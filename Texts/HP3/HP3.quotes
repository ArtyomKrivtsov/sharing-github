13615	13662	13609	13609	Fudge	173	“ you ’ve had us all in a right flap , I do n’t mind telling you . Running away from your aunt and uncle ’s house like that ! I ’d started to think ... but you ’re safe , and that ’s what matters . ”
13675	13761	13663	13663	Fudge	173	“ Eat , Harry , you look dead on your feet . Now then ... You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing - up of Miss Marjorie Dursley . Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago . Miss Dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified . She has no recollection of the incident at all . So that ’s that , and no harm done . ”
13810	13825	13827	13827	Fudge	173	“ Ah , you ’re worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle ? ”
13829	13868	13827	13827	Fudge	173	“ Well , I wo n’t deny that they are extremely angry , Harry , but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays . ”
13874	13887	13888	13888	he	117	“ I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays , ”
13891	13905	13888	13888	he	117	“ and I do n’t ever want to go back to Privet Drive . ”
13906	13924	13926	13926	Fudge	173	“ Now , now , I ’m sure you ’ll feel differently once you ’ve calmed down , ”
13932	13958	13926	13926	Fudge	173	“ They are your family , after all , and I ’m sure you are fond of each other — er — very deep down . ”
13985	13991	13993	13993	Fudge	173	“ So all that remains , ”
14002	14033	13993	13993	Fudge	173	“ is to decide where you ’re going to spend the last three weeks of your vacation . I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and — ”
14034	14038	14040	14040	Harry	117	“ Hang on , ”
14042	14048	14040	14040	Harry	117	“ What about my punishment ? ”
14052	14055	13993	13993	Fudge	173	“ Punishment ? ”
14056	14062	14063	14063	Harry	117	“ I broke the law ! ”
14066	14076	14063	14063	Harry	117	“ The Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry ! ”
14077	14098	14100	14100	Fudge	173	“ Oh , my dear boy , we ’re not going to punish you for a little thing like that ! ”
14107	14127	14100	14100	Fudge	173	“ It was an accident ! We do n’t send people to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts ! ”
14146	14170	14171	14171	he	117	“ Last year , I got an official warning just because a house - elf smashed a pudding in my uncle ’s house ! ”
14177	14197	14171	14171	he	117	“ The Ministry of Magic said I ’d be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magic there ! ”
14212	14239	14206	14206	Fudge	173	“ Circumstances change , Harry ... We have to take into account ... in the present climate ... Surely you do n’t want to be expelled ? ”
14240	14247	14249	14249	Harry	117	“ Of course I do n’t , ”
14251	14262	14264	14264	Fudge	173	“ Well then , what ’s all the fuss about ? ”
14266	14289	14264	14264	Fudge	173	“ Now , have a crumpet , Harry , while I go and see if Tom ’s got a room for you . ”
14372	14380	14382	14382	Fudge	173	“ Room eleven ’s free , Harry , ”
14384	14452	14382	14382	Fudge	173	“ I think you ’ll be very comfortable . Just one thing , and I ’m sure you ’ll understand ... I do n’t want you wandering off into Muggle London , all right ? Keep to Diagon Alley . And you ’re to be back here before dark each night . Sure you ’ll understand . Tom will be keeping an eye on you for me . ”
14453	14456	14458	14458	Harry	117	“ Okay , ”
14461	14466	14458	14458	Harry	117	“ but why — ? ”
14467	14479	14481	14481	Fudge	173	“ Do n’t want to lose you again , do we ? ”
14487	14502	14481	14481	Fudge	173	“ No , no ... best we know where you are ... I mean ... ”
14515	14530	14505	14505	his	173	“ Well , I ’ll be off , plenty to do , you know ... ”
14531	14541	14542	14542	Harry	117	“ Have you had any luck with Black yet ? ”
14557	14603	14505	14505	his	173	“ What ’s that ? Oh , you ’ve heard — well , no , not yet , but it ’s only a matter of time . The Azkaban guards have never yet failed ... and they are angrier than I ’ve ever seen them . ”
14608	14618	14604	14604	Fudge	173	“ So , I ’ll say good - bye . ”
14635	14646	14619	14619	He	173	“ Er — Minister ? Can I ask you something ? ”
14647	14650	14652	14652	Fudge	173	“ Certainly , ”
14657	14688	14619	14619	He	173	“ Well , third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade , but my aunt and uncle did n’t sign the permission form . D’you think you could — ? ”
14694	14697	14698	14698	he	173	“ Ah , ”
14701	14723	14698	14698	he	173	“ No , no , I ’m very sorry , Harry , but as I ’m not your parent or guardian — ”
14724	14733	14735	14735	Harry	117	“ But you ’re the Minister of Magic , ”
14738	14745	14735	14735	Harry	117	“ If you gave me permission — ”
14746	14760	14762	14762	Fudge	173	“ No , I ’m sorry , Harry , but rules are rules , ”
14765	14805	14762	14762	Fudge	173	“ Perhaps you ’ll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year . In fact , I think it ’s best if you do n’t ... yes ... well , I ’ll be off . Enjoy your stay , Harry . ”
14832	14842	14843	14843	he	178	“ If you ’ll follow me , Mr. Potter , ”
14846	14855	14843	14843	he	178	“ I ’ve already taken your things up ... ”
14911	14914	14915	14915	Harry	117	“ Hedwig ! ”
14932	14941	14943	14943	Tom	178	“ Very smart owl you ’ve got there , ”
14945	14970	14943	14943	Tom	178	“ Arrived about five minutes after you did . If there ’s anything you need , Mr. Potter , do n’t hesitate to ask . ”

17412	17495	17407	17407	Ron	147	“ Famous Harry Potter and all that . I ’d hate to see what the Ministry’d do to me if I blew up an aunt . Mind you , they ’d have to dig me up first , because Mum would ’ve killed me . Anyway , you can ask Dad yourself this evening . We ’re staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too ! So you can come to King ’s Cross with us tomorrow ! Hermione ’s there as well ! ”
17501	17516	17496	17496	Hermione	313	“ Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things . ”
17517	17520	17522	17522	Harry	117	“ Excellent ! ”
17525	17538	17522	17522	Harry	117	“ So , have you got all your new books and stuff ? ”
17539	17544	17546	17546	Ron	147	“ Look at this , ”
17561	17587	17588	17588	He	147	“ Brand - new wand . Fourteen inches , willow , containing one unicorn tail - hair . And we ’ve got all our books — ”
17598	17618	17588	17588	He	147	“ What about those Monster Books , eh ? The assistant nearly cried when we said we wanted two . ”
17619	17627	17628	17628	Harry	117	“ What ’s all that , Hermione ? ”
17646	17662	17664	17664	Hermione	313	“ Well , I ’m taking more new subjects than you , are n’t I ? ”
17666	17689	17664	17664	Hermione	313	“ Those are my books for Arithmancy , Care of Magical Creatures , Divination , Study of Ancient Runes , Muggle Studies — ”
17690	17699	17701	17701	Ron	147	“ What are you doing Muggle Studies for ? ”
17709	17730	17704	17704	his	147	“ You ’re Muggle - born ! Your mum and dad are Muggles ! You already know all about Muggles ! ”
17731	17747	17749	17749	Hermione	313	“ But it ’ll be fascinating to study them from the Wizarding point of view , ”
17752	17767	17769	17769	Harry	117	“ Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year , Hermione ? ”
17779	17787	17788	17788	she	313	“ I ’ve still got ten Galleons , ”
17795	17819	17788	17788	she	313	“ It ’s my birthday in September , and Mum and Dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday present . ”
17820	17827	17829	17829	Ron	147	“ How about a nice book ? ”
17832	17841	17843	17843	Hermione	313	“ No , I do n’t think so , ”
17846	17866	17843	17843	Hermione	313	“ I really want an owl . I mean , Harry ’s got Hedwig and you ’ve got Errol — ”
17867	17872	17874	17874	Ron	147	“ I have n’t , ”
17876	17890	17891	17891	He	147	“ Errol ’s a family owl . All I ’ve got is Scabbers . ”
17901	17911	17912	17912	he	147	“ And I want to get him checked over , ”
17925	17935	17912	17912	he	147	“ I do n’t think Egypt agreed with him . ”
17953	17964	17966	17966	Harry	117	“ There ’s a magical creature shop just over there , ”
17977	17996	17966	17966	Harry	117	“ You could see if they ’ve got anything for Scabbers , and Hermione can get her owl . ”
18217	18223	18224	18224	he	147	“ It ’s my rat , ”
18229	18247	18224	18224	he	147	“ He ’s been a bit off - color ever since I brought him back from Egypt . ”
18248	18255	18257	18258	the witch	742	“ Bang him on the counter , ”
18350	18353	18355	18356	the witch	742	“ Hm , ”
18362	18369	18355	18356	the witch	742	“ How old is this rat ? ”
18370	18373	18375	18375	Ron	147	“ Dunno , ”
18377	18389	18375	18375	Ron	147	“ Quite old . He used to belong to my brother . ”
18390	18397	18399	18400	the witch	742	“ What powers does he have ? ”
18406	18409	18399	18400	the witch	742	“ Er — ”
18451	18462	18463	18463	she	742	“ He ’s been through the mill , this one , ”
18466	18478	18480	18480	Ron	147	“ He was like that when Percy gave him to me , ”
18483	18505	18507	18508	the witch	742	“ An ordinary common or garden rat like this ca n’t be expected to live longer than three years or so , ”
18510	18533	18507	18508	the witch	742	“ Now , if you were looking for something a bit more hard - wearing , you might like one of these — ”
18549	18554	18546	18546	Ron	147	“ Show - offs . ”
18555	18573	18575	18576	the witch	742	“ Well , if you do n’t want a replacement , you can try this rat tonic , ”
18590	18593	18595	18595	Ron	147	“ Okay , ”
18597	18603	18595	18595	Ron	147	“ How much — OUCH ! ”
18637	18644	18646	18647	the witch	742	“ NO , CROOKSHANKS , NO ! ”
18677	18680	18681	18681	Ron	147	“ Scabbers ! ”
18735	18740	18718	18718	Ron	147	“ What was that ? ”
18741	18755	18757	18757	Harry	117	“ It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger , ”
18759	18764	18718	18718	Ron	147	“ Where ’s Hermione ? ”
18765	18771	18772	18772	They	754	“ Probably getting her owl — ”
18814	18820	18822	18822	Ron	147	“ You bought that monster ? ”
18829	18838	18840	18840	Hermione	313	“ He ’s gorgeous , is n’t he ? ”
18911	18920	18922	18922	Ron	147	“ Hermione , that thing nearly scalped me ! ”
18924	18936	18938	18938	Hermione	313	“ He did n’t mean to , did you , Crookshanks ? ”
18940	18946	18948	18948	Ron	147	“ And what about Scabbers ? ”
18959	18978	18948	18948	Ron	147	“ He needs rest and relaxation ! How ’s he going to get it with that thing around ? ”
18979	18990	18992	18992	Hermione	313	“ That reminds me , you forgot your rat tonic , ”
19004	19045	18992	18992	Hermione	313	“ And stop worrying , Crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours , what ’s the problem ? Poor Crookshanks , that witch said he ’d been in there for ages ; no one wanted him . ”
19046	19051	19053	19053	Ron	147	“ I wonder why , ”
19078	19081	19082	19082	he	136	“ Harry ! ”
19091	19096	19082	19082	he	136	“ How are you ? ”
19097	19102	19104	19104	Harry	117	“ Fine , thanks , ”
19143	19153	19154	19154	he	117	“ They still have n’t caught him , then ? ”
19157	19160	19162	19163	Mr. Weasley	136	“ No , ”
19169	19194	19162	19163	Mr. Weasley	136	“ They ’ve pulled us all off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him , but no luck so far . ”
19195	19206	19208	19208	Ron	147	“ Would we get a reward if we caught him ? ”
19210	19221	19208	19208	Ron	147	“ It ’d be good to get some more money — ”
19222	19230	19232	19233	Mr. Weasley	136	“ Do n’t be ridiculous , Ron , ”
19243	19276	19232	19233	Mr. Weasley	136	“ Black ’s not going to be caught by a thirteen - year - old wizard . It ’s the Azkaban guards who ’ll get him back , you mark my words . ”
19374	19376	19368	19368	She	140	“ Hello ”
19402	19411	19393	19393	he	143	“ Harry . How nice to see you . ”
19412	19417	19419	19419	Harry	117	“ Hello , Percy , ”
19426	19433	19435	19435	Percy	143	“ I hope you ’re well ? ”
19451	19457	19435	19435	Percy	143	“ Very well , thanks — ”
19458	19461	19463	19463	Fred	144	“ Harry ! ”
19475	19485	19463	19463	Fred	144	“ Simply splendid to see you , old boy — ”
19486	19489	19491	19491	George	145	“ Marvelous , ”
19504	19508	19491	19491	George	145	“ Absolutely spiffing . ”
19512	19519	19521	19522	Mrs. Weasley	139	“ That ’s enough , now , ”
19524	19527	19529	19529	Fred	144	“ Mum ! ”
19544	19552	19532	19532	he	144	“ How really corking to see you — ”
19553	19561	19563	19564	Mrs. Weasley	139	“ I said , that ’s enough , ”
19574	19590	19591	19591	She	139	“ Hello , Harry , dear . I suppose you ’ve heard our exciting news ? ”
19605	19613	19614	19614	she	139	“ Second Head Boy in the family ! ”
19621	19625	19626	19626	Fred	144	“ And last , ”
19632	19639	19641	19642	Mrs. Weasley	139	“ I do n’t doubt that , ”
19647	19658	19641	19642	Mrs. Weasley	139	“ I notice they have n’t made you two prefects . ”
19659	19669	19671	19671	George	145	“ What do we want to be prefects for ? ”
19680	19691	19671	19671	George	145	“ It ’d take all the fun out of life . ”
19695	19707	19709	19710	Mrs. Weasley	139	“ You want to set a better example for your sister ! ”
19712	19726	19728	19728	Percy	143	“ Ginny ’s got other brothers to set her an example , Mother , ”
19731	19741	19728	19728	Percy	143	“ I ’m going up to change for dinner ... ”
19750	19760	19761	19761	he	143	“ We tried to shut him in a pyramid , ”
19765	19771	19761	19761	he	143	“ But Mum spotted us . ”
19809	19822	19824	19824	Fred	144	“ How ’re we getting to King ’s Cross tomorrow , Dad ? ”
19834	19844	19846	19847	Mr. Weasley	136	“ The Ministry ’s providing a couple of cars , ”
19855	19858	19860	19860	Percy	143	“ Why ? ”
19863	19872	19874	19874	George	145	“ It ’s because of you , Perce , ”
19877	19893	19874	19874	George	145	“ And there ’ll be little flags on the hoods , with HB on them — ”
19894	19900	19902	19902	Fred	144	“ — for Humongous Bighead , ”
19915	19925	19926	19926	Percy	143	“ Why are the Ministry providing cars , Father ? ”
19935	19946	19948	19949	Mr. Weasley	136	“ Well , as we have n’t got one anymore , ”
19951	19966	19948	19949	Mr. Weasley	136	“ — and as I work there , they ’re doing me a favor — ”
19998	20004	20006	20007	Mrs. Weasley	139	“ Good thing , too , ”
20010	20044	20006	20007	Mrs. Weasley	139	“ Do you realize how much luggage you ’ve all got between you ? A nice sight you ’d be on the Muggle Underground ... You are all packed , are n’t you ? ”
20045	20059	20061	20061	Percy	143	“ Ron has n’t put all his new things in his trunk yet , ”
20070	20079	20061	20061	Percy	143	“ He ’s dumped them on my bed . ”
20080	20102	20103	20104	Mrs. Weasley	139	“ You ’d better go and pack properly , Ron , because we wo n’t have much time in the morning , ”
20192	20209	20188	20188	Percy	143	“ It was here , on the bedside table , I took it off for polishing — ”
20210	20220	20221	20221	Ron	147	“ I have n’t touched it , all right ? ”
20225	20230	20232	20232	Harry	117	“ What ’s up ? ”
20234	20242	20244	20244	Percy	143	“ My Head Boy badge is gone , ”
20250	20258	20260	20260	Ron	147	“ So ’s Scabbers ’s rat tonic , ”
20271	20283	20260	20260	Ron	147	“ I think I might ’ve left it in the bar — ”
20284	20297	20299	20299	Percy	143	“ You ’re not going anywhere till you ’ve found my badge ! ”
20301	20313	20314	20314	Harry	117	“ I ’ll get Scabbers ’s stuff , I ’m packed , ”
20400	20412	20413	20414	Mr. Weasley	136	“ . . . makes no sense not to tell him , ”
20419	20452	20413	20414	Mr. Weasley	136	“ Harry ’s got a right to know . I ’ve tried to tell Fudge , but he insists on treating Harry like a child . He ’s thirteen years old and — ”
20453	20462	20464	20465	Mrs. Weasley	139	“ Arthur , the truth would terrify him ! ”
20468	20496	20464	20465	Mrs. Weasley	139	“ Do you really want to send Harry back to school with that hanging over him ? For heaven ’s sake , he ’s happy not knowing ! ”
20497	20516	20518	20519	Mr. Weasley	136	“ I do n’t want to make him miserable , I want to put him on his guard ! ”
20521	20598	20518	20519	Mr. Weasley	136	“ You know what Harry and Ron are like , wandering off by themselves — they ’ve even ended up in the Forbidden Forest ! But Harry must n’t do that this year ! When I think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home ! If the Knight Bus had n’t picked him up , I ’m prepared to bet he would have been dead before the Ministry found him . ”
20599	20616	20464	20465	Mrs. Weasley	139	“ But he ’s not dead , he ’s fine , so what ’s the point — ”
20617	20706	20518	20519	Mr. Weasley	136	“ Molly , they say Sirius Black ’s mad , and maybe he is , but he was clever enough to escape from Azkaban , and that ’s supposed to be impossible . It ’s been a month , and no one ’s seen hide nor hair of him , and I do n’t care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet , we ’re no nearer catching Black than inventing self - spelling wands . The only thing we know for sure is what Black ’s after — ”
20707	20717	20464	20465	Mrs. Weasley	139	“ But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts . ”
20718	20740	20518	20519	Mr. Weasley	136	“ We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe . If Black can break out of Azkaban , he can break into Hogwarts . ”
20741	20754	20464	20465	Mrs. Weasley	139	“ But no one ’s really sure that Black ’s after Harry — ”
20776	20908	20770	20770	his	136	“ Molly , how many times do I have to tell you ? They did n’t report it in the press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet , but Fudge went out to Azkaban the night Black escaped . The guards told Fudge that Black ’s been talking in his sleep for a while now . Always the same words : ‘ He ’s at Hogwarts ... he ’s at Hogwarts . ’ Black is deranged , Molly , and he wants Harry dead . If you ask me , he thinks murdering Harry will bring You - Know - Who back to power . Black lost everything the night Harry stopped You - Know - Who , and he ’s had twelve years alone in Azkaban to brood on that ... ”
20927	20971	20770	20770	his	136	“ Well , Arthur , you must do what you think is right . But you ’re forgetting Albus Dumbledore . I do n’t think anything could hurt Harry at Hogwarts while Dumbledore ’s headmaster . I suppose he knows about all this ? ”
20972	21010	20770	20770	his	136	“ Of course he knows . We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds . He was n’t happy about it , but he agreed . ”
21011	21030	20770	20770	his	136	“ Not happy ? Why should n’t he be happy , if they ’re there to catch Black ? ”
21031	21041	21043	21044	Mr. Weasley	136	“ Dumbledore is n’t fond of the Azkaban guards , ”
21047	21082	21043	21044	Mr. Weasley	136	“ Nor am I , if it comes to that ... but when you ’re dealing with a wizard like Black , you sometimes have to join forces with those you ’d rather avoid . ”
21083	21089	20770	20770	his	136	“ If they save Harry — ”
21090	21102	21104	21105	Mr. Weasley	136	“ — then I will never say another word against them , ”
21108	21121	21104	21105	Mr. Weasley	136	“ It ’s late , Molly , we ’d better go up ... ”
21239	21245	21246	21246	Fred	144	“ We ’ve got it , ”
21251	21258	21246	21246	Fred	144	“ We ’ve been improving it . ”
21640	21649	21650	21650	Harry	117	“ I ’m not going to be murdered , ”
21655	21663	21665	21665	his	117	“ That ’s the spirit , dear , ”
21721	21733	21734	21734	he	147	“ The sooner we get on the train , the better , ”
21737	21767	21768	21768	Ron	147	“ At least I can get away from Percy at Hogwarts . Now he ’s accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of Penelope Clearwater . You know , ”
21771	21791	21768	21768	Ron	147	“ his girlfriend . She ’s hidden her face under the frame because her nose has gone all blotchy ... ”
21792	21801	21802	21802	Harry	117	“ I ’ve got something to tell you , ”
21876	21882	21883	21883	Ron	147	“ What were you saying ? ”
21891	21894	21895	21895	Harry	117	“ Later , ”
21972	21980	21981	21981	Hermione	313	“ It ’s all right , Crookshanks , ”
21987	21997	21981	21981	Hermione	313	“ I ’ll let you out on the train . ”
21998	22003	22005	22005	Ron	147	“ You wo n’t , ”
22007	22015	22005	22005	Ron	147	“ What about poor Scabbers , eh ? ”
22054	22059	22060	22060	he	136	“ They ’re here , ”
22063	22069	22060	22060	he	136	“ Harry , come on . ”
22110	22117	22119	22120	Mr. Weasley	136	“ In you get , Harry , ”
22272	22276	22277	22277	he	136	“ Right then , ”
22284	22308	22277	22277	he	136	“ Let ’s do this in pairs , as there are so many of us . I ’ll go through first with Harry . ”
22430	22437	22439	22439	Percy	143	“ Ah , there ’s Penelope ! ”
22591	22602	22603	22603	she	139	“ Do take care , wo n’t you , Harry ? ”
22624	22658	22616	22616	she	139	“ I ’ve made you all sandwiches ... Here you are , Ron ... no , they ’re not corned beef ... Fred ? Where ’s Fred ? Here you are , dear ... ”
22659	22662	22664	22665	Mr. Weasley	136	“ Harry , ”
22668	22675	22664	22665	Mr. Weasley	136	“ come over here a moment . ”
22699	22713	22715	22716	Mr. Weasley	136	“ There ’s something I ’ve got to tell you before you leave — ”
22723	22732	22734	22734	Harry	117	“ It ’s all right , Mr. Weasley , ”
22736	22741	22734	22734	Harry	117	“ I already know . ”
22742	22751	22687	22687	him	136	“ You know ? How could you know ? ”
22752	22773	22774	22774	Harry	117	“ I — er — I heard you and Mrs. Weasley talking last night . I could n’t help hearing , ”
22778	22781	22774	22774	Harry	117	“ Sorry — ”
22782	22798	22800	22801	Mr. Weasley	136	“ That ’s not the way I ’d have chosen for you to find out , ”
22806	22834	22687	22687	him	136	“ No — honestly , it ’s okay . This way , you have n’t broken your word to Fudge and I know what ’s going on . ”
22835	22844	22774	22774	Harry	117	“ Harry , you must be very scared — ”
22845	22850	22852	22852	Harry	117	“ I ’m not , ”
22855	22858	22859	22859	he	117	“ Really , ”
22869	22894	22863	22864	Mr. Weasley	136	“ I ’m not trying to be a hero , but seriously , Sirius Black ca n’t be worse than Voldemort , can he ? ”
22908	22941	22895	22896	Mr. Weasley	136	“ Harry , I knew you were , well , made of stronger stuff than Fudge seems to think , and I ’m obviously pleased that you ’re not scared , but — ”
22942	22945	22947	22948	Mrs. Weasley	139	“ Arthur ! ”
22960	22974	22947	22948	Mrs. Weasley	139	“ Arthur , what are you doing ? It ’s about to go ! ”
22975	22982	22984	22985	Mr. Weasley	136	“ He ’s coming , Molly ! ”
23004	23016	22988	22988	he	136	“ Listen , I want you to give me your word — ”
23017	23032	23034	23034	Harry	117	“ — that I ’ll be a good boy and stay in the castle ? ”
23037	23041	23043	23044	Mr. Weasley	136	“ Not entirely , ”
23057	23071	23043	23044	Mr. Weasley	136	“ Harry , swear to me you wo n’t go looking for Black . ”
23075	23078	23072	23072	Harry	117	“ What ? ”
23098	23104	23106	23107	Mr. Weasley	136	“ Promise me , Harry , ”
23114	23119	23106	23107	Mr. Weasley	136	“ that whatever happens — ”
23120	23135	23137	23137	Harry	117	“ Why would I go looking for someone I know wants to kill me ? ”
23140	23150	23106	23107	Mr. Weasley	136	“ Swear to me that whatever you might hear — ”
23151	23156	23158	23159	Mrs. Weasley	139	“ Arthur , quickly ! ”
23218	23228	23229	23229	Harry	117	“ I need to talk to you in private , ”
23242	23248	23250	23250	Ron	147	“ Go away , Ginny , ”
23252	23259	23261	23261	Ginny	140	“ Oh , that ’s nice , ”
23397	23404	23405	23405	Ron	147	“ Who d’you reckon he is ? ”
23426	23432	23434	23434	Hermione	313	“ Professor R. J. Lupin , ”
23438	23444	23434	23434	Hermione	313	“ How d’you know that ? ”
23445	23452	23453	23453	she	313	“ It ’s on his case , ”
23501	23507	23509	23509	Ron	147	“ Wonder what he teaches ? ”
23519	23524	23526	23526	Hermione	313	“ That ’s obvious , ”
23528	23545	23526	23526	Hermione	313	“ There ’s only one vacancy , is n’t there ? Defense Against the Dark Arts . ”
23581	23592	23594	23594	Ron	147	“ Well , I hope he ’s up to it , ”
23597	23615	23616	23616	He	147	“ He looks like one good hex would finish him off , does n’t he ? Anyway ... ”
23621	23630	23616	23616	He	147	“ What were you going to tell us ? ”
23676	23708	23669	23669	She	313	“ Sirius Black escaped to come after you ? Oh , Harry ... you ’ll have to be really , really careful . Do n’t go looking for trouble , Harry — ”
23709	23718	23720	23720	Harry	117	“ I do n’t go looking for trouble , ”
23724	23730	23720	23720	Harry	117	“ Trouble usually finds me . ”
23731	23752	23754	23754	Ron	147	“ How thick would Harry have to be , to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him ? ”
23784	23795	23797	23797	Ron	147	“ No one knows how he got out of Azkaban , ”
23800	23819	23797	23797	Ron	147	“ No one ’s ever done it before . And he was a top - security prisoner too . ”
23820	23831	23833	23833	Hermione	313	“ But they ’ll catch him , wo n’t they ? ”
23836	23852	23833	23833	Hermione	313	“ I mean , they ’ve got all the Muggles looking out for him too ... ”
23853	23859	23861	23861	Ron	147	“ What ’s that noise ? ”
23883	23893	23895	23895	Ron	147	“ It ’s coming from your trunk , Harry , ”
23938	23944	23946	23946	Hermione	313	“ Is that a Sneakoscope ? ”
23956	23969	23970	23970	Ron	147	“ Yeah ... mind you , it ’s a very cheap one , ”
23973	23993	23970	23970	Ron	147	“ It went haywire just as I was tying it to Errol ’s leg to send it to Harry . ”
23994	24004	24006	24006	Hermione	313	“ Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time ? ”
24009	24048	24006	24006	Hermione	313	“ No ! Well ... I was n’t supposed to be using Errol . You know he ’s not really up to long journeys ... but how else was I supposed to get Harry ’s present to him ? ”
24049	24057	24058	24058	Harry	117	“ Stick it back in the trunk , ”
24066	24074	24058	24058	Harry	117	“ or it ’ll wake him up . ”
24112	24121	24123	24123	Ron	147	“ We could get it checked in Hogsmeade , ”
24129	24152	24123	24123	Ron	147	“ They sell that sort of thing in Dervish and Banges , magical instruments and stuff . Fred and George told me . ”
24153	24161	24163	24163	Hermione	313	“ Do you know much about Hogsmeade ? ”
24166	24182	24163	24163	Hermione	313	“ I ’ve read it ’s the only entirely non - Muggle settlement in Britain — ”
24183	24191	24193	24193	Ron	147	“ Yeah , I think it is , ”
24201	24220	24193	24193	Ron	147	“ but that ’s not why I want to go . I just want to get inside Honeydukes ! ”
24221	24226	24228	24228	Hermione	313	“ What ’s that ? ”
24230	24236	24238	24238	Ron	147	“ It ’s this sweetshop , ”
24248	24302	24238	24238	Ron	147	“ where they ’ve got everything ... Pepper Imps — they make you smoke at the mouth — and great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted cream , and really excellent sugar quills , which you can suck in class and just look like you ’re thinking what to write next — ”
24303	24316	24317	24317	Hermione	313	“ But Hogsmeade ’s a very interesting place , is n’t it ? ”
24322	24357	24317	24317	Hermione	313	“ In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion , and the Shrieking Shack ’s supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain — ”
24358	24380	24382	24382	Ron	147	“ — and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while you ’re sucking them , ”
24402	24420	24396	24396	Hermione	313	“ Wo n’t it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade ? ”
24421	24427	24429	24429	Harry	117	“ ’ Spect it will , ”
24432	24445	24429	24429	Harry	117	“ You ’ll have to tell me when you ’ve found out . ”
24446	24451	24453	24453	Ron	147	“ What d’you mean ? ”
24455	24476	24396	24396	Hermione	313	“ I ca n’t go . The Dursleys did n’t sign my permission form , and Fudge would n’t either . ”
24481	24502	24477	24477	Ron	147	“ You ’re not allowed to come ? But — no way — McGonagall or someone will give you permission — ”
24521	24541	24396	24396	Hermione	313	“ — or we can ask Fred and George , they know every secret passage out of the castle — ”
24542	24545	24547	24547	Hermione	313	“ Ron ! ”
24550	24568	24547	24547	Hermione	313	“ I do n’t think Harry should be sneaking out of school with Black on the loose — ”
24569	24586	24588	24588	Harry	117	“ Yeah , I expect that ’s what McGonagall will say when I ask for permission , ”
24591	24599	24601	24601	Ron	147	“ But if we ’re with him , ”
24606	24612	24601	24601	Ron	147	“ Black would n’t dare — ”
24613	24623	24625	24625	Hermione	313	“ Oh , Ron , do n’t talk rubbish , ”
24627	24663	24625	24625	Hermione	313	“ Black ’s already murdered a whole bunch of people in the middle of a crowded street . Do you really think he ’s going to worry about attacking Harry just because we ’re there ? ”
24678	24686	24687	24687	Ron	147	“ Do n’t let that thing out ! ”
24726	24732	24720	24720	he	147	“ Get out of here ! ”
24733	24739	24741	24741	Hermione	313	“ Ron , do n’t ! ”
24855	24864	24865	24865	Ron	147	“ D’you think we should wake him up ? ”
24874	24885	24865	24865	Ron	147	“ He looks like he could do with some food . ”
24892	24897	24898	24898	she	313	“ Er — Professor ? ”
24901	24907	24898	24898	she	313	“ Excuse me — Professor ? ”
24913	24920	24925	24925	she	742	“ Do n’t worry , dear , ”
24935	24953	24925	24925	she	742	“ If he ’s hungry when he wakes , I ’ll be up front with the driver . ”
24954	24961	24963	24963	Ron	147	“ I suppose he is asleep ? ”
24974	24986	24966	24967	the witch	742	“ I mean — he has n’t died , has he ? ”
24987	24996	24998	24998	Hermione	313	“ No , no , he ’s breathing , ”
25186	25194	25196	25196	Malfoy	200	“ Well , look who it is , ”
25209	25215	25198	25198	his	200	“ Potty and the Weasel . ”
25222	25239	25241	25241	Malfoy	200	“ I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer , Weasley , ”
25243	25251	25241	25241	Malfoy	200	“ Did your mother die of shock ? ”
25272	25277	25279	25279	Malfoy	200	“ Who ’s that ? ”
25291	25295	25297	25297	Harry	117	“ New teacher , ”
25316	25324	25297	25297	Harry	117	“ What were you saying , Malfoy ? ”
25347	25351	25352	25352	he	200	“ C’m on , ”
25376	25390	25391	25391	he	200	“ I ’m not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year , ”
25395	25421	25391	25391	he	200	“ I mean it . If he makes one more crack about my family , I ’m going to get hold of his head and — ”
25430	25433	25435	25435	Hermione	313	“ Ron , ”
25442	25446	25435	25435	Hermione	313	“ be careful ... ”
25513	25520	25522	25522	Ron	147	“ We must be nearly there , ”
25552	25555	25557	25557	Ron	147	“ Great , ”
25573	25586	25557	25557	Ron	147	“ I ’m starving . I want to get to the feast ... ”
25587	25595	25600	25600	her	313	“ We ca n’t be there yet , ”
25603	25610	25557	25557	Ron	147	“ So why ’re we stopping ? ”
25714	25720	25722	25722	Ron	147	“ What ’s going on ? ”
25729	25732	25734	25734	Hermione	313	“ Ouch ! ”
25736	25744	25734	25734	Hermione	313	“ Ron , that was my foot ! ”
25754	25762	25745	25745	Harry	117	“ D’you think we ’ve broken down ? ”
25763	25766	25781	25781	Ron	147	“ Dunno ... ”
25794	25802	25803	25803	Ron	147	“ There ’s something moving out there , ”
25806	25814	25803	25803	Ron	147	“ I think people are coming aboard ... ”
25829	25844	25821	25821	someone	572	“ Sorry — d’you know what ’s going on ? — Ouch — sorry — ”
25845	25850	25852	25852	Harry	117	“ Hullo , Neville , ”
25867	25878	25821	25821	someone	572	“ Harry ? Is that you ? What ’s happening ? ”
25879	25886	25821	25821	someone	572	“ No idea — sit down — ”
25906	25921	25923	25923	Hermione	313	“ I ’m going to go and ask the driver what ’s going on , ”
25951	25956	25929	25929	her	313	“ Who ’s that ? ”
25957	25962	25929	25929	her	313	“ Who ’s that ? ”
25963	25966	25929	25929	her	313	“ Ginny ? ”
25967	25970	25929	25929	her	313	“ Hermione ? ”
25971	25977	25929	25929	her	313	“ What are you doing ? ”
25978	25985	25929	25929	her	313	“ I was looking for Ron — ”
25986	25993	25929	25929	her	313	“ Come in and sit down — ”
25994	25998	26000	26000	Harry	117	“ Not here ! ”
26003	26008	26000	26000	Harry	117	“ I ’m here ! ”
26009	26012	26014	26014	Neville	168	“ Ouch ! ”
26016	26019	25929	25929	her	313	“ Quiet ! ”
26092	26098	26099	26099	he	195	“ Stay where you are , ”
26420	26430	26431	26431	Someone	572	“ Harry ! Harry ! Are you all right ? ”
26437	26442	26431	26431	Someone	572	“ W - what ? ”
26544	26549	26550	26550	Ron	147	“ Are you okay ? ”
26554	26557	26559	26559	Harry	117	“ Yeah , ”
26573	26587	26567	26569	The hooded creature	908	“ What happened ? Where ’s that — that thing ? Who screamed ? ”
26588	26593	26595	26595	Ron	147	“ No one screamed , ”
26620	26626	26608	26608	Ginny	140	“ But I heard screaming — ”
26647	26650	26651	26651	he	195	“ Here , ”
26663	26671	26651	26651	he	195	“ Eat it . It ’ll help . ”
26682	26688	26689	26689	he	117	“ What was that thing ? ”
26693	26697	26699	26699	Lupin	195	“ A dementor , ”
26710	26718	26699	26699	Lupin	195	“ One of the dementors of Azkaban . ”
26739	26742	26743	26743	he	195	“ Eat , ”
26746	26762	26743	26743	he	195	“ It ’ll help . I need to speak to the driver , excuse me ... ”
26773	26783	26785	26785	Hermione	313	“ Are you sure you ’re okay , Harry ? ”
26791	26801	26803	26803	Harry	117	“ I do n’t get it ... What happened ? ”
26812	26848	26763	26763	He	195	“ Well — that thing — the dementor — stood there and looked around ( I mean , I think it did , I could n’t see its face ) — and you — you — ”
26849	26860	26862	26862	Ron	147	“ I thought you were having a fit or something , ”
26869	26885	26862	26862	Ron	147	“ You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching — ”
26886	26906	26908	26908	Hermione	313	“ And Professor Lupin stepped over you , and walked toward the dementor , and pulled out his wand , ”
26910	26964	26908	26908	Hermione	313	“ and he said , ‘ None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks . Go . ’ But the dementor did n’t move , so Lupin muttered something , and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it , and it turned around and sort of glided away ... ”
26965	26970	26972	26972	Neville	168	“ It was horrible , ”
26981	26994	26972	26972	Neville	168	“ Did you feel how cold it got when it came in ? ”
26995	27000	27002	27002	Ron	147	“ I felt weird , ”
27009	27018	27002	27002	Ron	147	“ Like I ’d never be cheerful again ... ”
27051	27064	27066	27066	Harry	117	“ But did n’t any of you — fall off your seats ? ”
27069	27072	27074	27074	Ron	147	“ No , ”
27082	27091	27074	27074	Ron	147	“ Ginny was shaking like mad , though ... ”
27161	27172	27144	27144	He	195	“ I have n’t poisoned that chocolate , you know ... ”
27195	27205	27207	27208	Professor Lupin	195	“ We ’ll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes , ”
27210	27218	27207	27208	Professor Lupin	195	“ Are you all right , Harry ? ”
27230	27233	27234	27234	he	117	“ Fine , ”
27306	27313	27366	27366	Hagrid	305	“ Firs ’ years this way ! ”
27357	27365	27366	27366	Hagrid	305	“ All righ ’ , you three ? ”
27643	27659	27629	27629	Harry	117	“ You fainted , Potter ? Is Longbottom telling the truth ? You actually fainted ? ”
27687	27693	27695	27695	Ron	147	“ Shove off , Malfoy , ”
27702	27711	27713	27713	Malfoy	200	“ Did you faint as well , Weasley ? ”
27716	27728	27713	27713	Malfoy	200	“ Did the scary old dementor frighten you too , Weasley ? ”
27729	27735	27780	27780	his	200	“ Is there a problem ? ”
27786	27795	27783	27783	he	200	“ Oh , no — er — Professor , ”
27909	27921	27950	27950	She	199	“ Potter ! Granger ! I want to see you both ! ”
28004	28023	28024	28024	she	199	“ There ’s no need to look so worried — I just want a word in my office , ”
28028	28035	28024	28024	she	199	“ Move along there , Weasley . ”
28106	28126	28096	28096	She	199	“ Professor Lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train , Potter . ”
28183	28188	28189	28189	he	117	“ I ’m fine , ”
28192	28199	28189	28189	he	117	“ I do n’t need anything — ”
28200	28210	28212	28213	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ Oh , it ’s you , is it ? ”
28226	28237	28212	28213	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ I suppose you ’ve been doing something dangerous again ? ”
28238	28246	28248	28249	Professor McGonagall	199	“ It was a dementor , Poppy , ”
28263	28270	28271	28271	she	205	“ Setting dementors around a school , ”
28284	28320	28271	28271	she	205	“ He wo n’t be the last one who collapses . Yes , he ’s all clammy . Terrible things , they are , and the effect they have on people who are already delicate — ”
28321	28327	28329	28329	Harry	117	“ I ’m not delicate ! ”
28332	28339	28341	28342	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ Of course you ’re not , ”
28350	28356	28358	28359	Professor McGonagall	199	“ What does he need ? ”
28362	28376	28358	28359	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Bed rest ? Should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing ? ”
28377	28382	28384	28384	Harry	117	“ I ’m fine ! ”
28409	28423	28425	28426	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ Well , he should have some chocolate , at the very least , ”
28439	28446	28448	28448	Harry	117	“ I ’ve already had some , ”
28450	28465	28448	28448	Harry	117	“ Professor Lupin gave me some . He gave it to all of us . ”
28466	28472	28474	28475	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ Did he , now ? ”
28478	28496	28474	28475	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ So we ’ve finally got a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies ? ”
28497	28508	28509	28510	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Are you sure you feel all right , Potter ? ”
28514	28517	28519	28519	Harry	117	“ Yes , ”
28521	28552	28474	28475	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ Very well . Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with Miss Granger about her course schedule , then we can go down to the feast together . ”
28687	28690	28692	28692	Hermione	313	“ Oh , ”
28695	28702	28692	28692	Hermione	313	“ we ’ve missed the Sorting ! ”
28829	28836	28837	28837	he	117	“ What was all that about ? ”
28960	28963	28965	28965	Dumbledore	210	“ Welcome ! ”
28974	29022	28965	28965	Dumbledore	210	“ Welcome to another year at Hogwarts ! I have a few things to say to you all , and as one of them is very serious , I think it best to get it out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast ... ”
29030	29068	29025	29025	his	210	“ As you will all be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express , our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of Azkaban , who are here on Ministry of Magic business . ”
29092	29103	29104	29104	Dumbledore	210	“ They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds , ”
29107	29145	29146	29146	he	210	“ and while they are with us , I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission . Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises — or even Invisibility Cloaks , ”
29159	29219	29220	29220	he	210	“ It is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses . I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you . I look to the prefects , and our new Head Boy and Girl , to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors , ”
29265	29271	29272	29272	he	210	“ On a happier note , ”
29275	29289	29272	29272	he	210	“ I am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year .
29290	29312	29341	29341	them	988	“ First , Professor Lupin , who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher . ”
29359	29364	29365	29365	Ron	147	“ Look at Snape ! ”
29455	29463	29464	29464	Dumbledore	210	“ As to our second new appointment , ”
29476	29550	29464	29464	Dumbledore	210	“ Well , I am sorry to tell you that Professor Kettleburn , our Care of Magical Creatures teacher , retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs . However , I am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid , who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties . ”
29617	29623	29624	29624	Ron	147	“ We should ’ve known ! ”
29631	29642	29624	29624	Ron	147	“ Who else would have assigned us a biting book ? ”
29676	29687	29689	29689	Dumbledore	210	“ Well , I think that ’s everything of importance , ”
29691	29697	29689	29689	Dumbledore	210	“ Let the feast begin ! ”
29871	29876	29877	29877	Hermione	313	“ Congratulations , Hagrid ! ”
29887	29894	29896	29896	Hagrid	305	“ All down ter you three , ”
29912	29945	29906	29906	he	305	“ Can ’ believe it ... great man , Dumbledore ... came straight down to me hut after Professor Kettleburn said he ’d had enough ... It ’s what I always wanted ... ”
30017	30020	30007	30013	a fat lady in a pink dress	1005	“ Password ? ”
30021	30028	30029	30029	Percy	143	“ Coming through , coming through ! ”
30036	30046	30029	30029	Percy	143	“ The new password ’s ‘ Fortuna Major ’ ! ”
30047	30051	30057	30057	He	168	“ Oh no , ”
30196	30200	30202	30202	Hermione	313	“ Ignore him , ”
30210	30221	30202	30202	Hermione	313	“ Just ignore him , it ’s not worth it ... ”
30222	30227	30229	30230	Pansy Parkinson	214	“ Hey , Potter ! ”
30242	30254	30229	30230	Pansy Parkinson	214	“ Potter ! The dementors are coming , Potter ! Woooooooo ! ”
30270	30278	30280	30280	George	145	“ New third - year course schedules , ”
30286	30295	30280	30280	George	145	“ What ’s up with you , Harry ? ”
30296	30299	30301	30301	Ron	147	“ Malfoy , ”
30333	30338	30339	30339	he	147	“ That little git , ”
30343	30375	30339	30339	he	147	“ He was n’t so cocky last night when the dementors were down at our end of the train . Came running into our compartment , did n’t he , Fred ? ”
30376	30381	30383	30383	Fred	144	“ Nearly wet himself , ”
30392	30400	30402	30402	George	145	“ I was n’t too happy myself , ”
30404	30413	30402	30402	George	145	“ They ’re horrible things , those dementors ... ”
30414	30425	30427	30427	Fred	144	“ Sort of freeze your insides , do n’t they ? ”
30429	30441	30443	30443	Harry	117	“ You did n’t pass out , though , did you ? ”
30449	30455	30457	30457	George	145	“ Forget it , Harry , ”
30460	30516	30457	30457	George	145	“ Dad had to go out to Azkaban one time , remember , Fred ? And he said it was the worst place he ’d ever been , he came back all weak and shaking ... They suck the happiness out of a place , dementors . Most of the prisoners go mad in there . ”
30517	30533	30535	30535	Fred	144	“ Anyway , we ’ll see how happy Malfoy looks after our first Quidditch match , ”
30537	30550	30535	30535	Fred	144	“ Gryffindor versus Slytherin , first game of the season , remember ? ”
30594	30607	30608	30608	she	313	“ Ooh , good , we ’re starting some new subjects today , ”
30612	30615	30617	30617	Ron	147	“ Hermione , ”
30627	30655	30621	30621	he	147	“ they ’ve messed up your schedule . Look — they ’ve got you down for about ten subjects a day . There is n’t enough time . ”
30656	30670	30703	30703	Ron	147	“ I ’ll manage . I ’ve fixed it all with Professor McGonagall . ”
30671	30675	30677	30677	Ron	147	“ But look , ”
30681	30701	30677	30677	Ron	147	“ see this morning ? Nine o’clock , Divination . And underneath , nine o’clock , Muggle Studies . And ”
30712	30753	30703	30703	Ron	147	“ look — underneath that , Arithmancy , nine o’clock . I mean , I know you ’re good , Hermione , but no one ’s that good . How ’re you supposed to be in three classes at once ? ”
30754	30760	30762	30762	Hermione	313	“ Do n’t be silly , ”
30765	30778	30762	30762	Hermione	313	“ Of course I wo n’t be in three classes at once . ”
30779	30784	30703	30703	Ron	147	“ Well , then — ”
30785	30790	30792	30792	Hermione	313	“ Pass the marmalade , ”
30794	30797	30703	30703	Ron	147	“ But — ”
30798	30816	30817	30817	Hermione	313	“ Oh , Ron , what ’s it to you if my schedule ’s a bit full ? ”
30820	30834	30817	30817	Hermione	313	“ I told you , I ’ve fixed it all with Professor McGonagall . ”
30863	30868	30869	30869	he	305	“ All righ ’ ? ”
30882	30917	30869	30869	he	305	“ Yer in my firs ’ ever lesson ! Right after lunch ! Bin up since five gettin ’ everythin ’ ready ... Hope it ’s okay ... Me , a teacher ... hones’ly ... ”
30936	30945	30947	30947	Ron	147	“ Wonder what he ’s been getting ready ? ”
30978	31005	30972	30972	Ron	147	“ We ’d better go , look , Divination ’s at the top of North Tower . It ’ll take us ten minutes to get there ... ”
31092	31106	31107	31107	Ron	147	“ There ’s — got — to — be — a — shortcut , ”
31143	31151	31153	31153	Hermione	313	“ I think it ’s this way , ”
31164	31169	31171	31171	Ron	147	“ Ca n’t be , ”
31173	31193	31171	31171	Ron	147	“ That ’s south , look , you can see a bit of the lake out of the window ... ”
31285	31288	31289	31289	he	1030	“ Aha ! ”
31300	31330	31295	31295	Ron	147	“ What villains are these , that trespass upon my private lands ! Come to scorn at my fall , perchance ? Draw , you knaves , you dogs ! ”
31384	31390	31392	31392	Harry	117	“ Are you all right ? ”
31400	31413	31392	31392	Harry	117	“ Get back , you scurvy braggart ! Back , you rogue ! ”
31477	31480	31482	31482	Harry	117	“ Listen , ”
31492	31511	31482	31482	Harry	117	“ we ’re looking for the North Tower . You do n’t know the way , do you ? ”
31512	31516	31517	31518	The knight	1033	“ A quest ! ”
31534	31558	31526	31526	He	1033	“ Come follow me , dear friends , and we shall find our goal , or else shall perish bravely in the charge ! ”
31582	31597	31559	31559	He	1033	“ On foot then , good sirs and gentle lady ! On ! On ! ”
31645	31658	31660	31661	the knight	1033	“ Be of stout heart , the worst is yet to come ! ”
31730	31733	31735	31736	the knight	1033	“ Farewell ! ”
31751	31778	31735	31736	the knight	1033	“ Farewell , my comrades - in - arms ! If ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew , call upon Sir Cadogan ! ”
31779	31787	31789	31789	Ron	147	“ Yeah , we ’ll call you , ”
31795	31803	31789	31789	Ron	147	“ if we ever need someone mental . ”
31857	31866	31867	31867	Harry	117	“ ‘ Sybill Trelawney , Divination teacher , ’ ”
31870	31880	31867	31867	Harry	117	“ How ’re we supposed to get up there ? ”
31909	31913	31915	31915	Ron	147	“ After you , ”
32109	32114	32115	32115	Ron	147	“ Where is she ? ”
32135	32138	32091	32091	Ron	147	“ Welcome , ”
32142	32155	32091	32091	Ron	147	“ How nice to see you in the physical world at last . ”
32229	32237	32238	32238	she	219	“ Sit , my children , sit , ”
32267	32272	32274	32275	Professor Trelawney	219	“ Welcome to Divination , ”
32291	32326	32274	32275	Professor Trelawney	219	“ My name is Professor Trelawney . You may not have seen me before . I find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner Eye . ”
32344	32400	32335	32336	Professor Trelawney	219	“ So you have chosen to study Divination , the most difficult of all magical arts . I must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight , there is very little I will be able to teach you . Books can take you only so far in this field ... ”
32433	32467	32468	32469	Professor Trelawney	219	“ Many witches and wizards , talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings , are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future , ”
32485	32498	32499	32499	she	219	“ It is a Gift granted to few . You , boy , ”
32512	32518	32499	32499	she	219	“ Is your grandmother well ? ”
32519	32524	32526	32526	Neville	168	“ I think so , ”
32529	32543	32545	32546	Professor Trelawney	219	“ I would n’t be so sure if I were you , dear , ”
32565	32605	32606	32606	she	219	“ We will be covering the basic methods of Divination this year . The first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves . Next term we shall progress to palmistry . By the way , my dear , ”
32613	32621	32606	32606	she	219	“ beware a red - haired man . ”
32644	32650	32651	32652	Professor Trelawney	219	“ In the second term , ”
32656	32711	32651	32652	Professor Trelawney	219	“ we shall progress to the crystal ball — if we have finished with fire omens , that is . Unfortunately , classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu . I myself will lose my voice . And around Easter , one of our number will leave us forever . ”
32728	32734	32735	32735	she	219	“ I wonder , dear , ”
32751	32762	32735	32735	she	219	“ if you could pass me the largest silver teapot ? ”
32792	32817	32735	32735	she	219	“ Thank you , my dear . Incidentally , that thing you are dreading — it will happen on Friday the sixteenth of October . ”
32821	32935	32937	32937	she	219	“ Now , I want you all to divide into pairs . Collect a teacup from the shelf , come to me , and I will fill it . Then sit down and drink , drink until only the dregs remain . Swill these around the cup three times with the left hand , then turn the cup upside down on its saucer , wait for the last of the tea to drain away , then give your cup to your partner to read . You will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of Unfogging the Future . I shall move among you , helping and instructing . Oh , and dear ”
32950	32983	32937	32937	she	219	“ after you ’ve broken your first cup , would you be so kind as to select one of the blue - patterned ones ? I ’m rather attached to the pink . ”
33019	33039	33005	33006	Professor Trelawney	219	“ One of the blue ones , then , dear , if you would n’t mind ... thank you ... ”
33084	33087	33089	33089	Ron	147	“ Right , ”
33102	33110	33089	33089	Ron	147	“ What can you see in mine ? ”
33111	33119	33121	33121	Harry	117	“ A load of soggy brown stuff , ”
33138	33156	33157	33158	Professor Trelawney	219	“ Broaden your minds , my dears , and allow your eyes to see past the mundane ! ”
33171	33183	33184	33184	He	117	“ Right , you ’ve got a crooked sort of cross ... ”
33190	33240	33184	33184	He	117	“ That means you ’re going to have ‘ trials and suffering ’ — sorry about that — but there ’s a thing that could be the sun ... hang on ... that means ‘ great happiness ’ ... so you ’re going to suffer but be very happy ... ”
33241	33254	33256	33256	Ron	147	“ You need your Inner Eye tested , if you ask me , ”
33274	33278	33279	33279	Ron	147	“ My turn ... ”
33292	33304	33305	33305	he	147	“ There ’s a blob a bit like a bowler hat , ”
33308	33321	33305	33305	he	147	“ Maybe you ’re going to work for the Ministry of Magic ... ”
33331	33346	33347	33347	He	117	“ But this way it looks more like an acorn ... What ’s that ? ”
33356	33380	33381	33381	he	117	“ ‘ A windfall , unexpected gold . ’ Excellent , you can lend me some ... and there ’s a thing here , ”
33387	33413	33381	33381	he	117	“ that looks like an animal ... yeah , if that was its head ... it looks like a hippo ... no , a sheep ... ”
33427	33436	33437	33437	she	219	“ Let me see that , my dear , ”
33471	33484	33437	33437	she	219	“ The falcon ... my dear , you have a deadly enemy . ”
33485	33491	33493	33493	Hermione	313	“ But everyone knows that , ”
33505	33511	33513	33513	Hermione	313	“ Well , they do , ”
33515	33527	33513	33513	Hermione	313	“ Everybody knows about Harry and You - Know - Who . ”
33578	33596	33564	33564	her	219	“ The club ... an attack . Dear , dear , this is not a happy cup ... ”
33597	33606	33608	33608	Ron	147	“ I thought that was a bowler hat , ”
33611	33623	33564	33564	her	219	“ The skull ... danger in your path , my dear ... ”
33682	33709	33678	33678	her	219	“ My dear boy ... my poor , dear boy ... no ... it is kinder not to say ... no ... do n’t ask me ... ”
33710	33717	33719	33720	Dean Thomas	178	“ What is it , Professor ? ”
33759	33763	33764	33765	Professor Trelawney	219	“ My dear , ”
33772	33778	33764	33765	Professor Trelawney	219	“ you have the Grim . ”
33779	33783	33785	33785	Harry	117	“ The what ? ”
33826	33836	33838	33839	Professor Trelawney	219	“ The Grim , my dear , the Grim ! ”
33850	33876	33838	33839	Professor Trelawney	219	“ The giant , spectral dog that haunts churchyards ! My dear boy , it is an omen — the worst omen — of death ! ”
33940	33951	33952	33952	she	313	“ I do n’t think it looks like a Grim , ”
33964	33995	33956	33957	Professor Trelawney	219	“ You ’ll forgive me for saying so , my dear , but I perceive very little aura around you . Very little receptivity to the resonances of the future . ”
34007	34018	34019	34019	he	184	“ It looks like a Grim if you do this , ”
34028	34039	34040	34040	he	184	“ but it looks more like a donkey from here , ”
34048	34064	34066	34066	Harry	117	“ When you ’ve all finished deciding whether I ’m going to die or not ! ”
34084	34096	34101	34101	her	219	“ I think we will leave the lesson here for today , ”
34105	34114	34101	34101	her	219	“ Yes ... please pack away your things ... ”
34144	34150	34152	34153	Professor Trelawney	219	“ Until we meet again , ”
34156	34166	34168	34168	she	219	“ fair fortune be yours . Oh , and dear ”
34173	34192	34168	34168	she	219	“ you ’ll be late next time , so mind you work extra - hard to catch up . ”
34341	34352	34354	34355	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Really , what has got into you all today ? ”
34373	34395	34360	34360	herself	199	“ Not that it matters , but that ’s the first time my transformation ’s not got applause from a class . ”
34414	34438	34411	34411	her	313	“ Please , Professor , we ’ve just had our first Divination class , and we were reading the tea leaves , and — ”
34439	34445	34447	34448	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Ah , of course , ”
34453	34478	34447	34448	Professor McGonagall	199	“ There is no need to say any more , Miss Granger . Tell me , which of you will be dying this year ? ”
34484	34487	34489	34489	Harry	117	“ Me , ”
34493	34497	34499	34500	Professor McGonagall	199	“ I see , ”
34509	34572	34505	34505	her	199	“ Then you should know , Potter , that Sybill Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school . None of them has died yet . Seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class . If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues — ”
34595	34632	34588	34588	She	199	“ Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic . I shall not conceal from you that I have very little patience with it . True Seers are very rare , and Professor Trelawney — ”
34651	34692	34633	34633	She	199	“ You look in excellent health to me , Potter , so you will excuse me if I do n’t let you off homework today . I assure you that if you die , you need not hand it in . ”
34745	34753	34742	34742	Lavender	222	“ But what about Neville ’s cup ? ”
34773	34779	34781	34781	Hermione	313	“ Ron , cheer up , ”
34791	34799	34781	34781	Hermione	313	“ You heard what Professor McGonagall said . ”
34816	34819	34820	34820	he	147	“ Harry , ”
34830	34844	34820	34820	he	147	“ you have n’t seen a great black dog anywhere , have you ? ”
34845	34851	34853	34853	Harry	117	“ Yeah , I have , ”
34855	34867	34853	34853	Harry	117	“ I saw one the night I left the Dursleys ’ . ”
34877	34882	34884	34884	Hermione	313	“ Probably a stray , ”
34898	34915	34916	34916	he	147	“ Hermione , if Harry ’s seen a Grim , that ’s — that ’s bad , ”
34919	34938	34916	34916	he	147	“ My — my uncle Bilius saw one and — and he died twenty - four hours later ! ”
34939	34942	34944	34944	Hermione	313	“ Coincidence , ”
34953	34964	34966	34966	Ron	147	“ You do n’t know what you ’re talking about ! ”
34973	34984	34966	34966	Ron	147	“ Grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards ! ”
34985	34992	34994	34994	Hermione	313	“ There you are , then , ”
35000	35054	34994	34994	Hermione	313	“ They see the Grim and die of fright . The Grim ’s not an omen , it ’s the cause of death ! And Harry ’s still with us because he ’s not stupid enough to see one and think , right , well , I ’d better kick the bucket then ! ”
35082	35090	35091	35091	she	313	“ I think Divination seems very woolly , ”
35099	35110	35091	35091	she	313	“ A lot of guesswork , if you ask me . ”
35111	35123	35125	35125	Ron	147	“ There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup ! ”
35128	35146	35148	35148	Hermione	313	“ You did n’t seem quite so confident when you were telling Harry it was a sheep , ”
35151	35176	35177	35177	He	147	“ Professor Trelawney said you did n’t have the right aura ! You just do n’t like being bad at something for a change ! ”
35203	35248	35249	35249	She	313	“ If being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves , I ’m not sure I ’ll be studying it much longer ! That lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy class ! ”
35263	35270	35271	35271	he	147	“ What ’s she talking about ? ”
35276	35287	35271	35271	he	147	“ She has n’t been to an Arithmancy class yet . ”
35460	35471	35472	35472	he	305	“ C’m on , now , get a move on ! ”
35479	35502	35472	35472	he	305	“ Got a real treat for yeh today ! Great lesson comin ’ up ! Everyone here ? Right , follow me ! ”
35567	35576	35577	35577	he	305	“ Everyone gather ’ round the fence here ! ”
35580	35605	35577	35577	he	305	“ That ’s it — make sure yeh can see — now , firs ’ thing yeh’ll want ter do is open yer books — ”
35606	35609	35617	35618	Draco Malfoy	200	“ How ? ”
35620	35623	35625	35625	Hagrid	305	“ Eh ? ”
35627	35635	35636	35636	Malfoy	200	“ How do we open our books ? ”
35695	35709	35711	35711	Hagrid	305	“ Hasn ’ — hasn ’ anyone bin able ter open their books ? ”
35723	35730	35732	35732	Hagrid	305	“ Yeh’ve got ter stroke ’em , ”
35746	35749	35732	35732	Hagrid	305	“ Look — ”
35796	35806	35807	35807	Malfoy	200	“ Oh , how silly we ’ve all been ! ”
35810	35823	35807	35807	Malfoy	200	“ We should have stroked them ! Why did n’t we guess ! ”
35824	35833	35834	35834	Hagrid	305	“ I — I thought they were funny , ”
35840	35846	35848	35848	Malfoy	200	“ Oh , tremendously funny ! ”
35850	35865	35848	35848	Malfoy	200	“ Really witty , giving us books that try and rip our hands off ! ”
35866	35872	35874	35874	Harry	117	“ Shut up , Malfoy , ”
35893	35898	35900	35900	Hagrid	305	“ Righ ’ then , ”
35910	35945	35900	35900	Hagrid	305	“ so — so yeh’ve got yer books an ’ — an ’ — now yeh need the Magical Creatures . Yeah . So I ’ll go an ’ get ’em . Hang on ... ”
35959	35970	35972	35972	Malfoy	200	“ God , this place is going to the dogs , ”
35975	35991	35972	35972	Malfoy	200	“ That oaf teaching classes , my father’ll have a fit when I tell him — ”
35992	35998	35999	35999	Harry	117	“ Shut up , Malfoy , ”
36002	36014	35972	35972	Malfoy	200	“ Careful , Potter , there ’s a dementor behind you — ”
36015	36018	36020	36021	Lavender Brown	222	“ Oooooooh ! ”
36154	36160	36161	36161	he	305	“ Gee up , there ! ”
36195	36198	36199	36199	Hagrid	305	“ Hippogriffs ! ”
36209	36216	36199	36199	Hagrid	305	“ Beau’iful , aren ’ they ? ”
36283	36286	36288	36288	Hagrid	305	“ So , ”
36298	36309	36291	36291	his	305	“ if yeh wan ’ ter come a bit nearer — ”
36331	36350	36352	36352	Hagrid	305	“ Now , firs ’ thing yeh got ta know abou ’ hippogriffs is , they ’re proud , ”
36354	36377	36352	36352	Hagrid	305	“ Easily offended , hippogriffs are . Do n’t never insult one , ’cause it might be the last thing yeh do . ”
36410	36424	36425	36425	Hagrid	305	“ Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs ’ move , ”
36428	36477	36425	36425	Hagrid	305	“ It ’s polite , see ? Yeh walk toward him , and yeh bow , an ’ yeh wait . If he bows back , yeh’re allowed ter touch him . If he doesn ’ bow , then get away from him sharpish , ’cause those talons hurt .
36478	36487	36538	36538	Hagrid	305	“ Right — who wants ter go first ? ”
36532	36536	36538	36538	Hagrid	305	“ No one ? ”
36545	36551	36553	36553	Harry	117	“ I ’ll do it , ”
36572	36584	36567	36567	Lavender	222	“ Oooh , no , Harry , remember your tea leaves ! ”
36596	36602	36604	36604	Hagrid	305	“ Good man , Harry ! ”
36606	36620	36604	36604	Hagrid	305	“ Right then — let ’s see how yeh get on with Buckbeak . ”
36667	36674	36676	36676	Hagrid	305	“ Easy , now , Harry , ”
36679	36702	36676	36676	Hagrid	305	“ Yeh’ve got eye contact , now try not ter blink ... Hippogriffs don ’ trust yeh if yeh blink too much ... ”
36737	36742	36744	36744	Hagrid	305	“ Tha ’s it , ”

36949	36956	36958	36958	Hagrid	305	“ Righ ’ then , Harry , ”
36960	36971	36958	36958	Hagrid	305	“ I reckon he might ’ let yeh ride him ! ”
37001	37014	37016	37016	Hagrid	305	“ Yeh climb up there , jus ’ behind the wing joint , ”
37018	37038	37016	37016	Hagrid	305	“ an ’ mind yeh don ’ pull any of his feathers out , he won ’ like that ... ”
37080	37086	37088	37088	Hagrid	305	“ Go on , then ! ”
37293	37299	37301	37301	Hagrid	305	“ Good work , Harry ! ”
37313	37322	37310	37310	Goyle	202	“ Okay , who else wants a go ? ”
37417	37423	37424	37424	Malfoy	200	“ This is very easy , ”
37435	37461	37462	37462	he	117	“ I knew it must have been , if Potter could do it ... I bet you ’re not dangerous at all , are you ? ”
37468	37477	37462	37462	he	117	“ Are you , you great ugly brute ? ”
37528	37533	37534	37534	Malfoy	200	“ I ’m dying ! ”
37541	37555	37534	37534	Malfoy	200	“ I ’m dying , look at me ! It ’s killed me ! ”
37556	37562	37564	37564	Hagrid	305	“ Yer not dyin ’ ! ”
37572	37584	37564	37564	Hagrid	305	“ Someone help me — got ta get him outta here — ”
37656	37664	37666	37667	Pansy Parkinson	214	“ They should fire him straight away ! ”
37674	37681	37683	37684	Dean Thomas	178	“ It was Malfoy ’s fault ! ”
37706	37717	37719	37719	Pansy	214	“ I ’m going to see if he ’s okay ! ”
37763	37772	37774	37774	Hermione	313	“ D’you think he ’ll be all right ? ”
37777	37793	37795	37795	Harry	117	“ ’ Course he will . Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second , ”
37809	37830	37832	37832	Ron	147	“ That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid ’s first class , though , was n’t it ? ”
37837	37847	37832	37832	Ron	147	“ Trust Malfoy to mess things up for him ... ”
37872	37882	37884	37884	Hermione	313	“ They would n’t fire him , would they ? ”
37897	37903	37905	37905	Ron	147	“ They ’d better not , ”
37952	37968	37970	37970	Ron	147	“ Well , you ca n’t say it was n’t an interesting first day back , ”
38012	38023	38024	38024	Harry	117	“ There ’s a light on in Hagrid ’s window , ”
38034	38053	38028	38028	Ron	147	“ If we hurried , we could go down and see him . It ’s still quite early ... ”
38054	38060	38061	38061	Hermione	313	“ I do n’t know , ”
38073	38083	38084	38084	he	117	“ I ’m allowed to walk across the grounds , ”
38088	38102	38084	38084	he	117	“ Sirius Black has n’t got past the dementors here , has he ? ”
38171	38174	38163	38163	they	1144	“ C’min . ”
38240	38248	38249	38249	he	305	“ ’ Spect it ’s a record , ”
38258	38275	38249	38249	he	305	“ Don ’ reckon they ’ve ever had a teacher who lasted on’y a day before . ”
38276	38285	38287	38287	Hermione	313	“ You have n’t been fired , Hagrid ! ”
38289	38293	38295	38295	Hagrid	305	“ Not yet , ”
38309	38325	38295	38295	Hagrid	305	“ But ’s only a matter o ’ time , i’n’t it , after Malfoy ... ”
38326	38331	38333	38333	Ron	147	“ How is he ? ”
38340	38349	38333	38333	Ron	147	“ It was n’t serious , was it ? ”
38350	38359	38361	38361	Hagrid	305	“ Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could , ”
38364	38382	38361	38361	Hagrid	305	“ but he ’s sayin ’ it ’s still agony ... covered in bandages ... moanin ’ ... ”
38383	38389	38391	38391	Harry	117	“ He ’s faking it , ”
38395	38421	38391	38391	Harry	117	“ Madam Pomfrey can mend anything . She regrew half my bones last year . Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it ’s worth . ”
38422	38433	38435	38435	Hagrid	305	“ School gov’nors have bin told , o ’ course , ”
38438	38474	38435	38435	Hagrid	305	“ They reckon I started too big . Shoulda left hippogriffs fer later ... done flobberworms or summat ... Jus ’ thought it ’d make a good firs ’ lesson ... ’S all my fault ... ”
38475	38485	38487	38487	Hermione	313	“ It ’s all Malfoy ’s fault , Hagrid ! ”
38490	38495	38497	38497	Harry	117	“ We ’re witnesses , ”
38499	38528	38497	38497	Harry	117	“ You said hippogriffs attack if you insult them . It ’s Malfoy ’s problem that he was n’t listening . We ’ll tell Dumbledore what really happened . ”
38529	38544	38546	38546	Ron	147	“ Yeah , do n’t worry , Hagrid , we ’ll back you up , ”
38579	38591	38593	38593	Hermione	313	“ I think you ’ve had enough to drink , Hagrid , ”
38610	38618	38620	38620	Hagrid	305	“ Ar , maybe she ’s right , ”
38657	38663	38665	38665	Harry	117	“ What ’s he done ? ”
38677	38686	38688	38688	Hermione	313	“ Stuck his head in the water barrel , ”
38715	38720	38721	38721	he	305	“ Tha ’s better , ”
38735	38753	38721	38721	he	305	“ Listen , it was good of yeh ter come an ’ see me , I really — ”

38944	38951	38953	38954	Pansy Parkinson	214	“ How is it , Draco ? ”
38956	38962	38953	38954	Pansy Parkinson	214	“ Does it hurt much ? ”
38963	38966	38968	38968	Malfoy	200	“ Yeah , ”
38993	39000	39002	39003	Professor Snape	260	“ Settle down , settle down , ”

39132	39143	39145	39145	Snape	260	“ Weasley , cut up Malfoy ’s roots for him , ”
39155	39164	39165	39165	he	147	“ There ’s nothing wrong with your arm , ”
39176	39189	39170	39170	Malfoy	200	“ Weasley , you heard Professor Snape ; cut up these roots . ”
39217	39220	39222	39222	Malfoy	200	“ Professor , ”
39224	39233	39222	39222	Malfoy	200	“ Weasley ’s mutilating my roots , sir . ”
39263	39271	39241	39241	his	260	“ Change roots with Malfoy , Weasley . ”
39272	39278	39241	39241	his	260	“ But , sir — ! ”
39298	39301	39303	39303	Snape	260	“ Now , ”
39330	39342	39344	39344	Malfoy	200	“ And , sir , I ’ll need this shrivelfig skinned , ”

39444	39450	39452	39452	Ron	147	“ None of your business , ”
39459	39472	39474	39474	Malfoy	200	“ I ’m afraid he wo n’t be a teacher much longer , ”
39482	39492	39474	39474	Malfoy	200	“ Father ’s not very happy about my injury — ”
39493	39508	39510	39510	Ron	147	“ Keep talking , Malfoy , and I ’ll give you a real injury , ”
39512	39546	39548	39548	he	147	“ — he ’s complained to the school governors . And to the Ministry of Magic . Father ’s got a lot of influence , you know . And a lasting injury like this ”
39556	39568	39548	39548	he	147	“ who knows if my arm’ll ever be the same again ? ”
39569	39580	39582	39582	Harry	117	“ So that ’s why you ’re putting it on , ”
39597	39605	39582	39582	Harry	117	“ To try to get Hagrid fired . ”
39606	39609	39611	39611	Malfoy	200	“ Well , ”
39620	39640	39611	39611	Malfoy	200	“ partly , Potter . But there are other benefits too . Weasley , slice my caterpillars for me . ”
39696	39701	39703	39703	Snape	260	“ Orange , Longbottom , ”
39724	39786	39703	39703	Snape	260	“ Orange . Tell me , boy , does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours ? Did n’t you hear me say , quite clearly , that only one rat spleen was needed ? Did n’t I state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice ? What do I have to do to make you understand , Longbottom ? ”
39805	39810	39812	39812	Hermione	313	“ Please , sir , ”
39814	39825	39812	39812	Hermione	313	“ please , I could help Neville put it right — ”
39826	39840	39842	39842	Snape	260	“ I do n’t remember asking you to show off , Miss Granger , ”
39853	39889	39846	39846	Hermione	313	“ Longbottom , at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens . Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly . ”
39900	39904	39905	39905	he	168	“ Help me ! ”
39910	39915	39917	39918	Seamus Finnigan	184	“ Hey , Harry , ”
39929	39947	39917	39918	Seamus Finnigan	184	“ have you heard ? Daily Prophet this morning — they reckon Sirius Black ’s been sighted . ”
39948	39951	39953	39953	Harry	117	“ Where ? ”
39973	39980	39982	39982	Seamus	184	“ Not too far from here , ”
39988	40042	39982	39982	Seamus	184	“ It was a Muggle who saw him . ’ Course , she did n’t really understand . The Muggles think he ’s just an ordinary criminal , do n’t they ? So she phoned the telephone hot line . By the time the Ministry of Magic got there , he was gone . ”
40043	40051	40052	40052	Ron	147	“ Not too far from here ... , ”
40069	40079	40065	40065	Malfoy	200	“ What , Malfoy ? Need something else skinned ? ”
40101	40114	40095	40095	He	147	“ Thinking of trying to catch Black single - handed , Potter ? ”
40115	40122	40124	40124	Harry	117	“ Yeah , that ’s right , ”
40138	40147	40148	40148	he	147	“ Of course , if it was me , ”
40152	40182	40148	40148	he	147	“ I ’d have done something before now . I would n’t be staying in school like a good boy , I ’d be out there looking for him . ”
40183	40192	40194	40194	Ron	147	“ What are you talking about , Malfoy ? ”
40197	40205	40207	40207	Malfoy	200	“ Do n’t you know , Potter ? ”
40214	40218	40209	40209	his	200	“ Know what ? ”
40228	40238	40239	40239	he	147	“ Maybe you ’d rather not risk your neck , ”
40242	40272	40239	40239	he	147	“ Want to leave it to the dementors , do you ? But if it was me , I ’d want revenge . I ’d hunt him down myself . ”
40273	40280	40282	40282	Harry	117	“ What are you talking about ? ”
40292	40328	40289	40289	Snape	260	“ You should have finished adding your ingredients by now ; this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk , so clear away while it simmers and then we ’ll test Longbottom ’s ... ”
40390	40396	40397	40397	Harry	117	“ What did Malfoy mean ? ”
40418	40437	40402	40402	he	147	“ Why would I want revenge on Black ? He has n’t done anything to me — yet . ”
40438	40445	40447	40447	Ron	147	“ He ’s making it up , ”
40450	40461	40447	40447	Ron	147	“ He ’s trying to make you do something stupid ... ”
40483	40489	40491	40491	Snape	260	“ Everyone gather ’ round , ”
40498	40547	40491	40491	Snape	260	“ and watch what happens to Longbottom ’s toad . If he has managed to produce a Shrinking Solution , it will shrink to a tadpole . If , as I do n’t doubt , he has done it wrong , his toad is likely to be poisoned . ”
40663	40669	40671	40671	Snape	260	“ Five points from Gryffindor , ”
40681	40696	40671	40671	Snape	260	“ I told you not to help him , Miss Granger . Class dismissed . ”
40728	40759	40722	40722	Ron	147	“ Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was all right ! Why did n’t you lie , Hermione ? You should ’ve said Neville did it all by himself ! ”
40769	40774	40765	40765	Ron	147	“ Where is she ? ”
40806	40813	40815	40815	Ron	147	“ She was right behind us , ”
40836	40841	40843	40843	Harry	117	“ There she is , ”
40875	40882	40884	40884	Ron	147	“ How did you do that ? ”
40886	40889	40891	40891	Hermione	313	“ What ? ”
40896	40920	40954	40954	Harry	117	“ One minute you were right behind us , the next moment , you were back at the bottom of the stairs again . ”
40921	40924	40925	40925	Hermione	313	“ What ? ”
40930	40944	40925	40925	Hermione	313	“ Oh — I had to go back for something . Oh no — ”
40976	40987	40988	40988	Ron	147	“ Why are you carrying all these around with you ? ”
40992	41002	41004	41004	Hermione	313	“ You know how many subjects I ’m taking , ”
41007	41018	41004	41004	Hermione	313	“ Could n’t hold these for me , could you ? ”
41019	41022	41023	41023	Ron	147	“ But — ”
41039	41061	41023	41023	Ron	147	“ You have n’t got any of these subjects today . It ’s only Defense Against the Dark Arts this afternoon . ”
41062	41066	41072	41072	she	313	“ Oh yes , ”
41085	41099	41100	41100	she	313	“ I hope there ’s something good for lunch , I ’m starving , ”
41112	41124	41125	41125	Ron	147	“ D’you get the feeling Hermione ’s not telling us something ? ”
41213	41217	41218	41218	he	195	“ Good afternoon , ”
41221	41249	41218	41218	he	195	“ Would you please put all your books back in your bags . Today ’s will be a practical lesson . You will need only your wands . ”
41302	41306	41308	41309	Professor Lupin	195	“ Right then , ”
41316	41323	41308	41309	Professor Lupin	195	“ If you ’d follow me . ”
41408	41414	41415	41415	Peeves	239	“ Loony , loopy Lupin , ”
41418	41429	41415	41415	Peeves	239	“ Loony , loopy Lupin , loony , loopy Lupin — ”
41471	41488	41489	41489	he	195	“ I ’d take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you , Peeves , ”
41493	41507	41489	41489	he	195	“ Mr. Filch wo n’t be able to get in to his brooms . ”
41567	41575	41576	41576	he	195	“ This is a useful little spell , ”
41584	41589	41576	41576	he	195	“ Please watch closely . ”
41600	41603	41590	41590	He	195	“ Waddiwasi ! ”
41644	41649	41651	41652	Dean Thomas	178	“ Cool , sir ! ”
41656	41662	41664	41665	Professor Lupin	195	“ Thank you , Dean , ”
41673	41678	41668	41668	his	195	“ Shall we proceed ? ”
41711	41716	41718	41719	Professor Lupin	195	“ Inside , please , ”
41800	41814	41797	41797	Snape	260	“ Leave it open , Lupin . I ’d rather not witness this . ”
41844	41884	41836	41836	he	260	“ Possibly no one ’s warned you , Lupin , but this class contains Neville Longbottom . I would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult . Not unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear . ”
41924	41941	41942	41942	he	195	“ I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation , ”
41945	41956	41942	41942	he	195	“ and I am sure he will perform it admirably . ”
41984	41989	41991	41992	Professor Lupin	195	“ Now , then , ”
42042	42048	42050	42051	Professor Lupin	195	“ Nothing to worry about , ”
42063	42071	42054	42056	a few people	1204	“ There ’s a boggart in there . ”
42105	42113	42115	42116	Professor Lupin	195	“ Boggarts like dark , enclosed spaces , ”
42118	42169	42115	42116	Professor Lupin	195	“ Wardrobes , the gap beneath beds , the cupboards under sinks — I once met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock . This one moved in yesterday afternoon , and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice .
42170	42187	42096	42097	Seamus Finnigan	184	“ So , the first question we must ask ourselves is , what is a boggart ? ”
42194	42202	42203	42203	she	313	“ It ’s a shape - shifter , ”
42206	42221	42203	42203	she	313	“ It can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most . ”
42222	42231	42233	42234	Professor Lupin	195	“ Could n’t have put it better myself , ”
42240	42303	42237	42237	Hermione	313	“ So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form . He does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door . Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone , but when I let him out , he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears .
42304	42308	42310	42311	Professor Lupin	195	“ This means , ”
42323	42344	42316	42316	Neville	168	“ that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin . Have you spotted it , Harry ? ”
42385	42406	42380	42380	Harry	117	“ Er — because there are so many of us , it wo n’t know what shape it should be ? ”
42407	42410	42412	42413	Professor Lupin	195	“ Precisely , ”
42427	42490	42418	42418	her	313	“ It ’s always best to have company when you ’re dealing with a boggart . He becomes confused . Which should he become , a headless corpse or a flesh - eating slug ? I once saw a boggart make that very mistake — tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug . Not remotely frightening .
42491	42537	42380	42380	Harry	117	“ The charm that repels a boggart is simple , yet it requires force of mind . You see , the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter . What you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing .
42538	42555	42418	42418	her	313	“ We will practice the charm without wands first . After me , please ... Riddikulus ! ”
42556	42559	42561	42562	the class	1047	“ Riddikulus ! ”
42565	42568	42570	42571	Professor Lupin	195	“ Good , ”
42573	42608	42570	42571	Professor Lupin	195	“ Very good . But that was the easy part , I ’m afraid . You see , the word alone is not enough . And this is where you come in , Neville . ”
42633	42638	42640	42641	Professor Lupin	195	“ Right , Neville , ”
42643	42663	42640	42641	Professor Lupin	195	“ First things first : What would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world ? ”
42675	42685	42687	42688	Professor Lupin	195	“ Did n’t catch that , Neville , sorry , ”
42715	42719	42691	42691	Neville	168	“ Professor Snape . ”
42737	42753	42729	42730	Professor Lupin	195	“ Professor Snape ... hmmm ... Neville , I believe you live with your grandmother ? ”
42754	42759	42761	42761	Neville	168	“ Er — yes , ”
42764	42779	42761	42761	Neville	168	“ But — I do n’t want the boggart to turn into her either . ”
42780	42789	42791	42792	Professor Lupin	195	“ No , no , you misunderstand me , ”
42797	42814	42791	42792	Professor Lupin	195	“ I wonder , could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears ? ”
42822	42857	42815	42815	Neville	168	“ Well ... always the same hat . A tall one with a stuffed vulture on top . And a long dress ... green , normally ... and sometimes a fox - fur scarf . ”
42858	42863	42865	42866	Professor Lupin	195	“ And a handbag ? ”
42868	42874	42876	42876	Neville	168	“ A big red one , ”
42878	42882	42884	42885	Professor Lupin	195	“ Right then , ”
42887	42908	42884	42885	Professor Lupin	195	“ Can you picture those clothes very clearly , Neville ? Can you see them in your mind ’s eye ? ”
42909	42912	42914	42914	Neville	168	“ Yes , ”
42924	42949	42951	42951	Lupin	195	“ When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe , Neville , and sees you , it will assume the form of Professor Snape , ”
42953	43007	42951	42951	Lupin	195	“ And you will raise your wand — thus — and cry ‘ Riddikulus ’ — and concentrate hard on your grandmother ’s clothes . If all goes well , Professor Boggart Snape will be forced into that vulture - topped hat , and that green dress , with that big red handbag . ”
43022	43043	43045	43046	Professor Lupin	195	“ If Neville is successful , the boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn , ”
43048	43081	43045	43046	Professor Lupin	195	“ I would like all of you to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most , and imagine how you might force it to look comical ... ”
43201	43207	43195	43195	Ron	147	“ Take its legs off . ”
43225	43229	43231	43232	Professor Lupin	195	“ Everyone ready ? ”
43276	43286	43288	43289	Professor Lupin	195	“ Neville , we ’re going to back away , ”
43291	43323	43288	43289	Professor Lupin	195	“ Let you have a clear field , all right ? I ’ll call the next person forward ... Everyone back , now , so Neville can get a clear shot — ”
43363	43372	43374	43375	Professor Lupin	195	“ On the count of three , Neville , ”
43390	43399	43380	43380	his	195	“ One — two — three — now ! ”
43463	43470	43472	43472	Neville	168	“ R - R - Riddikulus ! ”
43535	43540	43531	43532	Professor Lupin	195	“ Parvati ! Forward ! ”
43599	43602	43604	43604	Parvati	220	“ Riddikulus ! ”
43629	43632	43634	43635	Professor Lupin	195	“ Seamus ! ”
43700	43703	43705	43705	Seamus	184	“ Riddikulus ! ”
43765	43770	43772	43772	Lupin	195	“ It ’s confused ! ”
43774	43782	43772	43772	Lupin	195	“ We ’re getting there ! Dean ! ”
43810	43813	43815	43815	Dean	178	“ Riddikulus ! ”
43831	43839	43891	43891	Ron	147	“ Excellent ! Ron , you next ! ”
43886	43889	43891	43891	Ron	147	“ Riddikulus ! ”
43935	43938	43940	43941	Professor Lupin	195	“ Here ! ”
43989	43992	43984	43984	Lupin	195	“ Riddikulus ! ”
43998	44008	44010	44010	Lupin	195	“ Forward , Neville , and finish him off ! ”
44036	44039	44040	44040	he	168	“ Riddikulus ! ”
44063	44066	44040	44040	he	168	“ Ha ! ”
44088	44091	44093	44094	Professor Lupin	195	“ Excellent ! ”
44102	44145	44093	44094	Professor Lupin	195	“ Excellent , Neville . Well done , everyone ... Let me see ... five points to Gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart — ten for Neville because he did it twice ... and five each to Hermione and Harry . ”
44146	44154	44156	44156	Harry	117	“ But I did n’t do anything , ”
44158	44175	44176	44176	Lupin	195	“ You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class , Harry , ”
44180	44216	44176	44176	Lupin	195	“ Very well , everyone , an excellent lesson . Homework , kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it for me ... to be handed in on Monday . That will be all . ”
44288	44297	44299	44299	Seamus	184	“ Did you see me take that banshee ? ”
44301	44306	44308	44308	Dean	178	“ And the hand ! ”
44315	44322	44270	44270	he	117	“ And Snape in that hat ! ”
44323	44328	44299	44299	Seamus	184	“ And my mummy ! ”
44329	44341	44343	44343	Lavender	222	“ I wonder why Professor Lupin ’s frightened of crystal balls ? ”
44346	44366	44368	44368	Ron	147	“ That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson we ’ve ever had , was n’t it ? ”
44384	44393	44395	44395	Hermione	313	“ He seems like a very good teacher , ”
44398	44412	44395	44395	Hermione	313	“ But I wish I could have had a turn with the boggart — ”
44413	44422	44424	44424	Ron	147	“ What would it have been for you ? ”
44428	44441	44424	44424	Ron	147	“ A piece of homework that only got nine out of ten ? ”
44478	44487	44488	44488	Malfoy	200	“ Look at the state of his robes , ”
44500	44510	44488	44488	Malfoy	200	“ He dresses like our old house - elf . ”
44897	44906	44908	44908	Ron	147	“ Why would anyone bother looking after them ? ”
45170	45187	45188	45188	he	247	“ This is our last chance — my last chance — to win the Quidditch Cup , ”
45201	45221	45188	45188	he	247	“ I ’ll be leaving at the end of this year . I ’ll never get another shot at it .
45222	45256	45257	45257	Wood	247	“ Gryffindor has n’t won for seven years now . Okay , so we ’ve had the worst luck in the world — injuries — then the tournament getting called off last year ... ”
45272	45293	45294	45294	he	247	“ But we also know we ’ve got the best — ruddy — team — in — the — school , ”
45314	45322	45294	45294	he	247	“ We ’ve got three superb Chasers . ”
45336	45344	45323	45323	Wood	247	“ We ’ve got two unbeatable Beaters . ”
45345	45356	45358	45358	Fred	144	“ Stop it , Oliver , you ’re embarrassing us , ”
45368	45385	45386	45386	Wood	247	“ And we ’ve got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match ! ”
45399	45403	45404	45404	he	247	“ And me , ”
45410	45421	45423	45423	George	145	“ We think you ’re very good too , Oliver , ”
45425	45430	45432	45432	Fred	144	“ Spanking good Keeper , ”
45434	45439	45440	45440	Wood	247	“ The point is , ”
45448	45507	45445	45445	his	247	“ the Quidditch Cup should have had our name on it these last two years . Ever since Harry joined the team , I ’ve thought the thing was in the bag . But we have n’t got it , and this year ’s the last chance we ’ll get to finally see our name on the thing ... ”
45520	45529	45531	45531	Fred	144	“ Oliver , this year ’s our year , ”
45533	45541	45543	45543	Angelina	249	“ We ’ll do it , Oliver ! ”
45545	45548	45550	45550	Harry	117	“ Definitely , ”
45636	45641	45642	45642	he	117	“ What ’s happened ? ”
45668	45673	45675	45675	Ron	147	“ First Hogsmeade weekend , ”
45691	45698	45675	45675	Ron	147	“ End of October . Halloween . ”
45699	45702	45704	45704	Fred	144	“ Excellent , ”
45715	45731	45704	45704	Fred	144	“ I need to visit Zonko ’s . I ’m nearly out of Stink Pellets . ”
45754	45769	45770	45770	she	313	“ Harry , I ’m sure you ’ll be able to go next time , ”
45773	45789	45770	45770	she	313	“ They ’re bound to catch Black soon . He ’s been sighted once already . ”
45790	45802	45804	45804	Ron	147	“ Black ’s not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade , ”
45806	45827	45804	45804	Ron	147	“ Ask McGonagall if you can go this time , Harry . The next one might not be for ages — ”
45828	45831	45833	45833	Hermione	313	“ Ron ! ”
45835	45844	45833	45833	Hermione	313	“ Harry ’s supposed to stay in school — ”
45845	45857	45859	45859	Ron	147	“ He ca n’t be the only third year left behind , ”
45861	45870	45859	45859	Ron	147	“ Ask McGonagall , go on , Harry — ”
45871	45879	45881	45881	Harry	117	“ Yeah , I think I will , ”
45917	45929	45931	45931	Ron	147	“ Does he have to eat that in front of us ? ”
45935	45947	45949	45949	Hermione	313	“ Clever Crookshanks , did you catch that all by yourself ? ”
45966	45977	45979	45979	Ron	147	“ Just keep him over there , that ’s all , ”
45989	45999	45979	45979	Ron	147	“ I ’ve got Scabbers asleep in my bag . ”
46042	46052	46054	46054	Ron	147	“ You can copy mine , if you like , ”
46110	46113	46114	46114	Ron	147	“ OY ! ”
46135	46143	46121	46121	Crookshanks	251	“ GET OFF , YOU STUPID ANIMAL ! ”
46163	46171	46173	46173	Hermione	313	“ Ron , do n’t hurt him ! ”
46203	46208	46209	46209	Ron	147	“ CATCH THAT CAT ! ”
46321	46326	46327	46327	he	147	“ Look at him ! ”
46340	46355	46327	46327	he	147	“ He ’s skin and bone ! You keep that cat away from him ! ”
46356	46365	46369	46369	her	313	“ Crookshanks does n’t understand it ’s wrong ! ”
46373	46381	46369	46369	her	313	“ All cats chase rats , Ron ! ”
46382	46391	46393	46393	Ron	147	“ There ’s something funny about that animal ! ”
46409	46421	46393	46393	Ron	147	“ It heard me say that Scabbers was in my bag ! ”
46422	46428	46430	46430	Hermione	313	“ Oh , what rubbish , ”
46433	46446	46430	46430	Hermione	313	“ Crookshanks could smell him , Ron , how else d’you think — ”
46447	46457	46459	46459	Ron	147	“ That cat ’s got it in for Scabbers ! ”
46473	46485	46459	46459	Ron	147	“ And Scabbers was here first , and he ’s ill ! ”
46542	46547	46548	46548	Hermione	313	“ How ’s Scabbers ? ”
46570	46583	46585	46585	Ron	147	“ He ’s hiding at the bottom of my bed , shaking , ”
46599	46606	46608	46609	Professor Sprout	252	“ Careful , Weasley , careful ! ”
46712	46720	46725	46725	she	313	“ What ’s the matter , Lavender ? ”
46737	46747	46748	46748	Parvati	220	“ She got a letter from home this morning , ”
46751	46767	46748	46748	Parvati	220	“ It ’s her rabbit , Binky . He ’s been killed by a fox . ”
46768	46771	46773	46773	Hermione	313	“ Oh , ”
46775	46782	46773	46773	Hermione	313	“ I ’m sorry , Lavender . ”
46783	46789	46791	46791	Lavender	222	“ I should have known ! ”
46794	46802	46791	46791	Lavender	222	“ You know what day it is ? ”
46803	46806	46773	46773	Hermione	313	“ Er — ”
46807	46840	46791	46791	Lavender	222	“ The sixteenth of October ! ‘ That thing you ’re dreading , it will happen on the sixteenth of October ! ’ Remember ? She was right , she was right ! ”
46863	46876	46860	46860	she	313	“ You — you were dreading Binky being killed by a fox ? ”
46877	46886	46888	46888	Lavender	222	“ Well , not necessarily by a fox , ”
46898	46911	46860	46860	she	313	“ but I was obviously dreading him dying , was n’t I ? ”
46912	46915	46917	46917	Hermione	313	“ Oh , ”
46925	46932	46919	46919	She	313	“ Was Binky an old rabbit ? ”
46933	46938	46940	46940	Lavender	222	“ N - no ! ”
46942	46951	46940	46940	Lavender	222	“ H - he was only a baby ! ”
46961	46972	46974	46974	Hermione	313	“ But then , why would you dread him dying ? ”
46981	46989	46991	46991	Hermione	313	“ Well , look at it logically , ”
47001	47021	47023	47023	Lavender	222	“ I mean , Binky did n’t even die today , did he ? Lavender just got the news today ”
47027	47046	47023	47023	Lavender	222	“ and she ca n’t have been dreading it , because it ’s come as a real shock — ”
47047	47055	47057	47057	Ron	147	“ Do n’t mind Hermione , Lavender , ”
47060	47073	47057	47057	Ron	147	“ she does n’t think other people ’s pets matter very much . ”
47164	47170	47171	47171	she	199	“ One moment , please ! ”
47180	47213	47171	47171	she	199	“ As you ’re all in my House , you should hand Hogsmeade permission forms to me before Halloween . No form , no visiting the village , so do n’t forget ! ”
47220	47233	47171	47171	she	199	“ Please , Professor , I — I think I ’ve lost — ”
47234	47245	47247	47248	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Your grandmother sent yours to me directly , Longbottom , ”
47250	47269	47247	47248	Professor McGonagall	199	“ She seemed to think it was safer . Well , that ’s all , you may leave . ”
47270	47275	47276	47276	Ron	147	“ Ask her now , ”
47281	47286	47287	47287	Hermione	313	“ Oh , but — ”
47290	47297	47299	47299	Ron	147	“ Go for it , Harry , ”
47322	47327	47354	47355	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Yes , Potter ? ”
47334	47350	47351	47351	he	117	“ Professor , my aunt and uncle — er — forgot to sign my form , ”
47369	47398	47354	47355	Professor McGonagall	199	“ So — er — d’you think it would be all right — I mean , will it be okay if I — if I go to Hogsmeade ? ”
47411	47419	47420	47420	she	199	“ I ’m afraid not , Potter , ”
47423	47443	47420	47420	she	199	“ You heard what I said . No form , no visiting the village . That ’s the rule . ”
47444	47474	47475	47475	Harry	117	“ But — Professor , my aunt and uncle — you know , they ’re Muggles , they do n’t really understand about — about Hogwarts forms and stuff , ”
47487	47495	47479	47479	Ron	147	“ If you said I could go — ”
47496	47504	47506	47507	Professor McGonagall	199	“ But I do n’t say so , ”
47520	47534	47535	47535	She	199	“ The form clearly states that the parent or guardian must give permission . ”
47554	47583	47547	47547	her	199	“ I ’m sorry , Potter , but that ’s my final word . You had better hurry , or you ’ll be late for your next lesson . ”
47607	47615	47604	47604	Hermione	313	“ all - for - the - best ”
47651	47658	47660	47660	Ron	147	“ There ’s always the feast , ”
47670	47682	47660	47660	Ron	147	“ You know , the Halloween feast , in the evening . ”
47683	47686	47688	47688	Harry	117	“ Yeah , ”
47691	47694	47688	47688	Harry	117	“ great . ”
47822	47848	47849	47849	he	143	“ They make a fuss about Hogsmeade , but I assure you , Harry , it ’s not all it ’s cracked up to be , ”
47853	47899	47849	47849	he	143	“ All right , the sweetshop ’s rather good , and Zonko ’s Joke Shop ’s frankly dangerous , and yes , the Shrieking Shack ’s always worth a visit , but really , Harry , apart from that , you ’re not missing anything . ”
47927	47939	47941	47941	Hermione	313	“ We ’ll bring you lots of sweets back from Honeydukes , ”
47949	47954	47956	47956	Ron	147	“ Yeah , loads , ”
47976	47983	47985	47985	Harry	117	“ Do n’t worry about me , ”
47996	48010	47985	47985	Harry	117	“ I ’ll see you at the feast . Have a good time . ”
48061	48067	48069	48069	Malfoy	200	“ Staying here , Potter ? ”
48081	48088	48069	48069	Malfoy	200	“ Scared of passing the dementors ? ”
48113	48116	48118	48120	the Fat Lady	1307	“ Password ? ”
48128	48132	48134	48134	Harry	117	“ Fortuna Major , ”
48181	48190	48191	48191	It	1310	“ Harry ! Harry ! Hi , Harry ! ”
48216	48230	48232	48232	Colin	259	“ Are n’t you going to Hogsmeade , Harry ? Why not ? Hey ”
48240	48255	48232	48232	Colin	259	“ you can come and sit with us , if you like , Harry ! ”
48256	48265	48267	48267	Harry	117	“ Er — no , thanks , Colin , ”
48290	48309	48267	48267	Harry	117	“ I — I ’ve got to go to the library , got to get some work done . ”
48332	48341	48342	48344	the Fat Lady	1307	“ What was the point waking me up ? ”
48402	48408	48409	48409	Filch	241	“ What are you doing ? ”
48413	48416	48418	48418	Harry	117	“ Nothing , ”
48421	48424	48426	48426	Filch	241	“ Nothing ! ”
48433	48468	48426	48426	Filch	241	“ A likely story ! Sneaking around on your own — why are n’t you in Hogsmeade buying Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms like the rest of your nasty little friends ? ”
48472	48485	48487	48487	Filch	241	“ Well , get back to your common room where you belong ! ”
48544	48547	48575	48575	Lupin	195	“ Harry ? ”
48567	48573	48575	48575	Lupin	195	“ What are you doing ? ”
48586	48593	48575	48575	Lupin	195	“ Where are Ron and Hermione ? ”
48594	48597	48599	48599	Harry	117	“ Hogsmeade , ”
48609	48612	48614	48614	Lupin	195	“ Ah , ”
48623	48644	48616	48616	He	195	“ Why do n’t you come in ? I ’ve just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson . ”
48645	48649	48651	48651	Harry	117	“ A what ? ”
48697	48701	48703	48703	Lupin	195	“ Water demon , ”
48710	48746	48703	48703	Lupin	195	“ We should n’t have much difficulty with him , not after the kappas . The trick is to break his grip . You notice the abnormally long fingers ? Strong , but very brittle . ”
48766	48771	48772	48772	Lupin	195	“ Cup of tea ? ”
48781	48790	48772	48772	Lupin	195	“ I was just thinking of making one . ”
48791	48795	48797	48797	Harry	117	“ All right , ”
48818	48822	48824	48824	Lupin	195	“ Sit down , ”
48834	48856	48824	48824	Lupin	195	“ I ’ve only got teabags , I ’m afraid — but I daresay you ’ve had enough of tea leaves ? ”
48868	48876	48877	48877	Harry	117	“ How did you know about that ? ”
48880	48886	48888	48888	Lupin	195	“ Professor McGonagall told me , ”
48898	48907	48888	48888	Lupin	195	“ You ’re not worried , are you ? ”
48908	48911	48913	48913	Harry	117	“ No , ”
48981	48988	48978	48978	Lupin	195	“ Anything worrying you , Harry ? ”
48989	48992	48993	48993	Harry	117	“ No , ”
49012	49015	49016	49016	he	117	“ Yes , ”
49029	49039	49016	49016	he	117	“ You know that day we fought the boggart ? ”
49040	49043	49045	49045	Lupin	195	“ Yes , ”
49048	49058	49060	49060	Harry	117	“ Why did n’t you let me fight it ? ”
49068	49079	49080	49080	he	195	“ I would have thought that was obvious , Harry , ”
49106	49109	49110	49110	he	195	“ Why ? ”
49114	49117	49119	49119	Lupin	195	“ Well , ”
49124	49143	49119	49119	Lupin	195	“ I assumed that if the boggart faced you , it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort . ”
49186	49193	49195	49195	Lupin	195	“ Clearly , I was wrong , ”
49202	49228	49195	49195	Lupin	195	“ But I did n’t think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialize in the staffroom . I imagined that people would panic . ”
49229	49233	49235	49235	Harry	117	“ But then , ”
49238	49246	49235	49235	Harry	117	“ I — I remembered those dementors . ”
49247	49251	49253	49253	Lupin	195	“ I see , ”
49256	49265	49253	49253	Lupin	195	“ Well , well ... I ’m impressed . ”
49279	49298	49266	49266	He	195	“ That suggests that what you fear most of all is — fear . Very wise , Harry . ”
49316	49334	49336	49336	Lupin	195	“ So you ’ve been thinking that I did n’t believe you capable of fighting the boggart ? ”
49339	49344	49346	49346	Harry	117	“ Well ... yeah , ”
49356	49365	49348	49348	He	117	“ Professor Lupin , you know the dementors — ”
49376	49380	49382	49382	Lupin	195	“ Come in , ”
49417	49422	49424	49424	Lupin	195	“ Ah , Severus , ”
49428	49444	49424	49424	Lupin	195	“ Thanks very much . Could you leave it here on the desk for me ? ”
49460	49469	49471	49471	Lupin	195	“ I was just showing Harry my grindylow , ”
49479	49482	49484	49484	Snape	260	“ Fascinating , ”
49491	49500	49484	49484	Snape	260	“ You should drink that directly , Lupin . ”
49501	49509	49511	49511	Lupin	195	“ Yes , yes , I will , ”
49513	49520	49521	49521	Snape	260	“ I made an entire cauldronful , ”
49524	49530	49521	49521	Snape	260	“ If you need more . ”
49531	49546	49484	49484	Snape	260	“ I should probably take some again tomorrow . Thanks very much , Severus . ”
49547	49552	49554	49554	Snape	260	“ Not at all , ”
49590	49602	49603	49603	he	195	“ Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me , ”
49606	49624	49625	49625	He	195	“ I have never been much of a potion - brewer and this one is particularly complex . ”
49634	49641	49642	49642	he	195	“ Pity sugar makes it useless , ”
49651	49655	49656	49656	Harry	117	“ Why — ? ”
49669	49680	49681	49681	he	195	“ I ’ve been feeling a bit off - color , ”
49684	49717	49681	49681	he	195	“ This potion is the only thing that helps . I am very lucky to be working alongside Professor Snape ; there are n’t many wizards who are up to making it . ”
49738	49749	49750	49750	he	195	“ Professor Snape ’s very interested in the Dark Arts , ”
49754	49757	49759	49759	Lupin	195	“ Really ? ”
49773	49778	49779	49779	Harry	117	“ Some people reckon — ”
49787	49805	49779	49779	Harry	117	“ some people reckon he ’d do anything to get the Defense Against the Dark Arts job . ”
49815	49818	49819	49819	he	195	“ Disgusting , ”
49822	49844	49819	49819	he	195	“ Well , Harry , I ’d better get back to work . I ’ll see you at the feast later . ”
49845	49848	49850	49850	Harry	117	“ Right , ”
49865	49870	49872	49872	Ron	147	“ There you go , ”
49874	49884	49872	49872	Ron	147	“ We got as much as we could carry . ”
49934	49937	49939	49939	Harry	117	“ Thanks , ”
49951	49962	49939	49939	Harry	117	“ What ’s Hogsmeade like ? Where did you go ? ”
50001	50034	49971	49971	Dervish	261	“ The post office , Harry ! About two hundred owls , all sitting on shelves , all color - coded depending on how fast you want your letter to get there ! ”
50035	50059	49971	49971	Dervish	261	“ Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge ; they were giving out free samples , there ’s a bit , look — ”
50060	50079	49971	49971	Dervish	261	“ We think we saw an ogre , honestly , they get all sorts at the Three Broomsticks — ”
50080	50095	49971	49971	Dervish	261	“ Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer , really warms you up — ”
50096	50102	50104	50104	Hermione	313	“ What did you do ? ”
50109	50117	50104	50104	Hermione	313	“ Did you get any work done ? ”
50118	50121	50123	50123	Harry	117	“ No , ”
50125	50143	50123	50123	Harry	117	“ Lupin made me a cup of tea in his office . And then Snape came in ... ”
50158	50163	50164	50164	he	147	“ Lupin drank it ? ”
50167	50172	50164	50164	he	147	“ Is he mad ? ”
50178	50196	50197	50197	They	1331	“ We ’d better go down , you know , the feast’ll be starting in five minutes ... ”
50212	50219	50221	50221	Hermione	313	“ But if he — you know ”
50230	50252	50223	50223	her	313	“ if he was trying to — to poison Lupin — he would n’t have done it in front of Harry . ”
50253	50258	50260	50260	Harry	117	“ Yeah , maybe , ”
50488	50497	50474	50474	Malfoy	200	“ The dementors send their love , Potter ! ”
50541	50549	50551	50551	Ron	147	“ Why is n’t anyone going in ? ”
50571	50578	50580	50580	Percy	143	“ Let me through , please , ”
50593	50617	50585	50585	he	143	“ What ’s the holdup here ? You ca n’t all have forgotten the password — excuse me , I ’m Head Boy — ”
50654	50662	50645	50645	Percy	143	“ Somebody get Professor Dumbledore . Quick . ”
50677	50683	50685	50685	Ginny	140	“ What ’s going on ? ”
50731	50736	50737	50737	Hermione	313	“ Oh , my — ”
50805	50812	50814	50814	Dumbledore	210	“ We need to find her , ”
50816	50842	50814	50814	Dumbledore	210	“ Professor McGonagall , please go to Mr. Filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the Fat Lady . ”
50843	50849	50855	50855	It	1349	“ You ’ll be lucky ! ”
50882	50890	50892	50892	Dumbledore	210	“ What do you mean , Peeves ? ”
50924	50968	50969	50969	he	239	“ Ashamed , Your Headship , sir . Does n’t want to be seen . She ’s a horrible mess . Saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor , sir , dodging between the trees . Crying something dreadful , ”
50973	50977	50978	50978	he	239	“ Poor thing , ”
50982	50990	50992	50992	Dumbledore	210	“ Did she say who did it ? ”
50995	51001	51003	51003	Peeves	239	“ Oh yes , Professorhead , ”
51018	51034	51035	51035	Peeves	239	“ He got very angry when she would n’t let him in , you see . ”
51048	51059	51044	51044	his	239	“ Nasty temper he ’s got , that Sirius Black . ”
51096	51111	51112	51113	Professor Dumbledore	210	“ The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough search of the castle , ”
51128	51182	51183	51183	he	210	“ I ’m afraid that , for your own safety , you will have to spend the night here . I want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and Girl in charge . Any disturbance should be reported to me immediately , ”
51196	51205	51186	51186	Percy	143	“ Send word with one of the ghosts . ”
51219	51229	51206	51207	Professor Dumbledore	210	“ Oh , yes , you ’ll be needing ... ”
51270	51274	51283	51283	him	210	“ Sleep well , ”
51307	51314	51316	51316	Percy	143	“ Everyone into their sleeping bags ! ”
51318	51334	51316	51316	Percy	143	“ Come on , now , no more talking ! Lights out in ten minutes ! ”
51335	51339	51340	51340	Ron	147	“ C’m on , ”
51359	51370	51371	51371	Hermione	313	“ Do you think Black ’s still in the castle ? ”
51375	51383	51385	51385	Ron	147	“ Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be , ”
51387	51399	51401	51401	Hermione	313	“ It ’s very lucky he picked tonight , you know , ”
51420	51431	51401	51401	Hermione	313	“ The one night we were n’t in the tower ... ”
51432	51447	51449	51449	Ron	147	“ I reckon he ’s lost track of time , being on the run , ”
51451	51468	51449	51449	Ron	147	“ Did n’t realize it was Halloween . Otherwise he ’d have come bursting in here . ”
51485	51492	51476	51476	people	2759	“ How did he get in ? ”
51493	51501	51503	51504	a Ravenclaw	266	“ Maybe he knows how to Apparate , ”
51510	51521	51503	51504	a Ravenclaw	266	“ Just appear out of thin air , you know . ”
51522	51528	51530	51533	a Hufflepuff fifth year	1366	“ Disguised himself , probably , ”
51535	51542	51544	51545	Dean Thomas	178	“ He could ’ve flown in , ”
51547	51566	51568	51568	Hermione	313	“ Honestly , am I the only person who ’s ever bothered to read Hogwarts : A History ? ”
51575	51578	51580	51580	Ron	147	“ Probably , ”
51582	51585	51580	51580	Ron	147	“ Why ? ”
51586	51600	51602	51602	Hermione	313	“ Because the castle ’s protected by more than walls , you know , ”
51604	51676	51602	51602	Hermione	313	“ There are all sorts of enchantments on it , to stop people entering by stealth . You ca n’t just Apparate in here . And I ’d like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors . They ’re guarding every single entrance to the grounds . They ’d have seen him fly in too . And Filch knows all the secret passages , they ’ll have them covered ... ”
51677	51685	51686	51686	Percy	143	“ The lights are going out now ! ”
51689	51702	51686	51686	Percy	143	“ I want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking ! ”
51862	51870	51872	51872	Percy	143	“ Any sign of him , Professor ? ”
51877	51884	52008	52008	Snape	260	“ No . All well here ? ”
51885	51892	51856	51856	Dumbledore	210	“ Everything under control , sir . ”
51893	51928	52008	52008	Snape	260	“ Good . There ’s no point moving them all now . I ’ve found a temporary guardian for the Gryffindor portrait hole . You ’ll be able to move them back in tomorrow . ”
51929	51937	51856	51856	Dumbledore	210	“ And the Fat Lady , sir ? ”
51938	51986	52008	52008	Snape	260	“ Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor . Apparently she refused to let Black in without the password , so he attacked . She ’s still very distressed , but once she ’s calmed down , I ’ll have Mr. Filch restore her . ”
52002	52005	52008	52008	Snape	260	“ Headmaster ? ”
52018	52045	52010	52010	Harry	117	“ The whole of the third floor has been searched . He ’s not there . And Filch has done the dungeons ; nothing there either . ”
52046	52061	51987	51987	Harry	117	“ What about the Astronomy Tower ? Professor Trelawney ’s room ? The Owlery ? ”
52062	52066	52010	52010	Harry	117	“ All searched ... ”
52067	52082	51987	51987	Harry	117	“ Very well , Severus . I did n’t really expect Black to linger . ”
52083	52097	52099	52099	Snape	260	“ Have you any theory as to how he got in , Professor ? ”
52116	52130	52101	52101	Harry	117	“ Many , Severus , each of them as unlikely as the next . ”
52173	52193	52195	52195	Snape	260	“ You remember the conversation we had , Headmaster , just before — ah — the start of term ? ”
52215	52221	52223	52223	Dumbledore	210	“ I do , Severus , ”
52235	52262	52232	52232	his	210	“ It seems — almost impossible — that Black could have entered the school without inside help . I did express my concerns when you appointed — ”
52263	52281	52283	52283	Dumbledore	210	“ I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped Black enter it , ”
52303	52312	52314	52314	Dumbledore	210	“ I must go down to the dementors , ”
52316	52329	52314	52314	Dumbledore	210	“ I said I would inform them when our search was complete . ”
52330	52340	52342	52342	Percy	143	“ Did n’t they want to help , sir ? ”
52344	52348	52350	52350	Dumbledore	210	“ Oh yes , ”
52353	52372	52350	52350	Dumbledore	210	“ But I ’m afraid no dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while I am headmaster . ”
52434	52441	52442	52442	Ron	147	“ What was all that about ? ”
52562	52569	52571	52572	Seamus Finnigan	184	“ He ’s a complete lunatic , ”
52577	52585	52571	52572	Seamus Finnigan	184	“ Ca n’t we get anyone else ? ”
52586	52596	52598	52598	Percy	143	“ None of the other pictures wanted the job , ”
52600	52621	52598	52598	Percy	143	“ Frightened of what happened to the Fat Lady . Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer . ”
52706	52720	52721	52721	she	199	“ There ’s no point hiding it from you any longer , Potter , ”
52729	52745	52721	52721	she	199	“ I know this will come as a shock to you , but Sirius Black — ”
52746	52754	52756	52756	Harry	117	“ I know he ’s after me , ”
52759	52778	52756	52756	Harry	117	“ I heard Ron ’s dad telling his mum . Mr. Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic . ”
52799	52851	52786	52786	She	199	“ I see ! Well , in that case , Potter , you ’ll understand why I do n’t think it ’s a good idea for you to be practicing Quidditch in the evenings . Out on the field with only your team members , it ’s very exposed , Potter — ”
52852	52862	52864	52864	Harry	117	“ We ’ve got our first match on Saturday ! ”
52868	52877	52864	52864	Harry	117	“ I ’ve got to train , Professor ! ”
52923	52926	52886	52886	she	199	“ Hmm ... ”
52948	52994	52927	52928	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Well ... goodness knows , I ’d like to see us win the Cup at last ... but all the same , Potter ... I ’d be happier if a teacher were present . I ’ll ask Madam Hooch to oversee your training sessions . ”
53045	53052	53053	53053	he	247	“ We ’re not playing Slytherin ! ”
53061	53076	53053	53053	he	247	“ Flint ’s just been to see me . We ’re playing Hufflepuff instead . ”
53077	53080	53082	53086	the rest of the team	1391	“ Why ? ”
53088	53102	53104	53104	Wood	247	“ Flint ’s excuse is that their Seeker ’s arm ’s still injured , ”
53111	53138	53104	53104	Wood	247	“ But it ’s obvious why they ’re doing it . Do n’t want to play in this weather . Think it ’ll damage their chances ... ”
53163	53173	53175	53175	Harry	117	“ There ’s nothing wrong with Malfoy ’s arm ! ”
53178	53184	53175	53175	Harry	117	“ He ’s faking it ! ”
53185	53197	53199	53199	Wood	247	“ I know that , but we ca n’t prove it , ”
53202	53242	53199	53199	Wood	247	“ And we ’ve been practicing all those moves assuming we ’re playing Slytherin , and instead it ’s Hufflepuff , and their style ’s quite different . They ’ve got a new Captain and Seeker , Cedric Diggory — ”
53252	53255	53257	53257	Wood	247	“ What ? ”
53265	53280	53282	53282	Angelina	249	“ He ’s that tall , good - looking one , is n’t he ? ”
53284	53289	53291	53291	Katie	155	“ Strong and silent , ”
53300	53316	53318	53318	Fred	144	“ He ’s only silent because he ’s too thick to string two words together , ”
53321	53355	53318	53318	Fred	144	“ I do n’t know why you ’re worried , Oliver , Hufflepuff is a pushover . Last time we played them , Harry caught the Snitch in about five minutes , remember ? ”
53356	53365	53366	53366	Wood	247	“ We were playing in completely different conditions ! ”
53374	53424	53369	53369	his	247	“ Diggory ’s put a very strong side together ! He ’s an excellent Seeker ! I was afraid you ’d take it like this ! We must n’t relax ! We must keep our focus ! Slytherin is trying to wrong - foot us ! We must win ! ”
53425	53431	53433	53433	Fred	144	“ Oliver , calm down ! ”
53439	53449	53433	53433	Fred	144	“ We ’re taking Hufflepuff very seriously . Seriously . ”
53502	53515	53516	53516	he	200	“ Ah , if only my arm was feeling a bit better ! ”
53595	53615	53590	53590	Wood	247	“ Diggory ’s got a very fast swerve , Harry , so you might want to try looping him — ”
53639	53650	53670	53670	Snape	260	“ Sorry I ’m late , Professor Lupin , I — ”
53672	53697	53670	53670	Snape	260	“ This lesson began ten minutes ago , Potter , so I think we ’ll make it ten points from Gryffindor . Sit down . ”
53704	53710	53711	53711	he	117	“ Where ’s Professor Lupin ? ”
53714	53726	53728	53728	Snape	260	“ He says he is feeling too ill to teach today , ”
53734	53744	53728	53728	Snape	260	“ I believe I told you to sit down ? ”
53752	53759	53760	53760	Snape	260	“ What ’s wrong with him ? ”
53766	53772	53773	53773	he	260	“ Nothing life - threatening , ”
53784	53808	53773	53773	he	260	“ Five more points from Gryffindor , and if I have to ask you to sit down again , it will be fifty . ”
53826	53851	53819	53819	Snape	260	“ As I was saying before Potter interrupted , Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far — ”
53852	53870	53872	53872	Hermione	313	“ Please , sir , we ’ve done boggarts , Red Caps , kappas , and grindylows , ”
53875	53884	53872	53872	Hermione	313	“ and we ’re just about to start — ”
53885	53889	53891	53891	Snape	260	“ Be quiet , ”
53894	53914	53891	53891	Snape	260	“ I did not ask for information . I was merely commenting on Professor Lupin ’s lack of organization . ”
53915	53931	53933	53934	Dean Thomas	178	“ He ’s the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we ’ve ever had , ”
53958	53991	53951	53951	Snape	260	“ You are easily satisfied . Lupin is hardly overtaxing you — I would expect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and grindylows . Today we shall discuss — ”
54015	54019	54021	54021	Snape	260	“ — werewolves , ”
54023	54028	54036	54036	herself	313	“ But , sir , ”
54038	54055	54036	54036	herself	313	“ we ’re not supposed to do werewolves yet , we ’re due to start hinkypunks — ”
54056	54060	54062	54062	Snape	260	“ Miss Granger , ”
54070	54098	54062	54062	Snape	260	“ I was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson , not you . And I am telling you all to turn to page 394 . ”
54104	54111	54099	54099	He	260	“ All of you ! Now ! ”
54128	54146	54148	54148	Snape	260	“ Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf ? ”
54176	54179	54180	54180	Snape	260	“ Anyone ? ”
54192	54210	54186	54186	His	260	“ Are you telling me that Professor Lupin has n’t even taught you the basic distinction between — ”
54211	54216	54218	54218	Parvati	220	“ We told you , ”
54221	54237	54218	54218	Parvati	220	“ we have n’t got as far as werewolves yet , we ’re still on — ”
54238	54241	54243	54243	Snape	260	“ Silence ! ”
54245	54291	54243	54243	Snape	260	“ Well , well , well , I never thought I ’d meet a third - year class who would n’t even recognize a werewolf when they saw one . I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very behind you all are ... ”
54292	54297	54299	54299	Hermione	313	“ Please , sir , ”
54309	54328	54299	54299	Hermione	313	“ the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways . The snout of the werewolf — ”
54329	54345	54347	54347	Snape	260	“ That is the second time you have spoken out of turn , Miss Granger , ”
54350	54366	54347	54347	Snape	260	“ Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know - it - all . ”
54449	54472	54427	54427	Ron	147	“ You asked us a question and she knows the answer ! Why ask if you do n’t want to be told ? ”
54496	54501	54502	54502	Snape	260	“ Detention , Weasley , ”
54514	54537	54502	54502	Snape	260	“ And if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again , you will be very sorry indeed . ”
54583	54618	54562	54562	Snape	260	“ Very poorly explained ... That is incorrect , the kappa is more commonly found in Mongolia ... Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten ? I would n’t have given it three ... ”
54631	54695	54626	54626	Snape	260	“ You will each write an essay , to be handed in to me , on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves . I want two rolls of parchment on the subject , and I want them by Monday morning . It is time somebody took this class in hand . Weasley , stay behind , we need to arrange your detention . ”
54728	54755	54756	54756	Harry	117	“ Snape ’s never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers , even if he did want the job , ”
54761	54781	54756	54756	Harry	117	“ Why ’s he got it in for Lupin ? D’you think this is all because of the boggart ? ”
54782	54788	54790	54790	Hermione	313	“ I do n’t know , ”
54793	54804	54790	54790	Hermione	313	“ But I really hope Professor Lupin gets better soon ... ”
54819	54824	54827	54827	he	147	“ D’you know what that ”
54835	54838	54827	54827	he	147	“ Ron ! ”
54841	54863	54864	54864	He	147	“ is making me do ? I ’ve got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing . Without magic ! ”
54873	54896	54864	54864	He	147	“ Why could n’t Black have hidden in Snape ’s office , eh ? He could have finished him off for us ! ”
54960	54968	54970	54970	Harry	117	“ What did you do that for ? ”
55149	55161	55162	55162	Harry	117	“ You know , I reckon Ron was right about you , ”
55167	55185	55186	55186	he	117	“ There are plenty of mice around this place — go and chase them . Go on , ”
55199	55204	55186	55186	he	117	“ Leave Scabbers alone . ”
55356	55365	55367	55368	Sir Cadogan	217	“ Stand and fight , you mangy cur ! ”
55370	55376	55377	55377	Harry	117	“ Oh , shut up , ”
55410	55420	55422	55422	Wood	247	“ It ’s going to be a tough one , ”
55430	55436	55438	55438	Alicia	248	“ Stop worrying , Oliver , ”
55441	55451	55438	55438	Alicia	248	“ we do n’t mind a bit of rain . ”
55707	55712	55713	55713	He	117	“ Mount your brooms . ”
56006	56014	56015	56015	Wood	247	“ I called for time - out ! ”
56021	56028	56015	56015	Wood	247	“ Come on , under here — ”
56055	56061	56042	56042	Harry	117	“ What ’s the score ? ”
56062	56069	56071	56071	Wood	247	“ We ’re fifty points up , ”
56073	56090	56071	56071	Wood	247	“ but unless we get the Snitch soon , we ’ll be playing into the night . ”
56091	56101	56102	56102	Harry	117	“ I ’ve got no chance with these on , ”
56136	56152	56121	56121	she	313	“ I ’ve had an idea , Harry ! Give me your glasses , quick ! ”
56176	56179	56171	56171	her	313	“ Impervius ! ”
56180	56183	56184	56184	she	313	“ There ! ”
56193	56199	56184	56184	she	313	“ They ’ll repel water ! ”
56210	56213	56214	56214	he	247	“ Brilliant ! ”
56226	56237	56214	56214	he	247	“ Okay , team , let ’s go for it ! ”
56435	56438	56440	56440	Wood	247	“ Harry ! ”
56449	56455	56440	56440	Wood	247	“ Harry , behind you ! ”
56507	56511	56512	56512	he	117	“ Come on ! ”
56524	56527	56512	56512	he	117	“ Faster ! ”
56684	56695	56681	56682	a woman	1463	“ Not Harry , not Harry , please not Harry ! ”
56696	56709	56681	56682	a woman	1463	“ Stand aside , you silly girl ... stand aside , now ... ”
56710	56724	56681	56682	a woman	1463	“ Not Harry , please no , take me , kill me instead — ”
56775	56787	56765	56765	He	117	“ Not Harry ! Please ... have mercy ... have mercy ... ”
56805	56813	56794	56795	the woman	1464	“ Lucky the ground was so soft . ”
56814	56823	56794	56795	the woman	1464	“ I thought he was dead for sure . ”
56824	56834	56794	56795	the woman	1464	“ But he did n’t even break his glasses . ”
56895	56909	56924	56924	Harry	117	“ That was the scariest thing I ’ve ever seen in my life . ”
56977	56980	56982	56982	Fred	144	“ Harry ! ”
56992	56998	56982	56982	Fred	144	“ How ’re you feeling ? ”
57024	57028	57029	57029	he	117	“ What happened ? ”
57040	57045	57047	57047	Fred	144	“ You fell off , ”
57049	57059	57047	57047	Fred	144	“ Must ’ve been — what — fifty feet ? ”
57060	57067	57069	57069	Alicia	248	“ We thought you ’d died , ”
57089	57094	57096	57096	Harry	117	“ But the match , ”
57098	57108	57096	57096	Harry	117	“ What happened ? Are we doing a replay ? ”
57124	57131	57096	57096	Harry	117	“ We did n’t — lose ? ”
57132	57138	57140	57140	George	145	“ Diggory got the Snitch , ”
57142	57190	57140	57140	George	145	“ Just after you fell . He did n’t realize what had happened . When he looked back and saw you on the ground , he tried to call it off . Wanted a rematch . But they won fair and square ... even Wood admits it . ”
57191	57196	57198	57198	Harry	117	“ Where is Wood ? ”
57207	57213	57215	57215	Fred	144	“ Still in the showers , ”
57217	57227	57215	57215	Fred	144	“ We think he ’s trying to drown himself . ”
57251	57265	57242	57242	Fred	144	“ C’m on , Harry , you ’ve never missed the Snitch before . ”
57266	57279	57281	57281	George	145	“ There had to be one time you did n’t get it , ”
57283	57290	57292	57292	Fred	144	“ It ’s not over yet , ”
57294	57317	57292	57292	Fred	144	“ We lost by a hundred points , right ? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin ... ”
57318	57330	57332	57332	George	145	“ Hufflepuff’ll have to lose by at least two hundred points , ”
57334	57341	57292	57292	Fred	144	“ But if they beat Ravenclaw ... ”
57342	57358	57292	57292	Fred	144	“ No way , Ravenclaw is too good . But if Slytherin loses against Hufflepuff ... ”
57359	57375	57292	57292	Fred	144	“ It all depends on the points — a margin of a hundred either way — ”
57422	57431	57432	57432	Fred	144	“ We ’ll come and see you later , ”
57436	57456	57432	57432	Fred	144	“ Do n’t beat yourself up , Harry , you ’re still the best Seeker we ’ve ever had . ”
57488	57494	57495	57495	Hermione	313	“ Dumbledore was really angry , ”
57502	57573	57495	57495	Hermione	313	“ I ’ve never seen him like that before . He ran onto the field as you fell , waved his wand , and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground . Then he whirled his wand at the dementors . Shot silver stuff at them . They left the stadium right away ... He was furious they ’d come onto the grounds . We heard him — ”
57574	57583	57585	57585	Ron	147	“ Then he magicked you onto a stretcher , ”
57587	57604	57585	57585	Ron	147	“ And walked up to school with you floating on it . Everyone thought you were ... ”
57659	57666	57645	57645	he	117	“ Did someone get my Nimbus ? ”
57676	57679	57667	57667	Ron	147	“ Er — ”
57680	57683	57685	57685	Harry	117	“ What ? ”
57694	57707	57709	57709	Hermione	313	“ Well ... when you fell off , it got blown away , ”
57712	57715	57667	57667	Ron	147	“ And ? ”
57716	57734	57667	57667	Ron	147	“ And it hit — it hit — oh , Harry — it hit the Whomping Willow . ”
57758	57761	57762	57762	he	117	“ And ? ”
57769	57778	57780	57780	Ron	147	“ Well , you know the Whomping Willow , ”
57782	57792	57780	57780	Ron	147	“ It — it does n’t like being hit . ”
57793	57805	57807	57807	Hermione	313	“ Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around , ”
58462	58479	58481	58481	Ron	147	“ If Snape ’s teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again , I ’m skiving off , ”
58492	58501	58481	58481	Ron	147	“ Check who ’s in there , Hermione . ”
58509	58514	58502	58502	Hermione	313	“ It ’s okay ! ”
58583	58602	58564	58564	they	1047	“ It ’s not fair , he was only filling in , why should he give us homework ? ”
58603	58612	58564	58564	they	1047	“ We do n’t know anything about werewolves — ”
58613	58620	58564	58564	they	1047	“ — two rolls of parchment ! ”
58621	58634	58635	58635	Lupin	195	“ Did you tell Professor Snape we have n’t covered them yet ? ”
58647	58658	58564	58564	they	1047	“ Yes , but he said we were really behind — ”
58659	58666	58564	58564	they	1047	“ — he would n’t listen — ”
58667	58674	58564	58564	they	1047	“ — two rolls of parchment ! ”
58687	58708	58564	58564	they	1047	“ Do n’t worry . I ’ll speak to Professor Snape . You do n’t have to do the essay . ”
58709	58713	58715	58715	Hermione	313	“ Oh no , ”
58721	58728	58715	58715	Hermione	313	“ I ’ve already finished it ! ”
58773	58779	58781	58782	Professor Lupin	195	“ Lures travelers into bogs , ”
58788	58808	58781	58782	Professor Lupin	195	“ You notice the lantern dangling from his hand ? Hops ahead — people follow the light — then — ”
58842	58849	58850	58850	Lupin	195	“ Wait a moment , Harry , ”
58853	58860	58850	58850	Lupin	195	“ I ’d like a word . ”
58877	58884	58886	58886	Lupin	195	“ I heard about the match , ”
58902	58919	58886	58886	Lupin	195	“ and I ’m sorry about your broomstick . Is there any chance of fixing it ? ”
58920	58923	58925	58925	Harry	117	“ No , ”
58927	58935	58925	58925	Harry	117	“ The tree smashed it to bits . ”
58939	59001	58936	58936	Lupin	195	“ They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at Hogwarts . People used to play a game , trying to get near enough to touch the trunk . In the end , a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye , and we were forbidden to go near it . No broomstick would have a chance . ”
59002	59011	59013	59013	Harry	117	“ Did you hear about the dementors too ? ”
59023	59072	59017	59017	Lupin	195	“ Yes , I did . I do n’t think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that angry . They have been growing restless for some time ... furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds ... I suppose they were the reason you fell ? ”
59073	59076	59078	59078	Harry	117	“ Yes , ”
59100	59116	59098	59098	himself	117	“ Why ? Why do they affect me like that ? Am I just — ? ”
59117	59126	59134	59134	he	195	“ It has nothing to do with weakness , ”
59141	59164	59134	59134	he	195	“ The dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others do n’t have . ”
59188	59329	59359	59359	Lupin	195	“ Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth . They infest the darkest , filthiest places , they glory in decay and despair , they drain peace , hope , and happiness out of the air around them . Even Muggles feel their presence , though they ca n’t see them . Get too near a dementor and every good feeling , every happy memory will be sucked out of you . If it can , the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself ... soulless and evil . You ’ll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life . And the worst that happened to you , Harry , is enough to make anyone fall off their broom . You have nothing to feel ashamed of . ”
59330	59337	59338	59338	Harry	117	“ When they get near me — ”
59349	59358	59338	59338	Harry	117	“ I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum . ”
59390	59401	59403	59403	Harry	117	“ Why did they have to come to the match ? ”
59406	59412	59414	59414	Lupin	195	“ They ’re getting hungry , ”
59424	59475	59414	59414	Lupin	195	“ Dumbledore wo n’t let them into the school , so their supply of human prey has dried up ... I do n’t think they could resist the large crowd around the Quidditch field . All that excitement ... emotions running high ... it was their idea of a feast . ”
59476	59482	59483	59483	Harry	117	“ Azkaban must be terrible , ”
59490	59545	59414	59414	Lupin	195	“ The fortress is set on a tiny island , way out to sea , but they do n’t need walls and water to keep the prisoners in , not when they ’re all trapped inside their own heads , incapable of a single cheerful thought . Most of them go mad within weeks . ”
59546	59554	59555	59555	Harry	117	“ But Sirius Black escaped from them , ”
59559	59564	59555	59555	Harry	117	“ He got away ... ”
59582	59585	59586	59586	he	195	“ Yes , ”
59592	59630	59586	59586	he	195	“ Black must have found a way to fight them . I would n’t have believed it possible ... Dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long ... ”
59631	59642	59644	59644	Harry	117	“ You made that dementor on the train back off , ”
59647	59657	59659	59659	Lupin	195	“ There are — certain defenses one can use , ”
59661	59685	59659	59659	Lupin	195	“ But there was only one dementor on the train . The more there are , the more difficult it becomes to resist . ”
59686	59690	59692	59692	Harry	117	“ What defenses ? ”
59696	59702	59692	59692	Harry	117	“ Can you teach me ? ”
59703	59722	59659	59659	Lupin	195	“ I do n’t pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors , Harry ... quite the contrary ... ”
59723	59743	59692	59692	Harry	117	“ But if the dementors come to another Quidditch match , I need to be able to fight them — ”
59757	59803	59744	59744	Lupin	195	“ Well ... all right . I ’ll try and help . But it ’ll have to wait until next term , I ’m afraid . I have a lot to do before the holidays . I chose a very inconvenient time to fall ill . ”
60093	60103	60105	60105	Hermione	313	“ We can do all our Christmas shopping there ! ”
60107	60120	60105	60105	Hermione	313	“ Mum and Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes ! ”
60255	60260	60347	60347	He	117	“ Psst — Harry ! ”
60294	60300	60302	60302	Harry	117	“ What are you doing ? ”
60305	60315	60302	60302	Harry	117	“ How come you ’re not going to Hogsmeade ? ”
60316	60332	60334	60334	Fred	144	“ We ’ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go , ”
60341	60346	60334	60334	Fred	144	“ Come in here ... ”
60386	60395	60396	60396	he	117	“ Early Christmas present for you , Harry , ”
60451	60459	60436	60436	Harry	117	“ What ’s that supposed to be ? ”
60460	60472	60474	60474	George	145	“ This , Harry , is the secret of our success , ”
60481	60492	60494	60494	Fred	144	“ It ’s a wrench , giving it to you , ”
60496	60510	60494	60494	Fred	144	“ but we decided last night , your need ’s greater than ours . ”
60511	60520	60522	60522	George	145	“ Anyway , we know it by heart , ”
60524	60539	60522	60522	George	145	“ We bequeath it to you . We do n’t really need it anymore . ”
60540	60553	60555	60555	Harry	117	“ And what do I need with a bit of old parchment ? ”
60557	60564	60566	60566	Fred	144	“ A bit of old parchment ! ”
60582	60587	60566	60566	Fred	144	“ Explain , George . ”
60588	60608	60609	60609	Harry	117	“ Well ... when we were in our first year , Harry — young , carefree , and innocent — ”
60623	60644	60609	60609	Harry	117	“ — well , more innocent than we are now — we got into a spot of bother with Filch . ”
60645	60662	60609	60609	Harry	117	“ We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason — ”
60663	60680	60609	60609	Harry	117	“ So he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual — ”
60681	60685	60609	60609	Harry	117	“ — detention — ”
60686	60690	60609	60609	Harry	117	“ — disembowelment — ”
60691	60713	60609	60609	Harry	117	“ — and we could n’t help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked Confiscated and Highly Dangerous . ”
60714	60720	60722	60722	Harry	117	“ Do n’t tell me — ”
60728	60737	60739	60739	Fred	144	“ Well , what would you ’ve done ? ”
60741	60761	60739	60739	Fred	144	“ George caused a diversion by dropping another Dungbomb , I whipped the drawer open and grabbed — this . ”
60762	60775	60777	60777	George	145	“ It ’s not as bad as it sounds , you know , ”
60779	60810	60777	60777	George	145	“ We do n’t reckon Filch ever found out how to work it . He probably suspected what it was , though , or he would n’t have confiscated it . ”
60811	60820	60739	60739	Fred	144	“ And you know how to work it ? ”
60821	60825	60827	60827	Fred	144	“ Oh yes , ”
60831	60847	60827	60827	Fred	144	“ This little beauty ’s taught us more than all the teachers in this school . ”
60848	60855	60857	60857	Harry	117	“ You ’re winding me up , ”
60868	60874	60876	60876	George	145	“ Oh , are we ? ”
60892	60904	60878	60878	He	1526	“ I solemnly swear that I am up to no good . ”
61117	61122	61124	61124	Fred	144	“ Right into Hogsmeade , ”
61134	61148	61150	61150	he	117	“ There are seven in all . Now , Filch knows about these four ”
61155	61271	61150	61150	he	117	“ but we ’re sure we ’re the only ones who know about these . Do n’t bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor . We used it until last winter , but it ’s caved in — completely blocked . And we do n’t reckon anyone ’s ever used this one , because the Whomping Willow ’s planted right over the entrance . But this one here , this one leads right into the cellar of Honeydukes . We ’ve used it loads of times . And as you might ’ve noticed , the entrance is right outside this room , through that one - eyed old crone ’s hump . ”
61272	61282	61284	61284	George	145	“ Moony , Wormtail , Padfoot , and Prongs , ”
61293	61300	61284	61284	George	145	“ We owe them so much . ”
61301	61315	61317	61317	Fred	144	“ Noble men , working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers , ”
61320	61323	61325	61325	George	145	“ Right , ”
61328	61341	61325	61325	George	145	“ Do n’t forget to wipe it after you ’ve used it — ”
61342	61350	61351	61351	Fred	144	“ — or anyone can read it , ”
61355	61374	61325	61325	George	145	“ Just tap it again and say , ‘ Mischief managed ! ’ And it ’ll go blank . ”
61375	61381	61383	61383	Fred	144	“ So , young Harry , ”
61392	61398	61383	61383	Fred	144	“ mind you behave yourself . ”
61399	61405	61407	61407	George	145	“ See you in Honeydukes , ”
61775	61778	61733	61733	his	117	“ Dissendium . ”
61779	61782	61783	61783	Harry	117	“ Dissendium ! ”
61878	61881	61870	61870	He	117	“ Lumos ! ”
61914	61918	61897	61897	He	117	“ Mischief managed ! ”
62247	62265	62267	62268	a woman	1463	“ And get another box of Jelly Slugs , dear , they ’ve nearly cleaned us out — ”

62546	62553	62496	62496	Ron	147	“ Breathe fire for your friends ! ”
62559	62567	62556	62557	Ice Mice	287	“ Hear your teeth chatter and squeak ! ”
62576	62583	62556	62557	Ice Mice	287	“ Hop realistically in the stomach ! ”
62645	62666	62667	62667	Hermione	313	“ Ugh , no , Harry wo n’t want one of those , they ’re for vampires , I expect , ”
62671	62676	62678	62678	Ron	147	“ How about these ? ”
62691	62695	62697	62697	Harry	117	“ Definitely not , ”
62705	62708	62710	62710	Hermione	313	“ Harry ! ”
62712	62726	62710	62710	Hermione	313	“ What are you doing here ? How — how did you — ? ”
62727	62730	62732	62732	Ron	147	“ Wow ! ”
62738	62745	62732	62732	Ron	147	“ you ’ve learned to Apparate ! ”
62746	62753	62755	62755	Harry	117	“ ’ Course I have n’t , ”
62781	62793	62795	62795	Ron	147	“ How come Fred and George never gave it to me ! ”
62799	62805	62795	62795	Ron	147	“ I ’m their brother ! ”
62806	62816	62818	62818	Hermione	313	“ But Harry is n’t going to keep it ! ”
62827	62845	62818	62818	Hermione	313	“ He ’s going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall , are n’t you , Harry ? ”
62846	62853	62855	62855	Harry	117	“ No , I ’m not ! ”
62857	62862	62864	62864	Ron	147	“ Are you mad ? ”
62870	62877	62864	62864	Ron	147	“ Hand in something that good ? ”
62878	62905	62818	62818	Hermione	313	“ If I hand it in , I ’ll have to say where I got it ! Filch would know Fred and George had nicked it ! ”
62906	62913	62914	62914	Hermione	313	“ But what about Sirius Black ? ”
62917	62942	62914	62914	Hermione	313	“ He could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle ! The teachers have got to know ! ”
62943	62954	62956	62956	Harry	117	“ He ca n’t be getting in through a passage , ”
62959	63059	62956	62956	Harry	117	“ There are seven secret tunnels on the map , right ? Fred and George reckon Filch already knows about four of them . And of the other three — one of them ’s caved in , so no one can get through it . One of them ’s got the Whomping Willow planted over the entrance , so you ca n’t get out of it . And the one I just came through — well — it ’s really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar , so unless he knew it was there ... ”
63170	63173	63175	63175	Ron	147	“ See ? ”
63178	63222	63175	63175	Ron	147	“ I ’d like to see Black try and break into Honeydukes with dementors swarming all over the village . Anyway , Hermione , the Honeydukes owners would hear a break - in , would n’t they ? They live over the shop ! ”
63223	63230	63231	63231	Hermione	313	“ Yes , but — but — ”
63241	63291	63231	63231	Hermione	313	“ Look , Harry still should n’t be coming into Hogsmeade . He has n’t got a signed form ! If anyone finds out , he ’ll be in so much trouble ! And it ’s not nightfall yet — what if Sirius Black turns up today ? Now ? ”
63292	63303	63305	63305	Ron	147	“ He ’d have a job spotting Harry in this , ”
63319	63334	63305	63305	Ron	147	“ Come on , Hermione , it ’s Christmas . Harry deserves a break . ”
63344	63352	63353	63353	Harry	117	“ Are you going to report me ? ”
63359	63371	63337	63337	her	313	“ Oh — of course not — but honestly , Harry — ”
63372	63380	63382	63382	Ron	147	“ Seen the Fizzing Whizbees , Harry ? ”
63394	63434	63435	63435	Ron	147	“ And the Jelly Slugs ? And the Acid Pops ? Fred gave me one of those when I was seven — it burnt a hole right through my tongue . I remember Mum walloping him with her broomstick . ”
63444	63461	63435	63435	Ron	147	“ Reckon Fred’d take a bit of Cockroach Cluster if I told him they were peanuts ? ”
63559	63566	63551	63551	Ron	147	“ That ’s the post office — ”
63567	63574	63595	63595	his	147	“ Zonko ’s is up there — ”
63575	63585	63551	63551	Ron	147	“ We could go up to the Shrieking Shack — ”
63586	63591	63593	63593	Ron	147	“ Tell you what , ”
63599	63611	63593	63593	Ron	147	“ shall we go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks ? ”
63678	63684	63686	63686	Ron	147	“ That ’s Madam Rosmerta , ”
63688	63698	63699	63699	he	147	“ I ’ll get the drinks , shall I ? ”
63758	63762	63763	63763	he	147	“ Merry Christmas ! ”
63947	63950	63944	63944	Hermione	313	“ Mobiliarbus ! ”
64046	64051	64041	64042	a woman	1463	“ A small gillywater — ”
64052	64055	64057	64058	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Mine , ”
64062	64069	64041	64042	a woman	1463	“ Four pints of mulled mead — ”
64070	64075	64077	64077	Hagrid	305	“ Ta , Rosmerta , ”
64079	64090	64041	64042	a woman	1463	“ A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella — ”
64091	64094	64096	64097	Professor Flitwick	208	“ Mmm ! ”
64103	64115	64041	64042	a woman	1463	“ So you ’ll be the red currant rum , Minister . ”
64116	64124	64126	64126	Fudge	173	“ Thank you , Rosmerta , m’dear , ”
64130	64154	64126	64126	Fudge	173	“ Lovely to see you again , I must say . Have one yourself , wo n’t you ? Come and join us ... ”
64155	64165	64041	64042	a woman	1463	“ Well , thank you very much , Minister . ”
64244	64259	64261	64262	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ So , what brings you to this neck of the woods , Minister ? ”
64296	64319	64289	64289	he	117	“ What else , m’dear , but Sirius Black ? I daresay you heard what happened up at the school at Halloween ? ”
64320	64327	64329	64330	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ I did hear a rumor , ”
64332	64342	64344	64345	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Did you tell the whole pub , Hagrid ? ”
64348	64361	64363	64364	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ Do you think Black ’s still in the area , Minister ? ”
64366	64373	64375	64375	Fudge	173	“ I ’m sure of it , ”
64378	64390	64392	64393	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ You know that the dementors have searched my pub twice ? ”
64402	64418	64399	64399	her	1604	“ Scared all my customers away ... It ’s very bad for business , Minister . ”
64419	64435	64437	64437	Fudge	173	“ Rosmerta , m’dear , I do n’t like them any more than you do , ”
64440	64477	64437	64437	Fudge	173	“ Necessary precaution ... unfortunate , but there you are ... I ’ve just met some of them . They ’re in a fury against Dumbledore — he wo n’t let them inside the castle grounds . ”
64478	64484	64486	64487	Professor McGonagall	199	“ I should think not , ”
64490	64503	64486	64487	Professor McGonagall	199	“ How are we supposed to teach with those horrors floating around ? ”
64504	64509	64511	64513	tiny Professor Flitwick	208	“ Hear , hear ! ”
64525	64530	64532	64532	Fudge	173	“ All the same , ”
64534	64556	64532	64532	Fudge	173	“ they are here to protect you all from something much worse ... We all know what Black ’s capable of ... ”
64557	64569	64571	64572	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ Do you know , I still have trouble believing it , ”
64575	64636	64571	64572	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ Of all the people to go over to the Dark Side , Sirius Black was the last I ’d have thought ... I mean , I remember him when he was a boy at Hogwarts . If you ’d told me then what he was going to become , I ’d have said you ’d had too much mead . ”
64637	64649	64651	64651	Fudge	173	“ You do n’t know the half of it , Rosmerta , ”
64654	64664	64651	64651	Fudge	173	“ The worst he did is n’t widely known . ”
64665	64669	64674	64674	her	1605	“ The worst ? ”
64680	64692	64674	64674	her	1605	“ Worse than murdering all those poor people , you mean ? ”
64693	64698	64700	64700	Fudge	173	“ I certainly do , ”
64702	64715	64674	64674	her	1605	“ I ca n’t believe that . What could possibly be worse ? ”
64716	64727	64729	64730	Professor McGonagall	199	“ You say you remember him at Hogwarts , Rosmerta , ”
64732	64742	64729	64730	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Do you remember who his best friend was ? ”
64743	64746	64748	64749	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ Naturally , ”
64756	64797	64748	64749	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ Never saw one without the other , did you ? The number of times I had them in here — ooh , they used to make me laugh . Quite the double act , Sirius Black and James Potter ! ”
64811	64814	64816	64817	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Precisely , ”
64819	64858	64816	64817	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Black and Potter . Ringleaders of their little gang . Both very bright , of course — exceptionally bright , in fact — but I do n’t think we ’ve ever had such a pair of troublemakers — ”
64859	64863	64865	64865	Hagrid	305	“ I dunno , ”
64867	64881	64865	64865	Hagrid	305	“ Fred and George Weasley could give ’em a run fer their money . ”
64882	64893	64896	64897	Professor Flitwick	208	“ You ’d have thought Black and Potter were brothers ! ”
64899	64902	64896	64897	Professor Flitwick	208	“ Inseparable ! ”
64903	64909	64911	64911	Fudge	173	“ Of course they were , ”
64913	64965	64911	64911	Fudge	173	“ Potter trusted Black beyond all his other friends . Nothing changed when they left school . Black was best man when James married Lily . Then they named him godfather to Harry . Harry has no idea , of course . You can imagine how the idea would torment him . ”
64966	64982	64984	64985	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ Because Black turned out to be in league with You - Know - Who ? ”
64987	64995	64996	64996	Fudge	173	“ Worse even than that , m’dear ... ”
65009	65105	64998	64998	his	173	“ Not many people are aware that the Potters knew You - Know - Who was after them . Dumbledore , who was of course working tirelessly against You - Know - Who , had a number of useful spies . One of them tipped him off , and he alerted James and Lily at once . He advised them to go into hiding . Well , of course , You - Know - Who was n’t an easy person to hide from . Dumbledore told them that their best chance was the Fidelius Charm . ”
65106	65112	65114	65115	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ How does that work ? ”
65127	65133	65134	65134	he	1606	“ An immensely complex spell , ”
65138	65236	65134	65134	he	1606	“ involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single , living soul . The information is hidden inside the chosen person , or Secret - Keeper , and is henceforth impossible to find — unless , of course , the Secret - Keeper chooses to divulge it . As long as the Secret - Keeper refused to speak , You - Know - Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them , not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting - room window ! ”
65237	65248	65250	65251	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ So Black was the Potters ’ Secret - Keeper ? ”
65253	65256	65258	65259	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Naturally , ”
65261	65308	65258	65259	Professor McGonagall	199	“ James Potter told Dumbledore that Black would die rather than tell where they were , that Black was planning to go into hiding himself ... and yet , Dumbledore remained worried . I remember him offering to be the Potters ’ Secret - Keeper himself . ”
65309	65314	65316	65317	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ He suspected Black ? ”
65319	65342	65344	65345	Professor McGonagall	199	“ He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keeping You - Know - Who informed of their movements , ”
65348	65379	65344	65345	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Indeed , he had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to You - Know - Who . ”
65380	65389	65258	65259	Professor McGonagall	199	“ But James Potter insisted on using Black ? ”
65390	65394	65396	65396	Fudge	173	“ He did , ”
65399	65414	65396	65396	Fudge	173	“ And then , barely a week after the Fidelius Charm had been performed — ”
65415	65420	65422	65423	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ Black betrayed them ? ”
65425	65543	65258	65259	Professor McGonagall	199	“ He did indeed . Black was tired of his double - agent role , he was ready to declare his support openly for You - Know - Who , and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the Potters ’ death . But , as we all know , You - Know - Who met his downfall in little Harry Potter . Powers gone , horribly weakened , he fled . And this left Black in a very nasty position indeed . His master had fallen at the very moment when he , Black , had shown his true colors as a traitor . He had no choice but to run for it — ”
65544	65551	65552	65552	Hagrid	305	“ Filthy , stinkin ’ turncoat ! ”
65564	65567	65569	65570	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Shh ! ”
65572	65577	65579	65579	Hagrid	305	“ I met him ! ”
65581	65735	65736	65736	Hagrid	305	“ I musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people ! It was me what rescued Harry from Lily an ’ James ’s house after they was killed ! Jus ’ got him outta the ruins , poor little thing , with a great slash across his forehead , an ’ his parents dead ... an ’ Sirius Black turns up , on that flyin ’ motorbike he used ter ride . Never occurred ter me what he was doin’ there . I didn ’ know he ’d bin Lily an ’ James ’s Secret - Keeper . Thought he ’d jus ’ heard the news o ’ You - Know - Who ’s attack an ’ come ter see what he could do . White an ’ shakin ’ , he was . An ’ yeh know what I did ? I COMFORTED THE MURDERIN ’ TRAITOR ! ”
65739	65744	65746	65747	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Hagrid , please ! ”
65749	65755	65746	65747	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Keep your voice down ! ”
65756	65876	66026	66026	Hagrid	305	“ How was I ter know he wasn ’ upset abou ’ Lily an ’ James ? It was You - Know - Who he cared abou ’ ! An ’ then he says , ‘ Give Harry ter me , Hagrid , I ’m his godfather , I ’ll look after him — ’ Ha ! But I ’d had me orders from Dumbledore , an ’ I told Black no , Dumbledore said Harry was ter go ter his aunt an ’ uncle ’s . Black argued , but in the end he gave in . Told me ter take his motorbike ter get Harry there . ‘ I wo n’t need it anymore , ’ he says .
65877	65962	65746	65747	Professor McGonagall	199	“ I shoulda known there was somethin’ fishy goin’ on then . He loved that motorbike , what was he givin ’ it ter me for ? Why wouldn ’ he need it anymore ? Fact was , it was too easy ter trace . Dumbledore knew he ’d bin the Potters ’ Secret - Keeper . Black knew he was goin’ ter have ter run fer it that night , knew it was a matter o ’ hours before the Ministry was after him .
65963	66021	66026	66026	Hagrid	305	“ But what if I ’d given Harry to him , eh ? I bet he ’d ’ve pitched him off the bike halfway out ter sea . His bes ’ friends ’ son ! But when a wizard goes over ter the Dark Side , there ’s nothin’ and no one that matters to ’em anymore ... ”
66038	66061	66031	66032	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ But he did n’t manage to disappear , did he ? The Ministry of Magic caught up with him next day ! ”
66062	66070	66072	66072	Fudge	173	“ Alas , if only we had , ”
66075	66123	66072	66072	Fudge	173	“ It was not we who found him . It was little Peter Pettigrew — another of the Potters ’ friends . Maddened by grief , no doubt , and knowing that Black had been the Potters ’ Secret - Keeper , he went after Black himself . ”
66124	66141	66143	66144	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ Pettigrew ... that fat little boy who was always tagging around after them at Hogwarts ? ”
66146	66154	66156	66157	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Hero - worshipped Black and Potter , ”
66159	66190	66191	66191	She	199	“ Never quite in their league , talent - wise . I was often rather sharp with him . You can imagine how I — how I regret that now ... ”
66202	66209	66211	66211	Fudge	173	“ There , now , Minerva , ”
66214	66282	66211	66211	Fudge	173	“ Pettigrew died a hero ’s death . Eyewitnesses — Muggles , of course , we wiped their memories later — told us how Pettigrew cornered Black . They say he was sobbing , ‘ Lily and James , Sirius ! How could you ? ’ And then he went for his wand . Well , of course , Black was quicker . Blew Pettigrew to smithereens ... ”
66292	66314	66283	66284	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Stupid boy ... foolish boy ... he was always hopeless at dueling ... should have left it to the Ministry ... ”
66315	66351	66352	66352	Hagrid	305	“ I tell yeh , if I ’d got ter Black before little Pettigrew did , I would n’t ’ve messed around with wands — I ’d ’ve ripped him limb — from — limb , ”
66355	66368	66370	66370	Fudge	173	“ You do n’t know what you ’re talking about , Hagrid , ”
66373	66497	66370	66370	Fudge	173	“ Nobody but trained Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad would have stood a chance against Black once he was cornered . I was Junior Minister in the Department of Magical Catastrophes at the time , and I was one of the first on the scene after Black murdered all those people . I — I will never forget it . I still dream about it sometimes . A crater in the middle of the street , so deep it had cracked the sewer below . Bodies everywhere . Muggles screaming . And Black standing there laughing , with what was left of Pettigrew in front of him ... a heap of bloodstained robes and a few — a few fragments — ”
66514	66524	66526	66526	Fudge	173	“ Well , there you have it , Rosmerta , ”
66529	66573	66526	66526	Fudge	173	“ Black was taken away by twenty members of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad and Pettigrew received the Order of Merlin , First Class , which I think was some comfort to his poor mother . Black ’s been in Azkaban ever since . ”
66582	66592	66574	66575	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ Is it true he ’s mad , Minister ? ”
66593	66603	66605	66605	Fudge	173	“ I wish I could say that he was , ”
66608	66772	66605	66605	Fudge	173	“ I certainly believe his master ’s defeat unhinged him for a while . The murder of Pettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man — cruel ... pointless . Yet I met Black on my last inspection of Azkaban . You know , most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark ; there ’s no sense in them ... but I was shocked at how normal Black seemed . He spoke quite rationally to me . It was unnerving . You ’d have thought he was merely bored — asked if I ’d finished with my newspaper , cool as you please , said he missed doing the crossword . Yes , I was astounded at how little effect the dementors seemed to be having on him — and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place , you know . Dementors outside his door day and night . ”
66773	66786	66788	66789	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ But what do you think he ’s broken out to do ? ”
66791	66812	66788	66789	Madam Rosmerta	291	“ Good gracious , Minister , he is n’t trying to rejoin You - Know - Who , is he ? ”
66813	66825	66827	66827	Fudge	173	“ I daresay that is his — er — eventual plan , ”
66830	66878	66827	66827	Fudge	173	“ But we hope to catch Black long before that . I must say , You - Know - Who alone and friendless is one thing ... but give him back his most devoted servant , and I shudder to think how quickly he ’ll rise again ... ”
66896	66920	66922	66923	Professor McGonagall	199	“ You know , Cornelius , if you ’re dining with the headmaster , we ’d better head back up to the castle , ”
66986	66989	66981	66982	the teachers	1000	“ Harry ? ”
67519	67522	67524	67524	Ron	147	“ Harry ? ”
67650	67668	67628	67628	He	117	“ It has happened , my Lord ... the Potters have made me their Secret - Keeper ... ”
67693	67702	67628	67628	He	117	“ Harry , you — you look terrible . ”
67764	67769	67771	67771	Harry	117	“ Where is everyone ? ”
67773	67787	67789	67789	Ron	147	“ Gone ! It ’s the first day of the holidays , remember ? ”
67795	67814	67789	67789	Ron	147	“ It ’s nearly lunchtime ; I was going to come and wake you up in a minute . ”
67849	67860	67861	67861	Hermione	313	“ You really do n’t look well , you know , ”
67870	67875	67877	67877	Harry	117	“ I ’m fine , ”
67879	67884	67886	67886	Hermione	313	“ Harry , listen , ”
67894	67919	67892	67892	Ron	147	“ you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday . But the thing is , you must n’t go doing anything stupid . ”
67920	67924	67926	67926	Harry	117	“ Like what ? ”
67928	67936	67938	67938	Ron	147	“ Like trying to go after Black , ”
67961	67971	67973	67973	Hermione	313	“ You wo n’t , will you , Harry ? ”
67975	67984	67986	67986	Ron	147	“ Because Black ’s not worth dying for , ”
68002	68019	68020	68020	Ron	147	“ D’you know what I see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me ? ”
68030	68091	68022	68022	Hermione	313	“ I can hear my mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort . And if you ’d heard your mum screaming like that , just about to be killed , you would n’t forget it in a hurry . And if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent Voldemort after her — ”
68092	68100	68102	68102	Hermione	313	“ There ’s nothing you can do ! ”
68107	68127	68102	68102	Hermione	313	“ The dementors will catch Black and he ’ll go back to Azkaban and — and serve him right ! ”
68128	68160	68022	68022	Hermione	313	“ You heard what Fudge said . Black is n’t affected by Azkaban like normal people are . It ’s not a punishment for him like it is for the others . ”
68161	68168	68170	68170	Ron	147	“ So what are you saying ? ”
68176	68187	68170	68170	Ron	147	“ You want to — to kill Black or something ? ”
68188	68194	68196	68196	Hermione	313	“ Do n’t be silly , ”
68202	68216	68196	68196	Hermione	313	“ Harry does n’t want to kill anyone , do you , Harry ? ”
68259	68263	68264	68264	he	147	“ Malfoy knows , ”
68268	68297	68264	68264	he	147	“ Remember what he said to me in Potions ? ‘ If it was me , I ’d hunt him down myself ... I ’d want revenge . ’ ”
68298	68311	68313	68313	Ron	147	“ You ’re going to take Malfoy ’s advice instead of ours ? ”
68316	68377	68313	68313	Ron	147	“ Listen ... you know what Pettigrew ’s mother got back after Black had finished with him ? Dad told me — the Order of Merlin , First Class , and Pettigrew ’s finger in a box . That was the biggest bit of him they could find . Black ’s a madman , Harry , and he ’s dangerous — ”
68378	68387	68389	68389	Harry	117	“ Malfoy ’s dad must have told him , ”
68394	68404	68389	68389	Harry	117	“ He was right in Voldemort ’s inner circle — ”
68405	68416	68418	68418	Ron	147	“ Say You - Know - Who , will you ? ”
68421	68435	68389	68389	Harry	117	“ — so obviously , the Malfoys knew Black was working for Voldemort — ”
68436	68476	68389	68389	Harry	117	“ — and Malfoy’d love to see you blown into about a million pieces , like Pettigrew ! Get a grip . Malfoy ’s just hoping you ’ll get yourself killed before he has to play you at Quidditch . ”
68477	68482	68484	68484	Hermione	313	“ Harry , please , ”
68493	68567	68484	68484	Hermione	313	“ please be sensible . Black did a terrible , terrible thing , but d - don’t put yourself in danger , it ’s what Black wants ... Oh , Harry , you ’d be playing right into Black ’s hands if you went looking for him . Your mum and dad would n’t want you to get hurt , would they ? They ’d never want you to go looking for Black ! ”
68568	68591	68593	68593	Harry	117	“ I ’ll never know what they ’d have wanted , because thanks to Black , I ’ve never spoken to them , ”
68615	68618	68620	68620	Ron	147	“ Look , ”
68631	68661	68620	68620	Ron	147	“ it ’s the holidays ! It ’s nearly Christmas ! Let ’s — let ’s go down and see Hagrid . We have n’t visited him for ages ! ”
68662	68665	68667	68667	Hermione	313	“ No ! ”
68670	68682	68667	68667	Hermione	313	“ Harry is n’t supposed to leave the castle , Ron — ”
68683	68690	68692	68692	Harry	117	“ Yeah , let ’s go , ”
68697	68718	68692	68692	Harry	117	“ and I can ask him how come he never mentioned Black when he told me all about my parents ! ”
68734	68744	68745	68745	he	147	“ Or we could have a game of chess , ”
68749	68758	68745	68745	he	147	“ or Gobstones . Percy left a set — ”
68759	68767	68769	68769	Harry	117	“ No , let ’s visit Hagrid , ”
68788	68799	68745	68745	he	147	“ Stand and fight , you yellow - bellied mongrels ! ”
68883	68892	68894	68894	Hermione	313	“ He ’s not out , is he ? ”
68911	68918	68919	68919	he	147	“ There ’s a weird noise , ”
68922	68929	68919	68919	he	147	“ Listen — is that Fang ? ”
68954	68964	68966	68966	Ron	147	“ Think we ’d better go and get someone ? ”
68969	68972	68974	68974	Harry	117	“ Hagrid ! ”
68980	68988	68974	68974	Harry	117	“ Hagrid , are you in there ? ”
69023	69027	69028	69028	he	305	“ Yeh’ve heard ? ”
69121	69128	69130	69130	Hermione	313	“ Hagrid , what is it ? ”
69147	69154	69134	69134	Harry	117	“ What ’s this , Hagrid ? ”
69215	69225	69227	69227	Ron	147	“ Well , that ’s okay then , Hagrid ! ”
69354	69357	69359	69359	Ron	147	“ Oh , ”
69361	69381	69359	69359	Ron	147	“ But you said Buckbeak is n’t a bad hippogriff , Hagrid . I bet he ’ll get off — ”
69382	69400	69402	69402	Hagrid	305	“ Yeh don ’ know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o ’ Dangerous Creatures ! ”
69411	69422	69402	69402	Hagrid	305	“ They ’ve got it in fer interestin ’ creatures ! ”
69464	69478	69480	69480	Hagrid	305	“ I couldn ’ leave him tied up out there in the snow ! ”
69482	69491	69480	69480	Hagrid	305	“ All on his own ! At Christmas . ”
69516	69519	69514	69514	he	305	“ interesting creatures ”
69524	69528	69514	69514	he	305	“ terrifying monsters . ”
69560	69574	69576	69576	Hermione	313	“ You ’ll have to put up a good strong defense , Hagrid , ”
69590	69601	69576	69576	Hermione	313	“ I ’m sure you can prove Buckbeak is safe . ”
69602	69609	69611	69611	Hagrid	305	“ Wo n’t make no diff’rence ! ”
69613	69642	69611	69611	Hagrid	305	“ Them Disposal devils , they ’re all in Lucius Malfoy ’s pocket ! Scared o ’ him ! An ’ if I lose the case , Buckbeak — ”
69667	69674	69676	69676	Harry	117	“ What about Dumbledore , Hagrid ? ”
69678	69688	69690	69690	Hagrid	305	“ He ’s done more’n enough fer me already , ”
69692	69716	69690	69690	Hagrid	305	“ Got enough on his plate what with keepin ’ them dementors outta the castle , an ’ Sirius Black lurkin ’ around — ”
69763	69768	69769	69769	he	117	“ Listen , Hagrid , ”
69772	69797	69769	69769	he	117	“ you ca n’t give up . Hermione ’s right , you just need a good defense . You can call us as witnesses — ”
69798	69813	69815	69815	Hermione	313	“ I ’m sure I ’ve read about a case of hippogriff - baiting , ”
69818	69841	69815	69815	Hermione	313	“ where the hippogriff got off . I ’ll look it up for you , Hagrid , and see exactly what happened . ”
69858	69869	69871	69871	Ron	147	“ Er — shall I make a cup of tea ? ”
69878	69890	69891	69891	Ron	147	“ It ’s what my mum does whenever someone ’s upset , ”
69932	69951	69917	69917	Hagrid	305	“ Yer right . I can ’ afford to go ter pieces . Got ta pull meself together ... ”
69971	69979	69981	69981	Hagrid	305	“ I ’ve not bin meself lately , ”
69996	70011	69981	69981	Hagrid	305	“ Worried abou ’ Buckbeak , an ’ no one likin ’ me classes — ”
70012	70018	70020	70020	Hermione	313	“ We do like them ! ”
70024	70031	70033	70033	Ron	147	“ Yeah , they ’re great ! ”
70042	70050	70033	70033	Ron	147	“ Er — how are the flobberworms ? ”
70051	70054	70056	70056	Hagrid	305	“ Dead , ”
70059	70064	70056	70056	Hagrid	305	“ Too much lettuce . ”
70065	70069	70071	70071	Ron	147	“ Oh no ! ”
70077	70091	70093	70093	Hagrid	305	“ An ’ them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an ’ all , ”
70100	70125	70093	70093	Hagrid	305	“ Got ta walk past ’em ev’ry time I want a drink in the Three Broomsticks . ’S like bein ’ back in Azkaban — ”
70166	70175	70162	70162	Hermione	313	“ Is it awful in there , Hagrid ? ”
70176	70181	70183	70183	Hagrid	305	“ Yeh’ve no idea , ”
70186	70230	70183	70183	Hagrid	305	“ Never bin anywhere like it . Thought I was goin’ mad . Kep ’ goin’ over horrible stuff in me mind ... the day I got expelled from Hogwarts ... day me dad died ... day I had ter let Norbert go ... ”
70252	70338	70162	70162	Hermione	313	“ Yeh can ’ really remember who yeh are after a while . An ’ yeh can ’ see the point o ’ livin ’ at all . I used ter hope I ’d jus ’ die in me sleep ... When they let me out , it was like bein ’ born again , ev’rythin ’ came floodin ’ back , it was the bes ’ feelin ’ in the world . Mind , the dementors were n’t keen on lettin ’ me go . ”
70339	70345	70347	70347	Hermione	313	“ But you were innocent ! ”
70352	70406	70349	70349	Hagrid	305	“ Think that matters to them ? They don ’ care . Long as they ’ve got a couple o ’ hundred humans stuck there with ’em , so they can leech all the happiness out of ’em , they don ’ give a damn who ’s guilty an ’ who ’s not . ”
70424	70473	70420	70420	he	305	“ Thought o ’ jus ’ letting Buckbeak go ... tryin ’ ter make him fly away ... but how d’yeh explain ter a hippogriff it ’s got ta go inter hidin ’ ? An ’ — an ’ I ’m scared o ’ breakin ’ the law ... ”
70487	70499	70474	70474	He	305	“ I don ’ ever want ter go back ter Azkaban . ”
70625	70656	70619	70619	they	943	“ Here ’s something ... there was a case in 1722 ... but the hippogriff was convicted — ugh , look what they did to it , that ’s disgusting — ”
70657	70695	70588	70588	Buckbeak	233	“ This might help , look — a manticore savaged someone in 1296 , and they let the manticore off — oh — no , that was only because everyone was too scared to go near it ... ”
70826	70831	70819	70819	Ron	147	“ Oi ! Presents ! ”
70875	70891	70864	70864	Ron	147	“ Another sweater from Mum ... maroon again ... see if you ’ve got one . ”
70950	70955	70957	70957	Ron	147	“ What ’s that ? ”
70973	70976	70957	70957	Ron	147	“ Dunno ... ”
71010	71017	71018	71018	he	147	“ I do n’t believe it , ”
71110	71117	71119	71119	Ron	147	“ Who sent it to you ? ”
71125	71135	71137	71137	Harry	117	“ Look and see if there ’s a card , ”
71147	71160	71139	71139	Ron	147	“ Nothing ! Blimey , who ’d spend that much on you ? ”
71161	71164	71166	71166	Harry	117	“ Well , ”
71171	71181	71166	71166	Harry	117	“ I ’m betting it was n’t the Dursleys . ”
71182	71189	71191	71191	Ron	147	“ I bet it was Dumbledore , ”
71207	71216	71191	71191	Ron	147	“ He sent you the Invisibility Cloak anonymously ... ”
71217	71226	71228	71228	Harry	117	“ That was my dad ’s , though , ”
71230	71260	71228	71228	Harry	117	“ Dumbledore was just passing it on to me . He would n’t spend hundreds of Galleons on me . He ca n’t go giving students stuff like this — ”
71261	71274	71276	71276	Ron	147	“ That ’s why he would n’t say it was from him ! ”
71278	71293	71276	71276	Ron	147	“ In case some git like Malfoy said it was favoritism . Hey , Harry ”
71303	71332	71295	71295	Ron	147	“ Malfoy ! Wait till he sees you on this ! He ’ll be sick as a pig ! This is an international standard broom , this is ! ”
71333	71340	71341	71341	Harry	117	“ I ca n’t believe this , ”
71369	71373	71360	71360	his	147	“ Who — ? ”
71374	71378	71380	71380	Ron	147	“ I know , ”
71385	71396	71380	71380	Ron	147	“ I know who it could ’ve been — Lupin ! ”
71397	71400	71402	71402	Harry	117	“ What ? ”
71410	71433	71408	71408	himself	117	“ Lupin ? Listen , if he had this much gold , he ’d be able to buy himself some new robes . ”
71434	71442	71444	71444	Ron	147	“ Yeah , but he likes you , ”
71446	71476	71444	71444	Ron	147	“ And he was away when your Nimbus got smashed , and he might ’ve heard about it and decided to visit Diagon Alley and get this for you — ”
71477	71486	71488	71488	Harry	117	“ What d’you mean , he was away ? ”
71490	71502	71488	71488	Harry	117	“ He was ill when I was playing in that match . ”
71503	71514	71516	71516	Ron	147	“ Well , he was n’t in the hospital wing , ”
71518	71535	71516	71516	Ron	147	“ I was there , cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from Snape , remember ? ”
71541	71552	71536	71536	Harry	117	“ I ca n’t see Lupin affording something like this . ”
71553	71561	71536	71536	Harry	117	“ What ’re you two laughing about ? ”
71592	71600	71602	71602	Ron	147	“ Do n’t bring him in here ! ”
71646	71656	71627	71627	She	313	“ Oh , Harry ! Who sent you that ? ”
71657	71661	71663	71663	Harry	117	“ No idea , ”
71665	71676	71663	71663	Harry	117	“ There was n’t a card or anything with it . ”
71708	71716	71718	71718	Ron	147	“ What ’s the matter with you ? ”
71720	71726	71728	71728	Hermione	313	“ I do n’t know , ”
71731	71760	71728	71728	Hermione	313	“ but it ’s a bit odd , is n’t it ? I mean , this is supposed to be quite a good broom , is n’t it ? ”
71765	71776	71777	71777	he	147	“ It ’s the best broom there is , Hermione , ”
71780	71789	71761	71761	Ron	147	“ So it must ’ve been really expensive ... ”
71790	71803	71805	71805	Ron	147	“ Probably cost more than all the Slytherins ’ brooms put together , ”
71808	71831	71833	71833	Hermione	313	“ Well ... who ’d send Harry something as expensive as that , and not even tell him they ’d sent it ? ”
71835	71839	71841	71841	Ron	147	“ Who cares ? ”
71844	71860	71841	71841	Ron	147	“ Listen , Harry , can I have a go on it ? Can I ? ”
71861	71874	71876	71876	Hermione	313	“ I do n’t think anyone should ride that broom just yet ! ”
71886	71902	71904	71904	Ron	147	“ What d’you think Harry ’s going to do with it — sweep the floor ? ”
71925	71936	71937	71937	Ron	147	“ GET — HIM — OUT — OF — HERE ! ”
72036	72042	72043	72043	Harry	117	“ I forgot about that ! ”
72054	72066	72043	72043	Harry	117	“ I never wear those socks if I can help it ... ”
72084	72097	72099	72099	Ron	147	“ You ’d better take that cat out of here , Hermione , ”
72111	72120	72121	72121	he	117	“ Ca n’t you shut that thing up ? ”
72228	72239	72240	72240	Harry	117	“ He ’s not looking too good , is he ? ”
72243	72248	72250	72250	Ron	147	“ It ’s stress ! ”
72252	72266	72250	72250	Ron	147	“ He ’d be fine if that big stupid furball left him alone ! ”
72557	72561	72563	72563	Dumbledore	311	“ Merry Christmas ! ”
72575	72599	72570	72570	Hermione	313	“ As there are so few of us , it seemed foolish to use the House tables ... Sit down , sit down ! ”
72618	72621	72623	72623	Dumbledore	311	“ Crackers ! ”
72708	72712	72713	72713	he	260	“ Dig in ! ”
72779	72788	72790	72790	Dumbledore	311	“ Sybill , this is a pleasant surprise ! ”
72795	72804	72806	72807	Professor Trelawney	219	“ I have been crystal gazing , Headmaster , ”
72816	72863	72809	72809	her	219	“ and to my astonishment , I saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you . Who am I to refuse the promptings of fate ? I at once hastened from my tower , and I do beg you to forgive my lateness ... ”
72864	72869	72871	72871	Dumbledore	311	“ Certainly , certainly , ”
72877	72886	72871	72871	Dumbledore	311	“ Let me draw you up a chair — ”
72947	72990	72938	72938	she	219	“ I dare not , Headmaster ! If I join the table , we shall be thirteen ! Nothing could be more unlucky ! Never forget that when thirteen dine together , the first to rise will be the first to die ! ”
72991	72999	73001	73002	Professor McGonagall	199	“ We ’ll risk it , Sybill , ”
73005	73017	73001	73002	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Do sit down , the turkey ’s getting stone cold . ”
73058	73063	73047	73048	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Tripe , Sybill ? ”
73081	73089	73073	73073	she	219	“ But where is dear Professor Lupin ? ”
73090	73101	73103	73103	Dumbledore	311	“ I ’m afraid the poor fellow is ill again , ”
73113	73124	73103	73103	Dumbledore	311	“ Most unfortunate that it should happen on Christmas Day . ”
73125	73135	73137	73138	Professor McGonagall	199	“ But surely you already knew that , Sybill ? ”
73154	73161	73162	73162	she	199	“ Certainly I knew , Minerva , ”
73166	73203	73162	73162	she	199	“ But one does not parade the fact that one is All - Knowing . I frequently act as though I am not possessed of the Inner Eye , so as not to make others nervous . ”
73204	73211	73213	73214	Professor McGonagall	199	“ That explains a great deal , ”
73229	73277	73217	73218	Professor Trelawney	219	“ If you must know , Minerva , I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long . He seems aware , himself , that his time is short . He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him — ”
73278	73282	73284	73285	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Imagine that , ”
73288	73292	73294	73294	Dumbledore	311	“ I doubt , ”
73317	73338	73312	73313	Professor Trelawney	219	“ that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger . Severus , you ’ve made the potion for him again ? ”
73339	73344	73346	73346	Snape	260	“ Yes , Headmaster , ”
73348	73351	73353	73353	Dumbledore	311	“ Good , ”
73355	73381	73353	73353	Dumbledore	311	“ Then he should be up and about in no time ... Derek , have you had any of these chipolatas ? They ’re excellent . ”
73451	73465	73447	73447	she	1701	“ My dears ! Which of you left his seat first ? Which ? ”
73466	73469	73471	73471	Ron	147	“ Dunno , ”
73478	73487	73489	73490	Professor McGonagall	199	“ I doubt it will make much difference , ”
73493	73514	73489	73490	Professor McGonagall	199	“ unless a mad axe - man is waiting outside the doors to slaughter the first into the entrance hall . ”
73525	73528	73529	73529	Harry	117	“ Coming ? ”
73534	73537	73538	73538	Hermione	313	“ No , ”
73541	73551	73538	73538	Hermione	313	“ I want a quick word with Professor McGonagall . ”
73552	73565	73567	73567	Ron	147	“ Probably trying to see if she can take any more classes , ”
73634	73643	73620	73620	He	217	“ Merry — hic — Christmas ! Password ? ”
73644	73648	73650	73650	Ron	147	“ Scurvy cur , ”
73652	73661	73663	73664	Sir Cadogan	217	“ And the same to you , sir ! ”
73828	73837	73839	73840	Professor McGonagall	199	“ So that ’s it , is it ? ”
73854	73871	73839	73840	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Miss Granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick , Potter . ”
73898	73902	73904	73905	Professor McGonagall	199	“ May I ? ”
73935	73957	73924	73924	She	199	“ Hmm . And there was no note at all , Potter ? No card ? No message of any kind ? ”
73958	73961	73963	73963	Harry	117	“ No , ”
73966	73971	73973	73974	Professor McGonagall	199	“ I see ... , ”
73976	73991	73973	73974	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Well , I ’m afraid I will have to take this , Potter . ”
73992	73997	73999	73999	Harry	117	“ W - what ? ”
74006	74009	73999	73999	Harry	117	“ Why ? ”
74010	74020	74022	74023	Professor McGonagall	199	“ It will need to be checked for jinxes , ”
74025	74047	74022	74023	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Of course , I ’m no expert , but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it down — ”
74048	74053	74055	74055	Ron	147	“ Strip it down ? ”
74064	74075	74077	74078	Professor McGonagall	199	“ It should n’t take more than a few weeks , ”
74080	74096	74077	74078	Professor McGonagall	199	“ You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx - free . ”
74097	74105	74107	74107	Harry	117	“ There ’s nothing wrong with it ! ”
74114	74119	74107	74107	Harry	117	“ Honestly , Professor — ”
74120	74129	74131	74132	Professor McGonagall	199	“ You ca n’t know that , Potter , ”
74137	74177	74131	74132	Professor McGonagall	199	“ not until you ’ve flown it , at any rate , and I ’m afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with . I shall keep you informed . ”
74226	74236	74218	74218	Ron	147	“ What did you go running to McGonagall for ? ”
74259	74283	74243	74243	She	313	“ Because I thought — and Professor McGonagall agrees with me — that that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black ! ”
74489	74495	74496	74496	he	247	“ Had a good Christmas ? ”
74519	74560	74508	74508	he	247	“ I ’ve been doing some thinking over Christmas , Harry . After the last match , you know . If the dementors come to the next one ... I mean ... we ca n’t afford you to — well — ”
74568	74575	74577	74577	Harry	117	“ I ’m working on it , ”
74580	74610	74577	74577	Harry	117	“ Professor Lupin said he ’d train me to ward off the dementors . We should be starting this week . He said he ’d have time after Christmas . ”
74611	74614	74616	74616	Wood	247	“ Ah , ”
74622	74651	74616	74616	Wood	247	“ Well , in that case — I really did n’t want to lose you as Seeker , Harry . And have you ordered a new broom yet ? ”
74652	74655	74657	74657	Harry	117	“ No , ”
74659	74683	74616	74616	Wood	247	“ What ! You ’d better get a move on , you know — you ca n’t ride that Shooting Star against Ravenclaw ! ”
74684	74692	74694	74694	Ron	147	“ He got a Firebolt for Christmas , ”
74696	74710	74616	74616	Wood	247	“ A Firebolt ? No ! Seriously ? A — a real Firebolt ? ”
74711	74719	74721	74721	Harry	117	“ Do n’t get excited , Oliver , ”
74724	74736	74738	74738	he	247	“ I have n’t got it anymore . It was confiscated . ”
74752	74761	74616	74616	Wood	247	“ Jinxed ? How could it be jinxed ? ”
74762	74766	74767	74767	Harry	117	“ Sirius Black , ”
74771	74789	74767	74767	Harry	117	“ He ’s supposed to be after me . So McGonagall reckons he might have sent it . ”
74806	74846	74803	74803	Wood	247	“ But Black could n’t have bought a Firebolt ! He ’s on the run ! The whole country ’s on the lookout for him ! How could he just walk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a broomstick ? ”
74847	74851	74853	74853	Harry	117	“ I know , ”
74855	74865	74853	74853	Harry	117	“ but McGonagall still wants to strip it down — ”
74870	74881	74882	74882	he	247	“ I ’ll go and talk to her , Harry , ”
74885	74925	74882	74882	he	247	“ I ’ll make her see reason ... A Firebolt ... a real Firebolt , on our team ... She wants Gryffindor to win as much as we do ... I ’ll make her see sense . A Firebolt ... ”
75079	75083	75085	75085	Lupin	195	“ Ah yes , ”
75100	75152	75088	75088	Harry	117	“ Let me see ... how about eight o’clock on Thursday evening ? The History of Magic classroom should be large enough ... I ’ll have to think carefully about how we ’re going to do this ... We ca n’t bring a real dementor into the castle to practice on ... ”
75153	75162	75164	75164	Ron	147	“ Still looks ill , does n’t he ? ”
75176	75186	75164	75164	Ron	147	“ What d’you reckon ’s the matter with him ? ”
75193	75195	75088	75088	Harry	117	“ tuh ”
75232	75242	75244	75244	Ron	147	“ And what are you tutting at us for ? ”
75247	75250	75252	75252	Hermione	313	“ Nothing , ”
75266	75272	75274	75274	Ron	147	“ Yes , you were , ”
75276	75290	75274	75274	Ron	147	“ I said I wonder what ’s wrong with Lupin , and you — ”
75291	75299	75301	75301	Hermione	313	“ Well , is n’t it obvious ? ”
75310	75323	75325	75325	Ron	147	“ If you do n’t want to tell us , do n’t , ”
75327	75330	75336	75336	she	313	“ Fine , ”
75340	75346	75348	75348	Ron	147	“ She does n’t know , ”
75355	75369	75348	75348	Ron	147	“ She ’s just trying to get us to talk to her again . ”
75432	75437	75439	75439	Harry	117	“ What ’s that ? ”
75441	75445	75447	75447	Lupin	195	“ Another boggart , ”
75454	75540	75447	75447	Lupin	195	“ I ’ve been combing the castle ever since Tuesday , and very luckily , I found this one lurking inside Mr. Filch ’s filing cabinet . It ’s the nearest we ’ll get to a real dementor . The boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you , so we ’ll be able to practice on him . I can store him in my office when we ’re not using him ; there ’s a cupboard under my desk he ’ll like . ”
75541	75544	75546	75546	Harry	117	“ Okay , ”
75575	75578	75579	75580	Professor Lupin	195	“ So ... ”
75597	75628	75584	75584	his	195	“ The spell I am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic , Harry — well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level . It is called the Patronus Charm . ”
75629	75635	75637	75637	Harry	117	“ How does it work ? ”
75640	75654	75656	75656	Lupin	195	“ Well , when it works correctly , it conjures up a Patronus , ”
75658	75681	75656	75656	Lupin	195	“ which is a kind of anti - dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor . ”
75705	75782	75701	75702	Professor Lupin	195	“ The Patronus is a kind of positive force , a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon — hope , happiness , the desire to survive — but it can not feel despair , as real humans can , so the dementors ca n’t hurt it . But I must warn you , Harry , that the charm might be too advanced for you . Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it . ”
75783	75791	75793	75793	Harry	117	“ What does a Patronus look like ? ”
75796	75808	75701	75702	Professor Lupin	195	“ Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it . ”
75809	75817	75701	75702	Professor Lupin	195	“ And how do you conjure it ? ”
75818	75845	75701	75702	Professor Lupin	195	“ With an incantation , which will work only if you are concentrating , with all your might , on a single , very happy memory . ”
75888	75891	75892	75892	he	117	“ Right , ”
75911	75917	75920	75920	his	195	“ The incantation is this — ”
75923	75927	75920	75920	his	195	“ Expecto Patronum ! ”
75928	75932	75933	75933	Harry	117	“ Expecto Patronum , ”
75939	75943	75933	75933	Harry	117	“ Expecto Patronum . ”
75944	75952	75920	75920	his	195	“ Concentrating hard on your happy memory ? ”
75953	75958	75960	75960	Harry	117	“ Oh — yeah — ”
75973	75989	75960	75960	Harry	117	“ Expecto Patrono — no , Patronum — sorry — Expecto Patronum , Expecto Patronum — ”
76010	76016	76018	76018	Harry	117	“ Did you see that ? ”
76021	76025	76018	76018	Harry	117	“ Something happened ! ”
76026	76030	76032	76032	Lupin	195	“ Very good , ”
76036	76049	76032	76032	Lupin	195	“ Right , then — ready to try it on a dementor ? ”
76050	76053	76054	76054	Harry	117	“ Yes , ”
76199	76203	76204	76204	Harry	117	“ Expecto Patronum ! ”
76207	76213	76204	76204	Harry	117	“ Expecto Patronum ! Expecto — ”
76247	76261	76233	76234	his mother	1384	“ Not Harry ! Not Harry ! Please — I ’ll do anything — ”
76262	76271	76233	76234	his mother	1384	“ Stand aside . Stand aside , girl ! ”
76272	76275	76233	76234	his mother	1384	“ Harry ! ”
76310	76313	76314	76314	he	117	“ Sorry , ”
76329	76335	76337	76337	Lupin	195	“ Are you all right ? ”
76339	76342	76343	76343	Harry	117	“ Yes ... ”
76357	76360	76361	76361	Lupin	195	“ Here — ”
76368	76400	76361	76361	Lupin	195	“ Eat this before we try again . I did n’t expect you to do it your first time ; in fact , I would have been astounded if you had . ”
76401	76407	76408	76408	Harry	117	“ It ’s getting worse , ”
76418	76432	76408	76408	Harry	117	“ I could hear her louder that time — and him — Voldemort — ”
76439	76456	76361	76361	Lupin	195	“ Harry , if you do n’t want to continue , I will more than understand — ”
76457	76461	76463	76463	Harry	117	“ I do ! ”
76477	76516	76463	76463	Harry	117	“ I ’ve got to ! What if the dementors turn up at our match against Ravenclaw ? I ca n’t afford to fall off again . If we lose this game we ’ve lost the Quidditch Cup ! ”
76517	76523	76525	76525	Lupin	195	“ All right then ... , ”
76527	76558	76525	76525	Lupin	195	“ You might want to select another memory , a happy memory , I mean , to concentrate on ... That one does n’t seem to have been strong enough ... ”
76600	76603	76605	76605	Lupin	195	“ Ready ? ”
76612	76615	76617	76617	Harry	117	“ Ready , ”
76647	76650	76652	76652	Lupin	195	“ Go ! ”
76686	76690	76691	76691	Harry	117	“ Expecto Patronum ! ”
76694	76701	76691	76691	Harry	117	“ Expecto Patronum ! Expecto Pat — ”
76732	76754	76723	76724	a man	1741	“ Lily , take Harry and go ! It ’s him ! Go ! Run ! I ’ll hold him off — ”
76777	76785	76758	76758	someone	572	“ Harry ! Harry ... wake up ... ”
76814	76820	76821	76821	Harry	117	“ I heard my dad , ”
76824	76854	76821	76821	Harry	117	“ That ’s the first time I ’ve ever heard him — he tried to take on Voldemort himself , to give my mum time to run for it ... ”
76900	76905	76907	76907	Lupin	195	“ You heard James ? ”
76913	76916	76907	76907	Lupin	195	“ Yeah ... ”
76924	76937	76920	76920	Harry	117	“ Why — you did n’t know my dad , did you ? ”
76938	76950	76952	76952	Lupin	195	“ I — I did , as a matter of fact , ”
76954	76990	76952	76952	Lupin	195	“ We were friends at Hogwarts . Listen , Harry — perhaps we should leave it here for tonight . This charm is ridiculously advanced ... I should n’t have suggested putting you through this ... ”
76991	76994	76996	76996	Harry	117	“ No ! ”
77003	77029	76998	76998	He	117	“ I ’ll have one more go ! I ’m not thinking of happy enough things , that ’s what it is ... Hang on ... ”
77123	77126	77128	77128	Lupin	195	“ Ready ? ”
77143	77152	77134	77134	he	195	“ Concentrating hard ? All right — go ! ”
77181	77185	77186	77186	Harry	117	“ EXPECTO PATRONUM ! ”
77189	77196	77186	77186	Harry	117	“ EXPECTO PATRONUM ! EXPECTO PATRONUM ! ”
77296	77299	77301	77301	Lupin	195	“ Riddikulus ! ”
77380	77383	77384	77384	Lupin	195	“ Excellent ! ”
77394	77405	77384	77384	Lupin	195	“ Excellent , Harry ! That was definitely a start ! ”
77406	77418	77440	77440	He	195	“ Can we have another go ? Just one more go ? ”
77419	77423	77425	77425	Lupin	195	“ Not now , ”
77428	77439	77425	77425	Lupin	195	“ You ’ve had enough for one night . Here — ”
77452	77471	77440	77440	He	195	“ Eat the lot , or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood . Same time next week ? ”
77472	77475	77477	77477	Harry	117	“ Okay , ”
77510	77514	77515	77515	he	117	“ Professor Lupin ? ”
77518	77534	77515	77515	he	117	“ If you knew my dad , you must ’ve known Sirius Black as well . ”
77540	77547	77548	77548	he	195	“ What gives you that idea ? ”
77552	77568	77569	77569	Lupin	195	“ Nothing — I mean , I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too ... ”
77574	77581	77582	77582	he	195	“ Yes , I knew him , ”
77586	77606	77582	77582	he	195	“ Or I thought I did . You ’d better be off , Harry , it ’s getting late . ”
77741	77746	77747	77747	he	117	“ They ’re dead , ”
77752	77783	77747	77747	he	117	“ They ’re dead and listening to echoes of them wo n’t bring them back . You ’d better get a grip on yourself if you want that Quidditch Cup . ”
77976	77983	77984	77984	Ron	147	“ How ’s she doing it ? ”
78018	78022	77984	77984	Ron	147	“ Doing what ? ”
78023	78030	78031	78031	Ron	147	“ Getting to all her classes ! ”
78034	78114	78031	78031	Ron	147	“ I heard her talking to Professor Vector , that Arithmancy witch , this morning . They were going on about yesterday ’s lesson , but Hermione ca n’t ’ve been there , because she was with us in Care of Magical Creatures ! And Ernie Macmillan told me she ’s never missed a Muggle Studies class , but half of them are at the same time as Divination , and she ’s never missed one of them either ! ”
78160	78240	78241	78241	Wood	247	“ Bad news , Harry . I ’ve just been to see Professor McGonagall about the Firebolt . She — er — got a bit shirty with me . Told me I ’d got my priorities wrong . Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup than I do about you staying alive . Just because I told her I did n’t care if it threw you off , as long as you caught the Snitch first . ”
78248	78282	78283	78283	He	247	“ Honestly , the way she was yelling at me ... you ’d think I ’d said something terrible ... Then I asked her how much longer she was going to keep it ... ”
78296	78346	78283	78283	He	247	“ ‘ As long as necessary , Wood ’ ... I reckon it ’s time you ordered a new broom , Harry . There ’s an order form at the back of Which Broomstick ... you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand and One , like Malfoy ’s got . ”
78347	78358	78360	78360	Harry	117	“ I ’m not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good , ”
78429	78442	78443	78444	Professor McGonagall	199	“ No , Potter , you ca n’t have it back yet , ”
78461	78503	78443	78444	Professor McGonagall	199	“ We ’ve checked for most of the usual curses , but Professor Flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex . I shall tell you once we ’ve finished checking it . Now , please stop badgering me . ”
78606	78615	78617	78618	Professor Lupin	195	“ You ’re expecting too much of yourself , ”
78627	78656	78617	78618	Professor Lupin	195	“ For a thirteen - year - old wizard , even an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement . You are n’t passing out anymore , are you ? ”
78657	78671	78673	78673	Harry	117	“ I thought a Patronus would — charge the dementors down or something , ”
78676	78681	78673	78673	Harry	117	“ Make them disappear — ”
78682	78690	78692	78692	Lupin	195	“ The true Patronus does do that , ”
78694	78741	78692	78692	Lupin	195	“ But you ’ve achieved a great deal in a very short space of time . If the dementors put in an appearance at your next Quidditch match , you will be able to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the ground . ”
78742	78755	78757	78757	Harry	117	“ You said it ’s harder if there are loads of them , ”
78759	78767	78769	78769	Lupin	195	“ I have complete confidence in you , ”
78773	78796	78769	78769	Lupin	195	“ Here — you ’ve earned a drink — something from the Three Broomsticks . You wo n’t have tried it before — ”
78806	78809	78811	78811	Harry	117	“ Butterbeer ! ”
78816	78824	78811	78811	Harry	117	“ Yeah , I like that stuff ! ”
78830	78843	78844	78844	Harry	117	“ Oh — Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade , ”
78848	78852	78854	78854	Lupin	195	“ I see , ”
78863	78890	78891	78891	he	195	“ Well — let ’s drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw ! Not that I ’m supposed to take sides , as a teacher ... , ”
78914	78923	78903	78903	Harry	117	“ What ’s under a dementor ’s hood ? ”
78931	78967	78924	78925	Professor Lupin	195	“ Hmmm ... well , the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us . You see , the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon . ”
78968	78973	78924	78925	Professor Lupin	195	“ What ’s that ? ”
78974	78983	78985	78985	Lupin	195	“ They call it the Dementor ’s Kiss , ”
78993	79038	78985	78985	Lupin	195	“ It ’s what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly . I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there , because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and — and suck out his soul . ”
79048	79055	78924	78925	Professor Lupin	195	“ What — they kill — ? ”
79056	79060	79062	79062	Lupin	195	“ Oh no , ”
79064	79137	79062	79062	Lupin	195	“ Much worse than that . You can exist without your soul , you know , as long as your brain and heart are still working . But you ’ll have no sense of self anymore , no memory , no ... anything . There ’s no chance at all of recovery . You ’ll just — exist . As an empty shell . And your soul is gone forever ... lost . ”
79148	79182	79138	79138	Lupin	195	“ It ’s the fate that awaits Sirius Black . It was in the Daily Prophet this morning . The Ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find him . ”
79210	79215	79216	79216	he	117	“ He deserves it , ”
79220	79225	79227	79227	Lupin	195	“ You think so ? ”
79230	79239	79227	79227	Lupin	195	“ Do you really think anyone deserves that ? ”
79240	79243	79245	79245	Harry	117	“ Yes , ”
79248	79255	79245	79245	Harry	117	“ For ... for some things ... ”
79386	79396	79463	79463	She	199	“ Do watch where you ’re going , Potter ! ”
79397	79402	79463	79463	She	199	“ Sorry , Professor — ”
79403	79457	79463	79463	She	199	“ I ’ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room . Well , here it is , we ’ve done everything we could think of , and there does n’t seem to be anything wrong with it at all . You ’ve got a very good friend somewhere , Potter ... ”
79478	79485	79486	79486	Harry	117	“ I can have it back ? ”
79490	79493	79486	79486	Harry	117	“ Seriously ? ”
79494	79497	79503	79503	she	199	“ Seriously , ”
79508	79570	79503	79503	she	199	“ I daresay you ’ll need to get the feel of it before Saturday ’s match , wo n’t you ? And Potter — do try and win , wo n’t you ? Or we ’ll be out of the running for the eighth year in a row , as Professor Snape was kind enough to remind me only last night ... ”
79602	79624	79591	79591	Ron	147	“ She gave it to you ? Excellent ! Listen , can I still have a go on it ? Tomorrow ? ”
79625	79631	79633	79633	Harry	117	“ Yeah ... anything ... , ”
79646	79665	79633	79633	Harry	117	“ You know what — we should make up with Hermione ... She was only trying to help ... ”
79666	79672	79674	79674	Ron	147	“ Yeah , all right , ”
79676	79691	79674	79674	Ron	147	“ She ’s in the common room now — working , for a change — ”
79718	79724	79725	79725	Neville	168	“ I wrote them down ! ”
79730	79739	79725	79725	Neville	168	“ But I must ’ve dropped them somewhere ! ”
79740	79745	79747	79748	Sir Cadogan	217	“ A likely tale ! ”
79757	79784	79755	79755	Ron	147	“ Good even , my fine young yeomen ! Come clap this loon in irons . He is trying to force entry to the chambers within ! ”
79785	79791	79793	79793	Ron	147	“ Oh , shut up , ”
79803	79810	79811	79811	Neville	168	“ I ’ve lost the passwords ! ”
79816	79851	79811	79811	Neville	168	“ I made him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week , because he keeps changing them , and now I do n’t know what I ’ve done with them ! ”
79852	79855	79857	79857	Harry	117	“ Oddsbodikins , ”
79904	79913	79811	79811	Neville	168	“ Where ’d you get it , Harry ? ”
79914	79923	79898	79898	people	2759	“ Will you let me have a go ? ”
79924	79933	79811	79811	Neville	168	“ Have you ridden it yet , Harry ? ”
79934	79947	79898	79898	people	2759	“ Ravenclaw’ll have no chance , they ’re all on Cleansweep Sevens ! ”
79948	79957	79811	79811	Neville	168	“ Can I just hold it , Harry ? ”
80026	80032	80034	80034	Harry	117	“ I got it back , ”
80045	80058	80060	80060	Ron	147	“ See , Hermione ? There was n’t anything wrong with it ! ”
80062	80070	80072	80072	Hermione	313	“ Well — there might have been ! ”
80074	80088	80072	80072	Hermione	313	“ I mean , at least you know now that it ’s safe ! ”
80089	80096	80098	80098	Harry	117	“ Yeah , I suppose so , ”
80100	80108	80098	80098	Harry	117	“ I ’d better put it upstairs — ”
80109	80115	80117	80117	Ron	147	“ I ’ll take it ! ”
80120	80131	80117	80117	Ron	147	“ I ’ve got to give Scabbers his rat tonic . ”
80157	80165	80166	80166	Harry	117	“ Can I sit down , then ? ”
80170	80175	80177	80177	Hermione	313	“ I suppose so , ”
80218	80224	80189	80189	Harry	117	“ Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity ”
80238	80248	80249	80249	Harry	117	“ How are you getting through all this stuff ? ”
80253	80264	80266	80266	Hermione	313	“ Oh , well — you know — working hard , ”
80283	80295	80296	80296	Harry	117	“ Why do n’t you just drop a couple of subjects ? ”
80311	80318	80320	80320	Hermione	313	“ I could n’t do that ! ”
80325	80330	80332	80332	Harry	117	“ Arithmancy looks terrible , ”
80344	80352	80354	80354	Hermione	313	“ Oh no , it ’s wonderful ! ”
80357	80367	80354	80354	Hermione	313	“ It ’s my favorite subject ! It ’s — ”
80435	80438	80439	80439	he	147	“ LOOK ! ”
80449	80452	80453	80453	he	147	“ LOOK ! ”
80463	80469	80453	80453	he	147	“ Ron , what — ? ”
80470	80477	80439	80439	he	147	“ SCABBERS ! LOOK ! SCABBERS ! ”
80512	80515	80516	80516	Ron	147	“ BLOOD ! ”
80523	80537	80516	80516	Ron	147	“ HE ’S GONE ! AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR ? ”
80538	80543	80545	80545	Hermione	313	“ N - no , ”
80754	80766	80767	80767	she	313	“ Okay , side with Ron , I knew you would ! ”
80771	80805	80767	80767	she	313	“ First the Firebolt , now Scabbers , everything ’s my fault , is n’t it ! Just leave me alone , Harry , I ’ve got a lot of work to do ! ”
80818	80833	80835	80835	Fred	144	“ Come on , Ron , you were always saying how boring Scabbers was , ”
80838	80876	80835	80835	Fred	144	“ And he ’s been off - color for ages , he was wasting away . It was probably better for him to snuff it quickly — one swallow — he probably did n’t feel a thing . ”
80877	80880	80882	80882	Ginny	140	“ Fred ! ”
80885	80901	80903	80903	George	145	“ All he did was eat and sleep , Ron , you said it yourself , ”
80905	80913	80914	80914	Ron	147	“ He bit Goyle for us once ! ”
80918	80923	80914	80914	Ron	147	“ Remember , Harry ? ”
80924	80931	80933	80933	Harry	117	“ Yeah , that ’s true , ”
80935	80940	80942	80942	Fred	144	“ His finest hour , ”
80951	80993	80942	80942	Fred	144	“ Let the scar on Goyle ’s finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory . Oh , come on , Ron , get yourself down to Hogsmeade and buy a new rat , what ’s the point of moaning ? ”
81052	81066	81107	81107	She	270	“ Great ! Can I try and shoot a few goals on it ? ”
81125	81210	81107	81107	She	270	“ Look at the balance on it ! If the Nimbus series has a fault , it ’s a slight list to the tail end — you often find they develop a drag after a few years . They ’ve updated the handle too , a bit slimmer than the Cleansweeps , reminds me of the old Silver Arrows — a pity they ’ve stopped making them . I learned to fly on one , and a very fine old broom it was too ... ”
81224	81245	81221	81221	Wood	247	“ Er — Madam Hooch ? Is it okay if Harry has the Firebolt back ? We need to practice ... ”
81246	81259	81261	81262	Madam Hooch	270	“ Oh — right — here you are , then , Potter , ”
81264	81273	81261	81262	Madam Hooch	270	“ I ’ll sit over here with Weasley ... ”
81302	81351	81352	81352	Wood	247	“ Harry , I ’ve just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker . It ’s Cho Chang . She ’s a fourth year , and she ’s pretty good ... I really hoped she would n’t be fit , she ’s had some problems with injuries ... ”
81368	81394	81395	81395	He	247	“ On the other hand , she rides a Comet Two Sixty , which is going to look like a joke next to the Firebolt . ”
81409	81418	81395	81395	He	247	“ Okay , everyone , let ’s go — ”
81524	81534	81535	81535	Wood	247	“ Harry , I ’m letting the Snitch out ! ”
81685	81698	81700	81700	Wood	247	“ I ca n’t see what ’s going to stop us tomorrow ! ”
81702	81720	81700	81700	Wood	247	“ Not unless — Harry , you ’ve sorted out your dementor problem , have n’t you ? ”
81721	81724	81726	81726	Harry	117	“ Yeah , ”
81739	81754	81756	81756	Fred	144	“ The dementors wo n’t turn up again , Oliver . Dumbledore’d go ballistic , ”
81759	81767	81769	81769	Wood	247	“ Well , let ’s hope not , ”
81771	81791	81769	81769	Wood	247	“ Anyway — good work , everyone . Let ’s get back to the tower ... turn in early — ”
81792	81809	81810	81810	Harry	117	“ I ’m staying out for a bit ; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt , ”
81856	81861	81863	81863	Harry	117	“ Here you go , ”
82011	82017	82019	82019	Ron	147	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
82032	82035	82024	82024	Ron	147	“ Lumos ! ”
82068	82074	82075	82075	Ron	147	“ Get out of here ! ”
82111	82114	82115	82115	Ron	147	“ See ? ”
82125	82148	82115	82115	Ron	147	“ She ’s still letting him wander about wherever he wants — probably washing down Scabbers with a couple of birds now ... ”
82301	82308	82310	82310	Ron	147	“ Did you see his face ? ”
82318	82329	82310	82310	Ron	147	“ He ca n’t believe it ! This is brilliant ! ”
82344	82351	82352	82352	he	147	“ Put it here , Harry , ”
82425	82435	82440	82440	she	1820	“ Now , now , Penny , no sabotage ! ”
82446	82456	82457	82457	he	143	“ Penelope and I have got a bet on , ”
82462	82472	82457	82457	he	143	“ Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match ! ”
82490	82498	82500	82500	Percy	143	“ Harry — make sure you win , ”
82507	82523	82500	82500	Percy	143	“ I have n’t got ten Galleons . Yes , I ’m coming , Penny ! ”
82537	82547	82564	82564	Crabbe	201	“ Sure you can manage that broom , Potter ? ”
82571	82577	82579	82579	Harry	117	“ Yeah , reckon so , ”
82582	82593	82595	82595	Malfoy	200	“ Got plenty of special features , has n’t it ? ”
82601	82620	82595	82595	Malfoy	200	“ Shame it does n’t come with a parachute — in case you get too near a dementor . ”
82626	82640	82642	82642	Harry	117	“ Pity you ca n’t attach an extra arm to yours , Malfoy , ”
82644	82654	82642	82642	Harry	117	“ Then it could catch the Snitch for you . ”
82842	82852	82854	82854	Wood	247	“ You know what we ’ve got to do , ”
82864	82895	82854	82854	Wood	247	“ If we lose this match , we ’re out of the running . Just — just fly like you did in practice yesterday , and we ’ll be okay ! ”
83004	83012	83013	83014	Madam Hooch	270	“ Wood , Davies , shake hands , ”
83027	83042	83019	83019	Wood	247	“ Mount your brooms ... on my whistle ... three — two — one — ”
83095	83143	83061	83061	he	117	“ They ’re off , and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor . According to Which Broomstick , the Firebolt ’s going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this year ’s World Championship — ”
83144	83160	83162	83163	Professor McGonagall	199	“ Jordan , would you mind telling us what ’s going on in the match ? ”
83167	83197	83061	83061	he	117	“ Right you are , Professor — just giving a bit of background information — the Firebolt , incidentally , has a built - in auto - brake and — ”
83198	83201	83254	83254	she	250	“ Jordan ! ”
83202	83219	83061	83061	he	117	“ Okay , okay , Gryffindor in possession , Katie Bell of Gryffindor heading for goal ... ”
83266	83274	83275	83275	Fred	144	“ Show her your acceleration , Harry ! ”
83430	83432	83385	83386	a Bludger	1443	“ Ooooooh ”
83480	83533	83454	83454	his	1852	“ Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero , and look at that Firebolt go ! Potter ’s really putting it through its paces now , see it turn — Chang ’s Comet is just no match for it , the Firebolt ’s precision - balance is really noticeable in these long — ”
83534	83551	83454	83454	his	1852	“ JORDAN ! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS ? GET ON WITH THE COMMENTARY ! ”
83644	83656	83657	83657	Wood	247	“ HARRY , THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN ! ”
83667	83678	83657	83657	Wood	247	“ KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO ! ”
83848	83851	83853	83853	Cho	324	“ Oh ! ”
83905	83909	83897	83897	he	117	“ Expecto Patronum ! ”
84034	84040	84041	84041	Wood	247	“ That ’s my boy ! ”
84129	84132	84133	84133	Ron	147	“ Yes ! ”
84144	84149	84133	84133	Ron	147	“ Yes ! Yes ! ”
84150	84156	84158	84158	Percy	143	“ Well done , Harry ! ”
84163	84176	84158	84158	Percy	143	“ Ten Galleons to me ! Must find Penelope , excuse me — ”
84177	84184	84186	84187	Seamus Finnigan	184	“ Good for you , Harry ! ”
84189	84193	84195	84195	Hagrid	305	“ Ruddy brilliant ! ”
84204	84211	84158	84158	Percy	143	“ That was quite some Patronus , ”
84235	84245	84246	84246	Harry	117	“ The dementors did n’t affect me at all ! ”
84250	84258	84246	84246	Harry	117	“ I did n’t feel a thing ! ”
84259	84272	84274	84275	Professor Lupin	195	“ That would be because they — er — were n’t dementors , ”
84277	84282	84274	84275	Professor Lupin	195	“ Come and see — ”
84302	84311	84313	84313	Lupin	195	“ You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright , ”
84387	84392	84393	84393	she	1875	“ An unworthy trick ! ”
84397	84442	84393	84393	she	1875	“ A low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker ! Detention for all of you , and fifty points from Slytherin ! I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore about this , make no mistake ! Ah , here he comes now ! ”
84496	84502	84504	84504	George	145	“ Come on , Harry ! ”
84511	84520	84504	84504	George	145	“ Party ! Gryffindor common room , now ! ”
84521	84524	84526	84526	Harry	117	“ Right , ”
84619	84626	84628	84629	Angelina Johnson	249	“ How did you do that ? ”
84640	84655	84656	84656	Fred	144	“ With a little help from Moony , Wormtail , Padfoot , and Prongs , ”
84720	84729	84730	84730	he	117	“ Did you even come to the match ? ”
84734	84740	84742	84742	Hermione	313	“ Of course I did , ”
84755	84781	84742	84742	Hermione	313	“ And I ’m very glad we won , and I think you did really well , but I need to read this by Monday . ”
84782	84794	84795	84795	Harry	117	“ Come on , Hermione , come and have some food , ”
84817	84838	84840	84840	Hermione	313	“ I ca n’t , Harry . I ’ve still got four hundred and twenty - two pages to read ! ”
84847	84850	84840	84840	Hermione	313	“ Anyway ... ”
84858	84868	84851	84851	She	313	“ He does n’t want me to join in . ”
84885	84911	84877	84877	Ron	147	“ If Scabbers had n’t just been eaten , he could have had some of those Fudge Flies . He used to really like them — ”
84953	84962	84963	84963	Harry	117	“ Ca n’t you give her a break ? ”
84968	84971	84973	84973	Ron	147	“ No , ”
84976	85010	84973	84973	Ron	147	“ If she just acted like she was sorry — but she ’ll never admit she ’s wrong , Hermione . She ’s still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation or something . ”
85207	85212	85198	85198	he	117	“ AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH ! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ! ”
85259	85265	85247	85248	Seamus Finnigan	184	“ What ’s going on ? ”
85324	85334	85321	85321	his	147	“ Black ! Sirius Black ! With a knife ! ”
85335	85338	85301	85301	Ron	147	“ What ? ”
85339	85353	85321	85321	his	147	“ Here ! Just now ! Slashed the curtains ! Woke me up ! ”
85354	85364	85366	85366	Dean	178	“ You sure you were n’t dreaming , Ron ? ”
85368	85382	85321	85321	his	147	“ Look at the curtains ! I tell you , he was here ! ”
85417	85421	85321	85321	his	147	“ Who shouted ? ”
85422	85428	85321	85321	his	147	“ What ’re you doing ? ”
85455	85466	85321	85321	his	147	“ Are you sure you were n’t dreaming , Ron ? ”
85467	85477	85321	85321	his	147	“ I ’m telling you , I saw him ! ”
85478	85485	85321	85321	his	147	“ What ’s all the noise ? ”
85486	85496	85321	85321	his	147	“ Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed ! ”
85522	85530	85532	85533	Fred Weasley	144	“ Excellent , are we carrying on ? ”
85536	85541	85543	85543	Percy	143	“ Everyone back upstairs ! ”
85563	85569	85571	85571	Ron	147	“ Perce — Sirius Black ! ”
85574	85587	85571	85571	Ron	147	“ In our dormitory ! With a knife ! Woke me up ! ”
85595	85598	85600	85600	Percy	143	“ Nonsense ! ”
85605	85619	85600	85600	Percy	143	“ You had too much to eat , Ron — had a nightmare — ”
85620	85626	85649	85649	she	199	“ I ’m telling you — ”
85627	85636	85600	85600	Percy	143	“ Now , really , enough ’s enough ! ”
85659	85683	85642	85642	She	199	“ I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match , but this is getting ridiculous ! Percy , I expected better of you ! ”
85684	85694	85696	85696	Percy	143	“ I certainly did n’t authorize this , Professor ! ”
85703	85724	85699	85699	himself	143	“ I was just telling them all to get back to bed ! My brother Ron here had a nightmare — ”
85725	85731	85732	85732	Ron	147	“ IT WASN’T A NIGHTMARE ! ”
85735	85754	85732	85732	Ron	147	“ PROFESSOR , I WOKE UP , AND SIRIUS BLACK WAS STANDING OVER ME , HOLDING A KNIFE ! ”
85761	85780	85759	85759	him	147	“ Do n’t be ridiculous , Weasley , how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait hole ? ”
85781	85785	85787	85787	Ron	147	“ Ask him ! ”
85802	85809	85787	85787	Ron	147	“ Ask him if he saw — ”
85835	85849	85759	85759	him	147	“ Sir Cadogan , did you just let a man enter Gryffindor Tower ? ”
85850	85856	85858	85859	Sir Cadogan	217	“ Certainly , good lady ! ”
85875	85881	85883	85884	Professor McGonagall	199	“ You — you did ? ”
85886	85893	85883	85884	Professor McGonagall	199	“ But — but the password ! ”
85894	85899	85901	85902	Sir Cadogan	217	“ He had ’em ! ”
85905	85924	85901	85902	Sir Cadogan	217	“ Had the whole week ’s , my lady ! Read ’em off a little piece of paper ! ”
85946	85950	85951	85951	she	199	“ Which person , ”
85958	85975	85954	85954	her	199	“ which abysmally foolish person wrote down this week ’s passwords and left them lying around ? ”
86269	86277	86278	86278	Harry	117	“ D’you reckon we should tell someone ? ”
86282	86293	86295	86295	Ron	147	“ We know he ’s not coming in through Honeydukes , ”
86298	86311	86295	86295	Ron	147	“ We ’d ’ve heard if the shop had been broken into . ”
86408	86513	86390	86390	he	147	“ . . . I was asleep , and I heard this ripping noise , and I thought it was in my dream , you know ? But then there was this draft ... I woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down ... I rolled over ... and I saw him standing over me ... like a skeleton , with loads of filthy hair ... holding this great long knife , must ’ve been twelve inches ... and he looked at me , and I looked at him , and then I yelled , and he scampered .
86514	86519	86520	86520	Ron	147	“ Why , though ? ”
86542	86548	86520	86520	Ron	147	“ Why did he run ? ”
86607	86632	86634	86634	Harry	117	“ He must ’ve known he ’d have a job getting back out of the castle once you ’d yelled and woken people up , ”
86637	86663	86634	86634	Harry	117	“ He ’d ’ve had to kill the whole House to get back through the portrait hole ... then he would ’ve met the teachers ... ”
86846	86853	86854	86854	Ron	147	“ Run for it , Neville , ”
86966	86975	86954	86954	Hedwig	130	“ Ouch ! Oh — thanks , Hedwig . ”
87044	87054	87056	87056	Ron	147	“ He probably wants to hear all about Black ! ”
87095	87101	87103	87103	Ron	147	“ All right , Hagrid ! ”
87105	87118	87103	87103	Ron	147	“ S’pose you want to hear about Saturday night , do you ? ”
87119	87129	87131	87131	Hagrid	305	“ I ’ve already heard all abou ’ it , ”
87142	87145	87147	87147	Ron	147	“ Oh , ”
87232	87240	87242	87242	Harry	117	“ What are they for , Hagrid ? ”
87244	87259	87261	87261	Hagrid	305	“ Buckbeak ’s case against the Committee fer the Disposal o ’ Dangerous Creatures , ”
87263	87288	87261	87261	Hagrid	305	“ This Friday . Him an ’ me’ll be goin’ down ter London together . I ’ve booked two beds on the Knight Bus ... ”
87384	87394	87396	87396	Hagrid	305	“ I got somethin’ ter discuss with you two , ”
87407	87410	87412	87412	Harry	117	“ What ? ”
87414	87417	87419	87419	Hagrid	305	“ Hermione , ”
87421	87426	87428	87428	Ron	147	“ What about her ? ”
87430	87487	87509	87509	Hagrid	305	“ She ’s in a righ ’ state , that ’s what . She ’s bin comin ’ down ter visit me a lot since Chris’mas . Bin feelin ’ lonely . Firs ’ yeh weren ’ talking to her because o ’ the Firebolt , now yer not talkin ’ to her because her cat — ”
87488	87493	87494	87494	Ron	147	“ — ate Scabbers ! ”
87498	87508	87509	87509	Hagrid	305	“ Because her cat acted like all cats do , ”
87513	87588	87509	87509	Hagrid	305	“ She ’s cried a fair few times , yeh know . Goin’ through a rough time at the moment . Bitten off more’n she can chew , if yeh ask me , all the work she ’s tryin ’ ter do . Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak ’s case , mind ... She ’s found some really good stuff fer me ... reckon he ’ll stand a good chance now ... ”
87589	87601	87602	87602	Harry	117	“ Hagrid , we should ’ve helped as well — sorry — ”
87606	87614	87616	87616	Hagrid	305	“ I ’m not blamin ’ yeh ! ”
87624	87677	87616	87616	Hagrid	305	“ Gawd knows yeh’ve had enough ter be gettin ’ on with . I ’ve seen yeh practicin ’ Quidditch ev’ry hour o ’ the day an ’ night — but I got ta tell yeh , I thought you two’d value yer friend more’n broomsticks or rats . Tha ’s all . ”
87685	87723	87795	87795	him	305	“ Really upset , she was , when Black nearly stabbed yeh , Ron . She ’s got her heart in the right place , Hermione has , an ’ you two not talkin ’ to her — ”
87724	87742	87743	87743	Ron	147	“ If she ’d just get rid of that cat , I ’d speak to her again ! ”
87747	87772	87743	87743	Ron	147	“ But she ’s still sticking up for it ! It ’s a maniac , and she wo n’t hear a word against it ! ”
87773	87789	87791	87791	Hagrid	305	“ Ah , well , people can be a bit stupid abou ’ their pets , ”
87857	87863	87865	87865	Ron	147	“ Hogsmeade , next weekend ! ”
87877	87882	87883	87883	he	147	“ What d’you reckon ? ”
87895	87909	87910	87910	Harry	117	“ Well , Filch has n’t done anything about the passage into Honeydukes ... ”
87917	87920	87883	87883	he	147	“ Harry ! ”
87961	87980	87982	87982	Hermione	313	“ Harry , if you go into Hogsmeade again ... I ’ll tell Professor McGonagall about that map ! ”
87984	87993	87995	87995	Ron	147	“ Can you hear someone talking , Harry ? ”
88002	88031	88059	88059	Hermione	313	“ Ron , how can you let him go with you ? After what Sirius Black nearly did to you ! I mean it , I ’ll tell — ”
88032	88043	88045	88045	Ron	147	“ So now you ’re trying to get Harry expelled ! ”
88048	88058	88045	88045	Ron	147	“ Have n’t you done enough damage this year ? ”
88104	88110	88111	88111	Ron	147	“ So how about it ? ”
88123	88147	88111	88111	Ron	147	“ Come on , last time we went you did n’t see anything . You have n’t even been inside Zonko ’s yet ! ”
88161	88164	88165	88165	he	117	“ Okay , ”
88168	88179	88165	88165	he	117	“ But I ’m taking the Invisibility Cloak this time . ”

88371	88384	88365	88365	Neville	168	“ Harry ! I forgot you were n’t going to Hogsmeade either ! ”
88385	88390	88392	88392	Harry	117	“ Hi , Neville , ”
88409	88416	88392	88392	Harry	117	“ What are you up to ? ”
88417	88420	88422	88422	Neville	168	“ Nothing , ”
88424	88432	88422	88422	Neville	168	“ Want a game of Exploding Snap ? ”
88433	88455	88392	88392	Harry	117	“ Er — not now — I was going to go to the library and do that vampire essay for Lupin — ”
88456	88463	88465	88465	Neville	168	“ I ’ll come with you ! ”
88468	88476	88465	88465	Neville	168	“ I have n’t done it either ! ”
88477	88494	88392	88392	Harry	117	“ Er — hang on — yeah , I forgot , I finished it last night ! ”
88495	88503	88505	88505	Neville	168	“ Great , you can help me ! ”
88512	88534	88505	88505	Neville	168	“ I do n’t understand that thing about the garlic at all — do they have to eat it , or — ”
88561	88570	88572	88572	Snape	260	“ And what are you two doing here ? ”
88586	88593	88572	88572	Snape	260	“ An odd place to meet — ”
88623	88631	88633	88633	Harry	117	“ We ’re not — meeting here , ”
88635	88642	88633	88633	Harry	117	“ We just — met here . ”
88643	88646	88648	88648	Snape	260	“ Indeed ? ”
88650	88689	88648	88648	Snape	260	“ You have a habit of turning up in unexpected places , Potter , and you are very rarely there for no reason ... I suggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower , where you belong . ”
88892	88897	88898	88898	he	117	“ It ’s me , ”
88901	88906	88907	88907	Ron	147	“ What kept you ? ”
88910	88916	88907	88907	Ron	147	“ Snape was hanging around ... ”
88925	88930	88931	88931	Ron	147	“ Where are you ? ”
88942	88952	88939	88939	his	147	“ Are you still there ? This feels weird ... ”

89201	89209	89211	89211	Ron	147	“ Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it , ”
89224	89264	89211	89211	Ron	147	“ I asked Nearly Headless Nick ... he says he ’s heard a very rough crowd lives here . No one can get in . Fred and George tried , obviously , but all the entrances are sealed shut ... ”
89322	89361	89318	89318	Malfoy	306	“ . . . should have an owl from Father any time now . He had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm ... about how I could n’t use it for three months ... ”
89367	89407	89364	89364	Goyle	202	“ I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself ... ‘ There ’s no ’ arm in ’ i m , ’ onest — ’ ... that hippogriff ’s as good as dead — ”
89424	89432	89415	89415	His	147	“ What are you doing , Weasley ? ”
89443	89479	89433	89433	Malfoy	306	“ Suppose you ’d love to live here , would n’t you , Weasley ? Dreaming about having your own bedroom ? I heard your family all sleep in one room — is that true ? ”
89496	89502	89503	89503	he	117	“ Leave him to me , ”
89545	89554	89555	89555	Malfoy	306	“ We were just discussing your friend Hagrid , ”
89560	89592	89555	89555	Malfoy	306	“ Just trying to imagine what he ’s saying to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures . D’you think he ’ll cry when they cut off his hippogriff ’s — ”
89617	89622	89643	89643	Crabbe	201	“ What the — ? ”
89665	89674	89657	89657	Malfoy	306	“ What was that ? Who did that ? ”
89675	89685	89687	89687	Ron	147	“ Very haunted up here , is n’t it ? ”
89774	89781	89786	89786	his	306	“ It came from over there ! ”
89922	89925	89926	89926	he	306	“ AAARGH ! ”
89970	89973	89974	89974	Ron	147	“ Harry ! ”
89990	90014	89974	89974	Ron	147	“ you ’d better run for it ! If Malfoy tells anyone — you ’d better get back to the castle , quick — ”
90015	90020	90022	90022	Harry	117	“ See you later , ”
90287	90290	90291	90291	he	260	“ So , ”
90330	90337	90339	90339	Snape	260	“ Come with me , Potter , ”
90431	90434	90436	90436	Snape	260	“ Sit , ”
90448	90464	90466	90466	Snape	260	“ Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story , Potter , ”
90474	90495	90468	90468	Harry	117	“ He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack when he ran into Weasley — apparently alone . ”
90503	90539	90556	90556	Snape	260	“ Mr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to Weasley , when a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head . How do you think that could have happened ? ”
90547	90555	90540	90540	Harry	117	“ I do n’t know , Professor . ”
90583	90603	90540	90540	Harry	117	“ Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition . Can you imagine what it might have been , Potter ? ”
90604	90607	90609	90609	Harry	117	“ No , ”
90618	90630	90540	90540	Harry	117	“ It was your head , Potter . Floating in midair . ”
90637	90647	90649	90649	Harry	117	“ Maybe he ’d better go to Madam Pomfrey , ”
90651	90659	90649	90649	Harry	117	“ If he ’s seeing things like — ”
90660	90673	90675	90675	Snape	260	“ What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade , Potter ? ”
90678	90699	90675	90675	Snape	260	“ Your head is not allowed in Hogsmeade . No part of your body has permission to be in Hogsmeade . ”
90700	90705	90707	90707	Harry	117	“ I know that , ”
90720	90729	90707	90707	Harry	117	“ It sounds like Malfoy ’s having hallucin — ”
90730	90737	90739	90739	Snape	260	“ Malfoy is not having hallucinations , ”
90765	90780	90742	90742	he	260	“ If your head was in Hogsmeade , so was the rest of you . ”
90781	90790	90792	90792	Harry	117	“ I ’ve been up in Gryffindor Tower , ”
90794	90799	90792	90792	Harry	117	“ Like you told — ”
90800	90806	90742	90742	he	260	“ Can anyone confirm that ? ”
90823	90826	90827	90827	he	260	“ So , ”
90834	90890	90827	90827	he	260	“ Everyone from the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black . But famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself . Let the ordinary people worry about his safety ! Famous Harry Potter goes where he wants to , with no thought for the consequences . ”
90921	90932	90933	90933	Snape	260	“ How extraordinarily like your father you are , Potter , ”
90941	90988	90933	90933	Snape	260	“ He too was exceedingly arrogant . A small amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too . Strutting around the place with his friends and admirers ... The resemblance between you is uncanny . ”
90989	90996	90998	90998	Harry	117	“ My dad did n’t strut , ”
91006	91011	90998	90998	Harry	117	“ And neither do I. ”
91012	91024	91025	91025	Snape	260	“ Your father did n’t set much store by rules either , ”
91040	91059	91025	91025	Snape	260	“ Rules were for lesser mortals , not Quidditch Cup - winners . His head was so swollen — ”
91060	91064	91033	91033	his	260	“ SHUT UP ! ”
91109	91119	91096	91096	Snape	260	“ What did you say to me , Potter ? ”
91120	91131	91132	91132	Harry	117	“ I told you to shut up about my dad ! ”
91135	91167	91132	91132	Harry	117	“ I know the truth , all right ? He saved your life ! Dumbledore told me ! You would n’t even be here if it was n’t for my dad ! ”
91180	91197	91198	91198	he	260	“ And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life ? ”
91201	91217	91198	91198	he	260	“ Or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious Potter ’s delicate ears ? ”
91247	91266	91267	91267	he	260	“ I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father , Potter , ”
91277	91360	91267	91267	he	260	“ Have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism ? Then let me correct you — your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father had n’t got cold feet at the last moment . There was nothing brave about what he did . He was saving his own skin as much as mine . Had their joke succeeded , he would have been expelled from Hogwarts . ”
91370	91378	91379	91379	he	260	“ Turn out your pockets , Potter ! ”
91396	91416	91361	91361	Snape	260	“ Turn out your pockets , or we go straight to the headmaster ! Pull them out , Potter ! ”
91445	91452	91454	91454	Harry	117	“ Ron gave them to me , ”
91471	91482	91467	91467	Snape	260	“ He — brought them back from Hogsmeade last time — ”
91483	91505	91506	91506	Snape	260	“ Indeed ? And you ’ve been carrying them around ever since ? How very touching ... and what is this ? ”
91525	91531	91532	91532	he	117	“ Spare bit of parchment , ”
91548	91562	91563	91563	he	260	“ Surely you do n’t need such a very old piece of parchment ? ”
91566	91577	91563	91563	he	260	“ Why do n’t I just — throw this away ? ”
91585	91588	91589	91589	Harry	117	“ No ! ”
91593	91596	91598	91598	Snape	260	“ So ! ”
91605	91644	91600	91600	his	260	“ Is this another treasured gift from Mr. Weasley ? Or is it — something else ? A letter , perhaps , written in invisible ink ? Or — instructions to get into Hogsmeade without passing the dementors ? ”
91653	91663	91664	91664	he	260	“ Let me see , let me see ... , ”
91680	91685	91686	91686	he	260	“ Reveal your secret ! ”
91709	91713	91714	91714	Snape	260	“ Show yourself ! ”
91734	91753	91754	91754	Snape	260	“ Professor Severus Snape , master of this school , commands you to yield the information you conceal ! ”
91784	91810	91761	91761	his	260	“ Mr. Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape , and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people ’s business . ”
91839	91860	91811	91811	Snape	260	“ Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony , and would like to add that Professor Snape is an ugly git . ”
91881	91900	91968	91968	He	260	“ Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor . ”
91922	91942	91968	91968	He	260	“ Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day , and advises him to wash his hair , the slimeball . ”
91951	91955	91957	91957	Snape	260	“ So ... , ”
91960	91967	91957	91957	Snape	260	“ We ’ll see about this ... ”
91995	91998	91999	91999	Snape	260	“ Lupin ! ”
92005	92011	91999	91999	Snape	260	“ I want a word ! ”
92052	92058	92060	92060	Lupin	195	“ You called , Severus ? ”
92063	92068	92070	92070	Snape	260	“ I certainly did , ”
92085	92101	92070	92070	Snape	260	“ I have just asked Potter to empty his pockets . He was carrying this . ”
92137	92140	92142	92142	Snape	260	“ Well ? ”
92165	92168	92170	92170	Snape	260	“ Well ? ”
92173	92205	92170	92170	Snape	260	“ This parchment is plainly full of Dark Magic . This is supposed to be your area of expertise , Lupin . Where do you imagine Potter got such a thing ? ”
92228	92234	92235	92235	he	195	“ Full of Dark Magic ? ”
92239	92285	92235	92235	he	195	“ Do you really think so , Severus ? It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it . Childish , but surely not dangerous ? I imagine Harry got it from a joke shop — ”
92286	92289	92291	92291	Snape	260	“ Indeed ? ”
92301	92331	92293	92293	His	260	“ You think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing ? You do n’t think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers ? ”
92349	92362	92363	92363	he	195	“ You mean , by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people ? ”
92366	92377	92363	92363	he	195	“ Harry , do you know any of these men ? ”
92378	92381	92383	92383	Harry	117	“ No , ”
92386	92392	92394	92394	Lupin	195	“ You see , Severus ? ”
92401	92411	92394	92394	Lupin	195	“ It looks like a Zonko product to me — ”
92450	92461	92462	92462	he	147	“ I — gave — Harry — that — stuff , ”
92465	92478	92462	92462	he	147	“ Bought — it ... in Zonko ’s ... ages — ago ... ”
92479	92482	92484	92484	Lupin	195	“ Well ! ”
92495	92514	92515	92515	He	195	“ That seems to clear that up ! Severus , I ’ll take this back , shall I ? ”
92526	92549	92515	92515	He	195	“ Harry , Ron , come with me , I need a word about my vampire essay — excuse us , Severus — ”
92587	92592	92616	92616	his	195	“ Professor , I — ”
92593	92602	92604	92604	Lupin	195	“ I do n’t want to hear explanations , ”
92619	92645	92646	92646	he	195	“ I happen to know that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago . Yes , I know it ’s a map , ”
92655	92712	92646	92646	he	195	“ I do n’t want to know how it fell into your possession . I am , however , astounded that you did n’t hand it in . Particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around . And I ca n’t let you have it back , Harry . ”
92727	92740	92793	92793	He	195	“ Why did Snape think I ’d got it from the manufacturers ? ”
92741	92745	92746	92746	Lupin	195	“ Because ... , ”
92749	92770	92746	92746	Lupin	195	“ because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school . They ’d think it extremely entertaining . ”
92771	92777	92779	92779	Harry	117	“ Do you know them ? ”
92783	92788	92789	92789	he	195	“ We ’ve met , ”
92804	92883	92884	92884	He	195	“ Do n’t expect me to cover up for you again , Harry . I can not make you take Sirius Black seriously . But I would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you . Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive , Harry . A poor way to repay them — gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks . ”
92946	92952	92954	92954	Ron	147	“ It ’s my fault , ”
92957	92979	92954	92954	Ron	147	“ I persuaded you to go . Lupin ’s right , it was stupid , we should n’t ’ve done it — ”
93027	93035	93037	93037	Ron	147	“ Come to have a good gloat ? ”
93047	93058	93037	93037	Ron	147	“ Or have you just been to tell on us ? ”
93059	93062	93064	93064	Hermione	313	“ No , ”
93080	93101	93066	93066	She	313	“ I just thought you ought to know ... Hagrid lost his case . Buckbeak is going to be executed . ”
93109	93117	93102	93102	He	2019	” Hermione said , holding out the letter .
93186	93193	93195	93195	Harry	117	“ They ca n’t do this , ”
93197	93207	93195	93195	Harry	117	“ They ca n’t . Buckbeak is n’t dangerous . ”
93208	93219	93221	93221	Hermione	313	“ Malfoy ’s dad ’s frightened the Committee into it , ”
93227	93274	93221	93221	Hermione	313	“ You know what he ’s like . They ’re a bunch of doddery old fools , and they were scared . There ’ll be an appeal , though , there always is . Only I ca n’t see any hope ... .Nothing will have changed . ”
93275	93281	93283	93283	Ron	147	“ Yeah , it will , ”
93286	93306	93283	93283	Ron	147	“ You wo n’t have to do all the work alone this time , Hermione . I ’ll help . ”
93307	93312	93221	93221	Hermione	313	“ Oh , Ron ! ”
93349	93363	93364	93364	she	313	“ Ron , I ’m really , really sorry about Scabbers ... . , ”
93367	93376	93378	93378	Ron	147	“ Oh — well — he was old , ”
93391	93413	93378	93378	Ron	147	“ And he was a bit useless . You never know , Mum and Dad might get me an owl now . ”
93471	93539	93462	93462	He	147	“ S’all my fault . Got all tongue - tied . They was all sittin ’ there in black robes an ’ I kep ’ droppin ’ me notes and forgettin ’ all them dates yeh looked up fer me , Hermione . An ’ then Lucius Malfoy stood up an ’ said his bit , and the Committee jus ’ did exac’ly what he told ’em ... ”
93540	93547	93549	93549	Ron	147	“ There ’s still the appeal ! ”
93552	93565	93549	93549	Ron	147	“ Do n’t give up yet , we ’re working on it ! ”
93603	93609	93611	93611	Hagrid	305	“ S’no good , Ron , ”
93620	93658	93611	93611	Hagrid	305	“ That Committee ’s in Lucius Malfoy ’s pocket . I ’m jus ’ gon na make sure the rest o ’ Beaky ’s time is the happiest he ’s ever had . I owe him that ... ”
93676	93682	93669	93669	his	305	“ Look at him blubber ! ”
93700	93710	93712	93712	Malfoy	306	“ Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic ? ”
93714	93724	93712	93712	Malfoy	306	“ And he ’s supposed to be our teacher ! ”
93778	93793	93774	93774	her	313	“ Do n’t you dare call Hagrid pathetic , you foul — you evil — ”
93794	93797	93799	93799	Ron	147	“ Hermione ! ”
93815	93821	93803	93803	he	147	“ Get off , Ron ! ”
93844	93848	93849	93849	Malfoy	306	“ C’m on , ”
93870	93873	93874	93874	Ron	147	“ Hermione ! ”
93884	93897	93898	93898	Hermione	313	“ Harry , you ’d better beat him in the Quidditch final ! ”
93902	93918	93898	93898	Hermione	313	“ You just better had , because I ca n’t stand it if Slytherin wins ! ”
93919	93926	93928	93928	Ron	147	“ We ’re due in Charms , ”
93935	93941	93928	93928	Ron	147	“ We ’d better go . ”
93954	93961	93963	93964	Professor Flitwick	208	“ You ’re late , boys ! ”
93973	93997	93967	93967	Harry	117	“ Come along , quickly , wands out , we ’re experimenting with Cheering Charms today , we ’ve already divided into pairs — ”
94018	94024	94013	94013	Ron	147	“ Where ’s Hermione gone ? ”
94054	94059	94061	94061	Harry	117	“ That ’s weird , ”
94067	94079	94061	94061	Harry	117	“ Maybe — maybe she went to the bathroom or something ? ”
94089	94102	94104	94104	Ron	147	“ She could ’ve done with a Cheering Charm on her too , ”
94169	94180	94181	94181	Ron	147	“ You do n’t think Malfoy did something to her ? ”
94205	94207	94199	94201	the Fat Lady	1307	“ Flibbertigibbet ”
94256	94261	94263	94263	Hermione	313	“ W - what ? ”
94274	94290	94263	94263	Hermione	313	“ Is it time to go ? W - which lesson have we got now ? ”
94291	94303	94305	94305	Harry	117	“ Divination , but it ’s not for another twenty minutes , ”
94307	94318	94305	94305	Harry	117	“ Hermione , why did n’t you come to Charms ? ”
94319	94325	94326	94326	Hermione	313	“ What ? Oh no ! ”
94329	94337	94326	94326	Hermione	313	“ I forgot to go to Charms ! ”
94338	94345	94347	94347	Harry	117	“ But how could you forget ? ”
94349	94362	94347	94347	Harry	117	“ You were with us till we were right outside the classroom ! ”
94363	94370	94371	94371	Hermione	313	“ I do n’t believe it ! ”
94374	94398	94371	94371	Hermione	313	“ Was Professor Flitwick angry ? Oh , it was Malfoy , I was thinking about him and I lost track of things ! ”
94399	94406	94408	94408	Ron	147	“ You know what , Hermione ? ”
94425	94441	94408	94408	Ron	147	“ I reckon you ’re cracking up . You ’re trying to do too much . ”
94442	94449	94451	94451	Hermione	313	“ No , I ’m not ! ”
94468	94498	94451	94451	Hermione	313	“ I just made a mistake , that ’s all ! I ’d better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry ... I ’ll see you in Divination ! ”
94521	94547	94499	94499	Hermione	313	“ I ca n’t believe I missed Cheering Charms ! And I bet they come up in our exams ; Professor Flitwick hinted they might ! ”
94591	94604	94605	94605	Ron	147	“ I thought we were n’t starting crystal balls until next term , ”
94624	94636	94637	94637	Harry	117	“ Do n’t complain , this means we ’ve finished palmistry , ”
94641	94657	94637	94637	Harry	117	“ I was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my hands . ”
94658	94664	94666	94670	the familiar , misty voice	2039	“ Good day to you ! ”
94704	94721	94723	94724	Professor Trelawney	219	“ I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned , ”
94737	94763	94723	94724	Professor Trelawney	219	“ The fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb , and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice . ”
94767	94793	94794	94794	she	219	“ Well , honestly ... ‘ the fates have informed her ’ ... who sets the exam ? She does ! What an amazing prediction ! ”
94843	94852	94853	94853	she	219	“ Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art , ”
94857	94890	94853	94853	she	219	“ I do not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb ’s infinite depths . We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes ”
94911	94942	94901	94901	his	147	“ so as to clear the Inner Eye and the superconscious . Perhaps , if we are lucky , some of you will See before the end of the class . ”
94974	94978	94996	94996	Hermione	313	“ This is stupid ”
95000	95005	95006	95006	Harry	117	“ Seen anything yet ? ”
95020	95031	95033	95033	Ron	147	“ Yeah , there ’s a burn on this table , ”
95037	95044	95033	95033	Ron	147	“ Someone ’s spilled their candle . ”
95045	95054	95055	95055	Hermione	313	“ This is such a waste of time , ”
95058	95075	95055	95055	Hermione	313	“ I could be practicing something useful . I could be catching up on Cheering Charms — ”
95081	95097	95098	95098	she	313	“ Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their Orb ? ”
95107	95114	95115	95115	Ron	147	“ I do n’t need help , ”
95118	95136	95115	95115	Ron	147	“ It ’s obvious what this means . There ’s going to be loads of fog tonight . ”
95145	95150	95152	95153	Professor Trelawney	219	“ Now , really ! ”
95170	95178	95179	95179	She	313	“ You are disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations ! ”
95205	95211	95212	95213	Professor Trelawney	219	“ There is something here ! ”
95234	95243	95217	95217	her	219	“ Something moving ... but what is it ? ”
95272	95277	95278	95279	Professor Trelawney	219	“ My dear ... , ”
95287	95311	95278	95279	Professor Trelawney	219	“ It is here , plainer than ever before ... my dear , stalking toward you , growing ever closer ... the Gr — ”
95312	95320	95322	95322	Hermione	313	“ Oh , for goodness ’ sake ! ”
95325	95332	95322	95322	Hermione	313	“ Not that ridiculous Grim again ! ”
95369	95423	95358	95359	Professor Trelawney	219	“ I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class , my dear , it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of Divination requires . Indeed , I do n’t remember ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane . ”
95433	95436	95438	95438	Hermione	313	“ Fine ! ”
95453	95456	95457	95457	she	313	“ Fine ! ”

100409	100423	100399	100399	she	313	“ Er — are you sure you ’ve copied down these times right ? ”
100424	100427	100429	100429	Hermione	313	“ What ? ”
100440	100448	100429	100429	Hermione	313	“ Yes , of course I have . ”
100449	100467	100469	100469	Harry	117	“ Is there any point asking how you ’re going to sit for two exams at once ? ”
100471	100474	100476	100476	Hermione	313	“ No , ”
100479	100492	100476	100476	Hermione	313	“ Have either of you seen my copy of Numerology and Grammatica ? ”
100493	100508	100510	100510	Ron	147	“ Oh , yeah , I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading , ”
100556	100562	100564	100564	Harry	117	“ It ’s from Hagrid , ”
100571	100583	100564	100564	Harry	117	“ Buckbeak ’s appeal — it ’s set for the sixth . ”

100627	100640	100619	100619	Harry	117	“ Someone from the Ministry of Magic and — and an executioner . ”
100647	100667	100641	100641	Hermione	313	“ They ’re bringing the executioner to the appeal ! But that sounds as though they ’ve already decided ! ”
100668	100674	100676	100676	Harry	117	“ Yeah , it does , ”
100679	100684	100685	100685	Ron	147	“ They ca n’t ! ”
100688	100708	100685	100685	Ron	147	“ I ’ve spent ages reading up on stuff for him ; they ca n’t just ignore it all ! ”
100942	100956	101003	101003	Hermione	313	“ Mine still had a spout for a tail , what a nightmare ... ”
100957	100966	101003	101003	Hermione	313	“ Were the tortoises supposed to breathe steam ? ”
100967	100985	101003	101003	Hermione	313	“ It still had a willow - patterned shell , d’you think that ’ll count against me ? ”

101601	101607	101597	101597	Lupin	195	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
101608	101616	101617	101617	Hermione	313	“ P - P - Professor McGonagall ! ”
101625	101635	101617	101617	Hermione	313	“ Sh - she said I ’d failed everything ! ”
101726	101732	101733	101733	he	173	“ Hello there , Harry ! ”
101736	101748	101733	101733	he	173	“ Just had an exam , I expect ? Nearly finished ? ”

101777	101781	101783	101783	Fudge	173	“ Lovely day , ”
101792	101797	101783	101783	Fudge	173	“ Pity ... pity ... ”
101807	101857	101798	101798	He	173	“ I ’m here on an unpleasant mission , Harry . The Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff . As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black situation , I was asked to step in . ”
101858	101868	101869	101869	Ron	147	“ Does that mean the appeal ’s already happened ? ”
101875	101887	101889	101889	Fudge	173	“ No , no , it ’s scheduled for this afternoon , ”
101896	101909	101911	101911	Ron	147	“ Then you might not have to witness an execution at all ! ”
101914	101921	101911	101911	Ron	147	“ The hippogriff might get off ! ”
101997	102019	101981	101984	the very old wizard	2199	“ Dear , dear , I ’m getting too old for this ... Two o’clock , is n’t it , Fudge ? ”
102076	102083	102085	102085	Ron	147	“ Why ’d you stop me ? ”
102096	102115	102085	102085	Ron	147	“ Did you see them ? They ’ve even got the axe ready ! This is n’t justice ! ”
102116	102138	102143	102143	she	313	“ Ron , your dad works for the Ministry , you ca n’t go saying things like that to his boss ! ”
102149	102173	102143	102143	she	313	“ As long as Hagrid keeps his head this time , and argues his case properly , they ca n’t possibly execute Buckbeak ... ”
102306	102314	102315	102315	Neville	168	“ She ’s seeing us all separately , ”
102348	102361	102362	102362	he	168	“ Have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball ? ”
102367	102370	102372	102372	Ron	147	“ Nope , ”
102427	102437	102420	102424	the rest of the class	1073	“ What did she ask ? Was it okay ? ”
102445	102467	102471	102471	he	168	“ She says the crystal ball ’s told her that if I tell you , I ’ll have a horrible accident ! ”
102489	102494	102496	102496	Ron	147	“ That ’s convenient , ”
102498	102512	102514	102514	he	147	“ You know , I ’m starting to think Hermione was right about her ”
102523	102531	102514	102514	he	147	“ she ’s a right old fraud . ”
102532	102535	102537	102537	Harry	117	“ Yeah , ”
102551	102558	102537	102537	Harry	117	“ Wish she ’d hurry up ... ”
102569	102583	102584	102584	she	220	“ She says I ’ve got all the makings of a true Seer , ”
102590	102602	102584	102584	she	220	“ I saw loads of stuff ... Well , good luck ! ”
102613	102617	102629	102629	Ron	147	“ Ronald Weasley , ”
102700	102706	102707	102707	Harry	117	“ How ’d it go ? ”
102714	102717	102719	102719	Ron	147	“ Rubbish , ”
102721	102744	102719	102719	Ron	147	“ Could n’t see a thing , so I made some stuff up . Do n’t think she was convinced , though ... ”
102745	102753	102754	102754	Harry	117	“ Meet you in the common room , ”
102763	102767	102757	102758	Professor Trelawney	219	“ Harry Potter ! ”
102819	102826	102827	102827	she	219	“ Good day , my dear , ”
102831	102856	102827	102827	she	219	“ If you would kindly gaze into the Orb ... Take your time , now ... then tell me what you see within it ... ”
102889	102892	102893	102894	Professor Trelawney	219	“ Well ? ”
102898	102904	102893	102894	Professor Trelawney	219	“ What do you see ? ”
102939	102942	102944	102944	Harry	117	“ Er — ”
102946	102953	102944	102944	Harry	117	“ a dark shape ... um ... ”
102954	102960	102962	102963	Professor Trelawney	219	“ What does it resemble ? ”
102965	102970	102962	102963	Professor Trelawney	219	“ Think , now ... ”
102982	102986	102987	102987	he	117	“ A hippogriff , ”
102991	102994	102996	102997	Professor Trelawney	219	“ Indeed ! ”
103009	103044	102996	102997	Professor Trelawney	219	“ My boy , you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid ’s trouble with the Ministry of Magic ! Look closer ... Does the hippogriff appear to ... have its head ? ”
103045	103048	103050	103050	Harry	117	“ Yes , ”
103053	103058	103059	103060	Professor Trelawney	219	“ Are you sure ? ”
103064	103094	103059	103060	Professor Trelawney	219	“ Are you quite sure , dear ? You do n’t see it writhing on the ground , perhaps , and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it ? ”
103095	103098	103100	103100	Harry	117	“ No ! ”
103108	103116	103059	103060	Professor Trelawney	219	“ No blood ? No weeping Hagrid ? ”
103117	103120	103122	103122	Harry	117	“ No ! ”
103137	103148	103122	103122	Harry	117	“ It looks fine , it ’s — flying away ... ”
103153	103179	103059	103060	Professor Trelawney	219	“ Well , dear , I think we ’ll leave it there ... A little disappointing ... but I ’m sure you did your best . ”
103206	103212	103059	103060	Professor Trelawney	219	“ IT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT . ”
103235	103240	103242	103242	Harry	117	“ S - sorry ? ”
103310	103389	103294	103295	Professor Trelawney	219	“ THE DARK LORD LIES ALONE AND FRIENDLESS , ABANDONED BY HIS FOLLOWERS . HIS SERVANT HAS BEEN CHAINED THESE TWELVE YEARS . TONIGHT , BEFORE MIDNIGHT ... THE SERVANT WILL BREAK FREE AND SET OUT TO REJOIN HIS MASTER . THE DARK LORD WILL RISE AGAIN WITH HIS SERVANT ’S AID , GREATER AND MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER BEFORE .

103421	103430	103431	103431	she	219	“ I ’m so sorry , dear boy , ”
103435	103452	103431	103431	she	219	“ the heat of the day , you know ... I drifted off for a moment ... ”

109939	109948	109936	109936	Hermione	313	“ I ’ve been covering up for you — ”
109949	109958	109959	109959	Lupin	195	“ Hermione , listen to me , please ! ”
109962	109967	109959	109959	Lupin	195	“ I can explain — ”
109986	109991	109992	109992	he	195	“ I trusted you , ”
110004	110015	109992	109992	he	195	“ and all the time you ’ve been his friend ! ”
110016	110021	110023	110023	Lupin	195	“ You ’re wrong , ”
110025	110043	110023	110023	Lupin	195	“ I have n’t been Sirius ’s friend , but I am now — Let me explain ... ”
110044	110047	110048	110048	Hermione	313	“ NO ! ”
110051	110080	110048	110048	Hermione	313	“ Harry , do n’t trust him , he ’s been helping Black get into the castle , he wants you dead too — he ’s a werewolf ! ”
110104	110116	110117	110117	he	195	“ Not at all up to your usual standard , Hermione , ”
110120	110150	110117	110117	he	195	“ Only one out of three , I ’m afraid . I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle and I certainly do n’t want Harry dead ... ”
110159	110171	110222	110222	he	195	“ But I wo n’t deny that I am a werewolf . ”
110202	110210	110199	110199	Ron	147	“ Get away from me , werewolf ! ”
110229	110236	110222	110222	he	195	“ How long have you known ? ”
110237	110240	110241	110241	Hermione	313	“ Ages , ”
110244	110253	110241	110241	Hermione	313	“ Since I did Professor Snape ’s essay ... ”
110254	110260	110262	110262	Lupin	195	“ He ’ll be delighted , ”
110265	110313	110262	110262	Lupin	195	“ He assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant ... Did you check the lunar chart and realize that I was always ill at the full moon ? Or did you realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me ? ”
110314	110317	110318	110318	Hermione	313	“ Both , ”
110327	110343	110262	110262	Lupin	195	“ You ’re the cleverest witch of your age I ’ve ever met , Hermione . ”
110344	110349	110350	110350	Hermione	313	“ I ’m not , ”
110353	110371	110350	110350	Hermione	313	“ If I ’d been a bit cleverer , I ’d have told everyone what you are ! ”
110372	110378	110380	110380	Lupin	195	“ But they already know , ”
110382	110390	110380	110380	Lupin	195	“ At least , the staff do . ”
110391	110403	110404	110404	Ron	147	“ Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf ? ”
110407	110412	110404	110404	Ron	147	“ Is he mad ? ”
110413	110421	110423	110423	Lupin	195	“ Some of the staff thought so , ”
110425	110441	110423	110423	Lupin	195	“ He had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that I ’m trustworthy — ”
110442	110448	110449	110449	Harry	117	“ AND HE WAS WRONG ! ”
110452	110461	110462	110462	He	117	“ YOU’VE BEEN HELPING HIM ALL THE TIME ! ”
110515	110523	110525	110525	Lupin	195	“ I have not been helping Sirius , ”
110527	110542	110525	110525	Lupin	195	“ If you ’ll give me a chance , I ’ll explain . Look — ”
110569	110572	110574	110574	Lupin	195	“ There , ”
110585	110599	110574	110574	Lupin	195	“ You ’re armed , we ’re not . Now will you listen ? ”
110613	110622	110623	110623	he	117	“ If you have n’t been helping him , ”
110633	110642	110623	110623	he	117	“ how did you know he was here ? ”
110643	110647	110649	110649	Lupin	195	“ The map , ”
110651	110665	110649	110649	Lupin	195	“ The Marauder ’s Map . I was in my office examining it — ”
110666	110674	110675	110675	Harry	117	“ You know how to work it ? ”
110679	110689	110691	110691	Lupin	195	“ Of course I know how to work it , ”
110698	110719	110694	110694	his	195	“ I helped write it . I ’m Moony — that was my friends ’ nickname for me at school . ”
110720	110725	110649	110649	Lupin	195	“ You wrote — ? ”
110726	110778	110694	110694	his	195	“ The important thing is , I was watching it carefully this evening , because I had an idea that you , Ron , and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed . And I was right , was n’t I ? ”
110801	110815	110649	110649	Lupin	195	“ You might have been wearing your father ’s old Cloak , Harry — ”
110816	110824	110649	110649	Lupin	195	“ How d’you know about the Cloak ? ”
110825	110838	110840	110840	Lupin	195	“ The number of times I saw James disappearing under it ... , ”
110848	110909	110840	110840	Lupin	195	“ The point is , even if you ’re wearing an Invisibility Cloak , you still show up on the Marauder ’s Map . I watched you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid ’s hut . Twenty minutes later , you left Hagrid , and set off back toward the castle . But you were now accompanied by somebody else . ”
110910	110913	110915	110915	Harry	117	“ What ? ”
110917	110924	110915	110915	Harry	117	“ No , we were n’t ! ”
110925	110933	110935	110935	Lupin	195	“ I could n’t believe my eyes , ”
110946	110962	110935	110935	Lupin	195	“ I thought the map must be malfunctioning . How could he be with you ? ”
110963	110970	110972	110972	Harry	117	“ No one was with us ! ”
110974	111011	111037	111037	He	195	“ And then I saw another dot , moving fast toward you , labeled Sirius Black ... I saw him collide with you ; I watched as he pulled two of you into the Whomping Willow — ”
111012	111017	111018	111018	Ron	147	“ One of us ! ”
111022	111027	111029	111029	Lupin	195	“ No , Ron , ”
111031	111036	111029	111029	Lupin	195	“ Two of you . ”
111049	111062	111063	111063	he	195	“ Do you think I could have a look at the rat ? ”
111067	111070	111072	111072	Ron	147	“ What ? ”
111074	111084	111072	111072	Ron	147	“ What ’s Scabbers got to do with it ? ”
111085	111088	111090	111090	Lupin	195	“ Everything , ”
111092	111100	111090	111090	Lupin	195	“ Could I see him , please ? ”
111165	111168	111169	111169	Ron	147	“ What ? ”
111182	111193	111169	111169	Ron	147	“ What ’s my rat got to do with anything ? ”
111194	111201	111203	111204	Sirius Black	152	“ That ’s not a rat , ”
111207	111219	111203	111204	Sirius Black	152	“ What d’you mean — of course Scabbers is a rat — ”
111220	111227	111229	111229	Lupin	195	“ No , he ’s not , ”
111232	111238	111229	111229	Lupin	195	“ He ’s a wizard . ”
111239	111246	111248	111248	Black	152	“ Scabber 's is an Animagus , ”
111250	111258	111248	111248	Black	152	“ by the name of Peter Pettigrew . ”
111282	111288	111275	111275	Ron	147	“ You ’re both mental . ”
111289	111292	111294	111294	Hermione	313	“ Ridiculous ! ”
111297	111303	111305	111305	Harry	117	“ Peter Pettigrew ’s dead ! ”
111307	111315	111316	111316	He	117	“ He killed him twelve years ago ! ”
111326	111331	111332	111332	Black	152	“ I meant to , ”
111340	111356	111335	111335	his	152	“ but little Peter got the better of me ... not this time , though ! ”
111384	111389	111390	111390	Lupin	195	“ Sirius , NO ! ”
111404	111427	111394	111394	himself	195	“ WAIT ! You ca n’t do it just like that — they need to understand — we ’ve got to explain — ”
111428	111434	111436	111436	Black	152	“ We can explain afterwards ! ”
111477	111493	111494	111494	Lupin	195	“ They ’ve — got — a — right — to — know — everything ! ”
111503	111534	111494	111494	Lupin	195	“ Ron ’s kept him as a pet ! There are parts of it even I do n’t understand ! And Harry — you owe Harry the truth , Sirius ! ”
111564	111570	111571	111571	Black	152	“ All right , then , ”
111582	111607	111571	111571	Black	152	“ Tell them whatever you like . But make it quick , Remus . I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for ... ”
111608	111617	111619	111619	Ron	147	“ You ’re nutters , both of you , ”
111631	111643	111619	111619	Ron	147	“ I ’ve had enough of this . I ’m off . ”
111667	111678	111679	111679	he	195	“ You ’re going to hear me out , Ron , ”
111683	111695	111679	111679	he	195	“ Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen . ”
111696	111706	111707	111707	Ron	147	“ HE ’S NOT PETER , HE ’S SCABBERS ! ”
111756	111765	111766	111766	he	117	“ There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die , ”
111769	111777	111766	111766	he	117	“ A whole street full of them ... ”
111778	111789	111791	111791	Black	152	“ They did n’t see what they thought they saw ! ”
111803	111810	111812	111812	Lupin	195	“ Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter , ”
111816	111848	111812	111812	Lupin	195	“ I believed it myself — until I saw the map tonight . Because the Marauder ’s Map never lies ... Peter ’s alive . Ron ’s holding him , Harry . ”
111934	111958	111908	111908	Hermione	313	“ But Professor Lupin ... Scabbers ca n’t be Pettigrew ... it just ca n’t be true , you know it ca n’t ... ”
111959	111967	111968	111968	Lupin	195	“ Why ca n’t it be true ? ”
111992	112090	111908	111908	Hermione	313	“ Because ... because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus . We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall . And I looked them up when I did my homework — the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals ; there ’s a register showing what animal they become , and their markings and things ... and I went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register , and there have been only seven Animagi this century , and Pettigrew ’s name was n’t on the list — ”
112114	112120	112121	112121	he	195	“ Right again , Hermione ! ”
112124	112142	112121	112121	he	195	“ But the Ministry never knew that there used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts . ”
112143	112161	112163	112163	Black	152	“ If you ’re going to tell them the story , get a move on , Remus , ”
112175	112191	112163	112163	Black	152	“ I ’ve waited twelve years , I ’m not going to wait much longer . ”
112192	112206	112208	112208	Lupin	195	“ All right ... but you ’ll need to help me , Sirius , ”
112210	112218	112208	112208	Lupin	195	“ I only know how it began ... ”
112262	112267	112251	112251	Lupin	195	“ No one there ... ”
112268	112274	112276	112276	Ron	147	“ This place is haunted ! ”
112278	112283	112285	112285	Lupin	195	“ It ’s not , ”
112297	112319	112285	112285	Lupin	195	“ The Shrieking Shack was never haunted ... The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me . ”
112338	112375	112320	112320	He	195	“ That ’s where all of this starts — with my becoming a werewolf . None of this could have happened if I had n’t been bitten ... and if I had n’t been so foolhardy ... ”
112391	112394	112395	112395	She	313	“ Shh ! ”
112402	112497	112395	112395	She	313	“ I was a very small boy when I received the bite . My parents tried everything , but in those days there was no cure . The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery . It makes me safe , you see . As long as I take it in the week preceding the full moon , I keep my mind when I transform ... I am able to curl up in my office , a harmless wolf , and wait for the moon to wane again .
112498	112543	112395	112395	She	313	“ Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered , however , I became a fully fledged monster once a month . It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts . Other parents were n’t likely to want their children exposed to me .
112544	112578	112579	112579	Lupin	195	“ But then Dumbledore became headmaster , and he was sympathetic . He said that as long as we took certain precautions , there was no reason I should n’t come to school ... ”
112588	112624	112579	112579	Lupin	195	“ I told you , months ago , that the Whomping Willow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts . The truth is that it was planted because I came to Hogwarts . This house ”
112633	112686	112626	112626	Lupin	195	“ the tunnel that leads to it — they were built for my use . Once a month , I was smuggled out of the castle , into this place , to transform . The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while I was dangerous . ”
112723	112801	112720	112720	Lupin	195	“ My transformations in those days were — were terrible . It is very painful to turn into a werewolf . I was separated from humans to bite , so I bit and scratched myself instead . The villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits . Dumbledore encouraged the rumor ... Even now , when the house has been silent for years , the villagers do n’t dare approach it ...
112966	112966	112962	112962	They	2324	”
112967	112972	112974	112974	Harry	117	“ My dad too ? ”
112978	112983	112985	112985	Lupin	195	“ Yes , indeed , ”
112987	113082	112985	112985	Lupin	195	“ It took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it . Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school , and lucky they were , because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong — one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it . Peter needed all the help he could get from James and Sirius . Finally , in our fifth year , they managed it . They could each turn into a different animal at will . ”
113083	113091	113093	113093	Hermione	313	“ But how did that help you ? ”
113098	113116	113118	113118	Lupin	195	“ They could n’t keep me company as humans , so they kept me company as animals , ”
113120	113209	113118	113118	Lupin	195	“ A werewolf is only a danger to people . They sneaked out of the castle every month under James ’s Invisibility Cloak . They transformed ... Peter , as the smallest , could slip beneath the Willow ’s attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it . They would then slip down the tunnel and join me . Under their influence , I became less dangerous . My body was still wolfish , but my mind seemed to become less so while I was with them . ”
113210	113216	113218	113218	Black	152	“ Hurry up , Remus , ”
113235	113353	113118	113118	Lupin	195	“ I ’m getting there , Sirius , I ’m getting there ... well , highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform . Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night . Sirius and James transformed into such large animals , they were able to keep a werewolf in check . I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did ... And that ’s how we came to write the Marauder ’s Map , and sign it with our nicknames . Sirius is Padfoot . Peter is Wormtail . James was Prongs . ”
113354	113361	113362	113362	Harry	117	“ What sort of animal — ? ”
113371	113401	113366	113366	Hermione	313	“ That was still really dangerous ! Running around in the dark with a werewolf ! What if you ’d given the others the slip , and bitten somebody ? ”
113402	113410	113412	113412	Lupin	195	“ A thought that still haunts me , ”
113415	113444	113412	113412	Lupin	195	“ And there were near misses , many of them . We laughed about them afterwards . We were young , thoughtless — carried away with our own cleverness .
113537	113537	113532	113532	I	0	”
113554	113712	113551	113551	his	195	“ All this year , I have been battling with myself , wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus . But I did n’t do it . Why ? Because I was too cowardly . It would have meant admitting that I ’d betrayed his trust while I was at school , admitting that I ’d led others along with me ... and Dumbledore ’s trust has meant everything to me . He let me into Hogwarts as a boy , and he gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life , unable to find paid work because of what I am . And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using Dark Arts he learned from Voldemort , that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it ... so , in a way , Snape ’s been right about me all along . ”
113713	113716	113718	113718	Black	152	“ Snape ? ”
113738	113748	113736	113736	Lupin	195	“ What ’s Snape got to do with it ? ”
113749	113756	113758	113758	Lupin	195	“ He ’s here , Sirius , ”
113761	113769	113770	113770	He	195	“ He ’s teaching here as well . ”
113781	113805	113808	113808	Lupin	195	“ Professor Snape was at school with us . He fought very hard against my appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job ”
113810	113852	113808	113808	Lupin	195	“ He has been telling Dumbledore all year that I am not to be trusted . He has his reasons ... you see , Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him , a trick which involved me — ”
113859	113865	113866	113866	he	152	“ It served him right , ”
113869	113890	113866	113866	he	152	“ Sneaking around , trying to find out what we were up to ... hoping he could get us expelled ... ”
113891	113903	113904	113904	Lupin	195	“ Severus was very interested in where I went every month , ”
113913	114111	113911	113911	Hermione	313	“ We were in the same year , you know , and we — er — did n’t like each other very much . He especially disliked James . Jealous , I think , of James ’s talent on the Quidditch field ... anyway , Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform . Sirius thought it would be — er — amusing , to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick , and he ’d be able to get in after me . Well , of course , Snape tried it — if he ’d got as far as this house , he ’d have met a fully grown werewolf — but your father , who ’d heard what Sirius had done , went after Snape and pulled him back , at great risk to his life ... Snape glimpsed me , though , at the end of the tunnel . He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody , but from that time on he knew what I was ... ”
114112	114123	114125	114125	Harry	117	“ So that ’s why Snape does n’t like you , ”
114128	114139	114125	114125	Harry	117	“ because he thought you were in on the joke ? ”
114140	114145	113911	113911	Hermione	313	“ That ’s right , ”
114193	114205	114207	114207	Snape	260	“ I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow , ”
114226	114236	114207	114207	Snape	260	“ Very useful , Potter , I thank you ... ”
114251	114265	114266	114266	he	260	“ You ’re wondering , perhaps , how I knew you were here ? ”
114273	114345	114266	114266	he	260	“ I ’ve just been to your office , Lupin . You forgot to take your potion tonight , so I took a gobletful along . And very lucky I did ... lucky for me , I mean . Lying on your desk was a certain map . One glance at it told me all I needed to know . I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight . ”
114346	114349	114350	114350	Lupin	195	“ Severus — ”
114358	114405	114354	114354	Snape	260	“ I ’ve told the headmaster again and again that you ’re helping your old friend Black into the castle , Lupin , and here ’s the proof . Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout — ”
114406	114415	114417	114417	Lupin	195	“ Severus , you ’re making a mistake , ”
114420	114439	114417	114417	Lupin	195	“ You have n’t heard everything — I can explain — Sirius is not here to kill Harry — ”
114440	114447	114449	114449	Snape	260	“ Two more for Azkaban tonight , ”
114457	114486	114449	114449	Snape	260	“ I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this ... He was quite convinced you were harmless , you know , Lupin ... a tame werewolf — ”
114487	114491	114493	114493	Lupin	195	“ You fool , ”
114496	114510	114493	114493	Lupin	195	“ Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside Azkaban ? ”
114572	114578	114579	114579	he	260	“ Give me a reason , ”
114582	114597	114579	114579	he	260	“ Give me a reason to do it , and I swear I will . ”
114677	114701	114658	114658	Hermione	313	“ Professor Snape — it — it would n’t hurt to hear what they ’ve got to say , w - would it ? ”
114702	114715	114716	114716	Snape	260	“ Miss Granger , you are already facing suspension from this school , ”
114719	114754	114716	114716	Snape	260	“ You , Potter , and Weasley are out - of - bounds , in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf . For once in your life , hold your tongue . ”
114755	114765	114658	114658	Hermione	313	“ But if — if there was a mistake — ”
114766	114774	114775	114775	Snape	260	“ KEEP QUIET , YOU STUPID GIRL ! ”
114783	114792	114775	114775	Snape	260	“ DON’T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND ! ”
114818	114824	114825	114825	Snape	260	“ Vengeance is very sweet , ”
114830	114843	114825	114825	Snape	260	“ How I hoped I would be the one to catch you ... ”
114844	114854	114855	114855	Black	152	“ The joke ’s on you again , Severus , ”
114858	114871	114873	114873	he	260	“ As long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle ”
114880	114886	114873	114873	he	260	“ I ’ll come quietly ... ”
114887	114893	114895	114895	Snape	260	“ Up to the castle ? ”
114898	114950	114895	114895	Snape	260	“ I do n’t think we need to go that far . All I have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the Willow . They ’ll be very pleased to see you , Black ... pleased enough to give you a little Kiss , I daresay ... ”
114963	114974	114975	114975	he	152	“ You — you ’ve got to hear me out , ”
114978	114987	114975	114975	he	152	“ The rat — look at the rat — ”
115010	115018	115019	115019	he	260	“ Come on , all of you , ”
115041	115059	115022	115022	He	260	“ I ’ll drag the werewolf . Perhaps the dementors will have a Kiss for him too — ”
115081	115097	115099	115099	Snape	260	“ Get out of the way , Potter , you ’re in enough trouble already , ”
115101	115113	115099	115099	Snape	260	“ If I had n’t been here to save your skin — ”
115114	115128	115129	115129	Harry	117	“ Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year , ”
115132	115166	115129	115129	Harry	117	“ I ’ve been alone with him loads of times , having defense lessons against the dementors . If he was helping Black , why did n’t he just finish me off then ? ”
115167	115182	115184	115184	Snape	260	“ Do n’t ask me to fathom the way a werewolf ’s mind works , ”
115186	115195	115184	115184	Snape	260	“ Get out of the way , Potter . ”
115196	115200	115201	115201	Harry	117	“ YOU’RE PATHETIC ! ”
115204	115220	115201	115201	Harry	117	“ JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU WON’T EVEN LISTEN — ”
115221	115233	115234	115234	Snape	260	“ SILENCE ! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT ! ”
115242	115319	115234	115234	Snape	260	“ Like father , like son , Potter ! I have just saved your neck ; you should be thanking me on bended knee ! You would have been well served if he ’d killed you ! You ’d have died like your father , too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black — now get out of the way , or I will make you . GET OUT OF THE WAY , POTTER ! ”
115346	115349	115350	115350	he	117	“ Expelliarmus ! ”
115449	115457	115459	115459	Black	152	“ You should n’t have done that , ”
115465	115474	115459	115459	Black	152	“ You should have left him to me ... ”
115497	115509	115510	115510	Hermione	313	“ We attacked a teacher ... We attacked a teacher ... , ”
115522	115535	115510	115510	Hermione	313	“ Oh , we ’re going to be in so much trouble — ”
115566	115572	115573	115573	he	195	“ Thank you , Harry , ”
115576	115586	115587	115587	Harry	117	“ I ’m still not saying I believe you , ”
115590	115601	115603	115603	Black	152	“ Then it ’s time we offered you some proof , ”
115605	115616	115603	115603	Black	152	“ You , boy — give me Peter . Now . ”
115625	115630	115631	115631	he	147	“ Come off it , ”
115635	115657	115631	115631	he	147	“ Are you trying to say he broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers ? I mean ... ”
115668	115704	115658	115658	He	147	“ Okay , say Pettigrew could turn into a rat — there are millions of rats — how ’s he supposed to know which one he ’s after if he was locked up in Azkaban ? ”
115705	115717	115719	115719	Lupin	195	“ You know , Sirius , that ’s a fair question , ”
115728	115738	115719	115719	Lupin	195	“ How did you find out where he was ? ”
115801	115808	115809	115809	Lupin	195	“ How did you get this ? ”
115815	115818	115820	115820	Black	152	“ Fudge , ”
115822	115887	115820	115820	Black	152	“ When he came to inspect Azkaban last year , he gave me his paper . And there was Peter , on the front page ... on this boy ’s shoulder ... I knew him at once ... how many times had I seen him transform ? And the caption said the boy would be going back to Hogwarts ... to where Harry was ... ”
115888	115892	115894	115894	Lupin	195	“ My God , ”
115910	115915	115894	115894	Lupin	195	“ His front paw ... ”
115916	115921	115923	115923	Ron	147	“ What about it ? ”
115926	115934	115936	115936	Black	152	“ He ’s got a toe missing , ”
115938	115942	115943	115943	Lupin	195	“ Of course , ”
115946	115959	115943	115943	Lupin	195	“ So simple ... so brilliant ... he cut it off himself ? ”
115960	115966	115968	115968	Black	152	“ Just before he transformed , ”
115970	116031	115968	115968	Black	152	“ When I cornered him , he yelled for the whole street to hear that I ’d betrayed Lily and James . Then , before I could curse him , he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back , killed everyone within twenty feet of himself — and sped down into the sewer with the other rats ... ”
116032	116041	116043	116043	Lupin	195	“ Did n’t you ever hear , Ron ? ”
116045	116057	116043	116043	Lupin	195	“ The biggest bit of Peter they found was his finger . ”
116058	116083	115968	115968	Black	152	“ Look , Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something ! He ’s been in my family for ages , right — ”
116084	116091	116093	116093	Lupin	195	“ Twelve years , in fact , ”
116095	116108	116093	116093	Lupin	195	“ Did n’t you ever wonder why he was living so long ? ”
116109	116121	116123	116123	Ron	147	“ We — we ’ve been taking good care of him ! ”
116125	116139	116141	116141	Lupin	195	“ Not looking too good at the moment , though , is he ? ”
116143	116163	116141	116141	Lupin	195	“ I ’d guess he ’s been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose again ... ”
116164	116174	116176	116176	Ron	147	“ He ’s been scared of that mad cat ! ”
116226	116233	116235	116235	Black	152	“ This cat is n’t mad , ”
116251	116317	116238	116238	He	152	“ He ’s the most intelligent of his kind I ’ve ever met . He recognized Peter for what he was right away . And when he met me , he knew I was no dog . It was a while before he trusted me ... Finally , I managed to communicate to him what I was after , and he ’s been helping me ... ”
116318	116324	116326	116326	Hermione	313	“ What do you mean ? ”
116328	116367	116238	116238	He	152	“ He tried to bring Peter to me , but could n’t ... so he stole the passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me ... As I understand it , he took them from a boy ’s bedside table ... ”
116391	116406	116408	116408	Black	152	“ But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it ... ”
116410	116448	116408	116408	Black	152	“ This cat — Crookshanks , did you call him ? — told me Peter had left blood on the sheets ... I supposed he bit himself ... Well , faking his own death had worked once ... ”
116457	116466	116467	116467	he	117	“ And why did he fake his death ? ”
116471	116487	116467	116467	he	117	“ Because he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parents ! ”
116488	116491	116493	116493	Lupin	195	“ No , ”
116495	116498	116493	116493	Lupin	195	“ Harry — ”
116499	116510	116467	116467	he	117	“ And now you ’ve come to finish him off ! ”
116511	116517	116519	116519	Black	152	“ Yes , I have , ”
116528	116538	116539	116539	Harry	117	“ Then I should ’ve let Snape take you ! ”
116542	116545	116547	116547	Lupin	195	“ Harry , ”
116550	116598	116547	116547	Lupin	195	“ do n’t you see ? All this time we ’ve thought Sirius betrayed your parents , and Peter tracked him down — but it was the other way around , do n’t you see ? Peter betrayed your mother and father — Sirius tracked Peter down — ”
116599	116605	116606	116606	Harry	117	“ THAT ’S NOT TRUE ! ”
116609	116631	116606	116606	Harry	117	“ HE WAS THEIR SECRET - KEEPER ! HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU TURNED UP . HE SAID HE KILLED THEM ! ”
116651	116661	116662	116662	Black	152	“ Harry ... I as good as killed them , ”
116665	116790	116662	116662	Black	152	“ I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment , persuaded them to use him as Secret - Keeper instead of me ... I ’m to blame , I know it ... The night they died , I ’d arranged to check on Peter , make sure he was still safe , but when I arrived at his hiding place , he ’d gone . Yet there was no sign of a struggle . It did n’t feel right . I was scared . I set out for your parents ’ house straightaway . And when I saw their house , destroyed , and their bodies ... I realized what Peter must ’ve done ... what I ’d done ... ”
116799	116804	116806	116806	Lupin	195	“ Enough of this , ”
116823	116842	116815	116815	his	2336	“ There ’s one certain way to prove what really happened . Ron , give me that rat . ”
116843	116859	116860	116860	Ron	147	“ What are you going to do with him if I give him to you ? ”
116865	116872	116874	116874	Lupin	195	“ Force him to show himself , ”
116876	116890	116874	116874	Lupin	195	“ If he really is a rat , it wo n’t hurt him . ”
116928	116933	116935	116935	Lupin	195	“ Ready , Sirius ? ”
116969	116972	116973	116973	he	152	“ Together ? ”
116977	116982	116984	116984	Lupin	195	“ I think so , ”
116999	117012	116984	116984	Lupin	195	“ On the count of three . One — two — THREE ! ”
117233	117240	117242	117242	Lupin	195	“ Well , hello , Peter , ”
117257	117264	117242	117242	Lupin	195	“ Long time , no see . ”
117265	117274	117275	117276	Even Pettigrew	297	“ S - Sirius ... R - Remus ... ”
117291	117299	117284	117284	his	251	“ My friends ... my old friends ... ”
117332	117371	117326	117326	his	195	“ We ’ve been having a little chat , Peter , about what happened the night Lily and James died . You might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed — ”
117372	117375	117377	117377	Pettigrew	297	“ Remus , ”
117393	117412	117377	117377	Pettigrew	297	“ you do n’t believe him , do you ... ? He tried to kill me , Remus ... ”
117413	117419	117421	117421	Lupin	195	“ So we ’ve heard , ”
117426	117449	117421	117421	Lupin	195	“ I ’d like to clear up one or two little matters with you , Peter , if you ’d be so — ”
117450	117461	117462	117462	Pettigrew	297	“ He ’s come to try and kill me again ! ”
117486	117511	117474	117474	he	152	“ He killed Lily and James and now he ’s going to kill me too ... You ’ve got to help me , Remus ... ”
117532	117551	117553	117553	Lupin	195	“ No one ’s going to try and kill you until we ’ve sorted a few things out , ”
117555	117560	117562	117562	Pettigrew	297	“ Sorted things out ? ”
117585	117613	117562	117562	Pettigrew	297	“ I knew he ’d come after me ! I knew he ’d be back for me ! I ’ve been waiting for this for twelve years ! ”
117614	117626	117628	117628	Lupin	195	“ You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban ? ”
117634	117643	117628	117628	Lupin	195	“ When nobody has ever done it before ? ”
117644	117659	117660	117660	Pettigrew	297	“ He ’s got Dark powers the rest of us can only dream of ! ”
117664	117693	117660	117660	Pettigrew	297	“ How else did he get out of there ? I suppose He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named taught him a few tricks ! ”
117710	117717	117718	117718	he	152	“ Voldemort , teach me tricks ? ”
117733	117745	117747	117747	Black	152	“ What , scared to hear your old master ’s name ? ”
117749	117770	117747	117747	Black	152	“ I do n’t blame you , Peter . His lot are n’t very happy with you , are they ? ”
117771	117781	117783	117783	Pettigrew	297	“ Do n’t know what you mean , Sirius — ”
117800	117812	117814	117814	Black	152	“ You have n’t been hiding from me for twelve years , ”
117816	117942	117814	117814	Black	152	“ You ’ve been hiding from Voldemort ’s old supporters . I heard things in Azkaban , Peter ... They all think you ’re dead , or you ’d have to answer to them ... I ’ve heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep . Sounds like they think the double - crosser double - crossed them . Voldemort went to the Potters ’ on your information ... and Voldemort met his downfall there . And not all Voldemort ’s supporters ended up in Azkaban , did they ? There are still plenty out here , biding their time , pretending they ’ve seen the error of their ways ... If they ever got wind that you were still alive , Peter — ”
117943	117955	117957	117957	Pettigrew	297	“ Do n’t know ... what you ’re talking about ... , ”
117978	117990	117965	117965	He	297	“ You do n’t believe this — this madness , Remus — ”
117991	118017	118019	118019	Lupin	195	“ I must admit , Peter , I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat , ”
118022	118028	118030	118030	Pettigrew	297	“ Innocent , but scared ! ”
118032	118060	118030	118030	Pettigrew	297	“ If Voldemort ’s supporters were after me , it was because I put one of their best men in Azkaban — the spy , Sirius Black ! ”
118066	118071	118072	118072	he	152	“ How dare you , ”
118087	118161	118072	118072	he	152	“ I , a spy for Voldemort ? When did I ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself ? But you , Peter — I ’ll never understand why I did n’t see you were the spy from the start . You always liked big friends who ’d look after you , did n’t you ? It used to be us ... me and Remus ... and James ... ”
118175	118200	118168	118168	he	297	“ Me , a spy ... must be out of your mind ... never ... do n’t know how you can say such a — ”
118201	118216	118217	118217	Black	152	“ Lily and James only made you Secret - Keeper because I suggested it , ”
118229	118285	118223	118223	Pettigrew	297	“ I thought it was the perfect plan ... a bluff ... Voldemort would be sure to come after me , would never dream they ’d use a weak , talentless thing like you ... It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life , telling Voldemort you could hand him the Potters . ”
118295	118299	118286	118286	Pettigrew	297	“ far - fetched ”
118301	118304	118286	118286	Pettigrew	297	“ lunacy , ”
118335	118339	118341	118341	Hermione	313	“ Professor Lupin ? ”
118344	118352	118341	118341	Hermione	313	“ Can — can I say something ? ”
118353	118358	118360	118360	Lupin	195	“ Certainly , Hermione , ”
118363	118410	118341	118341	Hermione	313	“ Well — Scabbers — I mean , this — this man — he ’s been sleeping in Harry ’s dormitory for three years . If he ’s working for You - Know - Who , how come he never tried to hurt Harry before now ? ”
118411	118414	118416	118416	Pettigrew	297	“ There ! ”
118427	118451	118423	118423	his	297	“ Thank you ! You see , Remus ? I have never hurt a hair of Harry ’s head ! Why should I ? ”
118452	118459	118461	118461	Black	152	“ I ’ll tell you why , ”
118463	118598	118461	118461	Black	152	“ Because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you . Voldemort ’s been in hiding for twelve years , they say he ’s half dead . You were n’t about to commit murder right under Albus Dumbledore ’s nose , for a wreck of a wizard who ’d lost all of his power , were you ? You ’d want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him , would n’t you ? Why else did you find a wizard family to take you in ? Keeping an ear out for news , were n’t you , Peter ? Just in case your old protector regained strength , and it was safe to rejoin him ... ”
118619	118627	118629	118629	Hermione	313	“ Er — Mr. Black — Sirius ? ”
118655	118682	118712	118712	Black	152	“ If you do n’t mind me asking , how — how did you get out of Azkaban , if you did n’t use Dark Magic ? ”
118683	118687	118689	118689	Pettigrew	297	“ Thank you ! ”
118696	118703	118689	118689	Pettigrew	297	“ Exactly ! Precisely what I — ”
118737	118747	118748	118748	he	152	“ I do n’t know how I did it , ”
118752	118834	118835	118835	He	152	“ I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent . That was n’t a happy thought , so the dementors could n’t suck it out of me ... but it kept me sane and knowing who I am ... helped me keep my powers ... so when it all became ... too much ... I could transform in my cell ... become a dog . Dementors ca n’t see , you know ... ”
118838	118918	118835	118835	He	152	“ They feel their way toward people by sensing their emotions ... They could tell that my feelings were less — less human , less complex when I was a dog ... but they thought , of course , that I was losing my mind like everyone else in there , so it did n’t trouble them . But I was weak , very weak , and I had no hope of driving them away from me without a wand ...
118919	118958	118962	118962	his	297	“ But then I saw Peter in that picture ... I realized he was at Hogwarts with Harry ... perfectly positioned to act , if one hint reached his ears that the Dark Side was gathering strength again ... ”
118979	119028	118962	118962	his	297	“ . . . ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies ... and to deliver the last Potter to them . If he gave them Harry , who ’d dare say he ’d betrayed Lord Voldemort ? He ’d be welcomed back with honors ...
119029	119052	118962	118962	his	297	“ So you see , I had to do something . I was the only one who knew Peter was still alive ... ”
119063	119087	119060	119061	Mrs. Weasley	139	“ The guards say he ’s been talking in his sleep ... always the same words ... ‘ He ’s at Hogwarts . ’ ”
119088	119241	119242	119242	He	2344	“ It was as if someone had lit a fire in my head , and the dementors could n’t destroy it ... It was n’t a happy feeling ... it was an obsession ... but it gave me strength , it cleared my mind . So , one night when they opened my door to bring food , I slipped past them as a dog ... It ’s so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused ... I was thin , very thin ... thin enough to slip through the bars ... I swam as a dog back to the mainland ... I journeyed north and slipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog . I ’ve been living in the forest ever since , except when I came to watch the Quidditch , of course . You fly as well as your father did , Harry ... ”
119253	119257	119259	119259	Black	152	“ Believe me , ”
119261	119283	119259	119259	Black	152	“ Believe me , Harry . I never betrayed James and Lily . I would have died before I betrayed them . ”
119302	119305	119299	119299	he	117	“ No ! ”
119344	119362	119324	119324	He	297	“ Sirius — it ’s me ... it ’s Peter ... your friend ... you would n’t ... ”
119370	119383	119385	119385	Black	152	“ There ’s enough filth on my robes without you touching them , ”
119387	119390	119391	119391	Pettigrew	297	“ Remus ! ”
119406	119425	119396	119396	Lupin	195	“ You do n’t believe this ... Would n’t Sirius have told you they ’d changed the plan ? ”
119426	119438	119440	119440	Lupin	195	“ Not if he thought I was the spy , Peter , ”
119442	119456	119457	119457	he	195	“ I assume that ’s why you did n’t tell me , Sirius ? ”
119465	119471	119473	119473	Black	152	“ Forgive me , Remus , ”
119475	119485	119487	119487	Lupin	195	“ Not at all , Padfoot , old friend , ”
119497	119514	119487	119487	Lupin	195	“ And will you , in turn , forgive me for believing you were the spy ? ”
119515	119519	119521	119521	Black	152	“ Of course , ”
119545	119552	119535	119535	He	152	“ Shall we kill him together ? ”
119553	119560	119562	119562	Lupin	195	“ Yes , I think so , ”
119565	119575	119577	119577	Pettigrew	297	“ You would n’t ... you wo n’t ... , ”
119586	119624	119580	119580	he	297	“ Ron ... have n’t I been a good friend ... a good pet ? You wo n’t let them kill me , Ron , will you ... you ’re on my side , are n’t you ? ”
119636	119645	119646	119646	he	147	“ I let you sleep in my bed ! ”
119649	119656	119657	119657	Pettigrew	297	“ Kind boy ... kind master ... ”
119662	119682	119657	119657	Pettigrew	297	“ you wo n’t let them do it ... I was your rat ... I was a good pet ... ”
119683	119704	119706	119706	Black	152	“ If you made a better rat than a human , it ’s not much to boast about , Peter , ”
119745	119763	119727	119727	Pettigrew	297	“ Sweet girl ... clever girl ... you — you wo n’t let them ... Help me ... ”
119798	119814	119796	119796	Harry	117	“ Harry ... Harry ... you look just like your father ... just like him ... ”
119815	119823	119825	119825	Black	152	“ HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY ? ”
119827	119845	119825	119825	Black	152	“ HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM ? HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM ? ”
119846	119849	119851	119851	Pettigrew	297	“ Harry , ”
119860	119885	119851	119851	Pettigrew	297	“ Harry , James would n’t have wanted me killed ... James would have understood , Harry ... he would have shown me mercy ... ”
119919	119928	119930	119930	Black	152	“ You sold Lily and James to Voldemort , ”
119937	119943	119930	119930	Black	152	“ Do you deny it ? ”
119969	120035	120042	120042	Black	152	“ Sirius , Sirius , what could I have done ? The Dark Lord ... you have no idea ... he has weapons you ca n’t imagine ... I was scared , Sirius , I was never brave like you and Remus and James . I never meant it to happen ... He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named forced me — ”
120036	120040	120042	120042	Black	152	“ DON’T LIE ! ”
120044	120065	120042	120042	Black	152	“ YOU’D BEEN PASSING INFORMATION TO HIM FOR A YEAR BEFORE LILY AND JAMES DIED ! YOU WERE HIS SPY ! ”
120066	120075	120077	120077	Pettigrew	297	“ He — he was taking over everywhere ! ”
120079	120092	120077	120077	Pettigrew	297	“ W - what was there to be gained by refusing him ? ”
120093	120111	120113	120113	Black	152	“ What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed ? ”
120123	120130	120120	120120	his	152	“ Only innocent lives , Peter ! ”
120131	120137	120139	120139	Pettigrew	297	“ You do n’t understand ! ”
120141	120150	120139	120139	Pettigrew	297	“ He would have killed me , Sirius ! ”
120151	120158	120160	120160	Black	152	“ THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED ! ”
120162	120178	120160	120160	Black	152	“ DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS , AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU ! ”
120190	120196	120198	120198	Lupin	195	“ You should have realized , ”
120201	120218	120198	120198	Lupin	195	“ if Voldemort did n’t kill you , we would . Good - bye , Peter . ”
120232	120235	120236	120236	Harry	117	“ NO ! ”
120254	120261	120262	120262	he	117	“ You ca n’t kill him , ”
120266	120271	120262	120262	he	117	“ You ca n’t . ”
120279	120294	120295	120295	Black	152	“ Harry , this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents , ”
120298	120333	120295	120295	Black	152	“ This cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too , without turning a hair . You heard him . His own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole family . ”
120334	120338	120339	120339	Harry	117	“ I know , ”
120342	120373	120339	120339	Harry	117	“ We ’ll take him up to the castle . We ’ll hand him over to the dementors ... He can go to Azkaban ... but do n’t kill him . ”
120374	120377	120379	120379	Pettigrew	297	“ Harry ! ”
120391	120407	120382	120382	he	297	“ You — thank you — it ’s more than I deserve — thank you — ”
120408	120413	120414	120414	Harry	117	“ Get off me , ”
120426	120460	120418	120418	Pettigrew	297	“ I ’m not doing this for you . I ’m doing it because I do n’t reckon my dad would ’ve wanted his best friends to become killers — just for you . ”
120503	120518	120520	120520	Black	152	“ You ’re the only person who has the right to decide , Harry , ”
120522	120531	120520	120520	Black	152	“ But think ... think what he did ... ”
120532	120539	120540	120540	Harry	117	“ He can go to Azkaban , ”
120543	120553	120540	120540	Harry	117	“ If anyone deserves that place , he does ... ”
120561	120565	120567	120567	Lupin	195	“ Very well , ”
120569	120575	120567	120567	Lupin	195	“ Stand aside , Harry . ”
120579	120588	120590	120590	Lupin	195	“ I ’m going to tie him up , ”
120592	120600	120590	120590	Lupin	195	“ That ’s all , I swear . ”
120633	120641	120643	120643	Black	152	“ But if you transform , Peter , ”
120653	120664	120645	120645	his	152	“ we will kill you . You agree , Harry ? ”
120684	120687	120689	120689	Lupin	195	“ Right , ”
120694	120732	120689	120689	Lupin	195	“ Ron , I ca n’t mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey , so I think it ’s best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing . ”
120753	120756	120747	120747	his	195	“ Ferula . ”
120791	120796	120797	120797	he	195	“ That ’s better , ”
120800	120803	120797	120797	he	195	“ Thanks . ”
120804	120810	120812	120812	Hermione	313	“ What about Professor Snape ? ”
120826	120835	120837	120837	Lupin	195	“ There ’s nothing seriously wrong with him , ”
120847	120889	120837	120837	Lupin	195	“ You were just a little — overenthusiastic . Still out cold . Er — perhaps it will be best if we do n’t revive him until we ’re safely back in the castle . We can take him like this ... ”
120893	120896	120890	120890	He	195	“ Mobilicorpus . ”
120959	120970	120972	120972	Black	152	“ And two of us should be chained to this , ”
120980	120986	120972	120972	Black	152	“ Just to make sure . ”
120987	120993	120995	120995	Lupin	195	“ I ’ll do it , ”
120997	121001	121003	121003	Ron	147	“ And me , ”
121251	121258	121259	121259	Sirius	152	“ You know what this means ? ”
121274	121279	121259	121259	Sirius	152	“ Turning Pettigrew in ? ”
121280	121285	121287	121287	Harry	117	“ You ’re free , ”
121289	121293	121295	121295	Sirius	152	“ Yes ... , ”
121297	121318	121295	121295	Sirius	152	“ But I ’m also — I do n’t know if anyone ever told you — I ’m your godfather . ”
121319	121326	121328	121328	Harry	117	“ Yeah , I knew that , ”
121330	121340	121342	121342	Sirius	152	“ Well ... your parents appointed me your guardian , ”
121345	121352	121342	121342	Sirius	152	“ If anything happened to them ... ”
121365	121384	121386	121386	Sirius	152	“ I ’ll understand , of course , if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle , ”
121388	121412	121386	121386	Sirius	152	“ But ... well ... think about it . Once my name ’s cleared ... if you wanted a ... a different home ... ”

121504	121526	121493	121493	Harry	117	“ Of course I want to leave the Dursleys ! Have you got a house ? When can I move in ? ”
121551	121556	121557	121557	he	117	“ You want to ? ”
121560	121565	121557	121557	he	117	“ You mean it ? ”
121566	121573	121575	121575	Harry	117	“ Yeah , I mean it ! ”

123612	123621	123580	123580	Snape	260	“ Thank you very much indeed , Minister . ”
123622	123637	123580	123580	Snape	260	“ Nasty cut you ’ve got there ... Black ’s work , I suppose ? ”
123638	123656	123580	123580	Snape	260	“ As a matter of fact , it was Potter , Weasley , and Granger , Minister ... ”
123657	123660	123580	123580	Snape	260	“ No ! ”
123661	123771	123580	123580	Snape	260	“ Black had bewitched them , I saw it immediately . A Confundus Charm , to judge by their behavior . They seemed to think there was a possibility he was innocent . They were n’t responsible for their actions . On the other hand , their interference might have permitted Black to escape ... They obviously thought they were going to catch Black single - handed . They ’ve got away with a great deal before now ... I ’m afraid it ’s given them a rather high opinion of themselves ... and of course Potter has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster — ”
123772	123800	123580	123580	Snape	260	“ Ah , well , Snape ... Harry Potter , you know ... we ’ve all got a bit of a blind spot where he ’s concerned . ”
123801	123902	123580	123580	Snape	260	“ And yet — is it good for him to be given so much special treatment ? Personally , I try and treat him like any other student . And any other student would be suspended — at the very least — for leading his friends into such danger . Consider , Minister — against all school rules — after all the precautions put in place for his protection — out - of - bounds , at night , consorting with a werewolf and a murderer — and I have reason to believe he has been visiting Hogsmeade illegally too — ”
123903	123925	123580	123580	Snape	260	“ Well , well ... we shall see , Snape , we shall see ... The boy has undoubtedly been foolish ... ”
123992	124016	124121	124121	He	117	“ What amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors ... you ’ve really no idea what made them retreat , Snape ? ”
124017	124041	124121	124121	He	117	“ No , Minister ... by the time I had come ’ round they were heading back to their positions at the entrances ... ”
124042	124056	124121	124121	He	117	“ Extraordinary . And yet Black , and Harry , and the girl — ”
124057	124088	124121	124121	He	117	“ All unconscious by the time I reached them . I bound and gagged Black , naturally , conjured stretchers , and brought them all straight back to the castle . ”
124311	124318	124319	124319	she	205	“ Ah , you ’re awake ! ”
124342	124347	124349	124349	Harry	117	“ How ’s Ron ? ”
124354	124359	124361	124362	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ He ’ll live , ”
124365	124393	124361	124362	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ As for you two ... you ’ll be staying here until I ’m satisfied you ’re — Potter , what do you think you ’re doing ? ”
124411	124419	124420	124420	he	117	“ I need to see the headmaster , ”
124423	124426	124428	124429	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ Potter , ”
124432	124460	124428	124429	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ it ’s all right . They ’ve got Black . He ’s locked away upstairs . The dementors will be performing the Kiss any moment now — ”
124461	124464	124479	124479	his	117	“ WHAT ? ”
124501	124510	124512	124512	Fudge	173	“ Harry , Harry , what ’s this ? ”
124517	124530	124531	124531	he	117	“ You should be in bed — has he had any chocolate ? ”
124537	124542	124543	124543	Harry	117	“ Minister , listen ! ”
124546	124579	124543	124543	Harry	117	“ Sirius Black ’s innocent ! Peter Pettigrew faked his own death ! We saw him tonight ! You ca n’t let the dementors do that thing to Sirius , he ’s — ”
124594	124625	124591	124591	his	173	“ Harry , Harry , you ’re very confused , you ’ve been through a dreadful ordeal , lie back down , now , we ’ve got everything under control ... ”
124626	124630	124631	124631	Harry	117	“ YOU HAVEN’T ! ”
124634	124641	124631	124631	Harry	117	“ YOU’VE GOT THE WRONG MAN ! ”
124642	124649	124653	124653	she	313	“ Minister , listen , please , ”
124669	124693	124653	124653	she	313	“ I saw him too . It was Ron ’s rat , he ’s an Animagus , Pettigrew , I mean , and — ”
124694	124700	124702	124702	Snape	260	“ You see , Minister ? ”
124704	124721	124702	124702	Snape	260	“ Confunded , both of them ... Black ’s done a very good job on them ... ”
124722	124727	124728	124728	Harry	117	“ WE’RE NOT CONFUNDED ! ”
124731	124736	124738	124739	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ Minister ! Professor ! ”
124742	124762	124738	124739	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ I must insist that you leave . Potter is my patient , and he should not be distressed ! ”
124763	124778	124779	124779	Harry	117	“ I ’m not distressed , I ’m trying to tell them what happened ! ”
124783	124790	124779	124779	Harry	117	“ If they ’d just listen — ”
124822	124837	124845	124845	Dumbledore	191	“ Now , please , Minister , these children need care . Please leave — ”
124861	124868	124847	124847	Harry	117	“ Professor Dumbledore , Sirius Black — ”
124869	124875	124877	124878	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ For heaven ’s sake ! ”
124881	124896	124877	124878	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ Is this a hospital wing or not ? Headmaster , I must insist — ”
124897	124915	124917	124917	Dumbledore	210	“ My apologies , Poppy , but I need a word with Mr. Potter and Miss Granger , ”
124920	124930	124917	124917	Dumbledore	210	“ I have just been talking to Sirius Black — ”
124931	124950	124952	124952	Snape	260	“ I suppose he ’s told you the same fairy tale he ’s planted in Potter ’s mind ? ”
124954	124965	124952	124952	Snape	260	“ Something about a rat , and Pettigrew being alive — ”
124966	124976	124978	124978	Dumbledore	210	“ That , indeed , is Black ’s story , ”
124990	124999	125001	125001	Snape	260	“ And does my evidence count for nothing ? ”
125003	125025	125001	125001	Snape	260	“ Peter Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking Shack , nor did I see any sign of him on the grounds . ”
125026	125037	125039	125039	Hermione	313	“ That was because you were knocked out , Professor ! ”
125042	125052	125039	125039	Hermione	313	“ You did n’t arrive in time to hear — ”
125053	125061	125001	125001	Snape	260	“ Miss Granger , HOLD YOUR TONGUE ! ”
125062	125067	125069	125069	Fudge	173	“ Now , Snape , ”
125073	125088	125069	125069	Fudge	173	“ the young lady is disturbed in her mind , we must make allowances — ”
125089	125101	125103	125103	Dumbledore	210	“ I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone , ”
125106	125117	125103	125103	Dumbledore	210	“ Cornelius , Severus , Poppy — please leave us . ”
125118	125121	125123	125124	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ Headmaster ! ”
125126	125135	125123	125124	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ They need treatment , they need rest — ”
125136	125142	125144	125144	Dumbledore	210	“ This can not wait , ”
125146	125151	125144	125144	Dumbledore	210	“ I must insist . ”
125188	125197	125198	125198	he	173	“ The dementors should have arrived by now , ”
125201	125217	125198	125198	he	173	“ I ’ll go and meet them . Dumbledore , I ’ll see you upstairs . ”
125236	125249	125250	125250	Snape	260	“ You surely do n’t believe a word of Black ’s story ? ”
125261	125272	125273	125273	Dumbledore	210	“ I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone , ”
125283	125298	125299	125299	he	260	“ Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen , ”
125302	125323	125299	125299	he	260	“ You have n’t forgotten that , Headmaster ? You have n’t forgotten that he once tried to kill me ? ”
125324	125337	125339	125339	Dumbledore	210	“ My memory is as good as it ever was , Severus , ”
125380	125393	125370	125370	They	2413	“ Professor , Black ’s telling the truth — we saw Pettigrew — ”
125394	125406	125357	125357	It	2412	“ — he escaped when Professor Lupin turned into a werewolf — ”
125407	125414	125370	125370	They	2413	“ — he ’s a rat — ”
125415	125432	125357	125357	It	2412	“ — Pettigrew ’s front paw , I mean , finger , he cut it off — ”
125433	125444	125370	125370	They	2413	“ — Pettigrew attacked Ron , it was n’t Sirius — ”
125458	125482	125483	125483	he	210	“ It is your turn to listen , and I beg you will not interrupt me , because there is very little time , ”
125487	125551	125483	125483	he	210	“ There is not a shred of proof to support Black ’s story , except your word — and the word of two thirteen - year - old wizards will not convince anybody . A street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew . I myself gave evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters ’ Secret - Keeper . ”
125552	125559	125566	125566	himself	117	“ Professor Lupin can tell you — ”
125568	125638	125483	125483	he	210	“ Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest , unable to tell anyone anything . By the time he is human again , it will be too late , Sirius will be worse than dead . I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little — and the fact that he and Sirius are old friends — ”
125639	125642	125483	125483	he	210	“ But — ”
125643	125676	125483	125483	he	210	“ Listen to me , Harry . It is too late , you understand me ? You must see that Professor Snape ’s version of events is far more convincing than yours . ”
125677	125682	125683	125683	Hermione	313	“ He hates Sirius , ”
125687	125699	125683	125683	Hermione	313	“ All because of some stupid trick Sirius played on him — ”
125700	125741	125483	125483	he	210	“ Sirius has not acted like an innocent man . The attack on the Fat Lady — entering Gryffindor Tower with a knife — without Pettigrew , alive or dead , we have no chance of overturning Sirius ’s sentence . ”
125742	125748	125683	125683	Hermione	313	“ But you believe us . ”
125749	125755	125757	125757	Dumbledore	210	“ Yes , I do , ”
125760	125782	125757	125757	Dumbledore	210	“ But I have no power to make other men see the truth , or to overrule the Minister of Magic ... ”
125839	125844	125846	125846	Dumbledore	210	“ What we need , ”
125860	125865	125850	125850	his	210	“ is more time . ”
125866	125869	125870	125870	Hermione	313	“ But — ”
125881	125884	125875	125875	her	313	“ OH ! ”
125885	125891	125893	125893	Dumbledore	210	“ Now , pay attention , ”
125903	125984	125893	125893	Dumbledore	210	“ Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick ’s office on the seventh floor . Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower . If all goes well , you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight . But remember this , both of you : You must not be seen . Miss Granger , you know the law — you know what is at stake ... You — must — not — be — seen . ”
126011	126023	126024	126024	he	210	“ I am going to lock you in . It is — ”
126029	126047	126024	126024	he	210	“ five minutes to midnight . Miss Granger , three turns should do it . Good luck . ”
126048	126052	126053	126053	Harry	117	“ Good luck ? ”
126062	126079	126053	126053	Harry	117	“ Three turns ? What ’s he talking about ? What are we supposed to do ? ”
126104	126110	126111	126111	she	313	“ Harry , come here , ”
126115	126118	126111	126111	she	313	“ Quick ! ”
126145	126148	126127	126127	She	313	“ Here — ”
126159	126162	126163	126163	she	313	“ Ready ? ”
126167	126173	126174	126174	Harry	117	“ What are we doing ? ”
126296	126302	126279	126279	He	117	“ Hermione , what — ? ”
126303	126307	126308	126308	Hermione	313	“ In here ! ”
126347	126357	126327	126327	she	313	“ What — how — Hermione , what happened ? ”
126358	126366	126367	126367	Hermione	313	“ We ’ve gone back in time , ”
126381	126386	126367	126367	Hermione	313	“ Three hours back ... ”
126421	126424	126367	126367	Hermione	313	“ But — ”
126425	126444	126367	126367	Hermione	313	“ Shh ! Listen ! Someone ’s coming ! I think — I think it might be us ! ”
126455	126474	126445	126445	Hermione	313	“ Footsteps across the hall ... yes , I think it ’s us going down to Hagrid ’s ! ”
126475	126481	126482	126482	Harry	117	“ Are you telling me , ”
126485	126500	126482	126482	Harry	117	“ that we ’re here in this cupboard and we ’re out there too ? ”
126501	126504	126506	126506	Hermione	313	“ Yes , ”
126517	126548	126506	126506	Hermione	313	“ I ’m sure it ’s us . It does n’t sound like more than three people ... and we ’re walking slowly because we ’re under the Invisibility Cloak — ”
126557	126566	126549	126549	She	313	“ We ’ve gone down the front steps ... ”
126587	126596	126567	126567	Hermione	313	“ Where did you get that hourglass thing ? ”
126597	126606	126607	126607	Hermione	313	“ It ’s called a Time - Turner , ”
126610	126724	126607	126607	Hermione	313	“ and I got it from Professor McGonagall on our first day back . I ’ve been using it all year to get to all my lessons . Professor McGonagall made me swear I would n’t tell anyone . She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of Magic so I could have one . She had to tell them that I was a model student , and that I ’d never , ever use it for anything except my studies ... I ’ve been turning it back so I could do hours over again , that ’s how I ’ve been doing several lessons at once , see ? But ...
126725	126758	126820	126820	Hermione	313	“ Harry , I do n’t understand what Dumbledore wants us to do . Why did he tell us to go back three hours ? How ’s that going to help Sirius ? ”
126766	126781	126782	126782	he	117	“ There must be something that happened around now he wants us to change , ”
126786	126801	126782	126782	he	117	“ What happened ? We were walking down to Hagrid ’s three hours ago ... ”
126802	126818	126820	126820	Hermione	313	“ This is three hours ago , and we are walking down to Hagrid ’s , ”
126822	126829	126820	126820	Hermione	313	“ We just heard ourselves leaving ... ”
126847	126863	126782	126782	he	117	“ Dumbledore just said — just said we could save more than one innocent life ... ”
126870	126880	126782	126782	he	117	“ Hermione , we ’re going to save Buckbeak ! ”
126881	126890	126830	126830	Harry	117	“ But — how will that help Sirius ? ”
126891	126944	126782	126782	he	117	“ Dumbledore said — he just told us where the window is — the window of Flitwick ’s office ! Where they ’ve got Sirius locked up ! We ’ve got to fly Buckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius ! Sirius can escape on Buckbeak — they can escape together ! ”
126959	126974	126955	126955	she	313	“ If we manage that without being seen , it ’ll be a miracle ! ”
126975	126988	126990	126990	Harry	117	“ Well , we ’ve got to try , have n’t we ? ”
127003	127019	126992	126992	He	117	“ Does n’t sound like anyone ’s there ... Come on , let ’s go ... ”
127074	127084	127085	127085	Hermione	313	“ If anyone ’s looking out of the window — ”
127096	127103	127105	127105	Harry	117	“ We ’ll run for it , ”
127108	127132	127105	127105	Harry	117	“ Straight into the forest , all right ? We ’ll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout — ”
127133	127145	127147	127147	Hermione	313	“ Okay , but we ’ll go around by the greenhouses ! ”
127150	127180	127147	127147	Hermione	313	“ We need to keep out of sight of Hagrid ’s front door , or we ’ll see us ! We must be nearly at Hagrid ’s by now ! ”
127262	127265	127266	127266	she	313	“ Right , ”
127269	127286	127266	127266	she	313	“ We need to sneak over to Hagrid ’s ... Keep out of sight , Harry ... ”
127366	127388	127362	127362	his	117	“ It ’s us . We ’re wearing the Invisibility Cloak . Let us in and we can take it off . ”
127389	127394	127395	127395	Hagrid	305	“ Yeh shouldn’ve come ! ”
127408	127419	127420	127420	Harry	117	“ This is the weirdest thing we ’ve ever done , ”
127424	127432	127433	127433	Hermione	313	“ Let ’s move along a bit , ”
127436	127445	127433	127433	Hermione	313	“ We need to get nearer to Buckbeak ! ”
127468	127471	127472	127472	Harry	117	“ Now ? ”
127475	127478	127480	127480	Hermione	313	“ No ! ”
127482	127513	127480	127480	Hermione	313	“ If we steal him now , those Committee people will think Hagrid set him free ! We ’ve got to wait until they ’ve seen he ’s tied outside ! ”
127514	127525	127527	127527	Harry	117	“ That ’s going to give us about sixty seconds , ”
127553	127562	127563	127563	Hermione	313	“ That ’s Hagrid breaking the milk jug , ”
127566	127577	127563	127563	Hermione	313	“ I ’m going to find Scabbers in a moment — ”
127594	127597	127599	127599	Harry	117	“ Hermione , ”
127602	127616	127599	127599	Harry	117	“ what if we — we just run in there and grab Pettigrew — ”
127617	127620	127622	127622	Hermione	313	“ No ! ”
127628	127663	127622	127622	Hermione	313	“ Do n’t you understand ? We ’re breaking one of the most important Wizarding laws ! Nobody ’s supposed to change time , nobody ! You heard Dumbledore , if we ’re seen — ”
127664	127675	127599	127599	Harry	117	“ We ’d only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid ! ”
127676	127696	127698	127698	Hermione	313	“ Harry , what do you think you ’d do if you saw yourself bursting into Hagrid ’s house ? ”
127700	127712	127714	127714	Harry	117	“ I ’d — I ’d think I ’d gone mad , ”
127716	127729	127714	127714	Harry	117	“ or I ’d think there was some Dark Magic going on — ”
127730	127779	127800	127800	Hermione	313	“ Exactly ! You would n’t understand , you might even attack yourself ! Do n’t you see ? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time ... Loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistake ! ”
127780	127783	127785	127785	Harry	117	“ Okay ! ”
127787	127798	127785	127785	Harry	117	“ It was just an idea , I just thought — ”
127846	127854	127855	127855	Hermione	313	“ We ’re about to come out ! ”
127914	127926	127927	127927	Hagrid	305	“ It ’s okay , Beaky , it ’s okay ... , ”

127951	127958	127933	127933	he	305	“ Hagrid , we ca n’t — ”
127959	127968	127933	127933	he	305	“ We ’ll tell them what really happened — ”
127969	127976	127933	127933	he	305	“ They ca n’t kill him — ”
127977	127993	127933	127933	he	305	“ Go ! It ’s bad enough without you lot in trouble an ’ all ! ”
128011	128019	127996	127997	the Hermione	2439	“ Go quick . Don ’ listen ... ”

128153	128199	128200	128200	Macnair	355	“ We — er — have to read you the official notice of execution , Hagrid . I ’ll make it quick . And then you and Macnair need to sign it . Macnair , you ’re supposed to listen too , that ’s procedure — ”
128214	128218	128219	128219	Harry	117	“ Wait here , ”
128224	128230	128219	128219	Harry	117	“ I ’ll do it . ”
128258	128293	128238	128238	Harry	117	“ It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak , hereafter called the condemned , shall be executed on the sixth of June at sundown — ”
128340	128364	128325	128325	Harry	117	“ . . . sentenced to execution by beheading , to be carried out by the Committee ’s appointed executioner , Walden Macnair ... ”
128365	128371	128372	128372	Harry	117	“ Come on , Buckbeak , ”
128375	128390	128372	128372	Harry	117	“ come on , we ’re going to help you . Quietly ... quietly ... ”

128447	128460	128438	128445	the Committee member from inside Hagrid ’s cabin	2447	“ Hagrid , perhaps it will be better if you stay inside — ”
128461	128484	128501	128501	Harry	117	“ No , I — I wan ’ ter be with him ... I don ’ wan ’ him ter be alone — ”
128492	128497	128498	128498	Harry	117	“ Buckbeak , move ! ”

128556	128563	128552	128552	Dumbledore	210	“ You need to sign too . ”
128596	128601	128602	128602	she	313	“ Harry , hurry ! ”
128638	128643	128644	128644	Hermione	313	“ Quick ! Quick ! ”
128691	128694	128695	128695	he	117	“ Stop ! ”
128700	128706	128695	128695	he	117	“ They might hear us — ”
128740	128745	128751	128753	the Committee member	2456	“ Where is it ? ”
128755	128761	128751	128753	the Committee member	2456	“ Where is the beast ? ”
128762	128768	128770	128771	the executioner	3788	“ It was tied here ! ”
128774	128782	128770	128771	the executioner	3788	“ I saw it ! Just here ! ”
128783	128787	128798	128798	his	210	“ How extraordinary , ”

128913	128918	128919	128920	the executioner	3788	“ Someone untied him ! ”
128924	128934	128919	128920	the executioner	3788	“ We should search the grounds , the forest — ”
128935	128959	128961	128961	Dumbledore	210	“ Macnair , if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen , do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot ? ”
128967	128992	128961	128961	Dumbledore	210	“ Search the skies , if you will ... Hagrid , I could do with a cup of tea . Or a large brandy . ”
128993	129003	129005	129005	Hagrid	305	“ O ’ — o ’ course , Professor , ”
129013	129020	129005	129005	Hagrid	305	“ Come in , come in ... ”
129050	129054	129056	129056	Harry	117	“ Now what ? ”
129061	129070	129072	129072	Hermione	313	“ We ’ll have to hide in here , ”
129079	129129	129072	129072	Hermione	313	“ We need to wait until they ’ve gone back to the castle . Then we wait until it ’s safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius ’s window . He wo n’t be there for another couple of hours ... Oh , this is going to be difficult ... ”
129149	129158	129160	129160	Harry	117	“ We ’re going to have to move , ”
129165	129188	129160	129160	Harry	117	“ We ’ve got to be able to see the Whomping Willow , or we wo n’t know what ’s going on . ”
129189	129192	129194	129194	Hermione	313	“ Okay , ”
129205	129220	129194	129194	Hermione	313	“ But we ’ve got to keep out of sight , Harry , remember ... ”
129254	129259	129261	129261	Harry	117	“ There ’s Ron ! ”
129282	129296	129264	129266	A dark figure	2466	“ Get away from him — get away — Scabbers , come here — ”
129324	129334	129321	129321	Ron	147	“ Gotcha ! Get off , you stinking cat — ”
129335	129340	129342	129342	Harry	117	“ There ’s Sirius ! ”
129371	129382	129384	129384	Harry	117	“ Looks even worse from here , does n’t it ? ”
129395	129417	129384	129384	Harry	117	“ Ouch — look , I just got walloped by the tree — and so did you — this is weird — ”
129452	129460	129462	129462	Hermione	313	“ That was Crookshanks pressing the knot , ”
129464	129471	129472	129472	Harry	117	“ And there we go ... , ”
129475	129480	129472	129472	Harry	117	“ We ’re in . ”
129523	129534	129536	129536	Hermione	313	“ Right after we ’d gone down into the passage ! ”
129538	129547	129536	129536	Hermione	313	“ If only Dumbledore had come with us ... ”
129548	129557	129559	129559	Harry	117	“ Macnair and Fudge would ’ve come too , ”
129562	129579	129559	129559	Harry	117	“ I bet you anything Fudge would ’ve told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot ... ”
129605	129610	129612	129612	Harry	117	“ Here comes Lupin ! ”
129679	129688	129690	129690	Harry	117	“ If he ’d only grabbed the Cloak , ”
129692	129699	129690	129690	Harry	117	“ It ’s just lying there ... ”
129705	129725	129700	129700	He	117	“ If I just dashed out now and grabbed it , Snape’d never be able to get it and — ”
129726	129735	129700	129700	He	117	“ Harry , we must n’t be seen ! ”
129736	129743	129744	129744	he	117	“ How can you stand this ? ”
129749	129758	129759	129759	He	117	“ Just standing here and watching it happen ? ”
129762	129771	129759	129759	He	117	“ I ’m going to grab the Cloak ! ”
129772	129777	129802	129802	It	2475	“ Harry , no ! ”
129838	129841	129842	129842	Hermione	313	“ See ? ”
129845	129865	129842	129842	Hermione	313	“ See what would have happened ? We ’ve got to keep out of sight ! No , Buckbeak ! ”
129971	129979	129980	129980	Harry	117	“ Get your filthy hands off it , ”
129986	129989	129983	129983	his	117	“ Shh ! ”
130017	130023	130025	130025	Hermione	313	“ So that ’s it , ”
130028	130050	130025	130025	Hermione	313	“ We ’re all down there ... and now we ’ve just got to wait until we come back up again ... ”
130081	130120	130051	130051	She	313	“ Harry , there ’s something I do n’t understand ... Why did n’t the dementors get Sirius ? I remember them coming , and then I think I passed out ... there were so many of them ... ”
130177	130183	130164	130164	Hermione	313	“ But what was it ? ”
130184	130201	130203	130203	Harry	117	“ There ’s only one thing it could have been , to make the dementors go , ”
130205	130214	130203	130203	Harry	117	“ A real Patronus . A powerful one . ”
130215	130221	130164	130164	Hermione	313	“ But who conjured it ? ”
130262	130272	130274	130274	Hermione	313	“ Did n’t you see what they looked like ? ”
130277	130285	130274	130274	Hermione	313	“ Was it one of the teachers ? ”
130286	130289	130291	130291	Harry	117	“ No , ”
130293	130300	130291	130291	Harry	117	“ He was n’t a teacher . ”
130301	130340	130274	130274	Hermione	313	“ But it must have been a really powerful wizard , to drive all those dementors away ... If the Patronus was shining so brightly , did n’t it light him up ? Could n’t you see — ? ”
130341	130348	130350	130350	Harry	117	“ Yeah , I saw him , ”
130353	130373	130350	130350	Harry	117	“ But ... maybe I imagined it ... I was n’t thinking straight ... I passed out right afterward ... ”
130374	130382	130274	130274	Hermione	313	“ Who did you think it was ? ”
130383	130387	130388	130388	Harry	117	“ I think — ”
130400	130408	130388	130388	Harry	117	“ I think it was my dad . ”
130437	130448	130449	130449	she	313	“ Harry , your dad ’s — well — dead , ”
130453	130458	130460	130460	Harry	117	“ I know that , ”
130463	130471	130523	130523	Hermione	313	“ You think you saw his ghost ? ”
130472	130484	130523	130523	Hermione	313	“ I do n’t know ... no ... he looked solid ... ”
130485	130489	130523	130523	Hermione	313	“ But then — ”
130490	130497	130499	130499	Harry	117	“ Maybe I was seeing things , ”
130501	130522	130499	130499	Harry	117	“ But ... from what I could see ... it looked like him ... I ’ve got photos of him ... ”
130536	130543	130545	130545	Harry	117	“ I know it sounds crazy , ”
130716	130721	130722	130722	Hermione	313	“ Here we come ! ”
130816	130819	130824	130824	she	313	“ Harry , ”
130832	130853	130824	130824	she	313	“ we ’ve got to stay put . We must n’t be seen . There ’s nothing we can do ... ”
130854	130868	130870	130870	Harry	117	“ So we ’re just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again ... ”
130873	130886	130888	130888	Hermione	313	“ How do you expect to find a rat in the dark ? ”
130890	130915	130888	130888	Hermione	313	“ There ’s nothing we can do ! We came back to help Sirius . We ’re not supposed to be doing anything else ! ”
130916	130920	130951	130951	Hermione	313	“ All right ! ”
130945	130950	130951	130951	Hermione	313	“ There goes Lupin , ”
130954	130959	130951	130951	Hermione	313	“ He ’s transforming — ”
130960	130963	130965	130965	Harry	117	“ Hermione ! ”
130968	130975	130965	130965	Harry	117	“ We ’ve got to move ! ”
130976	130986	130951	130951	Hermione	313	“ We must n’t , I keep telling you — ”
130987	131005	130965	130965	Harry	117	“ Not to interfere ! Lupin ’s going to run into the forest , right at us ! ”
131009	131012	131013	131013	she	313	“ Quick ! ”
131021	131046	131013	131013	she	313	“ Quick ! Where are we going to go ? Where are we going to hide ? The dementors will be coming any moment — ”
131047	131053	131054	131054	Harry	117	“ Back to Hagrid ’s ! ”
131057	131066	131054	131054	Harry	117	“ It ’s empty now — come on ! ”
131131	131140	131142	131142	Hermione	313	“ Shh , Fang , it ’s us ! ”
131154	131160	131161	131161	she	313	“ That was really close ! ”
131166	131169	131161	131161	she	313	“ Yeah ... ”
131226	131239	131241	131241	Harry	117	“ I think I ’d better go outside again , you know , ”
131244	131263	131241	131241	Harry	117	“ I ca n’t see what ’s going on — we wo n’t know when it ’s time — ”
131273	131283	131285	131285	Harry	117	“ I ’m not going to try and interfere , ”
131288	131314	131285	131285	Harry	117	“ But if we do n’t see what ’s going on , how ’re we going to know when it ’s time to rescue Sirius ? ”
131315	131346	131377	131377	Hermione	313	“ Well ... okay , then ... I ’ll wait here with Buckbeak ... but Harry , be careful — there ’s a werewolf out there — and the dementors — ”
131630	131634	131635	131635	he	117	“ Come on ! ”
131641	131651	131635	131635	he	117	“ Where are you ? Dad , come on — ”
131734	131738	131739	131739	he	117	“ EXPECTO PATRONUM ! ”
131940	131943	131944	131944	he	117	“ Prongs , ”
131999	132005	132006	132006	she	313	“ What did you do ? ”
132010	132022	132006	132006	she	313	“ You said you were only going to keep a lookout ! ”
132023	132032	132034	132034	Harry	117	“ I just saved all our lives ... , ”
132036	132049	132034	132034	Harry	117	“ Get behind here — behind this bush — I ’ll explain . ”
132064	132070	132058	132058	her	313	“ Did anyone see you ? ”
132071	132095	132006	132006	she	313	“ Yes , have n’t you been listening ? I saw me but I thought I was my dad ! It ’s okay ! ”
132096	132125	132058	132058	her	313	“ Harry , I ca n’t believe it ... You conjured up a Patronus that drove away all those dementors ! That ’s very , very advanced magic ... ”
132126	132136	132138	132138	Harry	117	“ I knew I could do it this time , ”
132140	132153	132138	132138	Harry	117	“ because I ’d already done it ... Does that make sense ? ”
132154	132166	132058	132058	her	313	“ I do n’t know — Harry , look at Snape ! ”
132236	132244	132246	132246	Hermione	313	“ Right , it ’s nearly time , ”
132254	132292	132246	132246	Hermione	313	“ We ’ve got about forty - five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing . We ’ve got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes we ’re missing ... ”
132326	132335	132337	132337	Harry	117	“ D’you reckon he ’s up there yet ? ”
132362	132365	132366	132366	Hermione	313	“ Look ! ”
132369	132383	132366	132366	Hermione	313	“ Who ’s that ? Someone ’s coming back out of the castle ! ”
132411	132414	132416	132416	Harry	117	“ Macnair ! ”
132418	132436	132416	132416	Harry	117	“ The executioner ! He ’s gone to get the dementors ! This is it , Hermione — ”
132497	132500	132501	132501	he	117	“ Ready ? ”
132506	132515	132501	132501	he	117	“ You ’d better hold on to me — ”
132566	132586	132563	132563	her	313	“ Oh , no — I do n’t like this — oh , I really do n’t like this — ”
132631	132634	132635	132635	he	117	“ Whoa ! ”
132681	132686	132687	132687	Harry	117	“ He ’s there ! ”
132752	132756	132763	132763	she	313	“ Stand back ! ”
132782	132785	132763	132763	she	313	“ Alohomora ! ”
132791	132797	132799	132799	Black	152	“ How — how — ? ”
132807	132817	132819	132819	Harry	117	“ Get on — there ’s not much time , ”
132836	132858	132819	132819	Harry	117	“ You ’ve got to get out of here — the dementors are coming — Macnair ’s gone to get them . ”
132912	132919	132921	132921	Harry	117	“ Okay , Buckbeak , up ! ”
132927	132936	132921	132921	Harry	117	“ Up to the tower — come on ! ”
132981	132991	132992	132992	Harry	117	“ Sirius , you ’d better go , quick , ”
132995	133013	132992	132992	Harry	117	“ They ’ll reach Flitwick ’s office any moment , they ’ll find out you ’re gone . ”
133024	133034	133036	133036	Sirius	152	“ What happened to the other boy ? Ron ? ”
133038	133070	133036	133036	Sirius	152	“ He ’s going to be okay . He ’s still out of it , but Madam Pomfrey says she ’ll be able to make him better . Quick — go — ”
133080	133087	133072	133072	Black	152	“ How can I ever thank — ”
133088	133091	133092	133092	Harry	117	“ GO ! ”
133108	133116	133117	133117	he	152	“ We ’ll see each other again , ”
133120	133132	133117	133117	he	152	“ You are — truly your father ’s son , Harry ... ”
133189	133192	133185	133185	They	2551	“ Harry ! ”
133205	133231	133202	133202	her	313	“ We ’ve got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us — before Dumbledore locks the door — ”
133232	133235	133237	133237	Harry	117	“ Okay , ”
133246	133251	133237	133237	Harry	117	“ let ’s go ... ”
133309	133323	133324	133324	Snape	260	“ . . . only hope Dumbledore ’s not going to make difficulties , ”
133328	133336	133324	133324	Snape	260	“ The Kiss will be performed immediately ? ”
133337	133417	133432	133432	he	260	“ As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors . This whole Black affair has been highly embarrassing . I ca n’t tell you how much I ’m looking forward to informing the Daily Prophet that we ’ve got him at last ... I daresay they ’ll want to interview you , Snape ... and once young Harry ’s back in his right mind , I expect he ’ll want to tell the Prophet exactly how you saved him ... ”
133491	133494	133495	133495	Harry	117	“ Peeves ! ”
133503	133507	133495	133495	Harry	117	“ In here ! ”
133539	133546	133550	133550	her	313	“ Oh , he ’s horrible , ”
133556	133573	133574	133574	She	313	“ I bet he ’s all excited because the dementors are going to finish off Sirius ... ”
133579	133585	133574	133574	She	313	“ Three minutes , Harry ! ”
133613	133634	133635	133635	Harry	117	“ Hermione — what ’ll happen — if we do n’t get back inside — before Dumbledore locks the door ? ”
133638	133648	133649	133649	Hermione	313	“ I do n’t want to think about it ! ”
133657	133661	133649	133649	Hermione	313	“ One minute ! ”
133676	133684	133686	133686	Hermione	313	“ Okay — I can hear Dumbledore , ”
133689	133695	133686	133686	Hermione	313	“ Come on , Harry ! ”
133711	133720	133723	133723	him	210	“ I am going to lock you in , ”
133726	133746	133723	133723	him	210	“ It is five minutes to midnight . Miss Granger , three turns should do it . Good luck . ”
133791	133794	133795	133795	he	210	“ Well ? ”
133799	133804	133806	133806	Harry	117	“ We did it ! ”
133809	133817	133806	133806	Harry	117	“ Sirius has gone , on Buckbeak ... ”
133823	133830	133831	133831	He	210	“ Well done . I think — ”
133842	133861	133831	133831	He	210	“ Yes , I think you ’ve gone too — get inside — I ’ll lock you in — ”
133930	133948	133920	133921	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ Did I hear the headmaster leaving ? Am I allowed to look after my patients now ? ”
134028	134033	134035	134036	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ What was that ? ”
134060	134077	134052	134053	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ Really — they ’ll wake everybody up ! What do they think they ’re doing ? ”
134094	134118	134089	134089	They	2555	“ He must have Disapparated , Severus . We should have left somebody in the room with him . When this gets out — ”
134119	134124	134125	134125	Snape	260	“ HE DIDN’T DISAPPARATE ! ”
134134	134158	134125	134125	Snape	260	“ YOU CAN’T APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE ! THIS — HAS — SOMETHING — TO — DO — WITH — POTTER ! ”
134159	134171	134172	134172	BAM	368	“ Severus — be reasonable — Harry has been locked up — ”
134222	134229	134230	134230	he	260	“ OUT WITH IT , POTTER ! ”
134233	134239	134230	134230	he	260	“ WHAT DID YOU DO ? ”
134240	134244	134246	134247	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ Professor Snape ! ”
134249	134253	134246	134247	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ Control yourself ! ”
134254	134263	134265	134265	Fudge	173	“ See here , Snape , be reasonable , ”
134267	134278	134265	134265	Fudge	173	“ This door ’s been locked , we just saw — ”
134279	134289	134290	134290	Snape	260	“ THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE , I KNOW IT ! ”
134311	134317	134318	134318	Fudge	173	“ Calm down , man ! ”
134321	134327	134318	134318	Fudge	173	“ You ’re talking nonsense ! ”
134328	134334	134336	134336	Snape	260	“ YOU DON’T KNOW POTTER ! ”
134338	134349	134336	134336	Snape	260	“ HE DID IT , I KNOW HE DID IT — ”
134350	134357	134359	134359	Dumbledore	210	“ That will do , Severus , ”
134362	134394	134359	134359	Dumbledore	210	“ Think about what you are saying . This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago . Madam Pomfrey , have these students left their beds ? ”
134395	134400	134402	134403	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ Of course not ! ”
134407	134414	134402	134403	Madam Pomfrey	205	“ I would have heard them ! ”
134415	134425	134427	134427	Dumbledore	210	“ Well , there you have it , Severus , ”
134430	134463	134427	134427	Dumbledore	210	“ Unless you are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at once , I ’m afraid I do n’t see any point in troubling them further . ”
134509	134515	134517	134517	Fudge	173	“ Fellow seems quite unbalanced , ”
134523	134537	134517	134517	Fudge	173	“ I ’d watch out for him if I were you , Dumbledore . ”
134538	134546	134548	134548	Dumbledore	210	“ Oh , he ’s not unbalanced , ”
134551	134560	134548	134548	Dumbledore	210	“ He ’s just suffered a severe disappointment . ”
134561	134569	134571	134571	Fudge	173	“ He ’s not the only one ! ”
134573	134633	134571	134571	Fudge	173	“ The Daily Prophet ’s going to have a field day ! We had Black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again ! All it needs now is for the story of that hippogriff ’s escape to get out , and I ’ll be a laughingstock ! Well ... I ’d better go and notify the Ministry ... ”
134634	134639	134641	134641	Dumbledore	210	“ And the dementors ? ”
134643	134655	134641	134641	Dumbledore	210	“ They ’ll be removed from the school , I trust ? ”
134656	134666	134668	134668	Fudge	173	“ Oh yes , they ’ll have to go , ”
134678	134722	134671	134671	his	173	“ Never dreamed they ’d attempt to administer the Kiss on an innocent boy ... Completely out of control ... no , I ’ll have them packed off back to Azkaban tonight ... Perhaps we should think about dragons at the school entrance ... ”
134723	134729	134731	134731	Dumbledore	210	“ Hagrid would like that , ”
134804	134810	134811	134811	he	147	“ What — what happened ? ”
134814	134836	134811	134811	he	147	“ Harry ? Why are we in here ? Where ’s Sirius ? Where ’s Lupin ? What ’s going on ? ”
134845	134849	134851	134851	Harry	117	“ You explain , ”
135026	135042	135043	135043	he	305	“ Know I shouldn ’ feel happy , after wha ’ happened las ’ night , ”
135046	135064	135043	135043	he	305	“ I mean , Black escapin ’ again , an ’ everythin ’ — but guess what ? ”
135065	135068	135069	135069	they	2581	“ What ? ”
135077	135093	135043	135043	he	305	“ Beaky ! He escaped ! He ’s free ! Bin celebratin ’ all night ! ”
135094	135099	135101	135101	Hermione	313	“ That ’s wonderful ! ”
135119	135130	135132	135132	Hagrid	305	“ Yeah ... ca n’t ’ve tied him up properly , ”
135141	135173	135132	135132	Hagrid	305	“ I was worried this mornin ’ , mind ... thought he mighta met Professor Lupin on the grounds , but Lupin says he never ate anythin ’ las ’ night ... ”
135174	135177	135179	135179	Harry	117	“ What ? ”
135182	135190	135192	135192	Hagrid	305	“ Blimey , haven ’ yeh heard ? ”
135213	135261	135200	135200	He	305	“ Er — Snape told all the Slytherins this mornin ’ ... Thought everyone’d know by now ... Professor Lupin ’s a werewolf , see . An ’ he was loose on the grounds las ’ night ... He ’s packin ’ now , o ’ course . ”
135262	135267	135269	135269	Harry	117	“ He ’s packing ? ”
135273	135276	135269	135269	Harry	117	“ Why ? ”
135277	135285	135287	135287	Hagrid	305	“ Leavin ’ , isn ’ he ? ”
135297	135316	135287	135287	Hagrid	305	“ Resigned firs ’ thing this mornin ’ . Says he ca n’t risk it happenin ’ again . ”
135323	135331	135332	135332	he	117	“ I ’m going to see him , ”
135339	135346	135287	135287	Hagrid	305	“ But if he ’s resigned — ”
135347	135360	135287	135287	Hagrid	305	“ — does n’t sound like there ’s anything we can do — ”
135361	135381	135287	135287	Hagrid	305	“ I do n’t care . I still want to see him . I ’ll meet you back here . ”
135437	135443	135445	135445	Lupin	195	“ I saw you coming , ”
135467	135473	135475	135475	Harry	117	“ I just saw Hagrid , ”
135477	135493	135475	135475	Harry	117	“ And he said you ’d resigned . It ’s not true , is it ? ”
135494	135501	135503	135503	Lupin	195	“ I ’m afraid it is , ”
135517	135520	135522	135522	Harry	117	“ Why ? ”
135524	135540	135522	135522	Harry	117	“ The Ministry of Magic do n’t think you were helping Sirius , do they ? ”
135552	135570	135571	135571	He	195	“ No . Professor Dumbledore managed to convince Fudge that I was trying to save your lives . ”
135574	135614	135571	135571	He	195	“ That was the final straw for Severus . I think the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard . So he — er — accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast . ”
135615	135625	135627	135627	Harry	117	“ You ’re not leaving just because of that ! ”
135633	135682	135571	135571	He	195	“ This time tomorrow , the owls will start arriving from parents ... They will not want a werewolf teaching their children , Harry . And after last night , I see their point . I could have bitten any of you ... That must never happen again . ”
135683	135699	135701	135701	Harry	117	“ You ’re the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we ’ve ever had ! ”
135703	135708	135701	135701	Harry	117	“ Do n’t go ! ”
135745	135787	135742	135742	Lupin	195	“ From what the headmaster told me this morning , you saved a lot of lives last night , Harry . If I ’m proud of anything , it ’s how much you ’ve learned ... Tell me about your Patronus . ”
135788	135795	135797	135797	Harry	117	“ How d’you know about that ? ”
135801	135811	135742	135742	Lupin	195	“ What else could have driven the dementors back ? ”
135829	135842	135843	135843	he	195	“ Yes , your father was always a stag when he transformed , ”
135846	135859	135843	135843	he	195	“ You guessed right ... that ’s why we called him Prongs . ”
135882	135895	135896	135896	he	195	“ Here — I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last night , ”
135906	135909	135910	135910	He	195	“ And ... ”
135922	135966	135910	135910	He	195	“ I am no longer your teacher , so I do n’t feel guilty about giving you this back as well . It ’s no use to me , and I daresay you , Ron , and Hermione will find uses for it . ”
135974	136006	135967	135967	Harry	117	“ You told me Moony , Wormtail , Padfoot , and Prongs would ’ve wanted to lure me out of school ... you said they ’d have thought it was funny . ”
136007	136014	136016	136016	Lupin	195	“ And so we would have , ”
136026	136056	136016	136016	Lupin	195	“ I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle . ”
136095	136105	136106	136106	he	210	“ Your carriage is at the gates , Remus , ”
136109	136115	136116	136116	Lupin	195	“ Thank you , Headmaster . ”
136128	136137	136138	136138	he	195	“ Well — good - bye , Harry , ”
136143	136179	136138	136138	he	195	“ It has been a real pleasure teaching you . I feel sure we ’ll meet again sometime . Headmaster , there is no need to see me to the gates , I can manage ... ”
136194	136203	136205	136205	Dumbledore	210	“ Good - bye , then , Remus , ”
136269	136276	136277	136277	he	210	“ Why so miserable , Harry ? ”
136281	136293	136277	136277	he	210	“ You should be very proud of yourself after last night . ”
136294	136302	136304	136304	Harry	117	“ It did n’t make any difference , ”
136307	136312	136304	136304	Harry	117	“ Pettigrew got away . ”
136313	136320	136322	136322	Dumbledore	210	“ Did n’t make any difference ? ”
136325	136353	136322	136322	Dumbledore	210	“ It made all the difference in the world , Harry . You helped uncover the truth . You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate . ”
136376	136398	136304	136304	Harry	117	“ Professor Dumbledore — yesterday , when I was having my Divination exam , Professor Trelawney went very — very strange . ”
136399	136402	136404	136404	Dumbledore	210	“ Indeed ? ”
136406	136416	136404	136404	Dumbledore	210	“ Er — stranger than usual , you mean ? ”
136417	136462	136463	136463	Harry	117	“ Yes ... her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said ... she said Voldemort ’s servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight ... She said the servant would help him come back to power . ”
136469	136499	136463	136463	Harry	117	“ And then she sort of became normal again , and she could n’t remember anything she ’d said . Was it — was she making a real prediction ? ”
136505	136519	136520	136520	he	210	“ Do you know , Harry , I think she might have been , ”
136524	136550	136520	136520	he	210	“ Who ’d have thought it ? That brings her total of real predictions up to two . I should offer her a pay raise ... ”
136551	136554	136555	136555	Harry	117	“ But — ”
136570	136593	136520	136520	he	210	“ But — I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew ! That makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back ! ”
136594	136599	136601	136601	Dumbledore	210	“ It does not , ”
136604	136669	136601	136601	Dumbledore	210	“ Has n’t your experience with the Time - Turner taught you anything , Harry ? The consequences of our actions are always so complicated , so diverse , that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed ... Professor Trelawney , bless her , is living proof of that ... You did a very noble thing , in saving Pettigrew ’s life . ”
136670	136681	136520	136520	he	210	“ But if he helps Voldemort back to power — ! ”
136682	136736	136601	136601	Dumbledore	210	“ Pettigrew owes his life to you . You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt . When one wizard saves another wizard ’s life , it creates a certain bond between them ... and I ’m much mistaken if Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry Potter . ”
136737	136747	136749	136749	Harry	117	“ I do n’t want a bond with Pettigrew ! ”
136751	136757	136749	136749	Harry	117	“ He betrayed my parents ! ”
136758	136792	136601	136601	Dumbledore	210	“ This is magic at its deepest , its most impenetrable , Harry . But trust me ... the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew ’s life . ”
136813	136829	136830	136830	he	210	“ I knew your father very well , both at Hogwarts and later , Harry , ”
136834	136848	136830	136830	he	210	“ He would have saved Pettigrew too , I am sure of it . ”
136865	136899	136863	136863	Dumbledore	210	“ Last night ... I thought it was my dad who ’d conjured my Patronus . I mean , when I saw myself across the lake ... I thought I was seeing him . ”
136900	136907	136909	136909	Dumbledore	210	“ An easy mistake to make , ”
136912	136942	136909	136909	Dumbledore	210	“ I expect you ’ll tire of hearing it , but you do look extraordinarily like James . Except for the eyes ... you have your mother ’s eyes . ”
136948	136958	136959	136959	he	117	“ It was stupid , thinking it was him , ”
136962	136972	136959	136959	he	117	“ I mean , I knew he was dead . ”
136973	137040	137050	137050	Dumbledore	210	“ You think the dead we have loved ever truly leave us ? You think that we do n’t recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble ? Your father is alive in you , Harry , and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him . How else could you produce that particular Patronus ? Prongs rode again last night . ”
137054	137067	137069	137069	Dumbledore	210	“ Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi , ”
137073	137129	137069	137069	Dumbledore	210	“ An extraordinary achievement — not least , keeping it quiet from me . And then I remembered the most unusual form your Patronus took , when it charged Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match against Ravenclaw . So you did see your father last night , Harry ... You found him inside yourself . ”
137258	137282	137283	137283	he	143	“ If I manage to get into the Ministry , I ’ll have a lot of proposals to make about Magical Law Enforcement ! ”
137372	137382	137384	137385	Seamus Finnigan	184	“ Wonder what they ’ll give us next year ? ”
137388	137393	137395	137396	Dean Thomas	178	“ Maybe a vampire , ”
137814	137836	137952	137952	She	313	“ I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning , just before breakfast . I ’ve decided to drop Muggle Studies . ”
137837	137850	137852	137852	Ron	147	“ But you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent ! ”
137854	137858	137860	137860	Hermione	313	“ I know , ”
137862	137908	137860	137860	Hermione	313	“ but I ca n’t stand another year like this one . That Time - Turner , it was driving me mad . I ’ve handed it in . Without Muggle Studies and Divination , I ’ll be able to have a normal schedule again . ”
137909	137923	137925	137925	Ron	147	“ I still ca n’t believe you did n’t tell us about it , ”
137928	137937	137925	137925	Ron	147	“ We ’re supposed to be your friends . ”
137938	137947	137949	137949	Hermione	313	“ I promised I would n’t tell anyone , ”
137979	137987	137989	137989	Hermione	313	“ Oh , cheer up , Harry ! ”
137992	137997	137999	137999	Harry	117	“ I ’m okay , ”
138002	138009	137999	137999	Harry	117	“ Just thinking about the holidays . ”
138010	138021	138023	138023	Ron	147	“ Yeah , I ’ve been thinking about them too , ”
138025	138063	138023	138023	Ron	147	“ Harry , you ’ve got to come and stay with us . I ’ll fix it up with Mum and Dad , then I ’ll call you . I know how to use a fellytone now — ”
138064	138070	138072	138072	Hermione	313	“ A telephone , Ron , ”
138074	138085	138072	138072	Hermione	313	“ Honestly , you should take Muggle Studies next year ... ”
138090	138126	138086	138086	Ron	147	“ It ’s the Quidditch World Cup this summer ! How about it , Harry ? Come and stay , and we ’ll go and see it ! Dad can usually get tickets from work . ”
138140	138163	138086	138086	Ron	147	“ Yeah ... I bet the Dursleys’d be pleased to let me come ... especially after what I did to Aunt Marge ... ”
138224	138227	138229	138229	Hermione	313	“ Harry , ”
138237	138246	138229	138229	Hermione	313	“ What ’s that thing outside your window ? ”
138444	138450	138435	138435	He	117	“ It ’s from Sirius ! ”
138451	138454	138456	138456	Ron	147	“ What ? ”
138461	138466	138456	138456	Ron	147	“ Read it aloud ! ”
138620	138623	138625	138625	Hermione	313	“ Ha ! ”
138628	138639	138625	138625	Hermione	313	“ See ! I told you it was from him ! ”
138640	138653	138655	138655	Ron	147	“ Yes , but he had n’t jinxed it , had he ? ”
138657	138660	138655	138655	Ron	147	“ Ouch ! ”
138895	138904	138906	138906	Harry	117	“ That ’ll be good enough for Dumbledore ! ”
138917	138925	138909	138909	He	117	“ Hang on , there ’s a P.S ...
138949	138950	138926	138926	I	0	” .
138964	138968	138969	138969	he	147	“ Keep him ? ”
139003	139008	139009	139009	Ron	147	“ What d’you reckon ? ”
139014	139019	139009	139009	Ron	147	“ Definitely an owl ? ”
139023	139031	139033	139033	Ron	147	“ That ’s good enough for me , ”
139036	139041	139033	139033	Ron	147	“ He ’s mine . ”
139128	139137	139138	139138	Ron	147	“ I ’ll call about the World Cup ! ”
139175	139180	139181	139181	he	123	“ What ’s that ? ”
139196	139212	139181	139181	he	123	“ If it ’s another form for me to sign , you ’ve got another — ”
139213	139218	139220	139220	Harry	117	“ It ’s not , ”
139223	139232	139220	139220	Harry	117	“ It ’s a letter from my godfather . ”
139233	139236	139238	139239	Uncle Vernon	123	“ Godfather ? ”
139241	139249	139238	139239	Uncle Vernon	123	“ You have n’t got a godfather ! ”
139250	139256	139258	139258	Harry	117	“ Yes , I have , ”
139261	139316	139258	139258	Harry	117	“ He was my mum and dad ’s best friend . He ’s a convicted murderer , but he ’s broken out of Wizard prison and he ’s on the run . He likes to keep in touch with me , though ... keep up with my news ... check if I ’m happy ... ”
