11444	11469	11441	11441	Myrtle	168	“ Who said I was crazy about him ? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there . ”
11501	11553	11554	11554	She	169	“ The only crazy I was when I married him . I knew right away I made a mistake . He borrowed somebody ’s best suit to get married in , and never even told me about it , and the man came after it one day when he was out . ”
11563	11607	11554	11554	She	169	“ ‘ Oh , is that your suit ? ’ I said . ‘ This is the first I ever heard about it . But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon . ”

He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes , and I could n’t keep my eyes off him , but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head . When we came into the station he was next to me , and his white shirt - front pressed against my arm , and so I told him I ’d have to call policeman , but he knew I lied . I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I did n’t hardly know I was n’t getting into a subway train . All I kept thinking about , over and over , was ‘ You ca n’t live forever ; you ca n’t live forever . ’ ”

I ’m going to make a list of all the things I ’ve got to get . A massage and a wave , and a collar for the dog , and one of those cute little ash - trays where you touch a spring , and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother ’s grave that ’ll last all summer . I got to write down a list so I wo n’t forget all the things I got to do . ”

42113	42117	42118	42118	Jordan	160	“ Remember Biloxi , ”
42122	42131	42118	42118	Jordan	160	“ Where ’d you know him , Tom ? ”
42132	42135	42136	42136	He	0	“ Biloxi ? ”
42142	42157	42136	42136	He	0	“ I did n’t know him . He was a friend of Daisy ’s . ”
42158	42163	42164	42164	she	152	“ He was not , ”
42167	42183	42164	42164	she	152	“ I ’d never seen him before . He came down in the private car . ”
42184	42219	42136	42136	He	0	“ Well , he said he knew you . He said he was raised in Louisville . Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him . ”
42223	42244	42220	42220	Jordan	160	“ He was probably bumming his way home . He told me he was president of your class at Yale . ”
42254	42257	42247	42247	I	0	“ Biloxi ? ”
42258	42269	42247	42247	I	0	“ First place , we did n’t have any president — ”
42285	42301	42280	42280	Tom	153	“ By the way , Mr. Gatsby , I understand you ’re an Oxford man . ”
42302	42306	42247	42247	I	0	“ Not exactly . ”
42307	42319	42280	42280	Tom	153	“ Oh , yes , I understand you went to Oxford . ”
42320	42327	42247	42247	I	0	“ Yes — I went there . ”
42339	42354	42332	42332	Tom	153	“ You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven . ”
42377	42380	42376	42376	his	1566	“ thank you ”
42400	42408	42410	42410	Gatsby	145	“ I told you I went there , ”
42412	42425	42376	42376	his	1566	“ I heard you , but I ’d like to know when . ”
42426	42453	42376	42376	his	1566	“ It was in nineteen - nineteen . I only stayed five months . That ’s why I ca n’t really call myself an Oxford man . ”
42473	42489	42490	42490	he	1566	“ It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the Armistice , ”
42493	42507	42490	42490	he	1566	“ We could go to any of the universities in England or France . ”
42549	42556	42557	42557	she	152	“ Open the whiskey , Tom , ”
42560	42585	42557	42557	she	152	“ and I ’ll make you a mint julep . Then you wo n’t seem so stupid to yourself .... Look at the mint ! ”
42586	42591	42593	42593	Tom	153	“ Wait a minute , ”
42595	42606	42593	42593	Tom	153	“ I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question . ”
42607	42611	42612	42612	Gatsby	145	“ Go on , ”
42616	42632	42612	42612	Gatsby	145	“ What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow ? ”
42646	42654	42655	42655	Daisy	152	“ He is n’t causing a row , ”
42664	42679	42655	42655	Daisy	152	“ You ’re causing a row . Please have a little self - control . ”
42680	42685	42687	42687	Tom	153	“ Self - control ! ”
42690	42752	42687	42687	Tom	153	“ I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife . Well , if that ’s the idea you can count me out .... Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions , and next they ’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white . ”
42771	42778	42780	42780	Jordan	160	“ We ’re all white here , ”
42782	42822	42780	42780	Jordan	160	“ I know I ’m not very popular . I do n’t give big parties . I suppose you ’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends — in the modern world . ”
42854	42866	42868	42868	Gatsby	145	“ I ’ve got something to tell you , old sport — ”
42877	42882	42883	42883	she	152	“ Please do n’t ! ”
42887	42903	42883	42883	she	152	“ Please let ’s all go home . Why do n’t we all go home ? ”
42904	42911	42912	42912	I	0	“ That ’s a good idea . ”
42916	42927	42912	42912	I	0	“ Come on , Tom . Nobody wants a drink . ”
42928	42941	42883	42883	she	152	“ I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me . ”
42942	42950	42952	42952	Gatsby	145	“ Your wife does n’t love you , ”
42954	42965	42952	42952	Gatsby	145	“ She ’s never loved you . She loves me . ”
42966	42972	42974	42974	Tom	153	“ You must be crazy ! ”
42987	42997	42998	42998	he	145	“ She never loved you , do you hear ? ”
43001	43037	42998	42998	he	145	“ She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me . It was a terrible mistake , but in her heart she never loved any one except me ! ”
43082	43088	43089	43089	Tom	153	“ Sit down , Daisy , ”
43099	43114	43089	43089	Tom	153	“ What ’s been going on ? I want to hear all about it . ”
43115	43125	43127	43127	Gatsby	145	“ I told you what ’s been going on , ”
43129	43142	43127	43127	Gatsby	145	“ Going on for five years — and you did n’t know . ”
43149	43160	43143	43143	Tom	153	“ You ’ve been seeing this fellow for five years ? ”
43161	43165	43167	43167	Gatsby	145	“ Not seeing , ”
43169	43197	43167	43167	Gatsby	145	“ No , we could n’t meet . But both of us loved each other all that time , old sport , and you did n’t know . ”
43198	43205	43206	43206	Tom	153	“ Oh — that ’s all . ”
43222	43227	43228	43228	he	145	“ You ’re crazy ! ”
43231	43301	43228	43228	he	145	“ I ca n’t speak about what happened five years ago because I did n’t know Daisy then — and I ’ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door . But all the rest of that ’s a God damned lie . Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now . ”
43302	43305	43307	43307	Gatsby	145	“ No , ”
43313	43340	43341	43341	He	145	“ She does , though . The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and does n’t know what she ’s doing . ”
43345	43389	43341	43341	He	145	“ And what ’s more I love Daisy too . Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself , but I always come back , and in my heart I love her all the time . ”
43390	43395	43397	43397	Daisy	152	“ You ’re revolting , ”
43420	43446	43405	43405	her	152	“ Do you know why we left Chicago ? I ’m surprised that they did n’t treat you to the story of that little spree . ”
43455	43464	43465	43465	he	145	“ Daisy , that ’s all over now , ”
43469	43497	43465	43465	he	145	“ It does n’t matter any more . Just tell him the truth — that you never loved him — and it ’s all wiped out forever . ”
43504	43515	43498	43498	She	152	“ Why — how could I love him — possibly ? ”
43516	43522	43523	43523	She	152	“ You never loved him . ”
43577	43583	43584	43584	she	152	“ I never loved him , ”
43591	43596	43598	43598	Tom	153	“ Not at Kapiolani ? ”
43601	43604	43648	43648	his	153	“ No . ”
43623	43641	43648	43648	his	153	“ Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry ? ”
43651	43654	43648	43648	his	153	“ Daisy ? ”
43655	43660	43661	43661	Her	152	“ Please do n’t . ”
43679	43684	43685	43685	she	152	“ There , Jay , ”
43714	43722	43723	43723	she	152	“ Oh , you want too much ! ”
43728	43746	43723	43723	she	152	“ I love you now — isn’t that enough ? I ca n’t help what ’s past . ”
43753	43766	43747	43747	She	152	“ I did love him once — but I loved you too . ”
43774	43780	43781	43781	he	145	“ You loved me too ? ”
43784	43791	43793	43793	Tom	153	“ Even that ’s a lie , ”
43796	43828	43793	43793	Tom	153	“ She did n’t know you were alive . Why — there’re things between Daisy and me that you ’ll never know , things that neither of us can ever forget . ”
43838	43847	43848	43848	he	145	“ I want to speak to Daisy alone , ”
43851	43858	43848	43848	he	145	“ She ’s all excited now — ”
43859	43871	43872	43872	she	1577	“ Even alone I ca n’t say I never loved Tom , ”
43879	43886	43872	43872	she	1577	“ It would n’t be true . ”
43887	43894	43896	43896	Tom	153	“ Of course it would n’t , ”
43904	43912	43913	43913	she	1577	“ As if it mattered to you , ”
43916	43935	43898	43898	She	1577	“ Of course it matters . I ’m going to take better care of you from now on . ”
43936	43942	43944	43944	Gatsby	145	“ You do n’t understand , ”
43952	43965	43944	43944	Gatsby	145	“ You ’re not going to take care of her any more . ”
43966	43971	43972	43972	Tom	153	“ I ’m not ? ”
43988	43993	43972	43972	Tom	153	“ Why ’s that ? ”
43994	44000	43944	43944	Gatsby	145	“ Daisy ’s leaving you . ”
44001	44004	43972	43972	Tom	153	“ Nonsense . ”
44005	44011	44012	44012	she	1577	“ I am , though , ”
44019	44026	44027	44027	Tom	153	“ She ’s not leaving me ! ”
44036	44056	44027	44027	Tom	153	“ Certainly not for a common swindler who ’d have to steal the ring he put on her finger . ”
44057	44064	44066	44066	Daisy	152	“ I wo n’t stand this ! ”
44068	44077	44066	44066	Daisy	152	“ Oh , please let ’s get out . ”
44078	44085	44088	44088	Tom	153	“ Who are you , anyhow ? ”
44090	44132	44088	44088	Tom	153	“ You ’re one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfsheim — that much I happen to know . I ’ve made a little investigation , into your affairs — and I ’ll carry it further to - morrow . ”
44133	44144	44146	44146	Gatsby	145	“ You can suit yourself about that , old sport , ”
44149	44160	44161	44161	He	145	“ I found out what your ‘ drugstores ’ were . ”
44169	44223	44161	44161	He	145	“ He and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of side - street drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter . That ’s one of his little stunts . I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him , and I was n’t far wrong . ”
44224	44229	44231	44231	Gatsby	145	“ What about it ? ”
44234	44251	44231	44231	Gatsby	145	“ I guess your friend Walter Chase was n’t too proud to come in on it . ”
44252	44292	44380	44380	Tom	153	“ And you left him in the lurch , did n’t you ? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey . God ! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of you . ”
44293	44314	44231	44231	Gatsby	145	“ He came to us dead broke . He was very glad to pick up some money , old sport . ”
44315	44326	44328	44328	Tom	153	“ Do n’t you call me ‘ old sport ’ ! ”
44334	44355	44330	44330	Gatsby	145	“ Walter could have you up on the betting laws too , but Wolfsheim scared him into shutting his mouth . ”
44369	44378	44380	44380	Tom	153	“ That drugstore business was just small change , ”
44383	44400	44380	44380	Tom	153	“ but you ’ve got something on now that Walter ’s afraid to tell me about . ”
44473	44478	44471	44471	he	145	“ killed a man . ”
44583	44596	44636	44636	She	152	“ Please , Tom ! I ca n’t stand this any more . ”
44615	44624	44626	44626	Tom	153	“ You two start on home . Daisy , ”
44628	44635	44626	44626	Tom	153	“ In Mr. Gatsby ’s car . ”
44651	44673	44636	44636	She	152	“ Go on . He wo n’t annoy you . I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over . ”
44716	44728	44701	44701	Tom	153	“ Want any of this stuff ? Jordan ? … Nick ? ”
44734	44737	44738	44738	He	153	“ Nick ? ”
44742	44745	44701	44701	Tom	153	“ What ? ”
44746	44750	44701	44701	Tom	153	“ Want any ? ”
44751	44763	44701	44701	Tom	153	“ No … I just remembered that today ’s my birthday . ”
45057	45068	45070	45070	Wilson	163	“ I ’ve got my wife locked in up there , ”
45073	45097	45070	45070	Wilson	163	“ She ’s going to stay there till the day after to - morrow , and then we ’re going to move away . ”
45319	45323	45326	45326	her	164	“ Beat me ! ”
45329	45342	45326	45326	her	164	“ Throw me down and beat me , you dirty little coward ! ”

45571	45574	45576	45576	Tom	153	“ Wreck ! ”
45578	45591	45576	45576	Tom	153	“ That ’s good . Wilson’ll have a little business at last . ”
45630	45637	45638	45638	he	1618	“ We ’ll take a look , ”
45642	45647	45638	45638	he	1618	“ just a look . ”
45685	45691	45746	45746	he	153	“ Oh , my God ! ”
45701	45709	45711	45711	Tom	153	“ There ’s some bad trouble here , ”
46002	46030	45992	45992	he	168	“ Oh , my Ga - od ! Oh , my Ga - od ! Oh , Ga - od ! Oh , my Ga - od ! ”

46280	46290	46292	46293	the officer	1097	“ What ’s the name of this place here ? ”
46295	46302	46303	46308	A pale well - dressed negro	1640	“ Has n’t got any name . ”

46534	46583	46527	46527	Tom	153	“ I just got here a minute ago , from New York . I was bringing you that coupe we ’ve been talking about . That yellow car I was driving this afternoon was n’t mine — do you hear ? I have n’t seen it all afternoon . ”
46613	46619	46620	46620	he	1039	“ What ’s all that ? ”

47448	47453	47489	47489	He	145	“ Was she killed ? ”
47454	47457	47489	47489	He	145	“ Yes . ”
47458	47488	47489	47489	He	145	“ I thought so ; I told Daisy I thought so . It ’s better that the shock should all come at once . She stood it pretty well . ”
47503	47514	47515	47515	he	145	“ I got to West Egg by a side road , ”
47519	47545	47515	47515	he	145	“ and left the car in my garage . I do n’t think anybody saw us , but of course I ca n’t be sure . ”

47578	47597	47564	47564	he	145	“ Her name was Wilson . Her husband owns the garage . How the devil did it happen ? ”
47598	47608	47609	47609	He	145	“ Well , I tried to swing the wheel — ”

47637	47758	47631	47631	he	145	“ but of course I ’ll say I was . You see , when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive — and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way . It all happened in a minute , but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us , thought we were somebody she knew . Well , first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car , and then she lost her nerve and turned back . The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock — it must have killed her instantly . ”
47759	47765	47609	47609	He	145	“ It ripped her open — ”
47766	47775	47776	47776	He	1669	“ Do n’t tell me , old sport . ”
47779	47818	47776	47776	He	1669	“ Anyhow — Daisy stepped on it . I tried to make her stop , but she could n’t , so I pulled on the emergency brake . Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on .
47819	47829	47830	47830	he	1669	“ She ’ll be all right to - morrow , ”
47834	47882	47830	47830	he	1669	“ I ’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon . She ’s locked herself into her room , and if he tries any brutality she ’s going to turn the light out and on again . ”

48482	48508	48478	48478	he	145	“ I waited , and about four o’clock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light . ”

48644	48655	48641	48641	I	0	“ It ’s pretty certain they ’ll trace your car . ”

I even hoped for a while that she ’d throw me over , but she did n’t , because she was in love with me too . She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her … Well , there I was , ’ way off my ambitions , getting deeper in love every minute , and all of a sudden I did n’t care . What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do ? ”

50161	50214	50215	50215	He	145	“ You must remember , old sport , she was very excited this afternoon . He told her those things in a way that frightened her — that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper . And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying . ”
50220	50250	50252	50252	he	145	“ Of course she might have loved him just for a minute , when they were first married — and loved me more even then , do you see ? ”

He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he could n’t buy some regular clothes . First time I saw him was when he come into Winebrenner ’s poolroom at Forty - third Street and asked for a job . He had n’t eat anything for a couple of days . ‘ Come on have some lunch with me , ’ I said . He ate more than four dollars ’ worth of food in half an hour . ”

56619	56706	56485	56485	he	275	“ I raised him up out of nothing , right out of the gutter . I saw right away he was a fine - appearing , gentlemanly young man , and when he told me he was an Oggsford I knew I could use him good . I got him to join up in the American Legion and he used to stand high there . Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany . We were so thick like that in everything”—he

56837	56905	56944	56944	he	1941	“ When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it any way . I keep out . When I was a young man it was different — if a friend of mine died , no matter how , I stuck with them to the end . You may think that ’s sentimental , but I mean it — to the bitter end . ”

Of course we was broke up when he run off from home , but I see now there was a reason for it . He knew he had a big future in front of him . And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me . ”
