505	532	503	503	Edmund	79	“ because you ’ll at least have a room of your own and I shall have to share a bedroom with that record stinker , Eustace . ”
996	1001	1003	1003	Edmund	79	“ The question is , ”
1005	1026	1003	1003	Edmund	79	“ whether it does n’t make things worse , looking at a Narnian ship when you ca n’t get there . ”
1027	1035	1037	1037	Lucy	80	“ Even looking is better than nothing , ”
1039	1049	1037	1037	Lucy	80	“ And she is such a very Narnian ship . ”

1185	1198	1200	1200	Lucy	80	“ Well Narnia and balmier do n’t rhyme , to begin with , ”
1202	1208	1210	1210	Eustace	73	“ It ’s an assonance , ”
1212	1224	1226	1226	Edmund	79	“ Do n’t ask him what an assy - thingummy is , ”
1228	1246	1226	1226	Edmund	79	“ He ’s only longing to be asked . Say nothing and perhaps he ’ll go away . ”
1282	1289	1290	1290	he	73	“ Do you like that picture ? ”
1293	1310	1312	1312	Edmund	79	“ For heaven ’s sake do n’t let him get started about Art and all that , ”
1327	1339	1316	1316	Lucy	80	“ Yes , I do . I like it very much . ”
1340	1347	1349	1349	Eustace	73	“ It ’s a rotten picture , ”
1351	1362	1364	1364	Edmund	79	“ You wo n’t see it if you step outside , ”
1366	1373	1375	1375	Eustace	73	“ Why do you like it ? ”
1379	1386	1388	1388	Lucy	80	“ Well , for one thing , ”
1390	1430	1388	1388	Lucy	80	“ I like it because the ship looks as if it was really moving . And the water looks as if it was really wet . And the waves look as if they were really going up and down . ”
1789	1793	1795	1795	Eustace	73	“ Stop it , ”
1806	1827	1795	1795	Eustace	73	“ It ’s some silly trick you two are playing . Stop it . I ’ll tell Alberta — Ow ! ”

2970	2989	2965	2965	Eustace	73	“ Oh ! Ugh ! What on earth ’s that ! Take it away , the horrid thing . ”
3264	3279	3258	3258	his	89	“ My humble duty to your Majesty . And to King Edmund , too . ”

3313	3336	3311	3311	Eustace	73	“ I hate mice . And I never could bear performing animals . They ’re silly and vulgar and - and sentimental . ”
3337	3343	3345	3345	Reepicheep	89	“ Am I to understand , ”
3355	3373	3345	3345	Reepicheep	89	“ that this singularly discourteous person is under your Majesty ’s protection ? Because , if not — ”
3383	3400	3402	3402	Caspian	85	“ What a fool I am to keep you all standing here in your wet things , ”
3404	3458	3402	3402	Caspian	85	“ Come on below and get changed . I ’ll give you my cabin of course , Lucy , but I ’m afraid we have no women ’s clothes on board . You ’ll have to make do with some of mine . Lead the way , Reepicheep , like a good fellow . ”
3459	3467	3469	3469	Reepicheep	89	“ To the convenience of a lady , ”
3471	3487	3469	3469	Reepicheep	89	“ even a question of honour must give way — at least for the moment — ”
3613	3632	3633	3633	he	85	“ This ’ll be your room , Lucy . I ’ll just get some dry things for myself — ”
3643	3672	3633	3633	he	85	spoke—“and then leave you to change . If you ’ll fling your wet things outside the door I ’ll get them taken to the galley to be dried . ”
3821	3830	3832	3832	Caspian	85	“ AH , there you are , Lucy , ”
3834	3851	3832	3832	Caspian	85	“ We were just waiting for you . This is my captain , the Lord Drinian . ”
3876	3881	3883	3883	Lucy	80	“ Where is Eustace ? ”
3885	3889	3891	3891	Edmund	79	“ In bed , ”
3893	3920	3891	3891	Edmund	79	“ and I do n’t think we can do anything for him . It only makes him worse if you try to be nice to him . ”
3921	3924	3926	3926	Caspian	85	“ Meanwhile , ”
3928	3934	3926	3926	Caspian	85	“ we want to talk . ”
3935	3942	3944	3944	Edmund	79	“ By Jove , we do , ”
3946	3978	3944	3944	Edmund	79	“ And first , about time . It ’s a year ago by our time since we left you just before your coronation . How long has it been in Narnia ? ”
3979	3984	3986	3986	Caspian	85	“ Exactly three years , ”
3988	3993	3995	3995	Edmund	79	“ All going well ? ”
3997	4017	4019	4020	the King	305	“ You do n’t suppose I ’d have left my kingdom and put to sea unless all was well , ”
4022	4094	4019	4020	the King	305	“ It could n’t be better . There ’s no trouble at all now between Telmarines , Dwarfs , Talking Beasts , Fauns and the rest . And we gave those troublesome giants on the frontier such a good beating last summer that they pay us tribute now . And I had an excellent person to leave as Regent while I ’m away Trumpkin , the Dwarf . You remember him ? ”
4095	4099	4101	4101	Lucy	80	“ Dear Trumpkin , ”
4103	4118	4101	4101	Lucy	80	“ of course I do . You could n’t have made a better choice . ”
4119	4135	4137	4137	Drinian	98	“ Loyal as a badger , Ma’am , and valiant as — as a Mouse , ”
4145	4149	4137	4137	Drinian	98	“ as a lion ”
4160	4168	4170	4170	Edmund	79	“ And where are we heading for ? ”
4172	4175	4177	4177	Caspian	85	“ Well , ”
4179	4233	4177	4177	Caspian	85	“ that ’s rather a long story . Perhaps you remember that when I was a child my usurping uncle Miraz got rid of seven friends of my father ’s ( who might have taken my part ) by sending them off to explore the unknown , Eastern Seas beyond the Lone Islands . ”
4234	4237	4239	4239	Lucy	80	“ Yes , ”
4241	4250	4239	4239	Lucy	80	“ and none of them ever came back . ”
4251	4354	4177	4177	Caspian	85	“ Right . Well , on , my coronation day , with Aslan ’s approval , I swore an oath that , if once I established peace in Narnia , I would sail east myself for a year and a day to find my father ’s friends or to learn of their deaths and avenge them if I could . These were their names — the Lord Revilian , the Lord Bern , the Lord Argoz , the Lord Mavramorn , the Lord Octesian , the Lord Restimar , and — oh , that other one who ’s so hard to remember . ”
4355	4362	4364	4364	Drinian	98	“ The Lord Rhoop , Sire , ”
4366	4374	4376	4376	Caspian	85	“ Rhoop , Rhoop , of course , ”
4378	4394	4376	4376	Caspian	85	“ That is my main intention . But Reepicheep here has an even higher hope . ”
4403	4410	4177	4177	Caspian	85	“ As high as my spirit , ”
4414	4472	4177	4177	Caspian	85	“ Though perhaps as small as my stature . Why should we not come to the very eastern end of the world ? And what might we find there ? I expect to find Aslan ’s own country . It is always from the east , across the sea , that the great Lion comes to us . ”
4473	4482	4484	4484	Edmund	79	“ I say , that is an idea , ”
4490	4496	4498	4498	Lucy	80	“ But do you think , ”
4500	4522	4498	4498	Lucy	80	“ Aslan ’s country would be that sort of country — I mean , the sort you could ever sail to ? ”
4523	4531	4533	4533	Reepicheep	89	“ I do not know , Madam , ”
4535	4560	4533	4533	Reepicheep	89	“ But there is this . When I was in my cradle , a wood woman , a Dryad , spoke this verse over me :
4561	4590	4498	4498	Lucy	80	“ Where sky and water meet , Where the waves grow sweet , Doubt not , Reepicheep , To find all you seek , There is the utter East .
4591	4613	4533	4533	Reepicheep	89	“ I do not know what it means . But the spell of it has been on me all my life . ”
4621	4630	4618	4618	Lucy	80	“ And where are we now , Caspian ? ”
4631	4641	4643	4643	Caspian	85	“ The Captain can tell you better than I , ”
4658	4664	4665	4665	he	98	“ That ’s our position , ”
4674	4732	4665	4665	he	98	“ Or was at noon today . We had a fair wind from Cair Paravel and stood a little north for Galma , which we made on the next day . We were in port for a week , for the Duke of Galma made a great tournament for His Majesty and there he unhorsed many knights — ”
4733	4752	4755	4755	Caspian	85	“ And got a few nasty falls myself , Drinian . Some of the bruises are there still , ”
4757	4764	4766	4766	Drinian	98	“ — And unhorsed many knights , ”
4771	4797	4766	4766	Drinian	98	“ We thought the Duke would have been pleased if the King ’s Majesty would have married his daughter , but nothing came of that — ”
4798	4805	4807	4807	Caspian	85	“ Squints , and has freckles , ”
4809	4815	4817	4817	Lucy	80	“ Oh , poor girl , ”
4819	4826	4828	4828	Drinian	98	“ And we sailed from Galma , ”
4830	4960	4828	4828	Drinian	98	“ and ran into a calm for the best part of two days and had to row , and then had wind again and did not make Terebinthia till the fourth day from Galma . And there their King sent out a warning not to land for there was sickness in Terebinthia , but we doubled the cape and put in at a little creek far from the city and watered . Then we had to lie off for three days before we got a south - east wind and stood out for Seven Isles . The third day out a pirate ( Terebinthian by her rig ) overhauled us , but when she saw us well armed she stood off after some shooting of arrows on either part — ”
4961	4982	4984	4984	Reepicheep	89	“ And we ought to have given her chase and boarded her and hanged every mother ’s son of them , ”
4986	5095	4828	4828	Drinian	98	“ — And in five days more we were insight of Muil , which , as you know , is the westernmost of the Seven Isles . Then we rowed through the straits and came about sundown into Redhaven on the isle of Brenn , where we were very lovingly feasted and had victuals and water at will . We left Redhaven six days ago and have made marvellously good speed , so that I hope to see the Lone Islands the day after tomorrow . The sum is , we are now nearly thirty days at sea and have sailed more than four hundred leagues from Narnia . ”
5096	5103	5105	5105	Lucy	80	“ And after the Lone Islands ? ”
5107	5115	5117	5117	Drinian	98	“ No one knows , your Majesty , ”
5119	5129	5117	5117	Drinian	98	“ Unless the Lone Islanders themselves can tell us . ”
5130	5138	5140	5140	Edmund	79	“ They could n’t in our days , ”
5142	5145	5147	5147	Reepicheep	89	“ Then , ”
5149	5162	5147	5147	Reepicheep	89	“ it is after the Lone Islands that the adventure really begins . ”
5189	5220	5186	5186	she	80	“ I think I really must go and see Eustace . Seasickness is horrid , you know . If I had my old cordial with me I could cure him . ”
5221	5226	5228	5228	Caspian	85	“ But you have , ”
5230	5275	5228	5228	Caspian	85	“ I ’d quite forgotten about it . As you left it behind I thought it might be regarded as one of the royal treasures and so I brought it — if you think it ought to be wasted on a thing like seasickness . ”
5276	5284	5286	5286	Lucy	80	“ It ’ll only take a drop , ”
5311	5319	5320	5320	he	85	“ Take back your own , Queen , ”
5735	5745	5747	5747	Caspian	85	“ You and I must lodge here , Edmund , ”
5749	5763	5747	5747	Caspian	85	“ We ’ll leave your kinsman the bunk and sling hammocks for ourselves . ”
5764	5770	5772	5772	Drinian	98	“ I beseech your Majesty — ”
5774	5780	5782	5782	Caspian	85	“ No , no shipmate , ”
5784	5796	5782	5782	Caspian	85	“ we have argued all that out already . You and Rhince ”
5803	5854	5782	5782	Caspian	85	“ are sailing the ship and will have cares and labours many a night when we are singing catches or telling stories , so you and he must have the port cabin above . King Edmund and I can lie very snug here below . But how is the stranger ? ”
5881	5885	5878	5878	Caspian	85	“ What storm ? ”
5892	5898	5899	5899	he	98	“ Storm , young master ! ”
5902	5915	5899	5899	he	98	“ This is as fair weather as a man could ask for . ”
5916	5921	5923	5923	Eustace	73	“ Who ’s that ? ”
5926	5938	5923	5923	Eustace	73	“ Send him away . His voice goes through my head . ”
5939	5954	5956	5956	Lucy	80	“ I ’ve brought you something that will make you feel better , Eustace , ”
5958	5968	5970	5970	Eustace	73	“ Oh , go away and leave me alone , ”
6055	6059	6039	6039	he	73	“ lodge a disposition ”

6662	6671	6673	6673	Edmund	79	“ As if he knew anything about them , ”
6845	6856	6829	6829	he	73	“ I got so much . What did you get ? ”
6884	7333	7339	7339	Reepicheep	89	“ 7 August . Have now been twenty - four hours on this ghastly boat if it is n’t a dream . All the time a frightful storm has been raging ( it ’s a good thing I ’m not seasick ) . Huge waves keep coming in over the front and I have seen the boat nearly go under any number of times . All the others pretend to take no notice of this , either from swank or because Harold says one of the most cowardly things ordinary people do is to shut their eyes to Facts . It ’s madness to come out into the sea in a rotten little thing like this . Not much bigger than a lifeboat . And , of course , absolutely primitive indoors . No proper saloon , no radio , no bathrooms , no deck - chairs . I was dragged all over it yesterday evening and it would make anyone sick to hear Caspian showing off his funny little toy boat as if it was the Queen Mary . I tried to tell him what real ships are like , but he ’s too dense . E. and L. , o f course , did n’t back me up . I suppose a kid like L. does n’t realize the danger and E. is buttering up C. as everyone does here . They call him a King . I said I was a Republican but he had to ask me what that meant ! He does n’t seem to know anything at all . Needless to say I ’ve been put in the worst cabin of the boat , a perfect dungeon , and Lucy has been given a whole room on deck to herself , almost a nice room compared with the rest of this place . C. says that ’s because she ’s a girl . I tried to make him see what Alberta says , that all that sort of thing is really lowering girls but he was too dense . Still , he might see that I shall be ill if I ’m kept in that hole any longer . E. says we must n’t grumble because C. is sharing it with us himself to make room for L. As if that did n’t make it more crowded and far worse . Nearly forgot to say that there is also a kind of Mouse thing that gives everyone the most frightful cheek . The others can put up with it if they like but I shall twist his tail pretty soon if he tries it on me . The food is frightful too . ”
7387	7424	7375	7375	Eustace	73	“ That little brute has half killed me . I insist on it being kept under control . I could bring an action against you , Caspian . i could order you to have it destroyed . ”
7450	7457	7458	7458	he	89	“ I ask your pardons all , ”
7461	7490	7458	7458	he	89	“ and especially her Majesty ’s . If I had known that he would take refuge here I would have awaited a more reasonable time for his correction . ”
7491	7498	7500	7500	Edmund	79	“ What on earth ’s up ? ”
7940	7944	7946	7946	Eustace	73	“ Stop it , ”
7948	7972	7946	7946	Eustace	73	“ go away . Put that thing away . It ’s not safe . Stop it , I say . I ’ll tell Caspian .
7982	7982	7973	7973	I	0	”
7983	7995	7997	7998	the Mouse	89	“ Why do you not draw your own sword , poltroon ! ”
8000	8016	7997	7998	the Mouse	89	“ Draw and fight or I ’ll beat you black and blue with the flat . ”
8017	8024	8026	8026	Eustace	73	“ I have n’t got one , ”
8028	8041	8026	8026	Eustace	73	“ I ’m a pacifist . I do n’t believe in fighting . ”
8042	8047	8049	8049	Reepicheep	89	“ Do I understand , ”
8062	8073	8049	8049	Reepicheep	89	“ that you do not intend to give me satisfaction ? ”
8074	8083	8085	8085	Eustace	73	“ I do n’t know what you mean , ”
8091	8111	8085	8085	Eustace	73	“ If you do n’t know how to take a joke I sha n’t bother my head about you . ”
8112	8117	8119	8119	Reepicheep	89	“ Then take that , ”
8121	8148	8119	8119	Reepicheep	89	“ and that — to teach you manners — and the respect due to a knight — and a Mouse — and a Mouse ’s tail — ”

8495	8504	8506	8506	Lucy	80	“ Same old Felimath ! Same old Doorn , ”
8512	8529	8506	8506	Lucy	80	“ Oh — Edmund , how long it is since you and I saw them last ! ”
8530	8541	8543	8543	Caspian	85	“ I ’ve never understood why they belong to Narnia , ”
8545	8554	8543	8543	Caspian	85	“ Did Peter the High King conquer them ? ”
8555	8559	8561	8561	Edmund	79	“ Oh no , ”
8563	8579	8561	8561	Edmund	79	“ They were Narnian before our time — in the days of the White Witch . ”
8626	8636	8638	8638	Drinian	98	“ Are we to put in here , Sire ? ”
8640	8654	8656	8656	Edmund	79	“ 1 should n’t think it would be much good landing on Felimath , ”
8658	8709	8656	8656	Edmund	79	“ It was almost uninhabited in our days and it looks as if it was the same still . The people lived mostly on Doorn and a little on Avra — that ’s the third one ; you ca n’t see it yet . They only kept sheep on Felimath . ”
8710	8723	8725	8725	Drinian	98	“ Then we ’ll have to double that cape , I suppose , ”
8727	8738	8725	8725	Drinian	98	“ and land on Doorn . That ’ll mean rowing . ”
8739	8750	8752	8752	Lucy	80	“ I ’m sorry we ’re not landing on Felimath , ”
8754	8784	8752	8752	Lucy	80	“ I ’d like to walk there again . It was so lonely — a nice kind of loneliness , and all grass and clover and soft sea air . ”
8785	8796	8798	8798	Caspian	85	“ I ’d love to stretch my legs now too , ”
8800	8840	8798	8798	Caspian	85	“ I tell you what . Why should n’t we go ashore in the boat and send it back , and then we could walk across Felimath and let the Dawn Treader pick us up on the other side ? ”
8874	8880	8882	8882	Lucy	80	“ Oh do let ’s , ”
8884	8892	8894	8894	Caspian	85	“ You ’ll come , will you ? ”
8908	8917	8919	8919	Eustace	73	“ Anything to get off this blasted boat , ”
8921	8924	8926	8926	Drinian	98	“ Blasted ? ”
8928	8934	8926	8926	Drinian	98	“ How do you mean ? ”
8935	8946	8948	8948	Eustace	73	“ In a civilized country like where I come from , ”
8950	8972	8948	8948	Eustace	73	“ the ships are so big that when you ’re inside you would n’t know you were at sea at all . ”
8973	8985	8987	8987	Caspian	85	“ In that case you might just as well stay ashore , ”
8989	9001	8987	8987	Caspian	85	“ Will you tell them to lower the boat , Drinian . ”
9259	9266	9268	9268	Edmund	79	“ Hullo ! What ’s this ? ”
9297	9306	9308	9308	Caspian	85	“ Do n’t tell them who we are , ”
9310	9320	9322	9322	Reepicheep	89	“ And pray , your Majesty , why not ? ”
9333	9340	9342	9342	Caspian	85	“ It just occurred to me , ”
9344	9389	9342	9342	Caspian	85	“ that no one here can have heard from Narnia for a long time . It ’s just possible they may not still acknowledge our over - lordship . In which case it might not be quite safe to be known as the King . ”
9390	9398	9400	9400	Reepicheep	89	“ We have our swords , Sire , ”
9402	9412	9414	9414	Caspian	85	“ Yes , Reep , I know we have , ”
9416	9443	9414	9414	Caspian	85	“ But if it is a question of re - conquering the three islands , I ’d prefer to come back with a rather larger army . ”
9469	9476	9459	9464	a big black - haired fellow	437	“ A good morning to you . ”
9477	9485	9487	9487	Caspian	85	“ And a good morning to you , ”
9489	9500	9487	9487	Caspian	85	“ Is there still a Governor of the Lone Islands ? ”
9501	9508	9510	9511	the man	438	“ To be sure there is , ”
9513	9532	9510	9511	the man	438	“ Governor Gumpas . His Sufficiency is at Narrowhaven . But you ’ll stay and drink with us . ”
9638	9646	9648	9649	the Leader	447	“ Careful with that beast , Tacks , ”
9651	9672	9648	9649	the Leader	447	“ Do n’t damage him . He ’ll fetch the best price of the lot , I should n’t wonder . ”
9673	9678	9680	9680	Reepicheep	89	“ Coward ! Poltroon ! ”
9682	9695	9680	9680	Reepicheep	89	“ Give me my sword and free my paws if you dare . ”
9696	9699	9701	9703	the slave merchant	448	“ Whew ! ”
9713	9735	9701	9703	the slave merchant	448	“ It can talk ! Well I never did . Blowed if I take less than two hundred crescents for him . ”
9758	9766	9768	9768	Caspian	85	“ So that ’s what you are , ”
9770	9784	9768	9768	Caspian	85	“ A kidnapper and slaver . I hope you ’re proud of it . ”
9785	9794	9796	9797	the slaver	450	“ Now , now , now , now , ”
9799	9840	9796	9797	the slaver	450	“ Do n’t you start any jaw . The easier you take it , the pleasanter all round , see ? I do n’t do this for fun . I ’ve got my living to make same as anyone else . ”
9841	9848	9850	9850	Lucy	80	“ Where will you take us ? ”
9860	9865	9867	9868	the slaver	450	“ Over to Narrowhaven , ”
9870	9876	9867	9868	the slaver	450	“ For market day tomorrow . ”
9877	9885	9887	9887	Eustace	73	“ Is there a British Consul there ? ”
9889	9895	9897	9898	the man	438	“ Is there a which ? ”
9916	9951	9911	9912	the slaver	450	“ Well , I ’ve had enough of this jabber . The Mouse is a fair treat but this one would talk the hind leg off a donkey . Off we go , mates . ”
10040	10043	10030	10032	the slave dealer	457	“ Go on ”
10053	10062	10045	10045	Reepicheep	89	“ It ’s as good as a play , ”
10065	10081	10045	10045	Reepicheep	89	“ Blimey , you ca n’t help almost thinking it knows what it ’s saying ! ”
10083	10093	10097	10097	Reepicheep	89	“ Was it one of you what trained it ? ”
10159	10164	10166	10168	the slave dealer	457	“ Now , youngsters , ”
10170	10189	10166	10168	the slave dealer	457	“ let ’s have no fuss and then you ’ll have nothing to cry about . All aboard . ”
10216	10227	10193	10198	a fine - looking bearded man	466	“ Well , Pug . More of your usual wares ? ”
10251	10258	10228	10229	The slaver	450	“ Yes , please your Lordship . ”
10259	10269	10271	10272	the other	471	“ How much do you want for that boy ? ”
10278	10281	10283	10283	Pug	125	“ Ah , ”
10285	10356	10283	10283	Pug	125	“ I knew your Lordship would pick on the best . No deceiving your Lordship with anything second rate . That boy , now , I ’ve taken a fancy to him myself . Got kind of fond of him , I have . I ’m that tender - hearted I did n’t ever ought to have taken up this job . Still , to a customer like your Lordship — ”
10357	10365	10367	10368	the Lord	472	“ Tell me your price , carrion , ”
10371	10387	10367	10368	the Lord	472	“ Do you think I want to listen to the rigmarole of your filthy trade ? ”
10388	10405	10472	10473	the Lord	472	“ Three hundred crescents , my Lord to your honourable Lordship , but to anyone else — ”
10406	10416	10367	10368	the Lord	472	“ I ’ll give you a hundred and fifty . ”
10417	10423	10426	10426	Lucy	80	“ Oh please , please , ”
10428	10443	10426	10426	Lucy	80	“ Do n’t separate us , whatever you do . You do n’t know — ”
10462	10470	10472	10473	the Lord	472	“ A hundred and fifty , then , ”
10475	10521	10472	10473	the Lord	472	“ As for you , little maiden , I am sorry I can not buy you all . Unrope my boy , Pug . And look — treat these others well while they are in your hands or it ’ll be the worse for you . ”
10522	10525	10527	10527	Pug	125	“ Well ! ”
10529	10564	10527	10527	Pug	125	“ Now who ever heard of a gentleman in my way of business who treated his stock better than what I do ? Well ? Why , I treat ’em like my own childen . ”
10565	10574	10576	10578	the other grimly	474	“ That ’s likely enough to be true , ”
10596	10602	10587	10587	Caspian	85	“ This way , lad , ”
10623	10642	10615	10615	Caspian	85	“ Cheer up . I ’m sure it will come all right in the end . So long . ”
10643	10648	10650	10650	Pug	125	“ Now , missie , ”
10652	10686	10650	10650	Pug	125	“ Do n’t you start taking on and spoiling your looks for the market tomorrow . You be a good girl and then you wo n’t have nothing to cry about , see ? ”
10835	10846	10847	10847	he	486	“ You need n’t be afraid of me , boy , ”
10850	10870	10847	10847	he	486	“ I ’ll treat you well . I bought you for your face . You reminded me of someone . ”
10871	10881	10883	10883	Caspian	85	“ May I ask of whom , my Lord ? ”
10885	10898	10847	10847	he	486	“ You remind me of my master , King Caspian of Narnia . ”
10909	10913	10914	10914	he	85	“ My Lord , ”
10917	10930	10914	10914	he	85	“ I am your master . I am Caspian King of Narnia . ”
10931	10937	10939	10940	the other	471	“ You make very free , ”
10942	10951	10939	10940	the other	471	“ How shall I know this is true ? ”
10952	10958	10960	10960	Caspian	85	“ Firstly by my face , ”
10962	11068	10960	10960	Caspian	85	“ Secondly because I know within six guesses who you are . You are one of those seven lords of Narnia whom my Uncle Miraz sent to sea and whom I have come out to look for — Argoz , Bern , Octesian , Restimar , Mavramorn , or — or — I have forgotten the others . And finally , if your Lordship will give me a sword I will prove on any man ’s body in clean battle that I am Caspian the son of Caspian , lawful King of Narnia , Lord of Cair Paravel , and Emperor of the Lone Islands . ”
11069	11073	11075	11076	the man	438	“ By heaven , ”
11078	11097	11075	11076	the man	438	“ it is his father ’s very voice and trick of speech . My liege — your Majesty — ”
11112	11130	11132	11132	Caspian	85	“ The moneys your Lordship disbursed for our person will be made good from our own treasury , ”
11134	11146	11148	11150	the Lord Bern	101	“ They ’re not in Pug ’s purse yet , Sire , ”
11157	11186	11148	11150	the Lord Bern	101	“ And never will be , I trust . I have moved his Sufficiency the Governor a hundred times to crush this vile traffic in man ’s flesh . ”
11187	11192	11194	11194	Caspian	85	“ My Lord Bern , ”
11196	11217	11194	11194	Caspian	85	“ we must talk of the state of these Islands . But first what is your Lordship ’s own story ? ”
11218	11224	11226	11226	Bern	101	“ Short enough , Sire , ”
11228	11283	11226	11226	Bern	101	“ I came thus far with my six fellows , loved a girl of the islands , and felt I had had enough of the sea . And there was no purpose in returning to Narnia while your Majesty ’s uncle held the reins . So I married and have lived here ever since . ”
11284	11308	11148	11150	the Lord Bern	101	“ And what is this governor , this Gumpas , like ? Does he still acknowledge the King of Narnia for his lord ? ”
11309	11390	11226	11226	Bern	101	“ In words , yes . All is done in the King ’s name . But he would not be best pleased to find a real , live King of Narnia coming in upon him . And if your Majesty came before him alone and unarmed — well he would not deny his allegiance , but he would pretend to disbelieve you . Your Grace ’s life would be in danger . What following has your Majesty in these waters ? ”
11391	11401	11403	11403	Caspian	85	“ There is my ship just rounding the point , ”
11405	11437	11403	11403	Caspian	85	“ We are about thirty swords if it came to fighting . Shall we not have my ship in and fall upon Pug and free my friends whom he holds captive ? ”
11438	11444	11446	11446	Bern	101	“ Not by my counsel , ”
11448	11516	11446	11446	Bern	101	“ As soon as there was a fight two or three ships would put out from Narrowhaven to rescue Pug . Your Majesty must work by a show of more power than you really have , and by the terror of the King ’s name . It must not come to plain battle . Gumpas is a chicken - hearted man and can be over - awed . ”
11670	11679	11681	11681	Bern	101	“ Steer straight down this channel , captain , ”
11683	11745	11681	11681	Bern	101	“ and then round to Avra where my own estates are . But first run up the King ’s banner , hang out all the shields , and send as many men to the fighting top as you can . And about five bowshots hence , when you get open sea on your port bow , run up a few signals . ”
11746	11752	11754	11754	Drinian	98	“ Signals ? To whom ? ”
11756	11780	11681	11681	Bern	101	“ Why , to all the other ships we have n’t got but which it might be well that Gumpas thinks we have . ”
11781	11787	11789	11789	Drinian	98	“ Oh , I see , ”
11794	11819	11789	11789	Drinian	98	“ And they ’ll read our signals . What shall I say ? Whole fleet round the South of Avra and assemble at — ? ”
11820	11823	11825	11827	the Lord Bern	101	“ Bernstead , ”
11829	11856	11825	11827	the Lord Bern	101	“ That ’ll do excellently . Their whole journey — if there were any ships What Caspian did there would be out of sight from Narrowhaven . ”
12058	12063	12064	12064	he	522	“ And above all , ”
12067	12099	12064	12064	he	522	“ let everything be as trim and scoured as if it were the morning of the first battle in a great war between noble kings with all the world looking on . ”
12163	12174	12176	12176	Bern	101	“ This is what I sent word about last night , ”
12178	12189	12176	12176	Bern	101	“ They are all friends of mine and honest people . ”
12207	12217	12197	12198	the crowd	538	“ Narnia ! Narnia ! Long live the King . ”
12519	12542	12510	12510	Caspian	85	“ Open for the King of Narnia , come to visit his trusty and wellbeloved servant the governor of the Lone Islands . ”
12602	12609	12610	12610	he	564	“ Carn — seez — fishansy , ”
12617	12623	12614	12614	his	564	saying,—“You ca n’t see his Sufficiency ”
12625	12646	12610	12610	he	564	“ No interviews without ’ pointments ’ cept ’ tween nine ’ n ’ ten p.m. second Saturday every month . ”
12647	12655	12657	12659	the Lord Bern	101	“ Uncover before Narnia , you dog , ”
12679	12689	12691	12692	the doorkeeper	565	“ ’ Ere ? Wot ’s it all about ? ”
12818	12824	12825	12825	he	85	“ Where is the captain ? ”
12828	12843	12845	12857	a languid and rather dandified young person without any j armour at all	575	“ I am , more or less , if you know what I mean , ”
12859	12865	12867	12867	Caspian	85	“ It is our wish , ”
12869	12984	12867	12867	Caspian	85	“ that our royal visitation to our realm of the Lone Islands should , if possible , be an occasion of joy and not of terror to our loyal subjects . If it were not for that , I should have something to say about the state of your men ’s armour and weapons . As it is , you are pardoned . Command a cask of wine to be opened that , your men may drink our health . But at noon tomorrow I wish to see them here in this courtyard looking like men - at - arms and not like vagabonds . See to it on pain of our extreme displeasure . ”
12993	13001	12989	12989	Bern	101	“ Three . cheers for the King , ”
13113	13128	13096	13096	He	121	“ No interviews without appointments except between nine and ten p.m. on second Saturdays . ”
13244	13248	13250	13250	he	85	“ My Lord , ”
13258	13277	13250	13250	he	85	“ you have not given us quite the welcome we expected . I am the King of Narnia . ”
13278	13286	13288	13289	the governor	2031	“ Nothing about it in the correspondence , ”
13291	13316	13288	13289	the governor	2031	“ Nothing in the minutes . We have not been notified of any such thing . All irregular . Happy to consider any applications — ”
13317	13333	13335	13335	Caspian	85	“ And we are come to enquire into your Sufficiency ’s conduct of your office , ”
13337	13378	13335	13335	Caspian	85	“ There are two points especially on which I require an explanation . Firstly I find no record that the tribute due from these Islands to the crown of Narnia has been received for about a hundred and fifty years . ”
13379	13393	13395	13395	Gumpas	121	“ That would be a question to raise at the Council next month , ”
13397	13430	13395	13395	Gumpas	121	“ If anyone moves that a commission of enquiry be set up to report on the financial history of the islands at the first meeting next year , why then . . . ”
13431	13443	13444	13444	Caspian	85	“ I also find it very clearly written in our laws , ”
13448	13476	13444	13444	Caspian	85	“ that if the tribute is not delivered the whole debt has to be paid by the Governor of the Lone Islands out of his private purse . ”
13486	13497	13498	13498	he	121	“ Oh , that ’s quite out of the question , ”
13501	13516	13498	13498	he	121	“ It is an economic impossibility — er — your Majesty must be joking . ”
13688	13691	13693	13693	Caspian	85	“ Secondly , ”
13695	13727	13693	13693	Caspian	85	“ I want to know why you have permitted this abominable and unnatural traffic in slaves to grow up here , contrary to the ancient custom and usage of our dominions . ”
13728	13733	13735	13735	his	85	“ Necessary , unavoidable , ”
13738	13763	13735	13735	his	85	“ An essential part of the economic development of the islands , I assure you . Our present burst of prosperity depends on it . ”
13764	13772	13693	13693	Caspian	85	“ What need have you of slaves ? ”
13773	13801	13735	13735	his	85	“ For export , your Majesty . Sell ’em to Calormen mostly ; and we have other markets . We are a great centre of the trade . ”
13802	13807	13809	13809	Caspian	85	“ In other words , ”
13811	13836	13809	13809	Caspian	85	“ you do n’t need them . Tell me what purpose they serve except to put money into the pockets of such as Pug ? ”
13837	13844	13846	13846	Gumpas	121	“ Your Majesty ’s tender years , ”
13858	13883	13846	13846	Gumpas	121	“ hardly make it possible that you should understand the economic problem involved . I have statistics , I have graphs , I have — ”
13884	13891	13893	13893	Caspian	85	“ Tender as my years be , ”
13895	13962	13893	13893	Caspian	85	“ I believe I understand the slave trade from within quite as well as your Sufficiency . And I do not see that it brings into the islands meat or bread or beer or wine or timber or cabbages or books or instruments of music or horses or armour or anything else worth having . But whether it does or not , it must be stopped . ”
13963	13973	13975	13976	the governor	2031	“ But that would be putting the clock back , ”
13978	13989	13975	13976	the governor	2031	“ Have you no idea of progress , of development ? ”
13990	14000	14002	14002	Caspian	85	“ I have seen them both in an egg , ”
14004	14020	14002	14002	Caspian	85	“ We call it ` Going Bad ’ in Narnia . This trade must stop . ”
14021	14032	14034	14034	Gumpas	121	“ I can take no responsibility for any such measure , ”
14036	14042	14044	14044	Caspian	85	“ Very well , then , ”
14046	14061	14044	14044	Caspian	85	“ we relieve you of your office . My Lord Bern , come here . ”
14110	14120	14107	14107	Caspian	85	“ I think we have had enough of governors , ”
14134	14142	14143	14143	he	85	“ As for you , my Lord , ”
14148	14180	14143	14143	he	85	“ I forgive you your debt for the tribute . But before noon tomorrow you and yours must be out of the castle , which is now the Duke ’s residence . ”
14181	14191	14193	14197	one of Gumpas ’s secretaries	607	“ Look here , this is all very well , ”
14199	14221	14193	14197	one of Gumpas ’s secretaries	607	“ but suppose all you gentlemen stop playacting and we do a little business . The question before us really is — ”
14222	14227	14229	14230	the Duke	1894	“ The question is , ”

14953	15032	14951	14951	Pug	125	“ Oh take him and welcome . Glad to have him off my hands . I ’ve never seen such a drug in the market in all my born days . Priced him at five crescents in the end and even so nobody’d have him . Threw him in free with other lots and still no one would have him . Would n’t touch him . Would n’t look at him . ’ Packs , bring out Sulky . ”

And I ’ve wondered about my friends and wondered what there really is behind that horizon . Nothing , most likely , yet I am always half ashamed that I stayed behind . But I wish your Majesty would n’t go . We may need your help here . This closing the slave market might make a new world ; war with Calormen is what I foresee . My liege , think again . ”

16773	17167	16770	16770	his	73	“ 3 September . The first day for ages when I have been able to write . We had been driven before a hurricane for thirteen days and nights . I know that because I kept a careful count , though the others all say it was only twelve . Pleasant to be embarked on a dangerous voyage with people who ca n’t even count right ! I have had a ghastly time , up and down enormous waves hour after hour , usually wet to the skin , and not even an attempt at giving us proper meals . Needless to say there ’s no wireless or even a rocket , so no chance of signalling anyone for help . It all proves what I keep on telling them , the madness of setting out in a rotten little tub like this . It would be bad enough even if one was with decent people instead of fiends in human form . Caspian and Edmund are simply brutal to me . The night we lost our mast ( there ’s only a stump left now ) , though I was not at all well , they forced me to come on deck and work like a slave . Lucy shoved her oar in by saying that Reepicheep was longing to go only he was too small . I wonder she does n’t see that everything that little beast does is all for the sake of showing off . Even at her age she ought to have that amount of sense . Today the beastly boat is level at last and the sun ’s out and we have all been jawing about what to do . We have food enough , pretty beastly stuff most of it , to last for sixteen days . ( The poultry were all washed overboard . Even if they had n’t been , the storm would have stopped them laying . ) The real trouble is water . Two casks seem to have got a leak knocked in them and are empty . ( Narnian efficiency again . ) On short rations , half a pint a day each , we ’ve got enough for twelve days . ( There ’s still lots of rum and wine but even they realize that would only make them thirstier . )
17168	17432	17924	17926	two dozen ”	2201	“ If we could , of course , the sensible thing would be to turn west at once and make for the Lone Islands . But it took us eighteen days to get where we are , running like mad with a gale behind us . Even if we got an east wind it might take us far longer to get back . And at present there ’s no sign of an east wind — in fact there ’s no wind at all . As for rowing back , it would take far too long and Caspian says the men could n’t row on half a pint of water a day . I ’m pretty sure this is wrong . I tried to explain that perspiration really cools people down , so the men would need less water if they were working . He did n’t take any notice of this , which is always his way when he ca n’t think of an answer . The others all voted for going on in the hope of finding land . I felt it my duty to point out that we did n’t know there was any land ahead and tried to get them to see the dangers of wishful thinking . Instead of producing a better plan they had the cheek to ask me what I proposed . So I just explained coolly and quietly that I had been kidnapped and brought away on this idiotic voyage without my consent , and it was hardly my business to get them out of their scrape .
17433	17499	16770	16770	his	73	“ 4 September . Still becalmed . Very short rations for dinner and I got less than anyone . Caspian is very clever at helping and thinks I do n’t see ! Lucy for some reason tried to make up to me by offering me some of hers but that interfering prig Edmund would n’t let her . Pretty hot sun . Terribly thirsty all evening .
17500	17536	17924	17926	two dozen ”	2201	“ 5 September . Still becalmed and very hot . Feeling rotten all day and am sure I ’ve got a temperature . Of course they have n’t the sense to keep a thermometer on board .
17537	17871	16770	16770	his	73	“ 6 September . A horrible day . Woke up in the night knowing I was feverish and must have a drink of water . Any doctor would have said so . Heaven knows I ’m the last person to try to get any unfair advantage but I never dreamed that this water - rationing would be meant to apply to a sick man . In fact I would have woken the others up and asked for some only I thought it would be selfish to wake them . So I got up and took my cup and tiptoed out of the Black Hole we slept in , taking great care not to disturb Caspian and Edmund , for they ’ve been sleeping badly since the heat and the short water began . I always try to consider others whether they are nice to me or not . I got out all right into the big room , if you can call it a room , where the rowing benches and the luggage are . The thing of water is at this end . All was going beautifully , but before I ’d drawn a cupful who should catch me but that little spy Reep . I tried to explain that I was going on deck for a breath of air ( the business about the water had nothing to do with him ) and he asked me why I had a cup . He made such a noise that the whole ship was roused . They treated me scandalously . I asked , as I think anyone would have , why Reepicheep was sneaking about the water cask in the middle of the night . He said that as he was too small to be any use on deck , he did sentry over the water every night so that one more man could go to sleep . Now comes their rotten unfairness : they all believed him . Can you beat it ?

17926	17952	16770	16770	his	73	” . I did n’t know what this meant till Edmund explained to me . It comes in the sort of books those Pevensie kids read .
17953	18010	17924	17926	two dozen ”	2201	“ After this cowardly threat Caspian changed his tune and started being patronizing . Said he was sorry for me and that everyone felt just as feverish as I did and we must all make the best of it , etc . , etc . Odious stuck - up prig . Stayed in bed all day today .
18011	18024	16770	16770	his	73	“ 7 September . A little wind today but still from the west .

Lucy gives me a little of her water ration . She says girls do n’t get as thirsty as boys . I had often thought this but it ought to be more generally known at sea .
18141	18162	16770	16770	his	73	“ 9 September . Land in sight ; a very high mountain a long way off to the south - east .

That idiot Caspian would n’t let us go ashore because it was getting dark and he was afraid of savages and wild beasts . Extra water ration tonight . ”

It sounds the least phoney of these countries . I wonder how much I can carry ? That bracelet now — those things in it are probably diamonds — I’ll slip that on my own wrist . Too big , but not if I push it right up here above my elbow . Then fill my pockets with diamonds — that ’s easier than gold . I wonder when this infernal rain ’s going to let up ? ”

21543	21559	21541	21541	Eustace	73	“ Of course , the brute had a mate and it ’s lying beside me . ”

22911	22959	22907	22907	Caspian	85	“ A dragon has just flown over the tree - tops and lighted on the beach . Yes , I am afraid it is between us and the ship . And arrows are no use against dragons . And they ’re not at all afraid of fire . ”

There are no other arrangements to be made . It will be light in a couple of hours . In an hour ’s time let a meal be served out and what is left of the wine . And let everything be done silently . ”

25745	25768	25788	25788	him	73	“ Well , last night I was more miserable than ever . And that beastly arm - ring was hurting like anything — ”
25769	25776	25788	25788	him	73	“ Is that all right now ? ”
25801	25806	25807	25807	he	73	“ There it is , ”
25810	25866	25807	25807	he	73	“ and anyone who likes can have it as far as I ’m concerned . Well , as I say , I was lying awake and wondering what on earth would become of me . And then — but , mind you , it may have been all a dream . I do n’t know . ”
25867	25871	25873	25873	Edmund	79	“ Go on , ”
25879	26025	25788	25788	him	73	“ Well , anyway , I looked up and saw the very last thing I expected : a huge lion coming slowly towards me . And one queer thing was that there was no moon last night , but there was moonlight where the lion was . So it came nearer and nearer . I was terribly afraid of it . You may think that , being a dragon , I could have knocked any lion out easily enough . But it was n’t that kind of fear . I was n’t afraid of it eating me , I was just afraid of it — if you can understand . Well , it came close up to me and looked straight into my eyes . And I shut my eyes tight . But that was n’t any good because it told me to follow it . ”
26026	26032	25777	25777	Eustace	73	“ You mean it spoke ? ”
26033	26150	25788	25788	him	73	“ I do n’t know . Now that you mention it , I do n’t think it did . But it told me all the same . And I knew I ’d have to do what it told me , so I got up and followed it . And it led me a long way into the mountains . And there was always this moonlight over and round the lion wherever we went . So at last we came to the top of a mountain I ’d never seen before and on the top of this mountain there was a garden — trees and fruit and everything . In the middle of it there was a well .
26151	26250	25777	25777	Eustace	73	“ I knew it was a well because you could see the water bubbling up from the bottom of it : but it was a lot bigger than most wells — like a very big , round bath with marble steps going down into it . The water was as clear as anything and I thought if I could get in there and bathe it would ease the pain in my leg . But the lion told me I must undress first . Mind you , I do n’t know if he said any words out loud or not .
26251	26405	25788	25788	him	73	“ I was just going to say that I could n’t undress because I had n’t any clothes on when I suddenly thought that dragons are snaky sort of things and snakes can cast their skins . Oh , of course , thought I , that ’s what the lion means . So I started scratching myself and my scales began coming off all over the place . And then I scratched a little deeper and , instead of just scales coming off here and there , my whole skin started peeling off beautifully , like it does after an illness , or as if I was a banana . In a minute or two I just stepped out of it . I could see it lying there beside me , looking rather nasty . It was a most lovely feeling . So I started to go down into the well for my bathe .
26406	26511	26649	26649	him	0	“ But just as I was going to put my feet into the water I looked down and saw that they were all hard and rough and wrinkled and scaly just as they had been before . Oh , that ’s all right , said I , it only means I had another smaller suit on underneath the first one , and I ’ll have to get out of it too . So 1 scratched and tore again and this underskin peeled off beautifully and out I stepped and left it lying beside the other one and went down to the well for my bathe .
26512	26596	26649	26649	him	0	“ Well , exactly the same thing happened again . And I thought to myself , oh dear , how ever many skins have I got to take off ? For I was longing to bathe my leg . So I scratched away for the third time and got off a third skin , just like the two others , and stepped out of it . But as soon as I looked at myself in the water I knew it had been no good .
26597	26601	26602	26602	I	0	“ Then the lion said”—but
26608	26617	26649	26649	him	0	spoke—“You will have to let me undress you . ”
26653	26746	26649	26649	him	0	“ The very first tear he made was so deep that I thought it had gone right into my heart . And when he began pulling the skin off , it hurt worse than anything I ’ve ever felt . The only thing that made me able to bear it was just the pleasure of feeling the stuff peel off . You know — if you ’ve ever picked the scab off a sore place . It hurts like billy - oh but it is such fun to see it coming away . ”
26747	26755	26757	26757	Edmund	79	“ I know exactly what you mean , ”
26759	26964	26649	26649	him	0	“ Well , he peeled the beastly stuff right off — just as I thought I ’d done it myself the other three times , only they had n’t hurt — and there it was lying on the grass : only ever so much thicker , and darker , and more knobbly - looking than the others had been . And there was I as smooth and soft as a peeled switch and smaller than I had been . Then he caught hold of me — I did n’t like that much for I was very tender underneath now that I ’d no skin on — and threw me into the water . It smarted like anything but only for a moment . After that it became perfectly delicious and as soon as I started swimming and splashing I found that all the pain had gone from my arm . And then I saw why . I ’d turned into a boy again . You ’d think me simply phoney if I told you how I felt about my own arms . I know they ’ve no muscle and are pretty mouldy compared with Caspian ’s , but I was so glad to see them .
26965	26978	26649	26649	him	0	“ After a bit the lion took me out and dressed me — ”
26979	26987	26649	26649	him	0	“ Dressed you . With his paws ? ”
26988	27045	26649	26649	him	0	“ Well , I do n’t exactly remember that bit . But he did somehow or other : in new clothes — the same I ’ve got on now , as a matter of fact . And then suddenly I was back here . Which is what makes me think it must have been a dream . ”
27046	27055	27057	27057	Edmund	79	“ No . It was n’t a dream , ”
27059	27063	26649	26649	him	0	“ Why not ? ”
27064	27090	26649	26649	him	0	“ Well , there are the clothes , for one thing . And you have been — well , un - dragoned , for another . ”
27091	27101	27103	27103	Eustace	73	“ What do you think it was , then ? ”
27105	27113	27115	27115	Edmund	79	“ I think you ’ve seen Aslan , ”
27117	27120	27122	27122	Eustace	73	“ Aslan ! ”
27124	27181	27122	27122	Eustace	73	“ I ’ve heard that name mentioned several times since we joined the Dawn Treader . And I felt — I do n’t know what — I hated it . But I was hating everything then . And by the way , I ’d like to apologize . I ’m afraid I ’ve been pretty beastly . ”
27182	27188	27190	27190	Edmund	79	“ That ’s all right , ”
27192	27224	27190	27190	Edmund	79	“ Between ourselves , you have n’t been as bad as I was on my first trip to Narnia . You were only an ass , but I was a traitor . ”
27225	27237	27239	27239	Eustace	73	“ Well , do n’t tell me about it , then , ”
27241	27252	27239	27239	Eustace	73	“ But who is Aslan ? Do you know him ? ”
27253	27260	27262	27262	Edmund	79	“ Well — he knows me , ”
27264	27314	27262	27262	Edmund	79	“ He is the great Lion , the son of the Emperor - beyond - the - Sea , who saved me and saved Narnia . We ’ve all seen him . Lucy sees him most often . And it may be Aslan ’s country we are sailing to . ”
27593	27603	27578	27578	HIS	103	“ from that time forth Eustace was a different boy ”
27684	27695	27697	27697	Caspian	85	“ Very well , then , catch as catch can , ”
27898	27903	27905	27905	Caspian	85	“ Pirates ’ work , ”
27907	27913	27915	27915	Edmund	79	“ Or the dragon ’s , ”
28116	28131	28106	28106	Lucy	80	“ Hello ! I do believe it ’s stopping . And what ’s that ? ”
28195	28203	28204	28204	Drinian	98	“ But they ca n’t be rocks , ”
28208	28218	28204	28204	Drinian	98	“ because they were n’t there five minutes ago . ”
28219	28226	28228	28228	Lucy	80	“ And one ’s just disappeared , ”
28230	28241	28243	28243	Edmund	79	“ Yes , and there ’s another one coming up , ”
28245	28249	28251	28251	Eustace	73	“ And nearer , ”
28253	28257	28259	28259	Caspian	85	“ Hang it ! ”
28261	28270	28259	28259	Caspian	85	“ The whole thing is moving this way . ”
28271	28285	28287	28287	Drinian	98	“ And moving a great deal quicker than we can sail , Sire , ”
28289	28300	28287	28287	Drinian	98	“ It ’ll be up with us in a minute . ”
28537	28542	28544	28546	the Master Bowman	142	“ Shoot ! Shoot ! ”
28820	28827	28814	28814	Reepicheep	89	“ Do n’t fight ! Push ! ”
29304	29308	29310	29310	Caspian	85	“ An axe , ”
29313	29318	29310	29310	Caspian	85	“ and still shove . ”
29687	29694	29696	29696	Drinian	98	“ By your leave , Sire , ”
29698	29723	29696	29696	Drinian	98	“ we will try to get under the lee of that country by rowing and lie in harbour , maybe till this is over . ”
29824	29834	29836	29836	Caspian	85	“ Which stream shall we water at , Drinian ? ”
29851	29863	29836	29836	Caspian	85	“ There seem to be two coming down into the bay . ”
29864	29872	29874	29874	Drinian	98	“ It makes little odds , Sire , ”
29876	29895	29874	29874	Drinian	98	“ But I think it ’s a shorter pull to that on the starboard - the eastern one . ”
29896	29902	29904	29904	Lucy	80	“ Here comes the rain , ”
29906	29913	29915	29915	Edmund	79	“ I should think it does ! ”
29924	29947	29915	29915	Edmund	79	“ I say , let ’s go to the other stream . There are trees there and we ’ll have some shelter . ”
29948	29954	29956	29956	Eustace	73	“ Yes , let ’s , ”
29958	29968	29956	29956	Eustace	73	“ No point in getting wetter than we need . ”
30007	30014	30016	30016	Caspian	85	“ They ’re right , Drinian , ”
30018	30034	30016	30016	Caspian	85	“ Why do n’t you bring her head round and make for the western stream ? ”
30035	30041	30043	30043	Drinian	98	“ As your Majesty pleases , ”
30199	30205	30207	30207	Eustace	73	“ Crazy , you know , ”
30221	30237	30207	30207	Eustace	73	“ Sailing on and on into that with no idea what we may get to . ”
30279	30290	30292	30292	Lucy	80	“ Do n’t let ’s go back the same way , ”
30297	30320	30292	30292	Lucy	80	“ let ’s go along a bit and come down by the other stream , the one Drinian wanted to go to . ”
30417	30428	30429	30429	he	79	“ They go in for sharp stones on this island , ”
30438	30502	30429	30429	he	79	“ Where is the wretched thing ? . . . Ah , now I ’ve got it . . . Hullo ! It was n’t a stone at all , it ’s a sword - hilt . No , by jove , it ’s a whole sword ; what the rust has left of it . It must have lain here for ages . ”
30503	30514	30516	30516	Caspian	85	“ Narnian , too , by the look of it , ”
30524	30532	30534	30534	Lucy	80	“ I ’m sitting on something too , ”
30536	30540	30534	30534	Lucy	80	“ Something hard . ”

30644	30651	30653	30653	Caspian	85	“ Just what I was thinking , ”
30655	30678	30653	30653	Caspian	85	“ I wonder which it was . There ’s nothing on the dagger to show . And I wonder how he died . ”
30679	30688	30690	30690	Reepicheep	89	“ And how we are to avenge him , ”
30712	30716	30717	30717	he	79	“ Look here , ”
30720	30739	30717	30717	he	79	“ there ’s something very fishy about this . He ca n’t have been killed in a fight . ”
30740	30744	30746	30746	Caspian	85	“ Why not ? ”
30748	30752	30754	30754	Edmund	79	“ No bones , ”
30756	30789	30754	30754	Edmund	79	“ An enemy might take the armour and leave the body . But who ever heard of a chap who ’d won a fight carrying away the body and leaving the armour ? ”
30790	30800	30801	30801	Lucy	80	“ Perhaps he was killed by a wild animal , ”
30804	30812	30814	30814	Edmund	79	“ It ’d be a clever animal , ”
30816	30827	30814	30814	Edmund	79	“ that would take a man ’s mail shirt off . ”
30828	30833	30835	30835	Caspian	85	“ Perhaps a dragon ? ”
30837	30841	30843	30843	Eustace	73	“ Nothing doing , ”
30845	30858	30843	30843	Eustace	73	“ A dragon could n’t do it . I ought to know . ”
30859	30872	30874	30874	Lucy	80	“ Well , let ’s get away from the place , anyway , ”
30893	30898	30900	30900	Caspian	85	“ If you like , ”
30905	30919	30900	30900	Caspian	85	“ I do n’t think any of this stuff is worth taking away . ”
31011	31014	31003	31003	Lucy	80	“ Look , ”
31120	31123	31125	31125	Caspian	85	“ Well ! ”
31127	31144	31125	31125	Caspian	85	“ That was worth coming to see ! I wonder , can we get it out ? ”
31145	31154	31156	31156	Reepicheep	89	“ We can dive for it , Sire , ”
31158	31164	31166	31166	Edmund	79	“ No good at all , ”
31168	31252	31166	31166	Edmund	79	“ At least , if it ’s really gold — solid gold — it’ll be far too heavy to bring up . And that pool ’s twelve or fifteen feet deep if it ’s an inch . Half a moment , though . It ’s a good thing I ’ve brought a hunting spear with me . Let ’s see what the depth is like . Hold on to my hand , Caspian , while I lean out over the water a bit . ”
31282	31308	31279	31279	Lucy	80	“ I do n’t believe the statue is gold at all . It ’s only the light . Your spear looks just the same colour . ”
31309	31314	31322	31322	Edmund	79	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
31331	31338	31340	31340	Edmund	79	“ I could n’t hold it , ”
31342	31348	31340	31340	Edmund	79	“ it seemed so heavy . ”
31349	31359	31361	31361	Caspian	85	“ And there it is on the bottom now , ”
31363	31379	31361	31361	Caspian	85	“ and Lucy is right . It looks just the same colour as the statue . ”
31423	31440	31406	31406	himself	79	“ Get back ! Back from the water . All of you . At once ! ! ”
31449	31452	31454	31454	Edmund	79	“ Look , ”
31456	31465	31454	31454	Edmund	79	“ look at the toes of my boots . ”
31466	31473	31475	31475	Eustace	73	“ They look a bit yellow , ”
31477	31485	31487	31487	Edmund	79	“ They ’re gold , solid gold , ”
31489	31514	31487	31487	Edmund	79	“ Look at them . Feel them . The leather ’s pulled away from it already . And they ’re as heavy as lead . ”
31515	31519	31521	31521	Caspian	85	“ By Aslan ! ”
31523	31531	31521	31521	Caspian	85	“ You do n’t mean to say- ? ”
31532	31538	31540	31540	Edmund	79	“ Yes , I do , ”
31542	31607	31540	31540	Edmund	79	“ That water turns things into gold . It turned the spear into gold , that ’s why it got so heavy . And it was just lapping against my feet ( it ’s a good thing I was n’t barefoot ) and it turned the toe - caps into gold . And that poor fellow on the bottom — well , you see . ”
31608	31618	31620	31620	Lucy	80	“ So it is n’t a statue at all , ”
31626	31683	31540	31540	Edmund	79	“ No . The whole thing is plain now . He was here on a hot day . He undressed on top of the cliff — where we were sitting . The clothes have rotted away or been taken by birds to line nests with ; the armour ’s still there . Then he dived and — ”
31684	31688	31690	31690	Lucy	80	“ Do n’t , ”
31692	31698	31690	31690	Lucy	80	“ What a horrible thing . ”
31699	31709	31711	31711	Edmund	79	“ And what a narrow shave we ’ve had , ”
31713	31717	31719	31719	Reepicheep	89	“ Narrow indeed , ”
31721	31749	31719	31719	Reepicheep	89	“ Anyone ’s finger , anyone ’s foot , anyone ’s whisker , or anyone ’s tail , might have slipped into the water at any moment . ”

31759	31767	31757	31757	Caspian	85	“ we may as well test it . ”

31844	31905	31837	31837	his	85	“ would soon be the richest of all the Kings of the world . I claim this land for ever as a Narnian possession . It shall be called Goldwater Island . And I bind all of you to secrecy . No one must know of this . Not even Drinian — on pain of death , do you hear ? ”
31906	31913	31915	31915	Edmund	79	“ Who are you talking to ? ”
31917	31956	31915	31915	Edmund	79	“ I ’m no subject of yours . If anything it ’s the other way round . I am one of the four ancient sovereigns of Narnia and you are under allegiance to the High King my brother . ”
31957	31971	31973	31973	Caspian	85	“ So it has come to that , King Edmund , has it ? ”
31984	31994	31996	31996	Lucy	80	“ Oh , stop it , both of you , ”
31998	32021	31996	31996	Lucy	80	“ That ’s the worst of doing anything with boys . You ’re all such swaggering , bullying idiots — oooh ! — ”
32106	32115	32102	32102	Lucy	80	“ He was the size of an elephant , ”

32208	32246	32206	32206	Reepicheep	89	“ this is a place with a curse on it . Let us get back on board at once . And if I might have the honour of naming this island , I should call it Deathwater . ”
32247	32259	32261	32261	Caspian	85	“ That strikes me as a very good name , Reep , ”
32263	32308	32261	32261	Caspian	85	“ though now that I come to think of it , I do n’t know why . But the weather seems to be settling and I dare say Drinian would like to be off . What a lot we shall have to tell him . ”
32330	32343	32345	32345	Drinian	98	“ Their Majesties all seemed a bit bewitched when they came aboard , ”

33749	33759	33696	33696	Caspian	85	“ Did they sound like humans from their footsteps ? ”
33760	33783	33696	33696	Caspian	85	“ I did n’t hear any noise of feet — only voices and this frightful thudding and thumping — like a mallet . ”

33792	33805	33790	33790	Reepicheep	89	“ do they become visible when you drive a sword into them ? ”

33820	33845	33818	33818	Caspian	85	“ But let ’s get out of this gateway . There ’s one of these gentry at that pump listening to all we say . ”

34563	34577	34579	34579	Reepicheep	89	“ And if it is anything against her Majesty ’s honour or safety , ”
34581	34596	34579	34579	Reepicheep	89	“ you will wonder to see how many we can kill before we die . ”
34597	34600	34602	34604	the Chief Voice	1150	“ Well , ”
34606	34619	34602	34604	the Chief Voice	1150	“ It ’s a long story . Suppose we all sit down ? ”
34636	34639	34641	34643	the Chief Voice	1150	“ Well , ”
34645	35355	34641	34643	the Chief Voice	1150	“ It ’s like this . This island has been the property of a great magician time out of mind . And we all are — or perhaps in a manner of speaking , I might say , we were — his servants . Well , to cut a long story short , this magician that I was speaking about , he told us to do something we did n’t like . And why not ? Because we did n’t want to . Well , then , this same magician he fell into a great rage ; for I ought to tell you he owned the island and he was n’t used to being crossed . He was terribly downright , you know . But let me see , where am I ? Oh yes , this magician then , he goes upstairs ( for you must know he kept all his magic things up there and we all lived down below ) , I say he goes upstairs and puts a spell on us . An uglifying spell . If you saw us now , which in my opinion you may thank your stars you ca n’t , you would n’t believe what we looked like before we were uglified . You would n’t really . So there we all were so ugly we could n’t bear to look at one another . So then what did we do ? Well , I ’ll tell you what we did . We waited till we thought this same magician would be asleep in the afternoon and we creep upstairs and go to his magic book , as bold as brass , to see if we can do anything about this uglification . But we were all of a sweat and a tremble , so I wo n’t deceive you . But , believe me or believe me not , I do assure you that we could n’t find any thing in the way of a spell for taking off the ugliness . And what with time getting on and being afraid that the old gentleman might wake up any minute — I was all of a muck sweat , so I wo n’t deceive you — well , to cut a long story short , whether we did right or whether we did wrong , in the end we see a spell for making people invisible . And we thought we ’d rather be invisible than go on being as ugly as all that . And why ? Because we ’d like it better . So my little girl , who ’s just about your little girl ’s age , and a sweet child she was before she was uglified , though now — but least said soonest mended — I say , my little girl she says the spell , for it ’s got to be a little girl or else the magician himself , if you see my meaning , for otherwise it wo n’t work . And why not ? Because nothing happens . So my Clipsie says the spell , for I ought to have told you she reads beautifully , and there we all were as invisible as you could wish to see . And I do assure you it was a relief not to see one another ’s faces . At first , anyway . But the long and the short of it is we ’re mortal tired of being invisible . And there ’s another thing . We never reckoned on this magician ( the one I was telling you about before ) going invisible too . But we have n’t ever seen him since . So we do n’t know if he ’s dead , or gone .away , or whether he ’s just sitting upstairs being invisible , and perhaps coming down and being invisible there . And , believe me , it ’s no manner of use listening because he always did go about with his bare feet on , making no more noise than a great big cat . And I ’ll tell all you gentlemen straight , it ’s getting more than what our nerves can stand . ”
35423	35426	35428	35428	Lucy	80	“ But , ”
35432	35448	35428	35428	Lucy	80	“ what ’s all this got to do with us ? I do n’t understand . ”
35449	35467	35469	35471	the Chief Voice	1150	“ Why , bless me , if I have n’t gone and left out the whole point , ”
35473	35482	35484	35486	the Other Voices	150	“ That you have , that you have , ”
35491	35514	35484	35486	the Other Voices	150	“ No one could n’t have left it out cleaner and better . Keep it up , Chief , keep it up . ”
35515	35528	35530	35532	the Chief Voice	1150	“ Well , I need n’t go over the whole story again , ”
35534	35540	35542	35542	Caspian	85	“ No . Certainly not , ”
35546	35558	35560	35562	the Chief Voice	1150	“ Well , then , to put it in a nutshell , ”
35564	35716	35560	35562	the Chief Voice	1150	“ we ’ve been waiting for ever so long for a nice little girl from foreign parts , like it might be you , Missie — that would go upstairs and go to the magic book and find the spell that takes off the invisibleness , and say it . And we all swore that the first strangers as landed on this island ( having a nice little girl with them , I mean , for if they had n’t it ’d be another matter ) we would n’t let them go away alive unless they ’d done the needful for us . And that ’s why , gentlemen , if your little girl does n’t come up to scratch , it will be our painful duty to cut all your throats . Merely in the way of business , as you might say , and no offence , I hope . ”
35717	35726	35728	35728	Reepicheep	89	“ I do n’t see all your weapons , ”
35730	35736	35728	35728	Reepicheep	89	“ Are they invisible too ? ”
35769	35778	35780	35782	the Chief Voice	1150	“ That ’s a spear , that is , ”
35784	35795	35797	35798	the others	1949	“ That it is , Chief , that it is , ”
35800	35809	35797	35798	the others	1949	“ You could n’t have put it better . ”
35810	35818	35819	35821	the Chief Voice	1150	“ And it came from my hand , ”
35824	35833	35819	35821	the Chief Voice	1150	“ They get visible when they leave us . ”
35834	35845	35847	35847	Lucy	80	“ But why do you want me to do this ? ”
35849	35866	35819	35821	the Chief Voice	1150	“ Why ca n’t one of your own people ? Have n’t you got any girls ? ”
35867	35874	35876	35878	all the Voices	1164	“ We dursen’t , we dursen’t , ”
35880	35888	35876	35878	all the Voices	1164	“ We ’re not going upstairs again . ”
35889	35894	35896	35896	Caspian	85	“ In other words , ”
35898	35921	35896	35896	Caspian	85	“ you are asking this lady to face some danger which you dare n’t ask your own sisters and daughters to face ! ”
35922	35931	35933	35935	all the Voices	1164	“ That ’s right , that ’s right , ”
35938	35963	35933	35935	all the Voices	1164	“ You could n’t have said it better . Eh , you ’ve had some education , you have . Anyone can see that . ”
35964	35972	35974	35974	Edmund	79	“ Well , of all the outrageous — ”
35980	35997	35933	35935	all the Voices	1164	“ Would I have to go upstairs at night , or would it do in daylight ? ”
35998	36009	36011	36013	the Chief Voice	1150	“ Oh , daylight , daylight , to be sure , ”
36015	36037	36011	36013	the Chief Voice	1150	“ Not at night . No one ’s asking you to do that . Go upstairs in the dark ? Ugh . ”
36038	36049	36051	36051	Lucy	80	“ All right , then , I ’ll do it , ”
36053	36056	36057	36057	she	80	“ No , ”
36065	36104	36057	36057	she	80	“ do n’t try to stop me . Ca n’t you see it ’s no use ? There are dozens of them there . We ca n’t fight them . And the other way there is a chance . ”
36105	36110	36112	36112	Caspian	85	“ But a magician ! ”
36114	36118	36120	36120	Lucy	80	“ I know , ”
36122	36149	36120	36120	Lucy	80	“ But he may n’t be as bad as they make out . Do n’t you get the idea that these people are not very brave ? ”
36150	36158	36160	36160	Eustace	73	“ They ’re certainly not very clever , ”
36162	36168	36170	36170	Edmund	79	“ Look here , Lu , ”
36172	36198	36170	36170	Edmund	79	“ We really ca n’t let you do a thing like this . Ask Reep , I ’m sure he ’ll say just the same . ”
36199	36213	36215	36215	Lucy	80	“ But it ’s to save my own life as well as yours , ”
36217	36236	36215	36215	Lucy	80	“ I do n’t want to be cut to bits with invisible swords any more than anyone else . ”
36237	36245	36247	36247	Reepicheep	89	“ Her Majesty is in the right , ”
36249	36322	36247	36247	Reepicheep	89	“ If we had any assurance of saving her by battle , our duty would be very - plain . It appears to me that we have none . And the service they ask of her is in no way contrary to her Majesty ’s honour , but a noble and heroical act . If the Queen ’s heart moves her to risk the magician , I will not speak against it . ”
36426	36443	36423	36423	Lucy	80	“ I ’m sure they ’re not treacherous . They ’re not like that at all , ”
36608	36620	36622	36622	Eustace	73	“ I ’m beginning to feel very inquisitive about these people , ”
36626	36648	36622	36622	Eustace	73	“ Do you think they ’re human at all ? More like huge grasshoppers or giant frogs , I should say . ”
36649	36656	36658	36658	Edmund	79	“ It does look like it , ”
36660	36687	36658	36658	Edmund	79	“ But do n’t put the idea of the grasshoppers into Lucy ’s head . She ’s not too keen on insects ; especially big ones . ”

37519	37537	37539	37539	Lucy	80	“ I just caught my own reflection with the tail of my eye as I went past , ”
37543	37555	37539	37539	Lucy	80	“ That was all it was . It ’s quite harmless . ”
37956	37966	37968	37968	Lucy	80	“ But it might take me days and weeks ! ”
37976	37992	37968	37968	Lucy	80	“ and I feel already as if I ’d been in this place for hours . ”
38281	38288	38289	38289	she	80	“ But I must get on , ”
38806	38813	38815	38815	Lucy	80	“ I will say the spell , ”

39206	39217	39219	39219	Marjorie	153	“ Do n’t know what you mean by taken up , ”
39221	39228	39230	39230	Anne	154	“ Oh yes , you do , ”
39232	39241	39230	39230	Anne	154	“ You were crazy about her last term . ”
39242	39249	39251	39251	Marjorie	153	“ No , I was n’t , ”
39253	39285	39251	39251	Marjorie	153	“ I ’ve got more sense than that . Not a bad little kid in her way . But I was getting pretty tired of her before the end of term . ”
39286	39301	39303	39303	Lucy	80	“ Well , you jolly well wo n’t have the chance any other term ! ”
39305	39312	39303	39303	Lucy	80	“ Two - faced little beast . ”
39343	39346	39348	39348	Lucy	80	“ Well , ”
39352	39457	39348	39348	Lucy	80	“ I did think better of her than that . And I did all sorts of things for her last term , and I stuck to her when not many other girls would . And she knows it too . And to Anne Featherstone of all people ! I wonder are all my friends the same ? There are lots of other pictures . No . I wo n’t look at any more . I wo n’t , I wo n’t ’ and with a great effort she turned over the page , but not before a large , angry tear had splashed on it .
39467	39564	39350	39350	herself	80	“ for the refreshment of the spirit ’ . The pictures were fewer here but very beautiful . And what Lucy found herself reading was more like a story than a spell . It went on for three pages and before she had read to the bottom of the page she had forgotten that she was reading at all . She was living in the story as if it were real , and all the pictures were real too . When she had got to the third page and come to the end , she said , “

39947	39989	39944	39944	she	80	“ I suppose I ’ve made everything visible , and not only the Thumpers . There might be lots of other invisible things hanging about a place like this . I ’m not sure that I want to see them all . ”
40172	40177	40179	40179	she	80	“ Oh , Aslan , ”
40181	40190	40179	40179	she	80	“ it was kind of you to come . ”
40191	40200	40202	40202	he	91	“ I have been here all the time , ”
40204	40213	40179	40179	she	80	“ but you have just made me visible . ”
40214	40217	40219	40219	Lucy	80	“ Aslan ! ”
40225	40244	40219	40219	Lucy	80	“ Do n’t make fun of me . As if anything 1 could do would make you visible ! ”
40245	40249	40251	40251	Aslan	91	“ It did , ”
40253	40265	40251	40251	Aslan	91	“ Do you think I would n’t obey my own rules ? ”
40274	40277	40278	40278	he	91	“ Child , ”
40281	40289	40278	40278	he	91	“ I think you have been eavesdropping . ”
40290	40293	40219	40219	Lucy	80	“ Eavesdropping ? ”
40294	40307	40278	40278	he	91	“ You listened to what your two schoolfellows were saying about you . ”
40308	40326	40219	40219	Lucy	80	“ Oh that ? I never thought that was eavesdropping , Aslan . Was n’t it magic ? ”
40327	40376	40278	40278	he	91	“ Spying on people by magic is the same as spying on them in any other way . And you have misjudged your friend . She is weak , but she loves you . She was afraid of the older girl and said what she does not mean . ”
40377	40395	40219	40219	Lucy	80	“ I do n’t think I ’d ever be able to forget what I heard her say . ”
40396	40403	40278	40278	he	91	“ No , you wo n’t . ”
40404	40408	40410	40410	Lucy	80	“ Oh dear , ”
40412	40453	40410	40410	Lucy	80	“ Have I spoiled everything ? Do you mean we would have gone on being friends if it had n’t been for this — and been really great friends — all our lives perhaps — and now we never shall . ”
40454	40457	40459	40459	Aslan	91	“ Child , ”
40461	40481	40459	40459	Aslan	91	“ did I not explain to you once before that no one is ever told what would have happened ? ”
40482	40490	40492	40492	Lucy	80	“ Yes , Aslan , you did , ”
40494	40502	40492	40492	Lucy	80	“ I ’m sorry . But please — ”
40503	40510	40459	40459	Aslan	91	“ Speak on , dear heart . ”
40511	40547	40492	40492	Lucy	80	“ Shall I ever be able to , read that story again ; the one I could n’t remember ? Will you tell it to me , Aslan ? Oh do , do , do . ”
40548	40578	40459	40459	Aslan	91	“ Indeed , yes , I will tell it to you for years and years . But now , come . We must meet the master of this house . ”
40647	40659	40641	40641	he	1256	“ Welcome , Sir , to the least of your houses . ”
40660	40680	40638	40638	he	1256	“ Do you grow weary , Coriakin , of ruling such foolish subjects as I have given you here ? ”
40681	40684	40686	40687	the Magician	2394	“ No , ”
40689	40740	40686	40687	the Magician	2394	“ they are very stupid but there is no real harm in them . I begin to grow rather fond of the creatures . Sometimes , perhaps , I am a little impatient , waiting for the day when they can be governed by wisdom instead of this rough magic . ”
40741	40749	40751	40751	Aslan	91	“ All in good time , Coriakin , ”
40753	40764	40638	40638	he	1256	“ Yes , all in very good time , Sir , ”
40769	40779	40638	40638	he	1256	“ Do you intend to show yourself to them ? ”
40780	40783	40785	40786	the Lion	1258	“ Nay , ”
40806	40888	40785	40786	the Lion	1258	“ I should frighten them out of their senses . Many stars will grow old and come to take their rest in islands before your people are ripe for that . And today before sunset I must visit Trumpkin the Dwarf where he sits in the castle of Cair Paravel counting the days till his master Caspian comes home . I will tell him all your story , Lucy . Do not look so sad . We shall meet soon again . ”
40889	40894	40896	40896	Lucy	80	“ Please , Aslan , ”
40898	40905	40896	40896	Lucy	80	“ what do you call soon ? ”
40906	40913	40915	40915	Aslan	91	“ I call all times soon , ”
40931	40934	40936	40936	he	2394	“ Gone ! ”
40938	40977	40936	40936	he	2394	“ and you and I quite crestfallen . It ’s always like that , you ca n’t keep him ; it ’s not as if he were a tame lion . And how did you enjoy my book ? ”
40978	40986	40988	40988	Lucy	80	“ Parts of it very much indeed , ”
40990	41001	40988	40988	Lucy	80	“ Did you know I was there all the time ? ”
41002	41082	40936	40936	he	2394	“ Well , of course I knew when I let the Duffers make themselves invisible that you would be coming along presently to take the spell off . I was n’t quite sure of the exact day . And I was n’t especially on the watch this morning . You see they had made me invisible too and being invisible always makes me so sleepy . Heigh - ho — there I ’m yawning again . Are you hungry ? ”
41083	41092	41094	41094	Lucy	80	“ Well , perhaps I am a little , ”
41096	41106	41094	41094	Lucy	80	“ I ’ve no idea what the time is . ”
41107	41110	41112	41113	the Magician	2394	“ Come , ”
41115	41135	41112	41113	the Magician	2394	“ All times may be soon to Aslan ; but in my home all hungry times are one o’clock . ”
41203	41214	41216	41216	he	2394	“ I hope that is - what you would like , ”
41218	41241	41216	41216	he	2394	“ I have tried to give you food more like the food of your own land than perhaps you have had lately . ”
41242	41247	41249	41249	Lucy	80	“ It ’s lovely , ”
41317	41324	41326	41326	Lucy	80	“ When will the spell work ? ”
41328	41338	41326	41326	Lucy	80	“ Will the Duffers be visible again at once ? ”
41339	41368	41409	41410	the Magician	2394	“ Oh yes , they ’re visible now . But they ’re probably all asleep still ; they always take a rest in the middle of the day . ”
41369	41396	41326	41326	Lucy	80	“ And now that they ’re visible , are you going to let them off being ugly ? Will you make them as they were before ? ”
41397	41407	41409	41410	the Magician	2394	“ Well , that ’s rather a delicate question , ”
41412	41458	41409	41410	the Magician	2394	“ You see , it ’s only they who think they were so nice to look at before . They say they ’ve been uglified , but that is n’t what I called it . Many people might say the change was for the better . ”
41459	41465	41326	41326	Lucy	80	“ Are they awfully conceited ? ”
41466	41496	41409	41410	the Magician	2394	“ They are . Or at least the Chief Duffer is , and he ’s taught all the rest to be . They always believe every word he says . ”
41497	41503	41505	41505	Lucy	80	“ We ’d noticed that , ”
41507	41571	41409	41410	the Magician	2394	“ Yes — we’d get on better without him , in a way . Of course I could turn him into something else , or even put a spell on him which would make them not believe a word he said . But I do n’t like to do that . It ’s better for them to admire him than to admire nobody . ”
41572	41579	41581	41581	Lucy	80	“ Do n’t they admire you ? ”
41583	41589	41591	41592	the Magician	2394	“ Oh , not me , ”
41594	41601	41591	41592	the Magician	2394	“ They would n’t admire me . ”
41602	41619	41409	41410	the Magician	2394	“ What was it you uglified them for — I mean , what they call uglified ? ”
41620	41767	41591	41592	the Magician	2394	“ Well , they would n’t do what they were told . Their work is to mind the garden and raise food — not for me , as they imagine , but for themselves . They would n’t do it at all if I did n’t make them . And of course for a garden you want water . There is a beautiful spring about half a mile away up the hill . And from that spring there flows a stream which comes right past the garden . All I asked them to do was to take their water from the stream instead of trudging up to the spring with their buckets two or three times a day and tiring themselves out besides spilling half of it on the way back . But they would n’t see it . In the end they refused point blank . ”
41768	41777	41779	41779	Lucy	80	“ Are they as stupid as all that ? ”
41785	41890	41781	41782	The Magician	2394	“ You would n’t believe the troubles I ’ve had with them . A few months ago they were all for washing up the plates and knives before dinner : they said it saved time afterwards . I ’ve caught them planting boiled potatoes to save cooking them when they were dug up . One day the cat got into the dairy and twenty of them were at work moving all the milk out ; no one thought of moving the cat . But I see you ’ve finished . Let ’s go and look at the Duffers now they can be looked at . ”
41935	41943	41931	41932	the Magician	2394	“ There . There are your Duffers . ”
41944	41951	41953	41953	Lucy	80	“ I do n’t see anybody , ”
41955	41963	41953	41953	Lucy	80	“ And what are those mushroom things ? ”
42129	42131	42126	42131	Each of the “ mushrooms ”	2483	“ mushrooms ”
42306	42315	42317	42317	Lucy	80	“ Oh , the funnies , the funnies , ”
42323	42331	42317	42317	Lucy	80	“ Did you make them like that ? ”
42332	42344	42346	42347	the Magician	2394	“ Yes , yes . I made the Duffers into Monopods , ”
42361	42365	42366	42366	he	2394	“ But watch , ”
42457	42467	42444	42444	they	1270	“ Hey , lads ! We ’re visible again . ”
42468	42473	42484	42486	the Chief Monopod	1280	“ Visible we are , ”
42488	42508	42484	42486	the Chief Monopod	1280	“ And what I say is , when chaps are visible , why , they can see one another . ”
42509	42522	42524	42526	all the others	1924	“ Ah , there it is , there it is , Chief , ”
42528	42552	42524	42526	all the others	1924	“ There ’s the point . No one ’s got a clearer head than you . You could n’t have made it plainer . ”
42553	42566	42568	42570	the Chief Monopod	1280	“ She caught the old man napping , that little girl did , ”
42572	42580	42568	42570	the Chief Monopod	1280	“ We ’ve beaten him this time . ”
42581	42592	42594	42595	the chorus	1148	“ Just what we were , going to say ourselves , ”
42597	42616	42594	42595	the chorus	1148	“ You ’re going stronger than ever today , Chief . Keep it up , keep it up . ”
42617	42629	42631	42631	Lucy	80	“ But do they dare to talk about you like that ? ”
42633	42653	42631	42631	Lucy	80	“ They seemed to be so afraid of you yesterday . Do n’t they know you might be listening ? ”
42654	42666	42668	42669	the Magician	2394	“ That ’s one of the funny things about the Duffers , ”
42671	42711	42668	42669	the Magician	2394	“ One minute they talk as if I ran everything and overheard everything and was extremely dangerous . The next moment they think they can take me in by tricks that a baby would see through — bless them ! ”
42712	42725	42727	42727	Lucy	80	“ Will they have to be turned back into their proper shapes ? ”
42729	42773	42727	42727	Lucy	80	“ Oh , I do hope it would n’t be unkind to leave them as they are . Do they really mind very much ? They seem pretty happy . I say — look at that jump . What were they like before ? ”
42774	42779	42781	42781	he	2394	“ Common little dwarfs , ”
42783	42796	42781	42781	he	2394	“ Nothing like so nice as the sort you have in Narnia . ”
42797	42808	42810	42810	Lucy	80	“ It would be a pity to change them back , ”
42812	42838	42810	42810	Lucy	80	“ They ’re so funny : and they ’re rather nice . Do you think it would make any difference if I told them that ? ”
42839	42855	42781	42781	he	2394	“ I ’m sure it would — if you could get it into their heads . ”
42856	42865	42810	42810	Lucy	80	“ Will you come with me and try ? ”
42866	42880	42781	42781	he	2394	“ No , no . You ’ll get on far better without me . ”
42881	42888	42890	42890	Lucy	80	“ Thanks awfully for the lunch , ”
42948	42954	42955	42955	she	80	“ It ’s all right , ”
42958	42978	42955	42955	she	80	“ Everything ’s all right . The Magician ’s a brick — and I ’ve seen Him — Aslan . ”
43023	43032	43033	43033	they	1924	“ Here she comes , here she comes , ”
43036	43058	43033	43033	they	1924	“ Three cheers for the little girl . Ah ! She put it across the old gentleman properly , she did . ”
43059	43066	43068	43070	the Chief Monopod	1280	“ And we ’re extremely regrettable , ”
43072	43124	43068	43070	the Chief Monopod	1280	“ that we ca n’t give you the pleasure of seeing us as we were before we were uglified , for you would n’t believe the difference , and that ’s the truth , for there ’s no denying we ’re mortal ugly now , so we wo n’t deceive you . ”
43125	43138	43140	43141	the others	1949	“ Eh , that we are , Chief , that we are , ”
43150	43161	43140	43141	the others	1949	“ You ’ve said it , you ’ve said it . ”
43162	43173	43175	43175	Lucy	80	“ But I do n’t think you are at all , ”
43183	43191	43175	43175	Lucy	80	“ I think you look very nice . ”
43192	43199	43201	43202	the Monopods	164	“ Hear her , hear her , ”
43204	43224	43201	43202	the Monopods	164	“ True for you , Missie . Very nice we look . You could n’t find a handsomer lot . ”
43244	43251	43253	43255	the Chief Monopod	1280	“ She ’s a - saying , ”
43257	43269	43253	43255	the Chief Monopod	1280	“ as how we looked very nice before we were uglified . ”
43270	43281	43283	43284	the others	1949	“ True for you , Chief , true for you , ”
43286	43298	43283	43284	the others	1949	“ That ’s what she says . We heard her ourselves . ”
43299	43304	43306	43306	Lucy	80	“ I did not , ”
43308	43317	43306	43306	Lucy	80	“ I said you ’re very nice now . ”
43318	43327	43329	43331	the Chief Monopod	165	“ So she did , so she did , ”
43333	43341	43329	43331	the Chief Monopod	165	“ said we were very nice then . ”
43342	43351	43353	43354	the Monopods	164	“ Hear ’em both , hear ’em both , ”
43356	43375	43353	43354	the Monopods	164	“ There ’s a pair for you . Always right . They could n’t have put it better . ”
43376	43385	43387	43387	Lucy	80	“ But we ’re saying just the opposite , ”
43395	43408	43410	43411	the Monopods	164	“ So you are , to be sure , so you are , ”
43413	43427	43410	43411	the Monopods	164	“ Nothing like an opposite . Keep it up , both of you . ”
43428	43437	43439	43439	Lucy	80	“ You ’re enough to drive anyone mad , ”
43553	43566	43568	43568	He	73	“ I wish the Magician would make them inaudible instead of invisible . ”
43624	43666	43618	43618	they	164	“ Eh , he ca n’t put things the way our Chief does . But you ’ll learn , young man . Hark to him . He ’ll show you how to say things . There ’s a speaker for you ! ”
43708	43746	43699	43699	He	89	“ Worthy and intelligent Monopods , you do not need boats . Each of you has a foot that will do instead . Just jump as lightly as you can on the water and see what happens . ”
43932	43939	43940	43940	they	160	“ That ’s what we are , ”
43943	43964	43940	43940	they	160	“ Moneypuds , Pomonods , Poddymons . Just what it was on the tips of our tongues to call ourselves . ”
44937	44944	44946	44946	Caspian	85	“ Do we go into this ? ”
44950	44956	44958	44958	Drinian	98	“ Not by my advice , ”
44960	44966	44968	44969	several sailors	1354	“ The Captain ’s right , ”
44971	44978	44980	44980	Edmund	79	“ I almost think he is , ”
45018	45023	45024	45024	he	89	“ And why not ? ”
45027	45036	45024	45024	he	89	“ Will someone explain to me why not . ”
45048	45057	45058	45058	he	89	“ If I were addressing peasants or slaves , ”
45061	45106	45058	45058	he	89	“ I might suppose that this suggestion proceeded from cowardice . But I hope it will never be told in Narnia that a company of noble and royal persons in the flower of their age turned tail because they were afraid of the dark . ”
45107	45121	45123	45123	Drinian	98	“ But what manner of use would it be ploughing through that blackness ? ”
45125	45128	45130	45130	Reepicheep	89	“ Use ? ”
45132	45210	45130	45130	Reepicheep	89	“ Use , Captain ? If by use you mean filling our bellies or our purses , I confess it will be no use at all . So far as I know we did not set sail to look for things useful but to seek honour and adventure . And here is as great an adventure as ever I heard of , and here , if we turn back , no tittle impeachment of all our honours . ”
45223	45227	45218	45218	their	1356	“ Honour be blowed ”
45233	45276	45230	45230	Caspian	85	“ Oh , bother you , Reepicheep . I almost wish we ’d left you at home . All right ! If you put it that way , I suppose we shall have to go on . Unless Lucy would rather not ? ”
45295	45300	45289	45289	she	80	“ I ’m game . ”
45301	45310	45312	45312	Drinian	98	“ Your Majesty will at least order lights ? ”
45314	45319	45321	45321	Caspian	85	“ By all means , ”
45323	45330	45321	45321	Caspian	85	“ See to it , Captain . ”
45450	45461	45463	45463	Caspian	85	“ And now , in Aslan ’s name , forward ! ”
45465	45486	45463	45463	Caspian	85	“ A slow , steady stroke . And let every man be silent and keep his ears open for orders . ”
45899	45903	46026	46026	someone	2007	“ Who calls ? ”

45944	45993	45885	45885	Reepicheep	89	“ Mercy ! Even if you are only one more dream , have merry . Take me on board . Take me , even if you strike me dead . But in the name of all mercies do not fade away and leave me in this horrible land . ”

46245	46261	46243	46243	Reepicheep	89	“ and tell us what the danger is . We are not used to flying . ”
46280	46288	46289	46289	he	261	“ Nevertheless you will fly from here , ”

46368	46421	46363	46363	his	438	“ That is the sort of talk that brought me here , and I ’d better have been drowned or never born . Do you hear what I say ? This is where dreams — dreams , do you understand , come to life , come real . Not daydreams : dreams . ”
46543	46550	46551	46551	he	89	“ Your Majesty , your Majesty , ”
46554	46576	46551	46551	he	89	“ are you going to tolerate this mutiny , this poltroonery ? This is a panic , this is a rout . ”

46586	46618	46584	46584	Caspian	85	“ Pull for all our lives . Is her head right , Drinian ? You can say what you like , Reepicheep . There are some things no man can face . ”
46619	46634	46636	46636	Reepicheep	89	“ It is , then , my good fortune not to be a man , ”
46858	46882	46883	46883	Eustace	73	“ Do you hear a noise like . . . like a huge pair of scissors opening and shutting .. . over there ? ”
46887	46890	46892	46892	Rynelf	86	“ Hush ! ”
46894	46907	46892	46892	Rynelf	86	“ I can hear them crawling up the sides of the ship . ”
46908	46919	46921	46921	Caspian	85	“ It ’s just going to settle on the mast , ”
46923	46926	46928	46929	a sailor	1405	“ Ugh ! ”
46931	46943	46928	46929	a sailor	1405	“ There are the gongs beginning . I knew they would . ”

46999	47005	47007	47007	Drinian	98	“ Five minutes , perhaps , ”
47009	47012	47007	47007	Drinian	98	“ Why ? ”
47013	47027	46971	46971	he	85	“ Because we ’ve been more than that already trying to get out . ”
47056	47068	47070	47071	the rowers	319	“ We shall never get out , never get ’ out , ”
47073	47095	47070	47071	the rowers	319	“ He ’s steering us wrong . We ’re going round and round in circles . We shall never get out . ”
47122	47127	47128	47128	he	1408	“ Never get out ! ”
47131	47173	47128	47128	he	1408	“ That ’s it . Of course . We shall never get out . What a fool I was to have thought they would let me go as easily as that . No , no , we shall never get out . ”
47188	47206	47176	47176	her	80	“ Aslan , Aslan , if ever you loved us at all , send us help now . ”
47231	47243	47244	47244	she	80	“ After all , nothing has really happened to us yet , ”
47247	47250	47252	47252	Rynelf	86	“ Look ! ”
47489	47495	47505	47505	Aslan	91	“ Courage , dear heart , ”

47722	47726	47727	47727	he	1423	“ Thank you , ”
47732	47778	47727	47727	he	1423	“ You have saved me from . . . but I wo n’t talk of that . And now let me know who you are . I am a Telmarine of Narnia , and when I was worth anything men called me the Lord Rhoop . ”
47779	47783	47785	47785	Caspian	85	“ And I , ”
47787	47811	47785	47785	Caspian	85	“ am Caspian , King of Narnia , and I sail to find you and your companions who were my father ’s friends . ”
47825	47828	47829	47829	he	85	“ Sire , ”
47832	47852	47829	47829	he	85	“ you are the man in all the world I most wished to see . Grant me a boon . ”
47853	47858	47860	47860	Caspian	85	“ What is it ? ”
47862	47870	47871	47871	he	85	“ Never to bring me back there , ”
47905	47908	47910	47911	Lord Rhoop	105	“ Why ! ”
47913	47919	47910	47911	Lord Rhoop	105	“ You have destroyed it ! ”
47920	47929	47931	47931	Lucy	80	“ I do n’t think it was us , ”
47933	47936	47938	47938	Drinian	98	“ Sire , ”
47940	47975	47938	47938	Drinian	98	“ this wind is fair for the southeast . Shall I have our poor fellows up and set sail ? And after that , every man who can be spared , to his hammock . ”
47976	47979	47981	47981	Caspian	85	“ Yes , ”
47983	48006	47981	47981	Caspian	85	“ and let there be grog all round . Heigh - ho , I feel I could sleep the clock round myself . ”
48298	48306	48296	48296	Lucy	80	“ a dim , purple kind of smell ”
48323	48330	48320	48320	Caspian	85	“ I know what you mean . ”
48594	48601	48591	48591	Drinian	98	“ Look ! What ’s that ? ”
48606	48612	48614	48614	Caspian	85	“ Are they great trees ? ”
48616	48622	48624	48624	Eustace	73	“ Towers , l think , ”
48626	48632	48634	48634	Edmund	79	“ It might be giants , ”
48640	48654	48659	48659	his	89	“ The way to find out is to go right iv among them , ”
48669	48677	48679	48679	Lucy	80	“ I think it ’s a ruin , ”
48886	48890	48892	48892	Lucy	80	“ I say ! ”
48904	48911	48913	48913	Eustace	73	“ But where are the guests ? ”
48915	48923	48925	48925	Rhince	108	“ We can provide that , Sir , ”
48927	48930	48932	48932	Edmund	79	“ Look ! ”
48984	48989	48991	48991	Lucy	80	“ What are those ? ”
48996	49007	48991	48991	Lucy	80	“ It looks like three beavers sitting on the table . ”
49008	49016	49018	49018	Edmund	79	“ Or a huge bird ’s nest , ”
49020	49030	49032	49032	Caspian	85	“ It looks more like a haystack to me , ”
49098	49107	49076	49076	He	89	“ These will not fight , I think . ”
49232	49235	49237	49237	Caspian	85	“ Dead ? ”
49239	49246	49262	49262	his	89	“ I think not , Sire , ”
49266	49276	49262	49262	his	89	“ This one is warm and his pulse beats . ”
49277	49286	49288	49288	Drinian	98	“ This one , too , and this , ”
49290	49298	49300	49300	Eustace	73	“ Why , they ’re only asleep , ”
49302	49312	49314	49314	Edmund	79	“ It ’s been a long sleep , though , ”
49316	49325	49314	49314	Edmund	79	“ to let their hair grow like this . ”
49326	49334	49336	49336	Lucy	80	“ It must be an enchanted sleep , ”
49338	49369	49336	49336	Lucy	80	“ I felt the moment we landed on this island that it was full of magic . Oh ! do you think we have perhaps come here to break it ? ”
49370	49375	49377	49377	Caspian	85	“ We can try , ”
49409	49422	49402	49403	the man	438	“ I ’ll go eastward no more . Out oars for Narnia . ”
49471	49495	49501	49502	the third	1471	“ Were n’t born to live like animals . Get to the east while you ’ve a chance — lands behind the sun , ”
49506	49511	49501	49502	the third	1471	“ Mustard , please , ”
49516	49524	49526	49526	Drinian	98	“ Out oars for Narnia , eh ? ”
49528	49531	49533	49533	Caspian	85	“ Yes , ”
49535	49584	49533	49533	Caspian	85	“ you are right , Drinian . I think our quest is at an end . Let ’s look at their rings . Yes , these are their devices . This is the Lord Revilian . This is the Lord Argoz : and this , the Lord Mavramorn . ”
49585	49593	49595	49595	Lucy	80	“ But we ca n’t wake them , ”
49597	49604	49595	49595	Lucy	80	“ What are we to do ? ”
49605	49613	49615	49615	Rhince	108	“ Begging your Majesties ’ pardons all , ”
49617	49640	49615	49615	Rhince	108	“ but why not fall to while you ’re discussing it ? We do n’t see a dinner like this every day . ”
49641	49647	49649	49649	Caspian	85	“ Not for your life ! ”
49651	49660	49662	49665	several of the sailors	1356	“ That ’s right , that ’s right , ”
49667	49684	49727	49727	Drinian	98	“ Too much magic about here . The sooner we ’re back on board the better . ”
49685	49690	49692	49692	Reepicheep	89	“ Depend upon it , ”
49694	49713	49692	49692	Reepicheep	89	“ it was from eating this food that these three lords came by a seven years ’ sleep . ”
49714	49725	49727	49727	Drinian	98	“ I would n’t touch it to save my life , ”
49729	49737	49739	49739	Rynelf	86	“ The light ’s going uncommon quick , ”
49741	49750	49752	49753	the men	2173	“ Back to ship , back to ship , ”
49755	49760	49762	49762	Edmund	79	“ I really think , ”
49764	49809	49762	49762	Edmund	79	“ they ’re right . We can decide what to do with the three sleepers tomorrow . We dare n’t eat the food and there ’s no point in staying here for the night . The whole place smells of magic — and danger . ”
49810	49820	49822	49822	Reepicheep	89	“ I am entirely of King Edmund ’s opinion , ”
49824	49847	49822	49822	Reepicheep	89	“ as far as concerns the ship ’s company in general . But I myself will sit at this table till sunrise . ”
49848	49853	49855	49855	Eustace	73	“ Why on earth ? ”
49857	49860	49862	49863	the Mouse	89	“ Because , ”
49865	49901	49862	49863	the Mouse	89	“ this is a very great adventure , and no danger seems to me so great as that of knowing when I get back to Narnia that I left a mystery behind me through fear . ”
49902	49911	49913	49913	Edmund	79	“ I ’ll stay with you , Reep , ”
49915	49920	49922	49922	Caspian	85	“ And I too , ”
49924	49928	49930	49930	Lucy	80	“ And me , ”
49972	49978	49980	49980	Drinian	98	“ I beseech your Majesty — ”
49982	49988	49990	49990	Caspian	85	“ No , my Lord , ”
49992	50014	49990	49990	Caspian	85	“ Your place is with the ship , and you have had a day ’s work while we five have idled . ”
50196	50201	50187	50187	they	1478	“ What about here ? ”
50203	50211	50187	50187	they	1478	“ Or perhaps a bit further on , ”
50214	50221	50187	50187	they	1478	“ Why not on this side ? ”
50704	50716	50718	50719	the girl	1222	“ Travellers who have come from far to Aslan ’s table , ”
50721	50730	50718	50719	the girl	1222	“ Why do you not eat and drink ? ”
50731	50734	50736	50736	Caspian	85	“ Madam , ”
50738	50755	50736	50736	Caspian	85	“ we feared the food because we thought it had cast our friends into an enchanted sleep .
50756	50763	50764	50764	she	1222	“ They have never tasted it , ”
50767	50770	50772	50772	Lucy	80	“ Please , ”
50774	50780	50772	50772	Lucy	80	“ what happened to them ? ”
50781	50786	50788	50789	the girl	1222	“ Seven years ago , ”
50791	51020	50788	50789	the girl	1222	“ they came here in a ship whose sails were rags and timbers ready to fall apart . There were a few others with them , sailors , and when they came to this table one said , ` Here is the good place . Let us set sail and reef sail and row no longer but sit down and end our days in peace ! ’ And the second said , ` No , let us re - embark and sail for Narnia and the west ; it may be that Miraz is dead . ’ But the third , who was a very masterful man , leaped up and said , ` No , by heaven . We are men and Telmarines , not brutes . What should we do but seek adventure after adventure ? We have not long to live in any event . Let us spend what is left in seeking the unpeopled world behind the sunrise . ’ And as they quarrelled he caught up the Knife of Stone which lies there on the table and would have fought with his comrades . But it is a thing not right for him to touch . And as his fingers closed upon the hilt , deep sleep fell upon all the three . And till the enchantment is undone they will never wake . ”
51021	51029	51031	51031	Eustace	73	“ What is this Knife of Stone ? ”
51033	51041	51043	51044	the girl	1222	“ Do none of you know it ? ”
51046	51052	51054	51054	Lucy	80	“ I — I think , ”
51056	51087	51054	51054	Lucy	80	“ I ’ve seen something like it before . It was a knife like it that the White Witch used when she killed Aslan at the Stone Table long ago . ”
51088	51094	51096	51097	the girl	1222	“ It was the same , ”
51099	51115	51096	51097	the girl	1222	“ and it was brought here to be kept in honour while the world lasts . ”
51135	51139	51140	51140	he	1501	“ Look here , ”
51143	51233	51140	51140	he	1501	“ I hope I ’m not a coward — about eating this food , I mean — and I ’m sure I do n’t mean to be rude . But we have had a lot of queer adventures on this voyage of ours and things are n’t always what they seem . When I look in your face I ca n’t help believing all you say : but then that ’s just what might happen with a witch too . How are we to know you ’re a friend ? ”
51234	51240	51242	51243	the girl	1222	“ You ca n’t know , ”
51245	51253	51242	51243	the girl	1222	“ You can only believe or not . ”
51266	51269	51270	51270	he	89	“ Sire , ”
51275	51304	51270	51270	he	89	“ of your courtesy fill my cup with wine from that flagon : it is too big for me to lift . I will drink to the lady . ”
51328	51335	51308	51314	the Mouse , standing on the table	1503	“ Lady , I pledge you . ”
51383	51392	51394	51394	Lucy	80	“ Why is it called Aslan ’s table ? ”
51397	51406	51408	51409	the girl	1222	“ It is set here by his bidding , ”
51411	51443	51408	51409	the girl	1222	“ for those who come so far . Some call this island the World ’s End , for though you can sail further , this is the beginning of the end . ”
51444	51452	51454	51456	the practical Eustace	73	“ But how does the food keep ? ”
51459	51469	51471	51472	the girl	1222	“ It is eaten , and renewed every day , ”
51474	51480	51471	51472	the girl	1222	“ This you will see . ”
51481	51492	51494	51494	Caspian	85	“ And what are we to do about the Sleepers ? ”
51496	51505	51509	51509	he	85	“ In the world from which my friends come ”
51517	51558	51509	51509	he	85	“ they have a story of a prince or a king coming to a castle where all the people lay in an enchanted sleep . In that story he could not dissolve the enchantment until he had kissed the Princess . ”
51559	51563	51565	51566	the girl	1222	“ But here , ”
51568	51587	51565	51566	the girl	1222	“ it is different . Here he can not kiss the Princess till he has dissolved the enchantment . ”
51588	51591	51593	51593	Caspian	85	“ Then , ”
51595	51613	51593	51593	Caspian	85	“ in the name of Aslan , show me how to set about that work at once . ”
51614	51622	51624	51625	the girl	1222	“ My father will teach you that , ”
51627	51631	51633	51633	everyone	251	“ Your father ! ”
51635	51643	51633	51633	everyone	251	“ Who is he ? And where ? ”
51644	51647	51649	51650	the girl	1222	“ Look , ”
52059	52081	52055	52055	Edmu	174	“ Though lots of things happened on that trip which sound more exciting , that moment was really the most exciting . ”
52462	52465	52467	52467	Caspian	85	“ Sir , ”
52469	52487	52467	52467	Caspian	85	“ will you tell us how to undo the enchantment which holds these three Narnian Lords asleep . ”
52488	52499	52501	52503	the Old Man	175	“ I will gladly tell you that , my son , ”
52505	52544	52501	52503	the Old Man	175	“ To break this enchantment you must sail to the World ’s End , or as near as you can come to it , and you must come back having left at least one of your company behind . ”
52545	52554	52556	52556	Reepicheep	89	“ And what must happen to that one ? ”
52558	52574	52501	52503	the Old Man	175	“ He must go on into the utter east and never return into the world . ”
52575	52583	52585	52585	Reepicheep	89	“ That is my heart ’s desire , ”
52587	52600	52602	52602	Caspian	85	“ And are we near the World ’s End now , Sir ? ”
52604	52619	52602	52602	Caspian	85	“ Have you any knowledge of the seas and lands further east than this ? ”
52620	52627	52629	52631	the Old Man	1264	“ I saw them long ago , ”
52633	52655	52629	52631	the Old Man	1264	“ but it was from a great height . I can not tell you such things as sailor need to know . ”
52656	52667	52668	52668	Eustace	73	“ Do you mean you were flying in the air ? ”
52672	52685	52687	52689	the Old Man	1264	“ I was a long way above the air , my son , ”
52691	52742	52687	52689	the Old Man	1264	“ I am Ramandu . But I see that you stare at on another and have not heard this name . And no wonder , for the days when I was a star had ceased long before any of you knew this world , and all the constellations have changed . ”
52743	52746	52748	52748	Edmund	79	“ Golly , ”
52753	52760	52748	52748	Edmund	79	“ He ’s a retired star . ”
52761	52770	52772	52772	Lucy	80	“ Are n’t you a star any longer ? ”
52774	52785	52787	52787	Ramandu	176	“ I am a star at rest , my daughter , ”
52788	52895	52687	52689	the Old Man	1264	“ When I set for the last time , decrepit and old beyond all that you can reckon , I was carried to this island . I am not so old now as I was then . Every morning a bird brings me a fire - berry from the valleys in the Sun , and each fire - berry takes away a little of my age . And when I have become as young as the child that was born yesterday , then I shall take my rising again ( for we are at earth ’s eastern rim ) and once more tread the great dance . ”
52896	52901	52903	52903	Eustace	73	“ In our world , ”
52905	52916	52903	52903	Eustace	73	“ a star is a huge ball of flaming gas . ”
52917	52961	52687	52689	the Old Man	1264	“ Even in your world , my son , that is not what a star is but only what it is made of . And in this world you ave already met a star , for I think you have been with Coriakin . ”
52962	52971	52973	52973	Lucy	80	“ Is he a retired star , too ? ”
52975	52983	52985	52985	Ramandu	176	“ Well , not quite the same , ”
52987	53031	52985	52985	Ramandu	176	“ It was not quite as a rest than he was set to govern the Duffers . You might call it a punishment . He might have shone for thousands of years more in the southern winter sky if all had gone well . ”
53032	53040	53042	53042	Caspian	85	“ What did he do , Sir ? ”
53044	53048	53050	53050	Ramandu	176	“ My son , ”
53052	53116	53050	53050	Ramandu	176	“ it is not for you , a son of Adam , to know what faults a star can commit . But come , we waste time in such talk . Are you yet resolved ? Will you sail further east and come again , leaving one to return no more , and so break the enchantment ? Or will you sail westward ? ”
53117	53122	53124	53124	Reepicheep	89	“ Surely , Sire , ”
53126	53150	53124	53124	Reepicheep	89	“ there is no question about that ? It is very plainly part of our quest to rescue these three lords from enchantment . ”
53151	53159	53161	53161	Caspian	85	“ I think the same , Reepicheep , ”
53163	53303	53161	53161	Caspian	85	“ And even if it were not so , it would break my heart not to go as near the World ’s End as the Dawn Treader will take us . But I am thinking of the crew . They signed on to seek the seven lords , not to reach the rim of the Earth . If we sail east from here we sail to find the edge , the utter east . And not one knows how far it is . They ’re brave fellows , but I set signs that some of them are weary of the voyage and long to have our prow pointing to Narnia again . I do n’t think should take them further without their knowledge an consent . And then there ’s the poor Lord Rhoop . He ’s broken man . ”
53304	53308	53310	53311	the star	1546	“ My son , ”
53313	53368	53310	53311	the star	1546	“ it would be no use , even though you wished it , to sail for the World ’s End with men unwilling or men deceived . That is not how great unenchantments are achieved . They must know where they go and why . But who is this broken man you speak of ? ”
53377	53387	53389	53389	Ramandu	176	“ I can give him what he needs most , ”
53391	53431	53389	53389	Ramandu	176	“ I this island there is sleep without stint or measure , and sleep in which no faintest footfall of a dream was ever heard . Let him sit beside these other three and drink oblivion till you return . ”
53432	53443	53445	53445	Lucy	80	“ Oh , do let ’s do that , Caspian , ”
53447	53458	53445	53445	Lucy	80	“ I ’m sure its just what he would love . ”
53527	53531	53533	53534	the King	305	“ My lord , ”
53538	53581	53533	53534	the King	305	“ pray send two men back to the Dawn Treader with a message to the Lord Rhoop . Tell him that the last of his old shipmates are here asleep — a sleep without dreams — and that he can share it . ”
53628	53720	53617	53619	the Master Bowman	142	“ What some of us have been wanting to ask for a long time , your Majesty , is how we ’re ever to get home when we do turn , whether we turn here or somewhere else . It ’s been west and north - west winds all the way , barring an occasional calm . And if that does n’t change , I ’d like to know what hopes we have of seeing Narnia again . There ’s not much chance of supplies lasting while we row all that way .
53721	53728	53730	53730	Drinian	98	“ That ’s landsman ’s talk , ”
53732	53777	53730	53730	Drinian	98	“ There ’s always a prevailing west wind in these seas all through the late summer , and it always changes after the New Year . We ’ll have plenty of wind for sailing westward ; more than we shall like from all accounts . ”
53778	53785	53787	53789	an old sailor	1556	“ That ’s true , Master , ”
53797	53842	53787	53789	an old sailor	1556	“ You get some ugly weather rolling up from the east in January and February . And by your leave , Sire , if I was in command of this ship I ’d say to winter here and begin the voyage home in March . ”
53843	53854	53856	53856	Eustace	73	“ What ’d you eat while you were wintering here ? ”
53858	53862	53864	53864	Ramandu	176	“ This table , ”
53866	53880	53864	53864	Ramandu	176	“ will be filled with a king ’s feast every day at sunset . ”
53881	53887	53889	53890	several sailors	1354	“ Now you ’re talking ! ”
53892	53901	53903	53903	Rynelf	86	“ Your Majesties and gentlemen and ladies all , ”
53905	54097	53903	53903	Rynelf	86	“ there ’s just one thing I want to say . There ’s not one of us chaps as was pressed on this journey . We ’re volunteers . And there ’s some here chat are looking very hard at that table and thinking about king ’s feasts who were talking very loud about adventures on the day we sailed from Cair Paravel , and swearing they would n’t come home till we ’d found the end of the world . And there were some standing on the quay who would have given all they had to come with us . It was thought a finer thing then to have a cabin - boy ’s berth on the Dawn Treader than to wear a knight ’s belt . I do n’t know if you get the hang of what I ’m saying . But what I mean is that I think chaps who set out like us will look as silly as — as those Dufflepuds — if we come home and say we got to the beginning of the world ’s end and had n’t the heart to go further . ”
54115	54125	54127	54127	Edmund	79	“ This is n’t going to be much fun , ”
54131	54144	54127	54127	Edmund	79	“ What are we to do if half those fellows hang back ? ”
54145	54148	54149	54149	Caspian	85	“ Wait , ”
54153	54162	54149	54149	Caspian	85	“ I ’ve still a card to play . ”
54163	54174	54176	54176	Lucy	80	“ Are n’t you going to say anything , Reep ? ”
54178	54188	54190	54190	Reepicheep	89	“ No . Why should your Majesty expect it ? ”
54199	54294	54190	54190	Reepicheep	89	“ My owns plans are made . While I can , I sail east in the Dawn Treader . When she fails me , I paddle east in my coracle . When she sinks , I shall swim east with my four paws . And when I can swim no longer , if I have not reached Aslan ’s country , or shot over the edge of the world in some vast cataract , I shall sink with my nose to the sunrise and Peepiceek will be head of the talking mice in Narnia . ”
54295	54300	54302	54303	a sailor	1405	“ Hear , hear , ”
54305	54325	54326	54326	He	1405	“ I ’ll say the same , barring the bit about the coracle , which would n’t bear me . ”
54333	54345	54326	54326	He	1405	“ I ’m not going to be outdone by a mouse . ”
54355	54358	54359	54359	he	85	“ Friends , ”
54362	54531	54359	54359	he	85	“ I think you have not quite understood our purpose . You talk as if we had come to you with our hat in our hand , begging for shipmates . It is n’t like that at all . We and our royal brother and sister and their kinsman and Sir Reepicheep , the good knight , and the Lord Drinian have an errand to the world ’s edge . It is our pleasure to choose from among such of you as are willing those whom we deem worthy of so high an enterprise . We have not said that any can come for the asking . That is why we shall now command the Lord Drinian and Master Rhince to consider carefully what men among you are the hardest in battle , the most skilled seamen , the purest in blood , the most loyal to our person , and the cleanest of life and manners ; and to give their names to us in a schedule . ”
54542	54547	54548	54548	he	1564	“ Aslan ’s mane ! ”
54551	54646	54548	54548	he	1564	“ Do you think that the privilege of seeing the last things is to be bought for a song ? Why , every man that comes with us shall bequeath the title of Dawn Treader to all his descendants , and when we land at Cair Paravel on the homeward voyage he shall have either gold or land enough to make him rich all his life . Now — scatter over the island , all of you . In half an hour ’s time I shall receive the names that Lord Drinian brings me . ”
54683	54691	54693	54693	Caspian	85	“ And now for the Lord Rhoop , ”
54854	54858	54860	54860	Lucy	80	“ Poor Rhoop , ”
54862	54874	54860	54860	Lucy	80	“ I am glad . He must have had terrible times . ”
54875	54885	54887	54887	Eustace	73	“ Do n’t let ’s even think of it , ”
54988	54991	54984	54985	several people	1571	“ sucking up ”
55377	55380	55382	55382	Caspian	85	“ Lady , ”
55384	55399	55382	55382	Caspian	85	“ I hope to speak with you again when I have broken the enchantments . ”
55566	55574	55576	55576	Lucy	80	“ How beautifully clear the water is ! ”
55874	55885	55887	55887	Lucy	80	“ It ’s our shadow!—the shadow of the Dawn Treader , ”
55889	55944	55887	55887	Lucy	80	“ Our shadow running along on the bottom of the sea . That time when it got bigger it went over a hill . But in that case the water must be clearer than I thought ! Good gracious , I must he seeing the bottom of the sea ; fathoms and fathoms down . ”
56070	56078	56080	56080	Lucy	80	“ Just like trees in a wind , ”
56082	56098	56080	56080	Lucy	80	“ And do believe that ’s what they are . It ’s a submarine forest . ”
56116	56123	56125	56125	Lucy	80	“ If I was down there , ”
56127	56226	56125	56125	Lucy	80	“ that streak would be just like a road through the wood . And that place where it joins the other Would be a crossroads . Oh , I do wish I was . Hallo ! the forest is coming to an end . And I do believe the streak really was a road ! I can still see it going on across the open sand . It ’s a different colour . And it ’s marked out with something at the edges — dotted lines . Perhaps they are stones . And now it ’s getting wider . ”
56542	56552	56554	56554	Lucy	80	“ Why!—it ’s a city or a huge castle , ”
56557	56573	56554	56554	Lucy	80	“ But I wonder why they ’ve built it on top of a high mountain ? ”
56697	56701	56693	56693	we	1628	“ in the shallows ”
56900	56907	56909	56909	Lucy	80	“ Oh , bother these fish ! ”
57087	57094	57096	57096	Lucy	80	“ Why , I do declare , ”
57098	57172	57096	57096	Lucy	80	“ it ’s a hunting party . Or more like a hawking party . Yes , that ’s it . They ride out with these little fierce fish on their wrists just as we used to ride out with falcons on our wrists when we were Kings and Queens at Cair Paravel long ago . And then they fly them — or I suppose I should say swim them — at the others . ”
57376	57385	57387	57391	a voice close beside her	1663	“ What are you staring at , Lu ? ”
57421	57423	57435	57435	Drinian	98	“ dead ”
57442	57445	57446	57446	she	80	“ Look , ”
57464	57497	57457	57457	Drinian	98	“ Turn round at once , your Majesties — that ’s right , with our backs to the sea . And do n’t look as if we were talking about anything important . ”
57498	57506	57508	57508	Lucy	80	“ Why , what ’s the matter ? ”
57513	57526	57528	57528	Drinian	98	“ It ’ll never do for the sailors to see all that , ”
57530	57581	57528	57528	Drinian	98	“ We ’ll have men falling in love with a seawoman , or falling in love with the under - sea country itself , and jumping overboard . I ’ve heard of that kind of thing happening before in strange seas . It ’s always unlucky to see these people . ”
57582	57590	57592	57592	Lucy	80	“ But we used to know them , ”
57594	57621	57592	57592	Lucy	80	“ In the old days at Cair Paravel when my brother Peter was High King . They came to the surface and sang at our coronation . ”
57622	57635	57637	57637	Edmund	79	“ I think that must have been a different kind , Lu , ”
57639	57683	57637	57637	Edmund	79	“ They could live in the air as well as under water . I rather think these ca n’t . By the look of them they ’d have surfaced and started attacking us long ago if they could . They seem very fierce . ”
57684	57689	57691	57691	Drinian	98	“ At any rate , ”
57718	57722	57707	57715	The other was a voice from the fighting top	1664	“ Man overboard ! ”
57799	57804	57806	57806	Drinian	98	“ Drat that mouse ! ”
57808	57867	57806	57806	Drinian	98	“ It ’s more trouble than all the rest of the ship ’s company put together . If there is any scrape to be got into , in it will get ! It ought to be put in irons — keel - hauled — marooned — have its whiskers cut off . Can anyone see the little blighter ? ”
58027	58043	58045	58045	Drinian	98	“ He ’ll blurt the whole thing out if we do n’t shut him up , ”
58066	58089	58050	58050	he	98	“ All right , all right . Back to your places . I hope I can heave a mouse up without help . ”
58117	58126	58109	58109	Drinian	98	“ Do n’t tell . Not a word . ”
58150	58153	58154	58154	he	89	“ Sweet ! ”
58157	58162	58154	58154	he	89	“ Sweet , sweet ! ”
58163	58170	58172	58172	Drinian	98	“ What are you talking about ? ”
58175	58188	58172	58172	Drinian	98	“ And you need n’t shake yourself all over me , either . ”
58189	58198	58200	58201	the Mouse	89	“ I tell you the water ’s sweet , ”
58203	58213	58200	58201	the Mouse	89	“ Sweet , fresh . It is n’t salt . ”
58237	58255	58229	58229	Reepicheep	89	“ Where the waves grow sweet , Doubt not , Reepicheep , There is the utter East . ”
58262	58271	58273	58273	Drinian	98	“ Let me have a bucket , Rynelf , ”
58297	58308	58310	58310	Drinian	98	“ Perhaps your Majesty would like to taste it first , ”
58357	58360	58361	58361	he	305	“ Yes , ”
58364	58408	58361	58361	he	305	“ it is sweet . That ’s real water , that . I ’m not sure that it is n’t going to kill me . But it is the death I would have chosen — if I ’d known about it till now . ”
58409	58415	58417	58417	Edmund	79	“ What do you mean ? ”
58419	58431	58433	58433	Caspian	85	“ It — it ’s like light more than anything else , ”
58435	58442	58444	58444	Reepicheep	89	“ That is what it is , ”
58446	58462	58444	58444	Reepicheep	89	“ Drinkable light . We must be very near the end of the world now . ”
58483	58494	58495	58495	she	80	“ It ’s the loveliest thing I have ever tasted , ”
58503	58520	58495	58495	she	80	“ But oh — it ’s strong . We sha n’t need to eat anything now . ”
58737	58782	58734	58734	Drinian	98	“ I ca n’t understand this . There is not a breath of wind . The sail hangs dead . The sea is as flat as a pond . And yet we drive on as fast as if there were a gale behind us . ”
58783	58792	58794	58794	Caspian	85	“ I ’ve been thinking that , too , ”
58796	58806	58794	58794	Caspian	85	“ We must be caught in some strong current . ”
58807	58810	58812	58812	Edmund	79	“ H’m , ”
58814	58834	58812	58812	Edmund	79	“ That ’s not so nice if the World really has an edge and we ’re getting near it . ”
58835	58839	58841	58841	Caspian	85	“ You mean , ”
58843	58855	58841	58841	Caspian	85	“ that we might be just well , poured over it ? ”
58856	58861	58866	58866	his	89	“ Yes , yes , ”
58870	58933	58866	58866	his	89	“ That ’s how I ’ve always imagined it — the World like a great round table and the waters of all the oceans endlessly pouring over the edge . The ship will tip up stand on her head — for one moment we shall see over the edge — and then , down , down , the rush , the speed — ”
58934	58951	58953	58953	Drinian	98	“ And what do you think will be waiting for us at the bottom , eh ? ”
58955	58961	58963	58964	the Mouse	89	“ Aslan ’s country perhaps , ”
58970	59013	58963	58964	the Mouse	89	“ Or perhaps there is n’t any bottom . Perhaps it goes down for ever and ever . But whatever it is , wo n’t it be worth anything just to have looked for one moment beyond the edge of the world . ”
59014	59020	59022	59022	Eustace	73	“ But look — here , ”
59024	59048	59022	59022	Eustace	73	“ this is all rot . The world ’s round — I mean , round like a ball , not like a table . ”
59049	59054	59056	59056	Edmund	79	“ Our world is , ”
59058	59063	59056	59056	Edmund	79	“ But is this ? ”
59064	59071	59073	59073	Caspian	85	“ Do you mean to say , ”
59075	59207	59073	59073	Caspian	85	“ that you three come from a round world ( round like a ball ) and you ’ve never told me ! It ’s really too bad of you . Because we have fairy - tales in which there are round worlds and I always loved them . I never believed there were any real ones . But I ’ve always wished there were and I ’ve always longed to live in one . Oh , I ’d give anything — I wonder why you can get into our world and we never get into yours ? If only I had the chance ! It must be exciting to live on a thing like a ball . Have you ever been to the parts where people walk about upside - down ? ”
59213	59221	59222	59222	he	79	“ And it is n’t like that , ”
59225	59239	59222	59222	he	79	“ There ’s nothing particularly exciting about a round world when you ’re there .
59436	59444	59446	59446	Lucy	80	“ Just like a flock of sheep , ”
59820	59824	59826	59826	Caspian	85	“ My Lord , ”
59832	59839	59826	59826	Caspian	85	“ what do you see ahead ? ”
59840	59843	59845	59845	Drinian	98	“ Sire , ”
59847	59869	59845	59845	Drinian	98	“ I see whiteness . All along the horizon from north to south , as far as my eyes can reach . ”
59870	59878	59880	59880	Caspian	85	“ That is what I see too , ”
59882	59892	59880	59880	Caspian	85	“ and I can not imagine what it is . ”
59893	59904	59906	59906	Drinian	98	“ If we were in higher latitudes , your Majesty , ”
59908	59964	59906	59906	Drinian	98	“ I would say it was ice . But it ca n’t be that ; not here . All the same , we ’d better get men to the oars and hold the ship back against the current . Whatever the stuff is , we do n’t want to crash into it at this speed ! ”
60290	60296	60298	60298	Rynelf	86	“ Lilies , your Majesty ! ”
60306	60312	60314	60314	Caspian	85	“ What did you say ? ”
60316	60323	60325	60325	Rynelf	86	“ Blooming lilies , your Majesty , ”
60327	60340	60325	60325	Rynelf	86	“ Same as in a pool or in a garden at home . ”
60341	60344	60346	60346	Lucy	80	“ Look ! ”
60372	60380	60382	60382	Drinian	98	“ What ’s the depth , Rynelf ? ”
60384	60393	60395	60395	Rynelf	86	“ That ’s the funny thing , Captain , ”
60397	60410	60395	60395	Rynelf	86	“ It ’s still deep . Three and a half fathoms clear . ”
60411	60425	60427	60427	Eustace	73	“ They ca n’t be real lilies — not what we call lilies , ”
60706	60728	60698	60698	She	80	“ I feel that I ca n’t stand much more of this , yet I do n’t want it to stop . ”
60811	60816	60818	60818	Caspian	85	“ Lower the boat , ”
60820	60834	60818	60818	Caspian	85	“ and then call the men aft . I must speak to them . ”
60835	60843	60845	60845	Eustace	73	“ What ’s he going to do ? ”
60849	60859	60845	60845	Eustace	73	“ There ’s a queer look in his eyes . ”
60860	60870	60872	60872	Edmund	79	“ I think we probably all look the same , ”
60901	60904	60906	60906	Caspian	85	“ Friends , ”
60908	61058	60906	60906	Caspian	85	“ we have now fulfilled the quest on which you embarked . The seven lords are all accounted for and as Sir Reepicheep has sworn never to return , when you reach Ramandu ’s Land you will doubtless find the Lords Revilian and Argoz and Mavramorn awake . To you , my Lord Drinian , I entrust this ship , bidding you sail to Narnia with all the speed you may , and above all not to land on the Island of Deathwater . And instruct my regent , the Dwarf Trumpkin , to give to all these , my shipmates , the rewards I promised them . They have been earned well . And if I come not again it is my will that the Regent , and Master Cornelius , and Trufflehunter the Badger , and the Lord Drinian choose a King of Narnia with the consent — ”
61059	61064	61066	61066	Drinian	98	“ But , Sire , ”
61068	61073	61066	61066	Drinian	98	“ are you abdicating ? ”
61074	61087	61089	61089	Caspian	85	“ I am going with Reepicheep to see the World ’s End , ”
61101	61108	61110	61110	Caspian	85	“ We will take the boat , ”
61112	61139	61110	61110	Caspian	85	“ You will have no need of it in these gentle seas and you must build a new one in Ramandu ’s island . And now — ”
61140	61143	61145	61145	Edmund	79	“ Caspian , ”
61150	61157	61145	61145	Edmund	79	“ you ca n’t do this . ”
61158	61162	61164	61164	Reepicheep	180	“ Most certainly , ”
61166	61172	61164	61164	Reepicheep	180	“ his Majesty can not . ”
61173	61177	61179	61179	Drinian	98	“ No indeed , ”
61181	61185	61187	61187	Caspian	85	“ Ca n’t ? ”
61200	61207	61209	61209	Rynelf	86	“ Begging your Majesty ’s pardon , ”
61215	61230	61209	61209	Rynelf	86	“ but if one of us did the same it would be called deserting . ”
61231	61243	61245	61245	Caspian	85	“ You presume too much on your long service , Rynelf , ”
61247	61257	61259	61259	Drinian	98	“ No , Sire ! He ’s perfectly right , ”
61261	61268	61270	61270	Caspian	85	“ By the Mane of Aslan , ”
61272	61287	61270	61270	Caspian	85	“ I had thought you were all my subjects here , not my schoolmasters . ”
61288	61293	61295	61295	Edmund	79	“ I ’m not , ”
61297	61307	61295	61295	Edmund	79	“ and I say you can not do this . ”
61308	61313	61315	61315	Caspian	85	“ Ca n’t again , ”
61317	61323	61315	61315	Caspian	85	“ What do you mean ? ”
61324	61336	61338	61338	Reepicheep	180	“ If it please your Majesty , we mean shall not , ”
61345	61421	61338	61338	Reepicheep	180	“ You are the King of Narnia . You break faith with all your subjects , and especially with Trumpkin , if you do not return . You shall not please yourself with adventures as if you were a private person . And if your Majesty will not hear reason it will be the truest loyalty of every man on board to follow me in disarming and binding you till you come to your senses . ”
61422	61426	61428	61428	Edmund	79	“ Quite right , ”
61430	61445	61428	61428	Edmund	79	“ Like they did with Ulysses when he wanted to go near the Sirens . ”
61460	61473	61457	61457	Lucy	80	“ And you ’ve almost promised Ramandu ’s daughter to go back . ”
61477	61486	61487	61487	he	85	“ Well , yes . There is that , ”
61506	61528	61490	61490	He	85	“ Well , have your way . The quest is ended . We all return . Get the boat up again . ”
61529	61532	61534	61534	Reepicheep	180	“ Sire , ”
61536	61550	61534	61534	Reepicheep	180	“ we do not all return . I , as I explained before — ”
61551	61554	61556	61556	Caspian	85	“ Silence ! ”
61558	61577	61556	61556	Caspian	85	“ I ’ve been lessoned but I ’ll not be baited . Will no one silence that Mouse ? ”
61578	61583	61585	61585	Reepicheep	89	“ Your Majesty promised , ”
61587	61599	61585	61585	Reepicheep	89	“ to be good lord to the Talking Beasts of Narnia . ”
61600	61606	61608	61608	Caspian	85	“ Talking beasts , yes , ”
61610	61621	61608	61608	Caspian	85	“ I said nothing about beasts that never stop talking . ”
61666	61672	61673	61673	he	85	“ It ’s no good , ”
61676	61833	61673	61673	he	85	“ I might as well have behaved decently for all the good I did with my temper and swagger . Aslan has spoken to me . No — I do n’t mean he was actually here . He would n’t fit into the cabin , for one thing . But that gold lion ’s head on the wall came to life and spoke to me . It was terrible his eyes . Not that he was at all rough with me — only a bit stern at first . But it was terrible all the same . And he said — he said — oh , I ca n’t bear it . The worst thing he could have said . You ’re to go on — Reep and Edmund , and Lucy , and Eustace ; and I ’m to go back . Alone . And at once . And what is the good of anything ? ”
61834	61839	61841	61841	Lucy	80	“ Caspian , dear , ”
61843	61860	61841	61841	Lucy	80	“ You knew we ’d have to go back to our own world sooner or later . ”
61861	61864	61866	61866	Caspian	85	“ Yes , ”
61871	61877	61866	61866	Caspian	85	“ but this is sooner . ”
61878	61892	61894	61894	Lucy	80	“ You ’ll feel better when you get back to Ramandu ’s Island , ”
62496	62503	62491	62491	Lucy	80	“ It would break your heart . ”
62504	62507	62509	62509	I	0	“ Why , ”
62511	62517	62509	62509	I	0	“ was it so sad : “
62518	62524	62526	62526	Lucy	80	“ Sad ! ! No , ”
62571	62574	62576	62576	Reepicheep	89	“ This , ”
62578	62586	62576	62576	Reepicheep	89	“ is where I go on alone . ”
62627	62635	62636	62636	he	89	“ I shall need it no more , ”
63118	63124	63126	63127	the Lamb	192	“ Come and have breakfast , ”
63186	63191	63193	63193	Lucy	80	“ Please , Lamb , ”
63195	63205	63193	63193	Lucy	80	“ is this the way to Aslan ’s country ? ”
63206	63211	63213	63214	the Lamb	1805	“ Not for you , ”
63216	63231	63213	63214	the Lamb	1805	“ For you the door into Aslan ’s country is from your own world . ”
63232	63235	63237	63237	Edmund	79	“ What ! ”
63239	63253	63237	63237	Edmund	79	“ Is there a way into Aslan ’s country from our world too ? ”
63254	63267	63269	63270	the Lamb	192	“ There is a way into my country from all the worlds , ”
63303	63308	63310	63310	Lucy	80	“ Oh , Aslan , ”
63312	63327	63310	63310	Lucy	80	“ Will you tell us how to get into your country from our world ? ”
63328	63338	63340	63340	Aslan	91	“ I shall be telling you all the time , ”
63342	63400	63340	63340	Aslan	91	“ But I will not tell you how long or short the way will be ; only that it lies across a river . But do not fear that , for I am the great Bridge Builder . And now come ; I will open the door in the sky and send you to your own land . ”
63401	63406	63408	63408	Lucy	80	“ Please , Aslan , ”
63410	63442	63408	63408	Lucy	80	“ Before we go , will you tell us when we can come back to Narnia again ? Please . And oh , do , do , do make it soon . ”
63443	63446	63448	63448	Aslan	91	“ Dearest , ”
63452	63464	63448	63448	Aslan	91	“ you and your brother will never come balk to Narnia . ”
63465	63471	63473	63473	Edmund	79	“ Oh , Aslan ! ! ”
63482	63490	63492	63492	Aslan	91	“ You are too old , children , ”
63494	63508	63492	63492	Aslan	91	“ and you must begin to come close to your own world now . ”
63509	63518	63520	63520	Lucy	80	“ It is n’t Narnia , you know , ”
63522	63544	63520	63520	Lucy	80	“ It ’s you . We sha n’t meet you there . And how can we live , never meeting you ? ”
63545	63555	63557	63557	Aslan	91	“ But you shall meet me , dear one , ”
63559	63568	63570	63570	Edmund	79	“ Are are you there too , Sir ? ”
63572	63576	63578	63578	Aslan	91	“ I am , ”
63580	63626	63578	63578	Aslan	91	“ But there I have another name . You must learn to know me by that name . This was the very reason why you were brought to Narnia , that by knowing me here for a little , you may know me better there . ”
63627	63638	63640	63640	Lucy	80	“ And is Eustace never to come back here either ? ”
63642	63645	63647	63647	Aslan	91	“ Child , ”
63649	63669	63647	63647	Aslan	91	“ do you really need to know that ? Come , I am opening the door in the sky . ”
63812	63822	63801	63801	everyone	251	“ You ’d never know him for the same boy ”
