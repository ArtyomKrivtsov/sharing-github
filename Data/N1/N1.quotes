360	367	369	369	Edmund	28	“ Trying to talk like Mother , ”
371	391	369	369	Edmund	28	“ And who are you to say when I ’m to go to bed ? Go to bed yourself . ”
392	402	404	404	Lucy	48	“ Had n’t we all better go to bed ? ”
406	421	404	404	Lucy	48	“ There ’s sure to be a row if we ’re heard talking here . ”
422	428	430	430	Peter	26	“ No there wo n’t , ”
432	487	430	430	Peter	26	“ I tell you this is the sort of house where no one ’s going to mind what we do . Anyway , they wo n’t hear us . It ’s about ten minutes ’ walk from here down to that dining - room , and any amount of stairs and passages in between . ”
488	494	496	496	Lucy	48	“ What ’s that noise ? ”
538	547	549	549	Edmund	28	“ It ’s only a bird , silly , ”
551	557	559	559	Peter	26	“ It ’s an owl , ”
561	629	559	559	Peter	26	“ This is going to be a wonderful place for birds . I shall go to bed now . I say , let ’s go and explore tomorrow . You might find anything in a place like this .

753	786	751	751	Susan	27	“ Ten to one it ’ll clear up in an hour or so . And in the meantime we ’re pretty well off . There ’s a wireless and lots of books . ”
787	792	794	794	Peter	26	“ Not for me , ”

1019	1023	1025	1025	Peter	26	“ Nothing there ! ”
1243	1252	1254	1254	Lucy	48	“ This must be a simply enormous wardrobe ! ”
1287	1295	1296	1296	she	48	“ I wonder is that more mothballs ? ”
1334	1340	1341	1341	she	48	“ This is very queer , ”
1380	1391	1393	1393	Lucy	48	“ Why , it is just like branches of trees ! ”
1565	1576	1578	1578	Lucy	48	“ I can always get back if anything goes wrong , ”
1901	1906	1908	1909	the Faun	36	“ Goodness gracious me ! ”
1911	1915	1917	1917	Lucy	48	“ GOOD EVENING , ”
1948	1955	1957	1958	the Faun	36	“ Good evening , good evening , ”
1960	1987	1957	1958	the Faun	36	“ Excuse me — I do n’t want to be inquisitive — but should I be right in thinking that you are a Daughter of Eve ? ”
1988	1994	1996	1996	she	48	“ My name ’s Lucy , ”
2003	2019	2021	2022	the Faun	36	“ But you are — forgive me — you are what they call a girl ? ”
2024	2032	2034	2034	Lucy	48	“ Of course I ’m a girl , ”
2036	2043	1957	1958	the Faun	36	“ You are in fact Human ? ”
2044	2051	2053	2053	Lucy	48	“ Of course I ’m human , ”
2060	2069	2071	2072	the Faun	36	“ To be sure , to be sure , ”
2074	2105	2071	2072	the Faun	36	“ How stupid of me ! But I ’ve never seen a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve before . I am delighted . That is to say — ”
2129	2134	1957	1958	the Faun	36	“ Delighted , delighted , ”
2139	2151	1957	1958	the Faun	36	“ Allow me to introduce myself . My name is Tumnus . ”
2152	2164	2166	2166	Lucy	48	“ I am very pleased to meet you , Mr Tumnus , ”
2168	2180	2182	2183	Mr Tumnus	39	“ And may I ask , O Lucy Daughter of Eve , ”
2185	2193	2182	2183	Mr Tumnus	39	“ how you have come into Narnia ? ”
2194	2201	2203	2203	Lucy	48	“ Narnia ? What ’s that ? ”
2205	2213	2215	2216	the Faun	160	“ This is the land of Narnia , ”
2218	2258	2215	2216	the Faun	160	“ where we are now ; all that lies between the lamp - post and the great castle of Cair Paravel on the eastern sea . And you — you have come from the wild woods of the west ? ”
2259	2273	2275	2275	Lucy	48	“ I — I got in through the wardrobe in the spare room , ”
2277	2280	2282	2283	Mr Tumnus	39	“ Ah ! ”
2290	2323	2282	2283	Mr Tumnus	39	“ if only I had worked harder at geography when I was a little Faun , I should no doubt know all about those strange countries . It is too late now . ”
2324	2333	2335	2335	Lucy	48	“ But they are n’t countries at all , ”
2340	2360	2335	2335	Lucy	48	“ It ’s only just back there — at least — I’m not sure . It is summer there . ”
2361	2364	2366	2367	Mr Tumnus	39	“ Meanwhile , ”
2369	2434	2366	2367	Mr Tumnus	39	“ it is winter in Narnia , and has been for ever so long , and we shall both catch cold if we stand here talking in the snow . Daughter of Eve from the far land of Spare Oom where eternal summer reigns around the bright city of War Drobe , how would it be if you came and had tea with me ? ”
2435	2444	2446	2446	Lucy	48	“ Thank you very much , Mr Tumnus , ”
2448	2461	2446	2446	Lucy	48	“ But I was wondering whether I ought to be getting back . ”
2462	2471	2473	2474	the Faun	36	“ It ’s only just round the corner , ”
2476	2494	2473	2474	the Faun	36	“ and there ’ll be a roaring fire — and toast — and sardines — and cake . ”
2495	2505	2507	2507	Lucy	48	“ Well , it ’s very kind of you , ”
2509	2520	2507	2507	Lucy	48	“ But I sha n’t be able to stay long . ”
2521	2533	2535	2536	Mr Tumnus	39	“ If you will take my arm , Daughter of Eve , ”
2538	2563	2535	2536	Mr Tumnus	39	“ I shall be able to hold the umbrella over both of us . That ’s the way . Now — off we go . ”
2712	2720	2721	2721	he	39	“ Now we sha n’t be long , ”
2765	2775	2777	2778	Mr Tumnus	39	“ one for me and one for a friend , ”
2881	2888	2890	2891	the Faun	36	“ Now , Daughter of Eve ! ”
3092	3102	3103	3103	he	39	“ Not that it is n’t always winter now , ”
3176	3214	3170	3170	she	48	“ Oh , Mr Tumnus — I’m so sorry to stop you , and I do love that tune — but really , I must go home . I only meant to stay for a few minutes . ”
3215	3225	3227	3228	the Faun	36	“ It ’s no good now , you know , ”
3243	3247	3249	3249	Lucy	48	“ No good ? ”
3258	3284	3249	3249	Lucy	48	“ What do you mean ? I ’ve got to go home at once . The others will be wondering what has happened to me . ”
3292	3301	3289	3289	she	48	“ Mr Tumnus ! Whatever is the matter ? ”
3349	3356	3358	3358	Lucy	48	“ Mr Tumnus ! Mr Tumnus ! ”
3363	3391	3358	3358	Lucy	48	“ Do n’t ! Do n’t ! What is the matter ? Aren ’ you well ? Dear Mr Tumnus , do tell me what is wrong . ”
3468	3472	3474	3474	Lucy	48	“ Mr Tumnus ! ”
3482	3514	3474	3474	Lucy	48	“ Do stop . Stop it at once ! You ought to be ashamed of yourself , a great big Faun like you . What on earth are you crying about ? ”
3515	3522	3524	3525	Mr Tumnus	39	“ Oh — oh — oh ! ”
3527	3539	3524	3525	Mr Tumnus	39	“ I ’m crying because I ’m such a bad Faun . ”
3540	3553	3555	3555	Lucy	48	“ I do n’t think you ’re a bad Faun at all , ”
3557	3577	3555	3555	Lucy	48	“ I think you are a very good Faun . You are the nicest Faun I ’ve ever met . ”
3578	3592	3594	3595	Mr Tumnus	39	“ Oh — oh — you would n’t say that if you knew , ”
3600	3626	3594	3595	Mr Tumnus	39	“ No , I ’m a bad Faun . I do n’t suppose there ever was a worse Faun since the beginning of the world . ”
3627	3634	3636	3636	Lucy	48	“ But what have you done ? ”
3638	3645	3647	3648	Mr Tumnus	39	“ My old father , now , ”
3650	3669	3647	3648	Mr Tumnus	39	“ that ’s his picture over the mantelpiece . He would never have done a thing like this . ”
3670	3676	3678	3678	Lucy	48	“ A thing like what ? ”
3680	3687	3689	3690	the Faun	36	“ Like what I ’ve done , ”
3692	3716	3689	3690	the Faun	36	“ Taken service under the White Witch . That ’s what I am . I ’m in the pay of the White Witch . ”
3717	3726	3647	3648	Mr Tumnus	39	“ The White Witch ? Who is she ? ”
3727	3761	3689	3690	the Faun	36	“ Why , it is she that has got all Narnia under her thumb . It ’s she that makes it always winter . Always winter and never Christmas ; think of that ! ”
3762	3766	3768	3768	Lucy	48	“ How awful ! ”
3770	3779	3768	3768	Lucy	48	“ But what does she pay you for ? ”
3780	3788	3790	3791	Mr Tumnus	39	“ That ’s the worst of it , ”
3797	3882	3790	3791	Mr Tumnus	39	“ I ’m a kidnapper for her , that ’s what I am . Look at me , Daughter of Eve . Would you believe that I ’m the sort of Faun to meet a poor innocent child in the wood , one that had never done me any harm , and pretend to be friendly with it , and invite it home to my cave , all for the sake of lulling it asleep and then handing it over to the White Witch ? ”
3883	3886	3888	3888	Lucy	48	“ No , ”
3890	3903	3888	3888	Lucy	48	“ I ’m sure you would n’t do anything of the sort . ”
3904	3909	3911	3912	the Faun	36	“ But I have , ”
3914	3917	3919	3919	Lucy	48	“ Well , ”
3939	3965	3919	3919	Lucy	48	“ well , that was pretty bad . But you ’re so sorry for it that I ’m sure you will never do it again . ”
3966	3976	3978	3979	the Faun	36	“ Daughter of Eve , do n’t you understand ? ”
3981	4000	3978	3979	the Faun	36	“ It is n’t something I have done . I ’m doing it now , this very moment . ”
4001	4007	4009	4009	Lucy	48	“ What do you mean ? ”
4015	4021	4023	4023	Tumnus	36	“ You are the child , ”
4025	4108	4023	4023	Tumnus	36	“ I had orders from the White Witch that if ever I saw a Son of Adam or a Daughter of Eve in the wood , I was to catch them and hand them over to her . And you are the first I ’ve ever met . And I ’ve pretended to be your friend an asked you to tea , and all the time I ’ve been meaning to wait till you were asleep and then go and tell Her . ”
4109	4120	4122	4122	Lucy	48	“ Oh , but you wo n’t , Mr Tumnus , ”
4124	4140	4122	4122	Lucy	48	“ Yo wo n’t , will you ? Indeed , indeed you really must n’t . ”
4141	4148	4150	4150	he	196	“ And if I do n’t , ”
4156	4260	4150	4150	he	196	“ she ’s sure to find out . And she ’ll have my tail cut off and my horns sawn off , and my beard plucked out , and she ’ll wave her wand over my beautiful clove hoofs and turn them into horrid solid hoofs like wretched horse ’s . And if she is extra and specially angry she ’ll turn me into stone and I shall be only statue of a Faun in her horrible house until the four thrones at Cair Paravel are filled and goodness knows when that will happen , or whether it will ever happen at all . ”
4261	4270	4272	4272	Lucy	48	“ I ’m very sorry , Mr Tumnus , ”
4274	4282	4272	4272	Lucy	48	“ But please let me go home . ”
4283	4289	4291	4292	the Faun	36	“ Of course I will , ”
4294	4376	4291	4292	the Faun	36	“ Of course I ’ve got to . I see that now . I had n’t known what Humans were like before I met you . Of course I ca n’t give you up to the Witch ; not now that I know you . But we must be off at once . I ’ll see you back to the lamp - post . I suppose you can find your own way from there back to Spare Oom and War Drobe ? ”
4377	4384	4386	4386	Lucy	48	“ I ’m sure I can , ”
4388	4398	4400	4401	Mr Tumnus	39	“ We must go as quietly as we can , ”
4403	4423	4400	4401	Mr Tumnus	39	“ The whole wood is full of her spies . Even some of the trees are on her side . ”
4511	4524	4526	4526	Tumnus	39	“ Do you know your way from here , Daughter o Eve ? ”
4551	4554	4555	4555	she	48	“ Yes , ”
4558	4566	4555	4555	she	48	“ I can see the wardrobe door . ”
4567	4578	4580	4581	the Faun	36	“ Then be off home as quick as you can , ”
4583	4599	4580	4581	the Faun	36	“ and — c - can you ever forgive me for what meant to do ? ”
4600	4608	4610	4610	Lucy	48	“ Why , of course I can , ”
4619	4635	4610	4610	Lucy	48	“ And I do hope you wo n’t get into dreadful trouble on my account . ”
4636	4643	4645	4645	he	39	“ Farewell , Daughter of Eve , ”
4647	4655	4645	4645	he	39	“ Perhaps I may keep the handkerchief ? ”
4656	4659	4661	4661	Lucy	48	“ Rather ! ”
4765	4770	4771	4771	she	48	“ I ’m here , ”
4774	4788	4771	4771	she	48	“ I ’m here . I ’ve come back I ’m all right . ”
4805	4811	4812	4812	she	48	“ It ’s all right , ”
4815	4820	4812	4812	she	48	“ I ’ve comeback . ”
4821	4832	4834	4834	Susan	27	“ What on earth are you talking about , Lucy ? ”
4836	4839	4841	4841	Lucy	48	“ Why ? ”
4845	4856	4841	4841	Lucy	48	“ have n’t you all been wondering where I was ? ”
4857	4867	4869	4869	Peter	26	“ So you ’ve been hiding , have you ? ”
4871	4899	4869	4869	Peter	26	“ Poor old Lu , hiding and nobody noticed ! You ’ll have to hide longer than that if you want people to start looking for you . ”
4900	4911	4913	4913	Lucy	48	“ But I ’ve been away for hours and hours , ”
4923	4926	4928	4928	Edmund	28	“ Batty ! ”
4934	4938	4928	4928	Edmund	28	“ Quite batty . ”
4939	4947	4949	4949	Peter	26	“ What do you mean , Lu ? ”
4951	4956	4958	4958	Lucy	48	“ What I said , ”
4960	4995	4958	4958	Lucy	48	“ It was just after breakfast when I went into the wardrobe , and I ’ve been away for hours and hours , and had tea , and all sorts of things have happened . ”
4996	5004	5006	5006	Susan	27	“ Do n’t be silly , Lucy , ”
5008	5028	5006	5006	Susan	27	“ We ’ve only just come out of that room a moment ago , and you were there then . ”
5029	5038	5040	5040	Peter	26	“ She ’s not being silly at all , ”
5042	5065	5040	5040	Peter	26	“ she ’s just making up a story for fun , are n’t you , Lu ? And why should n’t she ? ”
5066	5075	5076	5076	she	48	“ No , Peter , I ’m not , ”
5079	5118	5076	5076	she	48	“ It’s — it ’s a magic wardrobe . There ’s a wood inside it , and it ’s snowing , and there ’s a Faun and a Witch and it ’s called Narnia ; come and see . ”
5160	5170	5144	5144	She	48	“ Now ! go in and see for yourselves . ”
5171	5177	5179	5179	Susan	27	“ Why , you goose , ”
5192	5209	5179	5179	Susan	27	“ it ’s just an ordinary wardrobe ; look ! there ’s the back of it . ”
5271	5279	5280	5280	he	26	“ A jolly good hoax , Lu , ”
5288	5305	5280	5280	he	26	“ you have really taken us in , I must admit . We half believed you . ”
5306	5316	5318	5318	Lucy	48	“ But it was n’t a hoax at all , ”
5320	5340	5318	5318	Lucy	48	“ really and truly . It was all different a moment ago . Honestly it was . I promise . ”
5341	5346	5348	5348	Peter	26	“ Come , Lu , ”
5350	5372	5348	5348	Peter	26	“ that ’s going a bit far . You ’ve had your joke . Had n’t you better drop it now ? ”
5646	5648	5644	5644	Susan	27	“ It ”
5922	5933	5935	5935	Edmund	28	“ She thinks I ’m Susan come to catch her , ”
5939	5952	5935	5935	Edmund	28	“ and so she ’s keeping very quiet in at the back . ”
6044	6059	6039	6039	he	28	“ Lucy ! Lu ! Where are you ? I know you ’re here . ”
6110	6114	6116	6116	Edmund	28	“ Thank goodness , ”
6118	6130	6116	6116	Edmund	28	“ the door must have swung open of its own accord . ”
6322	6325	6341	6341	she	48	“ imaginary country ”
6352	6364	6349	6349	he	28	“ Lucy ! Lucy ! I ’m here too - Edmund . ”
6370	6384	6386	6386	Edmund	28	“ She ’s angry about all the things I ’ve been saying lately , ”
6424	6456	6420	6420	he	28	“ I say , Lu ! I ’m sorry I did n’t believe you . I see now you were right all along . Do come out . Make it Pax . ”
6463	6469	6473	6473	himself	28	“ Just like a girl , ”
6475	6486	6473	6473	himself	28	“ sulking somewhere , and wo n’t accept an apology . ”
6816	6819	6821	6822	the Lady	244	“ Stop ! ”
6866	6875	6877	6878	the Lady	244	“ And what , pray , are you ? ”
6885	6895	6897	6897	Edmund	28	“ I’m - I’m - my name ’s Edmund , ”
6916	6925	6926	6926	she	244	“ Is that how you address a Queen ? ”
6934	6948	6950	6950	Edmund	28	“ I beg your pardon , your Majesty , I did n’t know , ”
6952	6960	6962	6962	she	244	“ Not know the Queen of Narnia ? ”
6964	6982	6962	6962	she	244	“ Ha ! You shall know us better hereafter . But I repeat - what are you ? ”
6983	6989	6991	6991	Edmund	28	“ Please , your Majesty , ”
6993	7017	6991	6991	Edmund	28	“ I do n’t know what you mean . I ’m at school — at least I was it ’s the holidays now . ”
7018	7024	7026	7027	the Queen	249	“ BUT what are you ? ”
7030	7044	7026	7027	the Queen	249	“ Are you a great overgrown dwarf that has cut off its beard ? ”
7045	7051	7053	7053	Edmund	28	“ No , your Majesty , ”
7055	7067	7053	7053	Edmund	28	“ I never had a beard , I ’m a boy . ”
7068	7072	7074	7074	she	249	“ A boy ! ”
7076	7087	7074	7074	she	249	“ Do you mean you are a Son of Adam ? ”
7109	7123	7125	7126	the Queen	249	“ I see you are an idiot , whatever else you may be , ”
7128	7148	7125	7126	the Queen	249	“ Answer me , once and for all , or I shall lose my patience . Are you human ? ”
7149	7155	7157	7157	Edmund	28	“ Yes , your Majesty , ”
7159	7173	7125	7126	the Queen	249	“ And how , pray , did you come to enter my dominions ? ”
7174	7187	7125	7126	the Queen	249	“ Please , your Majesty , I came in through a wardrobe . ”
7188	7197	7125	7126	the Queen	249	“ A wardrobe ? What do you mean ? ”
7198	7214	7216	7216	Edmund	28	“ I — I opened a door and just found myself here , your Majesty , ”
7218	7221	7223	7224	the Queen	249	“ Ha ! ”
7234	7271	7229	7229	herself	249	“ A door . A door from the world of men ! I have heard of such things . This may wreck all . But he is only one , and he is easily dealt with . ”
7339	7344	7345	7345	she	249	“ My poor child , ”
7353	7381	7345	7345	she	249	“ how cold you look ! Come and sit with me here on the sledge and I will put my mantle round you and we will talk . ”
7425	7432	7434	7435	the Queen	249	“ Perhaps something hot to drink ? ”
7437	7443	7434	7435	the Queen	249	“ Should you like that ? ”
7444	7451	7453	7453	Edmund	28	“ Yes please , your Majesty , ”
7606	7620	7622	7623	the Queen	249	“ It is dull , Son of Adam , to drink without eating , ”
7626	7635	7622	7623	the Queen	249	“ What would you like best to eat ? ”
7636	7645	7647	7647	Edmund	28	“ Turkish Delight , please , your Majesty , ”
7871	7882	7883	7883	she	249	“ You are sure there are just four of you ? ”
7886	7902	7883	7883	she	249	“ Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve , neither more nor less ? ”
7918	7927	7904	7904	Edmund	28	“ Yes , I told you that before , ”
7933	7936	7932	7932	her	249	“ Your Majesty ”
8055	8082	8050	8050	she	249	“ Son of Adam , I should so much like to see your brother and your two sisters . Will you bring them to see me ? ”
8083	8088	8090	8090	Edmund	28	“ I ’ll try , ”
8099	8150	8090	8090	Edmund	28	“ Because , if you did come again — bringing them with you of course — I’d be able to give you some more Turkish Delight . I ca n’t do it now , the magic will only work once . In my own house it would be another matter . ”
8151	8162	8164	8164	Edmund	28	“ Why ca n’t we go to your house now ? ”
8210	8220	8222	8223	the Queen	249	“ It is a lovely place , my house , ”
8225	8337	8222	8223	the Queen	249	“ I am sure you would like it . There are whole rooms full of Turkish Delight , and what ’s more , I have no children of my own . I want a nice boy whom I could bring up as a Prince and who would be King of Narnia when I am gone . While he was Prince he would wear a gold crown and eat Turkish Delight all day long ; and you are much the cleverest and handsomest young man I ’ve ever met . I think I would like to make you the Prince — some day , when you bring the others to visit me . ”
8338	8343	8345	8345	Edmund	28	“ Why not now ? ”
8376	8387	8389	8389	she	249	“ Oh , but if I took you there now , ”
8391	8450	8389	8389	she	249	“ I should n’t see your brother and your sisters . I very much want to know your charming relations . You are to be the Prince and — later on — the King ; that is understood . But you must have courtiers and nobles . I will make your brother a Duke and your sisters Duchesses . ”
8451	8459	8461	8461	Edmund	28	“ There ’s nothing special about them , ”
8463	8477	8461	8461	Edmund	28	“ and , anyway , I could always bring them some other time . ”
8478	8489	8491	8492	the Queen	249	“ Ah , but once you were in my house , ”
8494	8554	8491	8492	the Queen	249	“ you might forget all about thern . You would be enjoying yourself so much that you would n’t want the bother of going to fetch them . No . You must go back to your own country now and come to me another day , with them , you understand . It is no good coming without them . ”
8555	8570	8572	8572	Edmund	28	“ But I do n’t even know the way back to my own country , ”
8574	8579	8581	8582	the Queen	249	“ That ’s easy , ”
8584	8591	8592	8592	She	249	“ Do you see that lamp ? ”
8615	8636	8637	8637	she	249	“ Straight on , beyond that , is the way to the World of Men . And now look the other way”—here
8642	8657	8637	8637	she	249	direction—“and tell me if you can see two little hills rising above the trees . ”
8658	8664	8666	8666	Edmund	28	“ I think I can , ”
8668	8735	8637	8637	she	249	“ Well , my house is between those two hills . So next time you come you have only to find the lamp - post and look for those two hills and walk through the wood till you reach my house . But remember — you must bring the others with you . I might have to be very angry with you if you came alone . ”
8736	8743	8745	8745	Edmund	28	“ I ’ll do my best , ”
8747	8754	8756	8757	the Queen	249	“ And , by the way , ”
8759	8827	8756	8757	the Queen	249	“ you need n’t tell them about me . It would be fun to keep it a secret between us two , would n’t it ? Make it a surprise for them . Just bring them along to the two hills — a clever boy like you will easily think of some excuse for doing that — and when you come to my house you could just say “
8834	8890	8966	8967	the Queen	249	” or something like that . I am sure that would be best . If your sister has met one of the Fauns , she may have heard strange stories about me — nasty stories that might make her afraid to come to me . Fauns will say anything , you know , and now — ”
8891	8896	8898	8898	Edmund	28	“ Please , please , ”
8901	8920	8898	8898	Edmund	28	“ please could n’t I have just one piece of Turkish Delight to eat on the way home ? ”
8921	8926	8928	8929	the Queen	249	“ No , no , ”
8934	8942	8928	8929	the Queen	249	“ you must wait till next time . ”
8975	8989	8966	8967	the Queen	249	“ Next time ! Next time ! Do n’t forget . Come soon . ”
9022	9027	9028	9028	she	48	“ Oh , Edmund ! ”
9031	9046	9028	9028	she	48	“ So you ’ve got in too ! Is n’t it wonderful , and now- ”
9047	9051	9053	9053	Edmund	28	“ All right , ”
9055	9099	9053	9053	Edmund	28	“ I see you were right and it is a magic wardrobe after all . I ’ll say I ’m sorry if you like . But where on earth have you been all this time ? I ’ve been looking for you everywhere . ”
9100	9116	9118	9118	Lucy	48	“ If I ’d known you had got in I ’d have waited for you , ”
9141	9195	9118	9118	Lucy	48	“ I ’ve been having lunch with dear Mr Tumnus , the Faun , and he ’s very well and the White Witch has done nothing to him for letting me go , so he thinks she ca n’t have found out and perhaps everything is going to be all right after all . ”
9196	9201	9203	9203	Edmund	28	“ The White Witch ? ”
9205	9210	9203	9203	Edmund	28	“ who ’s she ? ”
9211	9219	9221	9221	Lucy	48	“ She is a perfectly terrible person , ”
9223	9331	9221	9221	Lucy	48	“ She calls herself the Queen of Narnia though she has no right to be queen at all , and all the Fauns and Dryads and Naiads and Dwarfs and Animals — at least all the good ones — simply hate her . And she can turn people into stone and do all kinds of horrible things . And she has made a magic so that it is always winter in Narnia — always winter , but it never gets to Christmas . And she drives about on a sledge , drawn by reindeer , with her wand in her hand and a crown on her head . ”
9383	9395	9396	9396	he	28	“ Who told you all that stuff about the White Witch ? ”
9399	9406	9408	9408	Lucy	48	“ Mr Tumnus , the Faun , ”
9410	9420	9422	9422	Edmund	28	“ You ca n’t always believe what Fauns say , ”
9438	9443	9445	9445	Lucy	48	“ Who said so ? ”
9447	9452	9454	9454	Edmund	28	“ Everyone knows it , ”
9456	9479	9454	9454	Edmund	28	“ ask anybody you like . But it ’s pretty poor sport standing here in the snow . Let ’s go home . ”
9480	9486	9488	9488	Lucy	48	“ Yes , let ’s , ”
9490	9527	9488	9488	Lucy	48	“ Oh , Edmund , I am glad you ’ve got in too . The others will have to believe in Narnia now that both of us have been there . What fun it will be ! ”
9654	9658	9660	9660	Lucy	48	“ I say , ”
9662	9676	9660	9660	Lucy	48	“ you do look awful , Edmund . Do n’t you feel well ? ”
9677	9683	9685	9685	Edmund	28	“ I ’m all right , ”
9699	9704	9706	9706	Lucy	48	“ Come on then , ”
9708	9741	9706	9706	Lucy	48	“ let ’s find the others . What a lot we shall have to tell them ! And what wonderful adventures we shall have now that we ’re all in it together . ”
9795	9852	9791	9791	Lucy	48	“ Peter ! Susan ! It ’s all true . Edmund has seen it too . There is a country you can get to through the wardrobe . Edmund and I both got in . We met one another in there , in the wood . Go on , Edmund ; tell them all about it . ”
9853	9862	9864	9864	Peter	26	“ What ’s all this about , Ed ? ”
9945	9951	9953	9953	Susan	27	“ Tell us , Ed , ”
9988	10027	9964	9964	he	28	“ Oh , yes , Lucy and I have been playing — pretending that all her story about a country in the wardrobe is true . just for fun , of course . There ’s nothing there really . ”
10069	10093	10054	10054	he	28	“ There she goes again . What ’s the matter with her ? That ’s the worst of young kids , they always — ”
10094	10098	10100	10100	Peter	26	“ Look here , ”
10107	10154	10100	10100	Peter	26	“ shut up ! You ’ve been perfectly beastly to Lu ever since she started this nonsense about the wardrobe , and now you go playing games with her about it and setting her off again . I believe you did it simply out of spite . ”
10155	10162	10164	10164	Edmund	28	“ But it ’s all nonsense , ”
10170	10178	10180	10180	Peter	26	“ Of course it ’s all nonsense , ”
10182	10252	10180	10180	Peter	26	“ that ’s just the point . Lu was perfectly all right when we left home , but since we ’ve been down here she seems to be either going queer in the head or else turning into a most frightful liar . But whichever it is , what good do you think you ’ll do by jeering and nagging at her one day and encouraging her the next ? ”
10253	10260	10262	10262	Edmund	28	“ I thought — I thought , ”
10274	10283	10285	10285	Peter	26	“ You did n’t think anything at all , ”
10287	10314	10285	10285	Peter	26	“ it ’s just spite . You ’ve always liked being beastly to anyone smaller than yourself ; we ’ve seen that at school before now . ”
10315	10320	10322	10322	Susan	27	“ Do stop it , ”
10324	10346	10322	10322	Susan	27	“ it wo n’t make things any better having a row between you two . Let ’s go and find Lucy . ”
10389	10451	10381	10381	She	48	“ I do n’t care what you think , and I do n’t care what you say . You can tell the Professor or you can write to Mother or you can do anything you like . I know I ’ve met a Faun in there and — I wish I ’d stayed there and you are all beasts , beasts . ”
10537	10554	10556	10556	Peter	26	“ He ’ll write to Father if he thinks there is really something wrong with Lu , ”
10558	10565	10556	10556	Peter	26	“ it ’s getting beyond us . ”
10580	10584	10577	10578	the Professor	117	“ Come in , ”
10654	10660	10661	10661	he	117	“ How do you know , ”
10664	10674	10661	10661	he	117	“ that your sister ’s story is not true ? ”
10675	10680	10682	10682	Susan	27	“ Oh , but — ”
10711	10721	10704	10704	Susan	27	“ But Edmund said they had only been pretending . ”
10722	10728	10730	10731	the Professor	117	“ That is a point , ”
10733	10782	10730	10731	the Professor	117	“ which certainly deserves consideration ; very careful consideration . For instance — if you will excuse me for asking the question — does your experience lead you to regard your brother or your sister as the more reliable ? I mean , which is the more truthful ? ”
10783	10795	10797	10797	Peter	26	“ That ’s just the funny thing about it , sir , ”
10799	10812	10797	10797	Peter	26	“ Up till now , I ’d have said Lucy every time . ”
10813	10823	10825	10826	the Professor	117	“ And what do you think , my dear ? ”
10832	10835	10837	10837	Susan	27	“ Well , ”
10839	10867	10837	10837	Susan	27	“ in general , I ’d say the same as Peter , but this could n’t be true — all this about the wood and the Faun . ”
10868	10876	10878	10879	the Professor	117	“ That is more than I know , ”
10881	10907	10878	10879	the Professor	117	“ and a charge of lying against someone whom you have always found truthful is a very serious thing ; a very serious thing indeed . ”
10908	10919	10921	10921	Susan	27	“ We were afraid it might n’t even be lying , ”
10923	10934	10921	10921	Susan	27	“ we thought there might be something wrong with Lucy . ”
10935	10941	10943	10944	the Professor	117	“ Madness , you mean ? ”
10948	10979	10943	10944	the Professor	117	“ Oh , you can make your minds easy about that . One has only to look at her and talk to her to see that she is not mad . ”
10980	10984	10986	10986	Susan	27	“ But then , ”
11013	11016	11018	11019	the Professor	117	“ Logic ! ”
11024	11098	11018	11019	the Professor	117	“ Why do n’t they teach logic at these schools ? There are only three possibilities . Either your sister is telling lies , or she is mad , or she is telling the truth . You know she does n’t tell lies and it is obvious that she is not mad For the moment then and unless any further evidence turns up , we must assume that she is telling the truth . ”
11124	11134	11136	11136	Peter	26	“ But how could it be true , sir ? ”
11138	11145	11147	11148	the Professor	117	“ Why do you say that ? ”
11150	11157	11159	11159	Peter	26	“ Well , for one thing , ”
11161	11200	11159	11159	Peter	26	“ if it was true why does n’t everyone find this country every time they go to the wardrobe ? I mean , there was nothing there when we looked ; even Lucy did n’t pretend the was . ”
11201	11210	11212	11213	the Professor	117	“ What has that to do with it ? ”
11215	11232	11159	11159	Peter	26	“ Well , sir , if things are real , they ’re there all the time . ”
11233	11237	11239	11240	the Professor	117	“ Are they ? ”
11251	11258	11260	11260	Susan	27	“ But there was no time , ”
11262	11311	11260	11260	Susan	27	“ Lucy had no time to have gone anywhere , even if there was such a place . She came running after us the very moment we were out of the room . It was less than minute , and she pretended to have been away for hours . ”
11312	11328	11330	11331	the Professor	117	“ That is the very thing that makes her story so likely to be true , ”
11333	11462	11330	11331	the Professor	117	“ If there really a door in this house that leads to some other world ( and I should warn you that this is a very strange house , and even I know very little about it)—if , I say , she had got into another world , I should not be at a surprised to find that the other world had a separate time of its own ; so that however long you stay there it would never take up any of our time . On the other hand , I do n’t think many girls of her age would invent that idea for themselves . If she had been pretending , she would have hidden for a reasonable time before coming out and telling her story . ”
11463	11472	11474	11474	Peter	26	“ But do you really mean , sir , ”
11476	11497	11474	11474	Peter	26	“ that there could be other worlds — all over the place , just round the corner — like that ? ”
11498	11504	11506	11507	the Professor	117	“ Nothing is more probable , ”
11525	11537	11520	11520	he	117	“ I wonder what they do teach them at these schools . ”
11538	11546	11548	11548	Susan	27	“ But what are we to do ? ”
11563	11569	11571	11572	the Professor	117	“ My dear young lady , ”
11587	11605	11571	11572	the Professor	117	“ there is one plan which no one has yet suggested and which is well worth trying . ”
11606	11611	11613	11613	Susan	27	“ What ’s that ? ”
11615	11625	11627	11627	he	117	“ We might all try minding our own business , ”
11888	11910	11866	11866	She	30	“ And please remember you ’re to keep out of the way whenever I ’m taking a party over the house . ”
11911	11936	11938	11938	Edmund	28	“ Just as if any of us would want to waste half the morning trailing round with a crowd of strange grown - ups ! ”
11993	12008	11983	11985	the two girls	338	“ Look out ! Here comes the Macready and a whole gang with her . ”
12009	12015	12017	12017	Peter	26	“ Sharp ’s the word , ”
12144	12172	12141	12141	Susan	27	“ Oh bother those trippers ! Here — let ’s get into the Wardrobe Room till they ’ve passed . No one will follow us in there . ”
12203	12206	12208	12208	Peter	26	“ Quick ! ”
12210	12216	12208	12208	Peter	26	“ there ’s nowhere else , ”
12277	12292	12294	12294	Susan	27	“ I wish the Macready would hurry up and take all these people away , ”
12297	12304	12294	12294	Susan	27	“ I ’m getting horribly cramped . ”
12305	12314	12316	12316	Edmund	28	“ And what a filthy smell of camphor ! ”
12318	12331	12333	12333	Susan	27	“ I expect the pockets of these coats are full of it , ”
12335	12342	12333	12333	Susan	27	“ to keep away the moths . ”
12343	12352	12354	12354	Peter	26	“ There ’s something sticking into my back , ”
12356	12363	12365	12365	Susan	27	“ And is n’t it cold ? ”
12367	12378	12380	12380	Peter	26	“ Now that you mention it , it is cold , ”
12382	12415	12380	12380	Peter	26	“ and hang it all , it ’s wet too . What ’s the matter with this place ? I ’m sitting on something wet . It ’s getting wetter every minute . ”
12422	12428	12430	12430	Edmund	28	“ Let ’s get out , ”
12432	12437	12430	12430	Edmund	28	“ they ’ve gone . ”
12438	12445	12447	12447	Susan	27	“ O - o - oh ! ”
12459	12467	12469	12469	Susan	27	“ I ’m sitting against a tree , ”
12471	12483	12469	12469	Susan	27	“ and look ! It ’s getting light — over there . ”
12484	12492	12494	12494	Peter	26	“ By Jove , you ’re right , ”
12496	12532	12494	12494	Peter	26	“ and look there — and there . It ’s trees all round . And this wet stuff is snow . Why , I do believe we ’ve got into Lucy ’s wood after all . ”
12579	12587	12588	12588	he	26	“ I apologize for not believing you , ”
12591	12601	12588	12588	he	26	“ I ’m sorry . Will you shake hands ? ”
12602	12606	12608	12608	Lucy	48	“ Of course , ”
12613	12617	12619	12619	Susan	27	“ And now , ”
12621	12628	12619	12619	Susan	27	“ what do we do next ? ”
12629	12632	12634	12634	Peter	26	“ Do ? ”
12636	12648	12634	12634	Peter	26	“ why , go and explore the wood , of course . ”
12649	12652	12654	12654	Susan	27	“ Ugh ! ”
12660	12675	12654	12654	Susan	27	“ it ’s pretty cold . What about putting on some of these coats ? ”
12676	12682	12684	12684	Peter	26	“ They ’re not ours , ”
12687	12695	12697	12697	Susan	27	“ I am sure nobody would mind , ”
12699	12726	12697	12697	Susan	27	“ it is n’t as if we wanted to take them out of the house ; we sha n’t take them even out of the wardrobe . ”
12727	12736	12738	12738	Peter	26	“ I never thought of that , Su , ”
12740	12788	12738	12738	Peter	26	“ Of course , now you put it that way , I see . No one could say you had bagged a coat as long as you leave it in the wardrobe where you found it . And I suppose this whole country is in the wardrobe . ”
12858	12867	12869	12869	Lucy	48	“ We can pretend we are Arctic explorers , ”
12871	12882	12887	12887	he	26	“ This is going to be exciting enough without pretending , ”
12916	12920	12922	12922	Edmund	28	“ I say , ”
12925	12952	12922	12922	Edmund	28	“ ought n’t we to be bearing a bit more to the left , that is , if we are aiming for the lamp - post ? ”
13001	13008	13009	13009	he	26	“ So you really were here , ”
13012	13033	13009	13009	he	26	“ that time Lu said she ’d met you in here — and you made out she was telling lies . ”
13040	13050	13052	13052	Peter	26	“ Well , of all the poisonous little beasts — ”
13088	13108	13082	13082	Edmund	28	“ I ’ll pay you all out for this , you pack of stuck - up , selfsatisfied prigs . ”
13109	13116	13118	13118	Susan	27	“ Where are we going anyway ? ”
13129	13139	13141	13141	Peter	26	“ I think Lu ought to be the leader , ”
13143	13158	13141	13141	Peter	26	“ goodness knows she deserves it . Where will you take us , Lu ? ”
13159	13168	13170	13170	Lucy	48	“ What about going to see Mr Tumnus ? ”
13172	13183	13170	13170	Lucy	48	“ He ’s the nice Faun I told you about . ”
13381	13391	13393	13393	Edmund	28	“ This is a pretty good wash - out , ”
13395	13402	13393	13393	Edmund	28	“ not much good coming here . ”
13403	13408	13410	13410	Peter	26	“ What is this ? ”
13434	13442	13444	13444	Susan	27	“ Is there anything written on it ? ”
13446	13454	13456	13456	Peter	26	“ Yes , I think there is , ”
13458	13478	13456	13456	Peter	26	“ but I ca n’t read it in this light . Let ’s get out into the open air . ”
13582	13598	13600	13600	Susan	27	“ I do n’t know that I ’m going to like this place after all , ”
13602	13610	13612	13612	Peter	26	“ Who is this Queen , Lu ? ”
13614	13622	13612	13612	Peter	26	“ Do you know anything about her ? ”
13623	13633	13635	13635	Lucy	48	“ She is n’t a real queen at all , ”
13637	13677	13635	13635	Lucy	48	“ she ’s a horrible witch , the White Witch . Everyone all the wood people — hate her . She has made an enchantment over the whole country so that it is always winter here and never Christmas . ”
13678	13692	13694	13694	Susan	27	“ I — I wonder if there ’s any point in going on , ”
13696	13742	13694	13694	Susan	27	“ I mean , it does n’t seem particularly safe here and it looks as if it wo n’t be much fun either . And it ’s getting colder every minute , and we ’ve brought nothing to eat . What about just going home ? ”
13743	13755	13757	13757	Lucy	48	“ Oh , but we ca n’t , we ca n’t , ”
13760	13830	13757	13757	Lucy	48	“ do n’t you see ? We ca n’t just go home , not after this . It is all on my account that the poor Faun has got into this trouble . He hid me from the Witch and showed me the way back . That ’s what it means by comforting the Queen ’s enemies and fraternizing with Humans . We simply must try to rescue him . ”
13831	13838	13840	13840	Edmund	28	“ A lot we could do ! ”
13842	13853	13840	13840	Edmund	28	“ when we have n’t even got anything to eat ! ”
13854	13860	13862	13862	Peter	26	“ Shut up — you ! ”
13872	13880	13870	13870	Edmund	28	“ What do you think , Susan ? ”
13881	13892	13894	13894	Susan	27	“ I ’ve a horrid feeling that Lu is right , ”
13896	13937	13894	13894	Susan	27	“ I do n’t want to go a step further and I wish we ’d never come . But I think we must try to do something for Mr Whatever - his - name is — I mean the Faun . ”
13938	13946	13948	13948	Peter	26	“ That ’s what I feel too , ”
13950	14007	13948	13948	Peter	26	“ I ’m worried about having no food with us . I ’d vote for going back and getting something from the larder , only there does n’t seem to be any certainty of getting into this country again when once you ’ve got out of it . I think we ’ll have to go on . ”
14008	14013	14016	14017	the girls	120	“ So do I , ”
14019	14031	14033	14033	Peter	26	“ If only we knew where the poor chap was imprisoned ! ”
14049	14095	14046	14046	Lucy	48	“ Look ! There ’s a robin , with such a red breast . It ’s the first bird I ’ve seen here . I say!—I wonder can birds talk in Narnia ? It almost looks as if it wanted to say something to us . ”
14105	14121	14097	14097	she	48	“ Please , can you tell us where Tumnus the Faun has been taken to ? ”
14227	14232	14234	14234	Lucy	48	“ Do you know , ”
14236	14247	14234	14234	Lucy	48	“ I really believe he means us to follow him . ”
14248	14256	14258	14258	Susan	27	“ I ’ve an idea he does , ”
14260	14268	14258	14258	Susan	27	“ What do you think , Peter ? ”
14269	14279	14281	14281	Peter	26	“ Well , we might as well try it , ”
14392	14419	14387	14387	Edmund	28	“ if you ’re not still too high and mighty to talk to me , I ’ve something to say which you ’d better listen to . ”
14420	14425	14427	14427	Peter	26	“ What is it ? ”
14429	14436	14438	14438	Edmund	28	“ Hush ! Not so loud , ”
14440	14458	14438	14438	Edmund	28	“ there ’s no good frightening the girls . But have you realized what we ’re doing ? ”
14459	14462	14464	14464	Peter	26	“ What ? ”
14473	14506	14438	14438	Edmund	28	“ We ’re following a guide we know nothing about . How do we know which side that bird is on ? Why should n’t it be leading us into a trap ? ”
14507	14548	14438	14438	Edmund	28	“ That ’s a nasty idea . Still — a robin , you know . They ’re good birds in all the stories I ’ve ever read . I ’m sure a robin would n’t be on the wrong side . ”
14549	14604	14438	14438	Edmund	28	“ It if comes to that , which is the right side ? How do we know that the Fauns are in the right and the Queen ( yes , I know we ’ve been told she ’s a witch ) is in the wrong ? We do n’t really know anything about either . ”
14605	14611	14438	14438	Edmund	28	“ The Faun saved Lucy . ”
14612	14643	14438	14438	Edmund	28	“ He said he did . But how do we know ? And there ’s another thing too . Has anyone the least idea of the way home from here ? ”
14644	14648	14650	14650	Peter	26	“ Great Scott ! ”
14652	14660	14650	14650	Peter	26	“ I had n’t thought of that . ”
14661	14669	14671	14671	Edmund	28	“ And no chance of dinner either , ”
14686	14689	14438	14438	Edmund	28	“ Oh ! ”
14693	14697	14699	14699	Lucy	48	“ The robin ! ”
14701	14710	14699	14699	Lucy	48	“ the robin . It ’s flown away . ”
14721	14730	14732	14732	Edmund	28	“ And now what are we to do ? ”
14745	14752	14732	14732	Edmund	28	“ What did I tell you ? ”
14753	14758	14760	14760	Susan	27	“ Sh ! Look ! ”
14762	14765	14767	14767	Peter	26	“ What ? ”
14769	14783	14732	14732	Edmund	28	“ There ’s something moving among the trees over there to the left . ”
14800	14806	14808	14808	Susan	27	“ There it goes again , ”
14811	14819	14821	14821	Peter	26	“ I saw it that time too , ”
14823	14838	14821	14821	Peter	26	“ It ’s still there . It ’s just gone behind that big tree . ”
14839	14844	14846	14846	Lucy	48	“ What is it ? ”
14856	14861	14863	14863	Peter	26	“ Whatever it is , ”
14865	14882	14863	14863	Peter	26	“ it ’s dodging us . It ’s something that does n’t want to be seen . ”
14883	14889	14891	14891	Susan	27	“ Let ’s go home , ”
14927	14933	14935	14935	Lucy	48	“ What ’s it like ? ”
14937	14947	14949	14949	Susan	27	“ It’s — it ’s a kind of animal , ”
14954	14965	14949	14949	Susan	27	“ Look ! Look ! Quick ! There it is . ”
15066	15068	15044	15045	the stranger	400	“ Hush ”
15094	15101	15103	15103	Peter	26	“ I know what it is , ”
15105	15116	15103	15103	Peter	26	“ it ’s a beaver . I saw the tail . ”
15117	15126	15128	15128	Susan	27	“ It wants us to go to it , ”
15130	15142	15128	15128	Susan	27	“ and it is warning us not to make a noise . ”
15143	15147	15149	15149	Peter	26	“ I know , ”
15151	15172	15149	15149	Peter	26	“ The question is , are we to go to it or not ? What do you think , Lu ? ”
15173	15182	15184	15184	Lucy	48	“ I think it ’s a nice beaver , ”
15186	15195	15197	15197	Edmund	28	“ Yes , but how do we know ? ”
15199	15208	15210	15210	Susan	27	“ Sha n’t we have to risk it ? ”
15212	15231	15210	15210	Susan	27	“ I mean , it ’s no good just standing here and I feel I want some dinner . ”
15252	15256	15210	15210	Susan	27	“ Come on , ”
15258	15288	15210	15210	Susan	27	Peter,“let ’s give it a try . All keep close together . We ought to be a match for one beaver if it turns out to be an enemy . ”
15333	15353	15315	15316	the Beaver	59	“ Further in , come further in . Right in here . We ’re not safe in the open ! ”
15404	15417	15591	15592	the Beaver	59	“ Are you the Sons of Adam and the Daughters of Eve ? ”
15421	15428	15430	15430	Peter	26	“ We ’re some of them , ”
15432	15441	15443	15444	the Beaver	59	“ S - s - s - sh ! ”
15446	15459	15443	15444	the Beaver	59	“ not so loud please . We ’re not safe even here . ”
15460	15469	15471	15471	Peter	26	“ Why , who are you afraid of ? ”
15473	15482	15471	15471	Peter	26	“ There ’s no one here but ourselves . ”
15483	15489	15491	15492	the Beaver	59	“ There are the trees , ”
15494	15525	15491	15492	the Beaver	59	“ They ’re always listening . Most of them are on our side , but there are trees that would betray us to her ; you know who I mean , ”
15534	15543	15545	15545	Edmund	28	“ If it comes to talking about sides , ”
15547	15557	15545	15545	Edmund	28	“ how do we know you ’re a friend ? ”
15558	15568	15570	15570	Peter	26	“ Not meaning to be rude , Mr Beaver , ”
15572	15581	15570	15570	Peter	26	“ but you see , we ’re strangers . ”
15582	15589	15591	15592	the Beaver	59	“ Quite right , quite right , ”
15594	15600	15591	15592	the Beaver	59	“ Here is my token . ”
15627	15647	15624	15624	Lucy	48	“ Oh , of course . It ’s my handkerchief — the one I gave to poor Mr Tumnus . ”
15648	15653	15655	15656	the Beaver	59	“ That ’s right , ”
15658	15698	15655	15656	the Beaver	59	“ Poor fellow , he got wind of the arrest before it actually happened and handed this over to me . He said that if anything happened to him I must meet you here and take you on to — ”
15751	15765	15780	15780	Aslan	60	“ They say Aslan is on the move — perhaps has already landed . ”
15971	15978	15980	15980	Lucy	48	“ And what about Mr Tumnus , ”
15982	15987	15980	15980	Lucy	48	“ where is he ? ”
15988	15997	15999	16000	the Beaver	59	“ S - s - s - sh , ”
16002	16021	15999	16000	the Beaver	59	“ not here . I must bring you where we can have a real talk and also dinner . ”
16048	16050	16031	16032	the beaver	415	“ dinner ”
16268	16274	16265	16265	Susan	27	“ What a lovely dam ! ”
16281	16283	16276	16277	Mr Beaver	59	“ Hush ”
16287	16303	16276	16277	Mr Beaver	59	“ Merely a trifle ! Merely a trifle ! And it is n’t really finished ! ”
16598	16608	16609	16609	he	28	“ And I wonder how Peter will like that ? ”
16621	16626	16628	16629	Mr Beaver	59	“ Here we are , ”
16631	16657	16628	16629	Mr Beaver	59	“ and it looks as if Mrs Beaver is expecting us . I ’ll lead the way . But be careful and do n’t slip . ”
16763	16771	16773	16774	Mr Beaver	59	“ Here we are , Mrs Beaver , ”
16776	16791	16773	16774	Mr Beaver	59	“ I ’ve found them . Here are the Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve”—and
16866	16874	16875	16875	she	48	“ So you ’ve come at last ! ”
16886	16926	16875	16875	she	48	“ At last ! To think that ever I should live to see this day ! The potatoes are on boiling and the kettle ’s singing and I daresay , Mr Beaver , you ’ll get us some fish . ”
16927	16932	16934	16935	Mr Beaver	59	“ That I will , ”
17302	17309	17298	17299	Mr Beaver	59	“ Now we ’re nearly ready . ”
17583	17587	17589	17590	Mr Beaver	59	“ And now , ”
17607	17639	17640	17640	he	59	“ if you ’ll just wait till I ’ve got my pipe lit up and going nicely — why , now we can get to business . It ’s snowing again , ”
17650	17686	17640	17640	he	59	“ That ’s all the better , because it means we sha n’t have any visitors ; and if anyone should have been trying to follow you , why he wo n’t find any tracks . ”
17687	17691	17693	17693	Lucy	48	“ AND now , ”
17695	17707	17693	17693	Lucy	48	“ do please tell us what ’s happened to Mr Tumnus . ”
17708	17715	17717	17718	Mr Beaver	59	“ Ah , that ’s bad , ”
17724	17757	17717	17718	Mr Beaver	59	“ That ’s a very , very bad business . There ’s no doubt he was taken off by the police . I got that from a bird who saw it done . ”
17758	17767	17769	17769	Lucy	48	“ But where ’s he been taken to ? ”
17771	17791	17717	17718	Mr Beaver	59	“ Well , they were heading northwards when they were last seen and we all know what that means . ”
17792	17799	17801	17801	Susan	27	“ No , we do n’t , ”
17814	17828	17829	17829	he	59	“ I ’m afraid it means they were taking him to her House , ”
17832	17844	17846	17846	Lucy	48	“ But what ’ll they do to him , Mr Beaver ? ”
17848	17851	17853	17854	Mr Beaver	59	“ Well , ”
17856	17905	17853	17854	Mr Beaver	59	“ you ca n’t exactly say for sure . But there ’s not many taken in there that ever comes out again . Statues . All full of statues they say it is — in the courtyard and up the stairs and in the hall . People she ’s turned”—(he
17910	17915	17853	17854	Mr Beaver	59	“ turned into stone . ”
17916	17922	17924	17924	Lucy	48	“ But , Mr Beaver , ”
17926	17953	17924	17924	Lucy	48	“ ca n’t we — I mean we must do something to save him . It ’s too dreadful and it ’s all on my account . ”
17954	17969	17971	17972	Mrs Beaver	62	“ I do n’t doubt you ’d save him if you could , dearie , ”
17974	17994	17971	17972	Mrs Beaver	62	“ but you ’ve no chance of getting into that House against her will and ever coming out alive . ”
17995	18003	18005	18005	Peter	26	“ Could n’t we have some stratagem ? ”
18007	18083	18005	18005	Peter	26	“ I mean could n’t we dress up as something , or pretend to be — oh , pedlars or anything — or watch till she was gone out — or — oh , hang it all , there must be some way . This Faun saved my sister at his own risk , Mr Beaver . We ca n’t just leave him to be — to be — to have that done to him . ”
18084	18094	18096	18097	Mr Beaver	59	“ It ’s no good , Son of Adam , ”
18099	18117	18096	18097	Mr Beaver	59	“ no good your trying , of all people . But now that Aslan is on the move- ”
18118	18128	17971	17972	Mrs Beaver	62	“ Oh , yes ! Tell us about Aslan ! ”
18158	18163	18165	18165	Susan	27	“ Who is Aslan ? ”
18167	18170	18172	18173	Mr Beaver	59	“ Aslan ? ”
18175	18257	18172	18173	Mr Beaver	59	“ Why , do n’t you know ? He ’s the King . He ’s the Lord of the whole wood , but not often here , you understand . Never in my time or my father ’s time . But the word has reached us that he has come back . He is in Narnia at this moment . He ’ll settle the White Queen all right . It is he , not you , that will save Mr Tumnus . ”
18258	18268	18270	18270	Edmund	28	“ She wo n’t turn him into stone too ? ”
18272	18288	18290	18291	Mr Beaver	59	“ Lord love you , Son of Adam , what a simple thing to say ! ”
18297	18353	18290	18291	Mr Beaver	59	“ Turn him into stone ? If she can stand on her two feet and look him in the face it ’ll be the most she can do and more than I expect of her . No , no . He ’ll put all to rights as it says in an old rhyme in these parts :
18410	18410	18402	18402	You	472	”
18411	18418	18420	18420	Susan	27	“ But shall we see him ? ”
18422	18449	18451	18452	Mr Beaver	59	“ Why , Daughter of Eve , that ’s what I brought you here for . I ’m to lead you where you shall meet him , ”
18454	18462	18464	18464	Lucy	48	“ Is - is he a man ? ”
18466	18471	18473	18474	Mr Beaver	59	“ Aslan a man ! ”
18477	18528	18473	18474	Mr Beaver	59	“ Certainly not . I tell you he is the King of the wood and the son of the great Emperor - beyond - the - Sea . Do n’t you know who is the King of Beasts ? Aslan is a lion — the Lion , the great Lion . ”
18529	18532	18534	18534	Susan	27	“ Ooh ! ”
18536	18561	18534	18534	Susan	27	“ I ’d thought he was a man . Is he — quite safe ? I shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion . ”
18562	18573	18575	18576	Mrs Beaver	62	“ That you will , dearie , and no mistake , ”
18578	18604	18575	18576	Mrs Beaver	62	“ if there ’s anyone who can appear before Aslan without their knees knocking , they ’re either braver than most or else just silly . ”
18605	18612	18614	18614	Lucy	48	“ Then he is n’t safe ? ”
18616	18619	18621	18622	Mr Beaver	59	“ Safe ? ”
18624	18662	18621	18622	Mr Beaver	59	“ do n’t you hear what Mrs Beaver tells you ? Who said anything about safe ? ’ Course he is n’t safe . But he ’s good . He ’s the King , I tell you . ”
18663	18671	18673	18673	Peter	26	“ I ’m longing to see him , ”
18675	18689	18673	18673	Peter	26	“ even if I do feel frightened when it comes to the point . ”
18690	18699	18701	18702	Mr Beaver	59	“ That ’s right , Son of Adam , ”
18723	18750	18705	18705	his	59	“ And so you shall . Word has been sent that you are to meet him , tomorrow if you can , at the Stone Table . ”
18751	18756	18758	18758	Lucy	48	“ Where ’s that ? ”
18760	18766	18768	18769	Mr Beaver	59	“ I ’ll show you , ”
18771	18791	18768	18769	Mr Beaver	59	“ It ’s down the river , a good step from here . I ’ll take you to it ! ”
18792	18801	18803	18803	Lucy	48	“ But meanwhile what about poor Mr Tumnus ? ”
18805	18820	18822	18823	Mr Beaver	59	“ The quickest way you can help him is by going to meet Aslan , ”
18825	18856	18822	18823	Mr Beaver	59	“ once he ’s with us , then we can begin doing things . Not that we do n’t need you too . For that ’s another of the old rhymes :
18929	18929	19078	19079	Mrs Beaver	62	”
18930	18942	18944	18944	Peter	26	“ That ’s what I do n’t understand , Mr Beaver , ”
18946	18956	18944	18944	Peter	26	“ I mean is n’t the Witch herself human ? ”
18957	18966	18968	18969	Mr Beaver	59	“ She ’d like us to believe it , ”
18971	18999	18968	18969	Mr Beaver	59	“ and it ’s on that that she bases her claim to be Queen . But she ’s no Daughter of Eve . She comes of your father Adam’s”—(here
19004	19062	18968	18969	Mr Beaver	59	“ your father Adam ’s first wife , her they called Lilith . And she was one of the Jinn . That ’s what she comes from on one side . And on the other she comes of the giants . No , no , there is n’t a drop of real human blood in the Witch . ”
19063	19076	19078	19079	Mrs Beaver	62	“ That ’s why she ’s bad all through , Mr Beaver , ”
19081	19088	19090	19090	he	478	“ True enough , Mrs Beaver , ”
19092	19126	19090	19090	he	478	“ there may be two views about humans ( meaning no offence to the present company ) . But there ’s no two views about things that look like humans and are n’t . ”
19127	19134	19136	19137	Mrs Beaver	62	“ I ’ve known good Dwarfs , ”
19139	19151	19153	19154	her husband	479	“ So’ve I , now you come to speak of it , ”
19156	19269	19153	19154	her husband	479	“ but precious few , and they were the ones least like men . But in general , take my advice , when you meet anything that ’s going to be human and is n’t yet , or used to be human once and is n’t now , or ought to be human and is n’t , you keep your eyes on it and feel for your hatchet . And that ’s why the Witch is always on the lookout for any humans in Narnia . She ’s been watching for you this many a year , and if she knew there were four of you she ’d be more dangerous still . ”
19270	19279	19281	19281	Peter	26	“ What ’s that to do with it ? ”
19283	19289	19291	19292	Mr Beaver	59	“ Because of another prophecy , ”
19294	19423	19291	19292	Mr Beaver	59	“ Down at Cair Paravel — that ’s the castle on the sea coast down at the mouth of this river which ought to be the capital of the whole country if all was as it should be — down at Cair Paravel there are four thrones and it ’s a saying in Narnia time out of mind that when two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve sit in those four thrones , then it will be the end not only of the White Witch ’s reign but of her life , and that is why we had to be so cautious as we came along , for if she knew about you four , your lives would n’t be worth a shake of my whiskers ! ”
19466	19474	19462	19462	Lucy	48	“ I say - where ’s Edmund ? ”
19486	19503	19483	19483	everyone	133	“ Who saw him last ? How long has he been missing ? Is he outside ? ”
19581	19586	19587	19587	they	464	“ Edmund ! Edmund ! ”
19614	19619	19621	19621	Susan	27	“ How perfectly dreadful ! ”
19631	19642	19621	19621	Susan	27	“ Oh , how I wish we ’d never come . ”
19643	19655	19657	19657	Peter	26	“ What on earth are we to do , Mr Beaver ? ”
19659	19662	19664	19665	Mr Beaver	59	“ Do ? ”
19677	19695	19664	19665	Mr Beaver	59	“ do ? We must be off at once . We have n’t a moment to spare ! ”
19696	19706	19708	19708	Peter	26	“ We ’d better divide into four search parties , ”
19710	19728	19708	19708	Peter	26	“ and all go in different directions . Whoever finds him must come back here at once and- ”
19729	19737	19739	19740	Mr Beaver	59	“ Search parties , Son of Adam ? ”
19742	19746	19739	19740	Mr Beaver	59	“ what for ? ”
19747	19758	19664	19665	Mr Beaver	59	“ Why , to look for Edmund , of course ! ”
19759	19769	19771	19772	Mr Beaver	59	“ There ’s no point in looking for him , ”
19774	19780	19782	19782	Susan	27	“ What do you mean ? ”
19784	19816	19782	19782	Susan	27	“ He ca n’t be far away yet . And we ’ve got to find him . What do you mean when you say there ’s no use looking for him ? ”
19817	19826	19828	19829	Mr Beaver	59	“ The reason there ’s no use looking , ”
19831	19842	19828	19829	Mr Beaver	59	“ is that we know already where he ’s gone ! ”
19848	19854	19856	19857	Mr Beaver	59	“ Do n’t you understand ? ”
19859	19877	19856	19857	Mr Beaver	59	“ He ’s gone to her , to the White Witch . He has betrayed us all . ”
19878	19887	19889	19889	Susan	27	“ Oh , surely - oh , really ! ”
19891	19899	19889	19889	Susan	27	“ he ca n’t have done that . ”
19900	19905	19907	19908	Mr Beaver	59	“ Ca n’t he ? ”
19945	19953	19955	19955	Peter	26	“ But will he know the way ? ”
19957	19966	19968	19969	Mr Beaver	59	“ Has he been in this country before ? ”
19971	19979	19968	19969	Mr Beaver	59	“ Has he ever been here alone ? ”
19980	19983	19985	19985	Lucy	48	“ Yes , ”
19992	19999	19985	19985	Lucy	48	“ I ’m afraid he has . ”
20000	20016	19968	19969	Mr Beaver	59	“ And did he tell you what he ’d done or who he ’d met ? ”
20017	20026	20028	20028	Lucy	48	“ Well , no , he did n’t , ”
20030	20036	20038	20039	Mr Beaver	59	“ Then mark my words , ”
20041	20131	20038	20039	Mr Beaver	59	“ he has already met the White Witch and joined her side , and been told where she lives . I did n’t like to mention it before ( he being your brother and all ) but the moment I set eyes on that brother of yours I said to myself ` Treacherous ’ . He had the look of one who has been with the Witch and eaten her food . You can always tell them if you ’ve lived long in Narnia ; something about their eyes . ”
20132	20137	20139	20139	Peter	26	“ All the same , ”
20148	20183	20139	20139	Peter	26	“ we ’ll still have to go and look for him . He is our brother after all , even if he is rather a little beast . And he ’s only a kid . ”
20184	20192	20194	20195	Mrs Beaver	62	“ Go to the Witch ’s House ? ”
20197	20219	20194	20195	Mrs Beaver	62	“ Do n’t you see that the only chance of saving either him or yourselves is to keep away from her ? ”
20220	20226	20228	20228	Lucy	48	“ How do you mean ? ”
20230	20330	20228	20228	Lucy	48	“ Why , all she wants is to get all four of you ( she ’s thinking all the time of those four thrones at Cair Paravel ) . Once you were all four inside her House her job would be done — and there ’d be four new statues in her collection before you ’d had time to speak . But she ’ll keep him alive as long as he ’s the only one she ’s got , because she ’ll want to use him as a decoy ; as bait to catch the rest of you with . ”
20331	20340	20342	20342	Lucy	48	“ Oh , can no one help us ? ”
20344	20348	20350	20351	Mr Beaver	59	“ Only Aslan , ”
20353	20369	20350	20351	Mr Beaver	59	“ we must go on and meet him . That ’s our only chance now . ”
20370	20379	20381	20382	Mrs Beaver	62	“ It seems to me , my dears , ”
20384	20467	20381	20382	Mrs Beaver	62	“ that it is very important to know just when he slipped away . How much he can tell her depends on how much he heard . For instance , had we started talking of Aslan before he left ? If not , then we may do very well , for she wo n’t know that Aslan has come to Narnia , or that we are meeting him , and will be quite off her guard as far as that is concerned . ”
20468	20483	20485	20485	Peter	26	“ I do n’t remember his being here when we were talking about Aslan — ”
20492	20499	20500	20500	she	48	“ Oh yes , he was , ”
20504	20526	20500	20500	she	48	“ do n’t you remember , it was he who asked whether the Witch could n’t turn Aslan into stone too ? ”
20527	20535	20537	20537	Peter	26	“ So he did , by Jove , ”
20539	20551	20537	20537	Peter	26	“ just the sort of thing he would say , too ! ”
20552	20557	20559	20560	Mr Beaver	59	“ Worse and worse , ”
20562	20589	20559	20560	Mr Beaver	59	“ and the next thing is this . Was he still here when I told you that the place for meeting Aslan was the Stone Table ? ”
20602	20609	20611	20612	Mr Beaver	59	“ Because , if he was , ”
20614	20650	20611	20612	Mr Beaver	59	“ then she ’ll simply sledge down in that direction and get between us and the Stone Table and catch us on our way down . In fact we shall be cut off from Aslan . ”
20651	20662	20664	20665	Mrs Beaver	62	“ But that is n’t what she ’ll do first , ”
20667	20717	20664	20665	Mrs Beaver	62	“ not if I know her . The moment that Edmund tells her that we ’re all here she ’ll set out to catch us this very night , and if he ’s been gone about half an hour , she ’ll be here in about another twenty minutes . ”
20718	20726	20728	20729	her husband	479	“ You ’re right , Mrs Beaver , ”
20731	20748	20728	20729	her husband	479	“ we must all get away from here . There ’s not a moment to lose . ”
21112	21115	21116	21116	he	28	“ Because , ”
21121	21178	21116	21116	he	28	“ all these people who say nasty things about her are her enemies and probably half of it is n’t true . She was jolly nice to me , anyway , much nicer than they are . I expect she is the rightful Queen really . Anyway , she ’ll be better than that awful Aslan ! ”
21492	21513	21483	21483	he	28	“ When I ’m King of Narnia the first thing I shall do will be to make some decent roads . ”
22248	22256	22258	22258	Edmund	28	“ But supposing it turns its head ? ”
22286	22289	22291	22291	Edmund	28	“ Aha ! ”
22293	22308	22291	22291	Edmund	28	“ When it springs at the dwarf then will be my chance to escape . ”
22501	22504	22505	22505	he	28	“ Probably , ”
22508	22554	22505	22505	he	28	“ this is the great Lion Aslan that they were all talking about . She ’s caught him already and turned him into stone . So that ’s the end of all their fine ideas about him ! Pooh ! Who ’s afraid of Aslan ? ”
22610	22635	22607	22607	he	28	“ Yah ! Silly old Aslan ! How do you like being a stone ? You thought yourself mighty fine , did n’t you ? ”
22944	22955	22956	22956	he	28	“ It ’s all right , it ’s all right , ”
22962	22975	22956	22956	he	28	“ it ’s only a stone wolf . It ca n’t hurt me ”
23015	23036	23125	23126	the Wolf	558	“ Who ’s there ? Who ’s there ? Stand still , stranger , and tell me who you are . ”
23037	23044	23046	23046	Edmund	28	“ If you please , sir , ”
23056	23115	23046	23046	Edmund	28	“ my name is Edmund , and I ’m the Son of Adam that Her Majesty met in the wood the other day and I ’ve come to bring her the news that my brother and sisters are now in Narnia — quite close , in the Beavers ’ house . She — she wanted to see them . ”
23116	23123	23125	23126	the Wolf	558	“ I will tell Her Majesty , ”
23128	23143	23125	23126	the Wolf	558	“ Meanwhile , stand still on the threshold , as you value your life . ”
23192	23211	23175	23175	Maugrim	54	“ Come in ! Come in ! Fortunate favourite of the Queen — or else not so fortunate . ”
23301	23309	23311	23311	Edmund	28	“ I ’m come , your Majesty , ”
23317	23324	23326	23327	the Witch	1271	“ How dare you come alone ? ”
23333	23346	23326	23327	the Witch	1271	“ Did I not tell you to bring the others with you ? ”
23347	23353	23355	23355	Edmund	28	“ Please , your Majesty , ”
23357	23393	23355	23355	Edmund	28	“ I ’ve done the best I can . I ’ve brought them quite close . They ’re in the little house on top of the dam just up the riverwith Mr and Mrs Beaver . ”
23405	23412	23413	23413	she	43	“ Is this all your news ? ”
23416	23422	23424	23424	Edmund	28	“ No , your Majesty , ”
23442	23447	23449	23450	the Queen	249	“ What ! Aslan ? ”
23452	23468	23449	23450	the Queen	249	“ Aslan ! Is this true ? If I find you have lied to me — ”
23469	23480	23482	23482	Edmund	28	“ Please , I ’m only repeating what they said , ”
23513	23519	23521	23522	the Witch	1271	“ Make ready our sledge , ”
23524	23532	23521	23522	the Witch	1271	“ and use the harness without bells . ”
23556	23564	23552	23553	Mr Beaver	59	“ There ’s no time to lose , ”
23590	23638	23573	23574	Mrs Beaver	62	“ Now , Mr Beaver , just reach down that ham . And here ’s a packet of tea , and there ’s sugar , and some matches . And if someone will get two or three loaves out of the crock over there in the corner . ”
23639	23648	23650	23650	Susan	27	“ What are you doing , Mrs Beaver ? ”
23652	23663	23665	23666	Mrs Beaver	62	“ Packing a load for each of us , dearie , ”
23670	23690	23665	23666	Mrs Beaver	62	“ You did n’t think we ’d set out on a journey with nothing to eat , did you ? ”
23691	23698	23700	23700	Susan	27	“ But we have n’t time ! ”
23709	23717	23700	23700	Susan	27	“ She may be here any minute . ”
23718	23725	23728	23729	Mr Beaver	59	“ That ’s what I say , ”
23731	23738	23740	23741	his wife	576	“ Get along with you all , ”
23743	23764	23740	23741	his wife	576	“ Think it over , Mr Beaver . She ca n’t be here for quarter of an hour at least . ”
23765	23781	23783	23783	Peter	26	“ But do n’t we want as big a start as we can possibly get , ”
23785	23797	23783	23783	Peter	26	“ if we ’re to reach the Stone Table before her ? ”
23798	23809	23811	23811	Susan	27	“ You ’ve got to remember that , Mrs Beaver , ”
23813	23835	23811	23811	Susan	27	“ As soon as she has looked in here and finds we ’re gone she ’ll be off at top speed . ”
23836	23841	23843	23844	Mrs Beaver	62	“ That she will , ”
23846	23872	23843	23844	Mrs Beaver	62	“ But we ca n’t get there before her whatever we do , for she ’ll be on a sledge and we ’ll be walking . ”
23873	23881	23883	23883	Susan	27	“ Then — have we no hope ? ”
23885	23898	23900	23901	Mrs Beaver	62	“ Now do n’t you get fussing , there ’s a dear , ”
23903	23953	23900	23901	Mrs Beaver	62	“ but just get half a dozen clean handkerchiefs out of the drawer . ’ Course we ’ve got a hope . We ca n’t get there before her but we can keep under cover and go by ways she wo n’t expect and perhaps we ’ll get through . ”
23954	23963	23965	23966	her husband	479	“ That ’s true enough , Mrs Beaver , ”
23968	23979	23965	23966	her husband	479	“ But it ’s time we were out of this . ”
23980	23992	23994	23995	his wife	576	“ And do n’t you start fussing either , Mr Beaver , ”
23997	24024	24025	24025	she	576	“ There . That ’s better . There ’s five loads and the smallest for the smallest of us : that ’s you , my dear , ”
24032	24040	24042	24042	Lucy	48	“ Oh , do please come on , ”
24044	24053	24055	24056	Mrs Beaver	62	“ Well , I ’m nearly ready now , ”
24073	24085	24055	24056	Mrs Beaver	62	“ I suppose the sewing machine ’s took heavy to bring ? ”
24086	24092	24094	24095	Mr Beaver	59	“ Yes . It is , ”
24097	24126	24094	24095	Mr Beaver	59	“ A great deal too heavy . And you do n’t think you ’ll be able to use it while we ’re on the run , I suppose ? ”
24127	24141	24143	24144	Mrs Beaver	62	“ I ca n’t abide the thought of that Witch fiddling with it , ”
24146	24159	24143	24144	Mrs Beaver	62	“ and breaking it or stealing it , as likely as not . ”
24160	24172	24174	24176	the three children	489	“ Oh , please , please , please , do hurry ! ”
24193	24201	24202	24202	he	59	“ It ’ll delay her a bit , ”
24316	24326	24327	24327	he	59	“ Best keep down here as much as possible , ”
24330	24350	24327	24327	he	59	“ She ’ll have to keep to the top , for you could n’t bring a sledge down here . ”
24645	24650	24652	24652	Peter	26	“ Wherever is this ? ”
24679	24693	24695	24696	Mr Beaver	59	“ It ’s an old hiding - place for beavers in bad times , ”
24698	24721	24695	24696	Mr Beaver	59	“ and a great secret . It ’s not much of a place but we must get a few hours ’ sleep . ”
24722	24746	24748	24749	Mrs Beaver	62	“ If you had n’t all been in such a plaguey fuss when we were starting , I ’d have brought some pillows , ”
25123	25126	25128	25128	Lucy	48	“ Oh , ”
25130	25141	25128	25128	Lucy	48	“ he ’s been seen . She ’s caught him ! ”
25166	25172	25173	25173	he	59	“ It ’s all right , ”
25177	25203	25173	25173	he	59	“ Come out , Mrs Beaver . Come out , Sons and Daughters of Adam . It ’s all right ! It is n’t Her ! ”
25281	25285	25287	25288	Mr Beaver	59	“ Come on ! ”
25297	25321	25287	25288	Mr Beaver	59	“ Come and see ! This is a nasty knock for the Witch ! It looks as if her power is already crumbling . ”
25322	25331	25333	25333	Peter	26	“ What do you mean , Mr Beaver ? ”
25347	25354	25356	25357	Mr Beaver	59	“ Did n’t I tell you , ”
25359	25384	25356	25357	Mr Beaver	59	“ that she ’d made it always winter and never Christmas ? Did n’t I tell you ? Well , just come and see ! ”
25609	25616	25618	25618	he	614	“ I ’ve come at last , ”
25620	25652	25618	25618	he	614	“ She has kept me out for a long time , but I have got in at last . Aslan is on the move . The Witch ’s magic is weakening . ”
25676	25680	25682	25683	Father Christmas	50	“ And now , ”
25685	25716	25682	25683	Father Christmas	50	“ for your presents . There is a new and better sewing machine for you , Mrs Beaver . I will drop it in your house as , I pass . ”
25717	25724	25726	25727	Mrs Beaver	62	“ If you please , sir , ”
25733	25739	25726	25727	Mrs Beaver	62	“ It ’s locked up . ”
25740	25750	25752	25753	Father Christmas	50	“ Locks and bolts make no difference to me , ”
25755	25787	25752	25753	Father Christmas	50	“ And as for you , Mr Beaver , when you get home you will find your dam finished and mended and all the leaks stopped and a new sluicegate fitted . ”
25811	25818	25820	25821	Father Christmas	50	“ Peter , Adam ’s Son , ”
25823	25828	25830	25830	Peter	26	“ Here , sir , ”
25832	25838	25870	25870	he	26	“ These are your presents , ”
25843	25866	25870	25870	he	26	“ and they are tools not toys . The time to use them is perhaps near at hand . Bear them well . ”
25969	25976	25978	25979	Father Christmas	50	“ Susan , Eve ’s Daughter , ”
25981	25987	25989	25989	he	26	“ These are for you , ”
26006	26017	26018	26018	he	26	“ You must use the bow only in great need , ”
26021	26071	26018	26018	he	26	“ for I do not mean you to fight in the battle . It does not easily miss . And when you put this horn to your lips ; and blow it , then , wherever you are , I think help of some kind will come to you . ”
26078	26085	26075	26075	he	26	“ Lucy , Eve ’s Daughter , ”
26119	26124	26125	26125	he	26	“ In this bottle , ”
26128	26189	26125	26125	he	26	“ there is cordial made of the juice of one of the fireflowers that grow in the mountains of the sun . If you or any of your friends is hurt , a few drops of this restore them . And the dagger is to defend yourse at great need . For you also are not to be in battle . ”
26190	26195	26197	26197	Lucy	48	“ Why , sir ? ”
26199	26216	26197	26197	Lucy	48	“ I think — I do n’t know but I think I could be brave enough . ”
26217	26224	26225	26225	he	26	“ That is not the point , ”
26228	26238	26239	26239	he	26	“ But battles are ugly when women fight . And now”—here
26243	26253	26239	26239	he	26	grave—“here is something for the moment for you all ! ”
26312	26322	26309	26309	he	26	“ Merry Christmas ! Long live the true King ! ”
26373	26422	26369	26370	Mrs Beaver	62	“ Now then , now then ! Do n’t stand talking there till the tea ’s got cold . Just like men . Come and help to carry the tray down and we ’ll have breakfast . What a mercy I thought of bringing the bread - knife . ”
26472	26480	26468	26469	Mr Beaver	59	“ Time to be moving on now . ”
26541	26560	26561	26561	she	1271	“ Please , your Majesty , could I have some Turkish Delight ? You — you — said — ”
26564	26569	26561	26561	she	1271	“ Silence , fool ! ”
26586	26602	26571	26571	she	1271	“ And yet it will not do to have the brat fainting on the way , ”
26615	26624	26625	26625	she	1271	“ Bring the human creature food and drink , ”
26676	26690	26664	26664	he	243	“ Turkish Delight for the little Prince . Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! ”
26691	26696	26698	26698	Edmund	28	“ Take it away , ”
26701	26709	26698	26698	Edmund	28	“ I do n’t want dry bread . ”
26750	26764	26766	26767	the Witch	1271	“ You may be glad enough of it before you taste bread again , ”
26855	26875	26877	26878	the Witch	1271	“ Take with you the swiftest of your wolves and go at once to the house of the Beavers , ”
26880	26961	26877	26878	the Witch	1271	“ and kill whatever you find there . If they are already gone , then make all speed to the Stone Table , but do not be seen . Wait for me there in hiding . I meanwhile must go many miles to the West before I find a place where I can drive across the river . You may overtake these humans before they reach the Stone Table . You will know what to do if you find them ! ”
26962	26971	26973	26974	the Wolf	558	“ I hear and obey , O Queen , ”
27391	27399	27387	27388	the Witch	1271	“ What have we here ? Stop ! ”
27609	27617	27619	27621	the Witch Queen	668	“ What is the meaning of this ? ”
27626	27631	27632	27632	she	668	“ Speak , vermin ! ”
27636	27675	27632	27632	she	668	“ Or do you want my dwarf to find you a tongue with his whip ? What is the meaning of all this gluttony , this waste , this selfindulgence ? Where did you get all these things ? ”
27676	27682	27684	27685	the Fox	72	“ Please , your Majesty , ”
27687	27710	27684	27685	the Fox	72	“ we were given them . And if I might make so bold as to drink your Majesty ’s very good health — ”
27711	27718	27720	27721	the Witch	1271	“ Who gave them to you ? ”
27723	27733	27735	27736	the Fox	72	“ F - F - F - Father Christmas , ”
27738	27741	27743	27744	the Witch	1271	“ What ? ”
27761	27795	27743	27744	the Witch	1271	“ He has not been here ! He can not have been here ! How dare you — but no . Say you have been lying and you shall even now be forgiven . ”
27809	27819	27833	27834	the Witch	1271	“ He has — he has — he has ! ”
27856	27869	27871	27871	Edmund	28	“ Oh , do n’t , do n’t , please do n’t , ”
27931	27936	27938	27939	the Witch	1271	“ As for you , ”
27957	27973	27938	27939	the Witch	1271	“ let that teach you to ask favour for spies and traitors . Drive on ! ”
28422	28435	28418	28419	the Witch	1271	“ Do n’t sit staring , fool ! Get out and help . ”
28579	28588	28590	28591	the dwarf	243	“ It ’s no good , your Majesty , ”
28593	28602	28590	28591	the dwarf	243	“ We ca n’t sledge in this thaw . ”
28603	28609	28611	28612	the Witch	1271	“ Then we must walk , ”
28614	28622	28624	28625	the dwarf	243	“ We shall never overtake them walking , ”
28627	28636	28624	28625	the dwarf	243	“ Not with the start they ’ve got . ”
28637	28646	28648	28649	the Witch	1271	“ Are you my councillor or my slave ? ”
28651	28698	28648	28649	the Witch	1271	“ Do as you ’re told . Tie the hands of the human creature behind it and keep hold of the end of the rope . And take your whip . And cut the harness of the reindeer ; they ’ll find their own way home . ”
28770	28775	28759	28760	The Witch	1271	“ Faster ! Faster ! ”
28931	28937	28939	28940	the dwarf	243	“ Mind your own business ! ”
29121	29126	29128	29129	the Witch	1271	“ Faster ! Faster ! ”
29250	29256	29258	29259	the dwarf	243	“ This is no thaw , ”
29264	29291	29258	29259	the dwarf	243	“ This is Spring . What are we to do ? Your winter has been destroyed , I tell you ! This is Aslan ’s doing . ”
29292	29302	29304	29305	the Witch	1271	“ If either of you mention that name again , ”
29307	29314	29304	29305	the Witch	1271	“ he shall instantly be killed . ”
29368	29376	29359	29359	they	704	“ Look ! there ’s a kingfisher , ”
29378	29384	29359	29359	they	704	“ I say , bluebells ! ”
29386	29393	29359	29359	they	704	“ What was that lovely smell ? ”
29395	29402	29359	29359	they	704	“ Just listen to that thrush ! ”
29776	29781	29783	29784	Mr Beaver	59	“ Not long now , ”
29916	29920	29922	29922	Peter	26	“ By gum ! ”
29926	29930	29922	29922	Peter	26	“ the sea ! ”
30364	30368	30370	30371	Mr Beaver	59	“ Go on , ”
30373	30376	30378	30378	Peter	26	“ No , ”
30380	30384	30378	30378	Peter	26	“ you first . ”
30385	30394	30396	30397	Mr Beaver	59	“ No , Sons of Adam before animals , ”
30401	30404	30406	30406	Peter	26	“ Susan , ”
30408	30416	30406	30406	Peter	26	“ What about you ? Ladies first . ”
30417	30425	30427	30427	Susan	27	“ No , you ’re the eldest , ”
30473	30481	30482	30482	he	26	“ Come on . Pull yourselves together , ”
30490	30497	30482	30482	he	26	“ We have come — Aslan . ”
30498	30507	30509	30509	Aslan	60	“ Welcome , Peter , Son of Adam , ”
30511	30531	30509	30509	Aslan	60	“ Welcome , Susan and Lucy , Daughters of Eve . Welcome He - Beaver and She - Beaver . ”
30567	30574	30576	30576	Aslan	60	“ But where is the fourth ? ”
30578	30594	30596	30597	Mr Beaver	59	“ He has tried to betray them and joined the White Witch , O Aslan , ”
30606	30630	30603	30603	Peter	26	“ That was partly my fault , Aslan . I was angry with him and I think that helped him to go wrong . ”
30670	30675	30677	30677	Lucy	48	“ Please — Aslan , ”
30679	30688	30677	30677	Lucy	48	“ can anything be done to save Edmund ? ”
30689	30695	30697	30697	Aslan	60	“ All shall be done , ”
30699	30709	30697	30697	Aslan	60	“ But it may be harder than you think . ”
30772	30776	30778	30778	Lucy	48	“ Terrible paws , ”
30780	30791	30778	30778	Lucy	48	“ if he did n’t know how to velvet them ! ”
30796	30820	30761	30762	The Lion	75	“ Meanwhile , let the feast be prepared . Ladies , take these Daughters of Eve to the pavilion and minister to them . ”
30848	30875	30826	30826	Aslan	60	“ Come , Son of Adam , and I will show you a far - off sight of the castle where you are to be King . ”
31058	31064	31066	31066	Aslan	60	“ That , O Man , ”
31068	31110	31066	31066	Aslan	60	“ is Cair Paravel of the four thrones , in one of which you must sit as King . I show it to you because you are the first - born and you will be High King over all the rest . ”
31139	31147	31149	31149	Aslan	60	“ It is your sister ’s horn , ”
31208	31218	31219	31219	he	26	“ Back ! Let the Prince win his spurs , ”
31726	31731	31736	31736	Aslan	60	“ Quick ! Quick ! ”
31738	31793	31736	31736	Aslan	60	“ Centaurs ! Eagles ! I see another wolf in the thickets . There — behind you . He has just darted away . After him , all of you . He will be going to his mistress . Now is your chance to find the Witch and rescue the fourth Son of Adam . ”
31834	31843	31845	31845	Aslan	60	“ You have forgotten to clean your sword , ”
31895	31907	31909	31909	Aslan	60	“ Hand it to me and kneel , Son of Adam , ”
31929	31951	31917	31917	he	26	“ Rise up , Sir Peter Wolf’s - Bane . And , whatever happens , never forget to wipe your sword . ”
32056	32059	32061	32062	the dwarf	243	“ No , ”
32064	32084	32061	32062	the dwarf	243	“ it is no use now , O Queen . They must have reached the Stone Table by now . ”
32085	32098	32100	32101	the Witch	1271	“ Perhaps the Wolf will smell us out and bring us news , ”
32103	32114	32116	32117	the dwarf	243	“ It can not be good news if he does , ”
32119	32126	32128	32129	the Witch	1271	“ Four thrones in Cair Paravel , ”
32131	32146	32128	32129	the Witch	1271	“ How if only three were filled ? That would not fulfil the prophecy . ”
32147	32159	32161	32162	the dwarf	243	“ What difference would that make now that He is here ? ”
32182	32201	32128	32129	the Witch	1271	“ He may not stay long . And then — we would fall upon the three at Cair . ”
32202	32209	32211	32212	the dwarf	243	“ Yet it might be better , ”
32214	32219	32222	32222	he	243	“ to keep this one ”
32226	32231	32222	32222	he	243	“ for bargaining with . ”
32232	32240	32242	32243	the Witch	1271	“ Yes ! and have him rescued , ”
32246	32249	32251	32252	the dwarf	243	“ Then , ”
32254	32267	32251	32252	the dwarf	243	“ we had better do what we have to do at once . ”
32268	32282	32284	32285	the Witch	1271	“ I would like to have it done on the Stone Table itself , ”
32287	32304	32284	32285	the Witch	1271	“ That is the proper place . That is where it has always been done before . ”
32305	32326	32328	32329	the dwarf	243	“ It will be a long time now before the Stone Table can again be put to its proper use , ”
32331	32334	32336	32337	the Witch	43	“ True , ”
32342	32349	32336	32337	the Witch	43	“ Well , I will begin . ”
32366	32415	32359	32360	a Wolf	804	“ I have seen them . They are all at the Stone Table , with Him . They have killed my captain , Maugrim . I was hidden in the thickets and saw it all . One of the Sons of Adam killed him . Fly ! Fly ! ”
32416	32419	32421	32422	the Witch	1271	“ No , ”
32424	32541	32421	32422	the Witch	1271	“ There need be no flying . Go quickly . Summon all our people to meet me here as speedily as they can . Call out the giants and the werewolves and the spirits of those trees who are on our side . Call the Ghouls , and the Boggles , the Ogres and the Minotaurs . Call the Cruels , the Hags , the Spectres , and the people of the Toadstools . We will fight . What ? Have I not still my wand ? Will not their ranks turn into stone even as they come on ? Be off quickly , I have a little thing to finish here while you are away . ”
32555	32558	32559	32559	she	808	“ Now ! ”
32562	32584	32559	32559	she	808	“ we have no table — let me see . We had better put it against the trunk of a tree . ”
32662	32667	32670	32671	the Witch	1271	“ Prepare the victim , ”
32805	32830	32850	32850	they	815	“ Let him lie down — give him some wine — drink this — steady now — you’ll be all right in a minute . ”
32855	32862	32850	32850	they	815	“ Who ’s got the Witch ? ”
32863	32870	32850	32850	they	815	“ I thought you had her . ”
32871	32902	32850	32850	they	815	“ I did n’t see her after I knocked the knife out of her hand — I was after the dwarf — do you mean to say she ’s escaped ? ”
32903	32929	32850	32850	they	815	“ — A chap ca n’t mind everything at once — what ’s that ? Oh , sorry , it ’s only an old stump ! ”
33331	33337	33338	33338	he	60	“ Here is your brother , ”
33341	33357	33338	33338	he	60	“ and — there is no need to talk to him about what is past . ”
33375	33380	33358	33358	Edmund	28	“ I ’m sorry , ”
33385	33391	33382	33382	everyone	133	“ That ’s all right . ”
33454	33468	33447	33448	the leopards	840	“ Sire , there is a messenger from the enemy who craves audience . ”
33469	33474	33476	33476	Aslan	60	“ Let him approach , ”
33491	33501	33503	33503	Aslan	60	“ What is your message , Son of Earth ? ”
33505	33527	33529	33530	the dwarf	243	“ The Queen of Narnia and Empress of the Lone Islands desires a safe conduct to come and speak with you , ”
33532	33547	33529	33530	the dwarf	243	“ on a matter which is as much to your advantage as to hers . ”
33548	33555	33557	33558	Mr Beaver	59	“ Queen of Narnia , indeed ! ”
33560	33566	33557	33558	Mr Beaver	59	“ Of all the cheek — ”
33567	33572	33574	33574	Aslan	60	“ Peace , Beaver , ”
33576	33626	33574	33574	Aslan	60	“ All names will soon be restored to their proper owners . In the meantime we will not dispute about them . Tell your mistress , Son of Earth , that I grant her safe conduct on condition that she leaves her wand behind her at that great oak . ”
33649	33660	33662	33662	Lucy	48	“ But supposing she turns the two leopards into stone ? ”
33712	33719	33721	33721	Peter	26	“ It ’ll be all right , ”
33725	33736	33721	33721	Peter	26	“ He would n’t send them if it were n’t . ”
33866	33875	33877	33878	the Witch	1271	“ You have a traitor there , Aslan , ”
33933	33936	33938	33938	Aslan	60	“ Well , ”
33940	33948	33938	33938	Aslan	60	“ His offence was not against you . ”
33949	33957	33959	33960	the Witch	1271	“ Have you forgotten the Deep Magic ? ”
33962	33971	33973	33973	Aslan	60	“ Let us say I have forgotten it , ”
33976	33984	33973	33973	Aslan	60	“ Tell us of this Deep Magic . ”
33985	33989	33991	33992	the Witch	1271	“ Tell you ? ”
34000	34098	33991	33992	the Witch	1271	“ Tell you what is written on that very Table of Stone which stands beside us ? Tell you what is written in letters deep as a spear is long on the firestones on the Secret Hill ? Tell you what is engraved on the sceptre of the Emperor - beyond - the - Sea ? You at least know the Magic which the Emperor put into Narnia at the very beginning . You know that every traitor belongs to me as my lawful prey and that for every treachery I have a right to a kill . ”
34099	34102	34104	34105	Mr Beaver	59	“ Oh , ”
34107	34131	34104	34105	Mr Beaver	59	“ So that ’s how you came to imagine yourself a queen — because you were the Emperor ’s hangman . I see . ”
34132	34137	34139	34139	Aslan	60	“ Peace , Beaver , ”
34147	34151	34153	34154	the Witch	1271	“ And so , ”
34156	34176	34153	34154	the Witch	1271	“ that human creature is mine . His life is forfeit to me . His blood is my property . ”
34177	34184	34186	34187	the Bull	859	“ Come and take it then , ”
34199	34202	34204	34205	the Witch	1271	“ Fool , ”
34216	34265	34204	34205	the Witch	1271	“ do you really think your master can rob me of my rights by mere force ? He knows the Deep Magic better than that . He knows that unless I have blood as the Law says all Narnia will be overturned and perish in fire and water . ”
34266	34272	34274	34274	Aslan	60	“ It is very true , ”
34276	34283	34274	34274	Aslan	60	“ I do not deny it . ”
34284	34289	34291	34291	Susan	27	“ Oh , Aslan ! ”
34298	34333	34291	34291	Susan	27	“ ca n’t we — I mean , you wo n’t , will you ? Ca n’t we do something about the Deep Magic ? Is n’t there something you can work against it ? ”
34334	34342	34344	34344	Aslan	60	“ Work against the Emperor ’s Magic ? ”
34425	34433	34435	34435	Aslan	60	“ Fall back , all of you , ”
34437	34447	34435	34435	Aslan	60	“ and I will talk to the Witch alone . ”
34478	34483	34475	34475	Lucy	48	“ Oh , Edmund ! ”
34587	34594	34595	34595	he	60	“ You can all come back , ”
34598	34616	34595	34595	he	60	“ I have settled the matter . She has renounced the claim on your brother ’s blood . ”
34669	34681	34664	34664	she	1271	“ But how do I know this promise will be kept ? ”
34682	34689	34700	34700	his	60	“ Haa - a - arrh ! ”
34751	34779	34748	34748	Aslan	60	“ We must move from this place at once , it will be wanted for other purposes . We shall encamp tonight at the Fords of Beruna . ”
34911	34924	34925	34925	he	60	“ As soon as she has finished her business in these parts , ”
34928	34966	34925	34925	he	60	“ the Witch and her crew will almost certainly fall back to her House and prepare for a siege . You may or may not be able to cut her off and prevent her from reaching it . ”
35014	35026	35000	35000	he	60	“ You must put your Centaurs in such and such a place ”
35028	35046	35000	35000	he	60	“ You must post scouts to see that she does n’t do so - and - so , ”
35053	35063	35050	35050	Peter	26	“ But you will be there yourself , Aslan . ”
35064	35074	35076	35077	the Lion	756	“ I can give you no promise of that , ”
35168	35192	35165	35165	Peter	26	“ Would n’t it be better to camp on the far side — for fear she should try a night attack or anything ? ”
35217	35224	35206	35206	himself	60	“ Eh ? What ’s that ? ”
35232	35235	35237	35237	Aslan	60	“ No , ”
35250	35263	35237	35237	Aslan	60	“ No . She will not make an attack to - night . ”
35275	35301	35272	35272	he	756	“ All the same it was well thought of . That is how a soldier ought to think . But it does n’t really matter . ”
35440	35449	35451	35451	Susan	27	“ Ca n’t you get to sleep either ? ”
35453	35456	35458	35458	Lucy	48	“ No , ”
35460	35472	35458	35458	Lucy	48	“ I thought you were asleep . I say , Susan ! ”
35473	35476	35425	35425	Lucy	48	“ What ? ”
35477	35493	35458	35458	Lucy	48	“ I ’ve a most Horrible feeling — as if something were hanging over us . ”
35494	35509	35425	35425	Lucy	48	“ Have you ? Because , as a matter of fact , so have I. ”
35510	35515	35517	35517	Lucy	48	“ Something about Aslan , ”
35519	35541	35517	35517	Lucy	48	“ Either some dreadful thing is going to happen to him , or something dreadful that he ’s going to do . ”
35542	35553	35555	35555	Susan	27	“ There ’s been something wrong with him all afternoon , ”
35557	35591	35555	35555	Susan	27	“ Lucy ! What was that he said about not being with us at the battle ? You do n’t think he could be stealing away and leaving us tonight , do you ? ”
35592	35598	35600	35600	Lucy	48	“ Where is he now ? ”
35602	35610	35600	35600	Lucy	48	“ Is he here in the pavilion ? ”
35611	35618	35555	35555	Susan	27	“ I do n’t think so . ”
35619	35637	35600	35600	Lucy	48	“ Susan ! let ’s go outside and have a look round . We might see him . ”
35638	35645	35647	35647	Susan	27	“ All right . Let ’s , ”
35649	35663	35647	35647	Susan	27	“ we might just as well be doing that as lying awake here . ”
35714	35717	35705	35705	Susan	27	“ Look ! ”
35898	35911	35895	35895	he	903	“ Oh , children , children , why are you following me ? ”
35912	35918	35920	35920	Lucy	48	“ We could n’t sleep , ”
35942	35956	35958	35958	Susan	27	“ Please , may we come with you — wherever you ’re going ? ”
35960	35963	35965	35965	Aslan	60	“ Well — ”
35977	36013	35974	35974	he	60	“ I should be glad of company tonight . Yes , you may come , if you will promise to stop when I tell you , and after that leave me to go on alone . ”
36014	36027	36029	36031	the two girls	338	“ Oh , thank you , thank you . And we will , ”
36081	36087	36089	36089	Lucy	48	“ Aslan ! Dear Aslan ! ”
36091	36102	36089	36089	Lucy	48	“ what is wrong ? Ca n’t you tell us ? ”
36103	36111	36113	36113	Susan	27	“ Are you ill , dear Aslan ? ”
36115	36118	36120	36120	Aslan	60	“ No , ”
36122	36150	36120	36120	Aslan	60	“ I am sad and lonely . Lay your hands on my mane so that I can feel you are there and let us walk like that . ”
36263	36288	36258	36258	Aslan	60	“ Oh , children , children . Here you must stop . And whatever happens , do not let yourselves be seen . Farewell . ”
36553	36557	36558	36558	she	1271	“ The fool ! ”
36561	36571	36558	36558	she	1271	“ The fool has come . Bind him fast . ”
36624	36631	36633	36635	the White Witch	1248	“ Bind him , I say ! ”
36762	36765	36767	36768	the Witch	1271	“ Stop ! ”
36770	36777	36767	36768	the Witch	1271	“ Let him first be shaved . ”
36864	36876	36878	36878	one	258	“ Why , he ’s only a great cat after all ! ”
36880	36889	36891	36891	another	939	“ Is that what we were afraid of ? ”
36906	36914	36894	36894	they	931	“ Puss , Puss ! Poor Pussy , ”
36916	36927	36894	36894	they	931	“ How many mice have you caught today , Cat ? ”
36929	36940	36894	36894	they	931	“ Would you like a saucer of milk , Pussums ? ”
36941	36948	36950	36950	Lucy	48	“ Oh , how can they ? ”
36958	36965	36950	36950	Lucy	48	“ The brutes , the brutes ! ”
36994	36998	37000	37001	the Witch	1271	“ Muzzle him ! ”
37179	37186	37188	37188	Susan	27	“ The cowards ! The cowards ! ”
37190	37201	37188	37188	Susan	27	“ Are they still afraid of him , even now ? ”
37379	37480	37369	37369	she	43	“ And now , who has won ? Fool , did you think that by all this you would save the human traitor ? Now I will kill you instead of him as our pact was and so the Deep Magic will be appeased . But when you are dead what will prevent me from killing him as well ? And who will take him out of my hand then ? Understand that you have given me Narnia forever , you have lost your own life and you have not saved his . In that knowledge , despair and die . ”
37531	37575	37526	37527	the Witch	1271	“ Now ! Follow me all and we will set about what remains of this war ! It will not take us long to crush the human vermin and the traitors now that the great Fool , the great Cat , lies dead . ”
37824	37844	37821	37821	Lucy	48	“ I ca n’t bear to look at that horrible muzzle . I wonder could we take if off ? ”
37927	37937	37939	37939	Susan	27	“ I wonder could we untie him as well ? ”
38191	38194	38196	38196	Susan	27	“ Ugh ! ”
38205	38225	38196	38196	Susan	27	“ How beastly ! There are horrid little mice crawling over him . Go away , you little beasts . ”
38236	38239	38241	38241	Lucy	48	“ Wait ! ”
38253	38262	38241	38241	Lucy	48	“ Can you see what they ’re doing ? ”
38270	38275	38277	38277	Susan	27	“ I do believe — ”
38279	38292	38277	38277	Susan	27	“ But how queer ! They ’re nibbling away at the cords ! ”
38293	38300	38302	38302	Lucy	48	“ That ’s what I thought , ”
38304	38334	38302	38302	Lucy	48	“ I think they ’re friendly mice . Poor little things — they do n’t realize he ’s dead . They think it ’ll do some good untying him . ”
38531	38537	38539	38539	Lucy	48	“ I ’m so cold , ”
38541	38546	38548	38548	Susan	27	“ So am I , ”
38550	38558	38548	38548	Susan	27	“ Let ’s walk about a bit . ”
38726	38731	38733	38733	Lucy	48	“ What ’s that ? ”
38740	38750	38752	38752	Susan	27	“ I — I feel afraid to turn round , ”
38754	38760	38752	38752	Susan	27	“ something awful is happening . ”
38761	38770	38772	38772	Lucy	48	“ They ’re doing something worse to Him , ”
38774	38778	38780	38780	she	48	“ Come on ! ”
38850	38857	38859	38861	the two girls	338	“ Oh , oh , oh ! ”
38869	38877	38879	38879	Lucy	48	“ Oh , it ’s too bad , ”
38881	38890	38879	38879	Lucy	48	“ they might have left the body alone . ”
38891	38897	38899	38899	Susan	27	“ Who ’s done it ? ”
38901	38911	38899	38899	Susan	27	“ What does it mean ? Is it magic ? ”
38912	38915	38879	38879	Lucy	48	“ Yes ! ”
38924	38930	38879	38879	Lucy	48	“ It is more magic . ”
38965	38970	38973	38974	the children	384	“ Oh , Aslan ! ”
38990	39000	39002	39002	Lucy	48	“ Are n’t you dead then , dear Aslan ? ”
39004	39008	39010	39010	Aslan	60	“ Not now , ”
39012	39021	39023	39023	Susan	27	“ You ’re not — not a — ? ”
39073	39079	39080	39080	he	60	“ Do I look it ? ”
39083	39098	39100	39100	Lucy	48	“ Oh , you ’re real , you ’re real ! Oh , Aslan ! ”
39115	39123	39125	39125	Susan	27	“ But what does it all mean ? ”
39132	39136	39138	39138	Aslan	60	“ It means , ”
39140	39240	39138	39138	Aslan	60	“ that though the Witch knew the Deep Magic , there is a magic deeper still which she did not know : Her knowledge goes back only to the dawn of time . But if she could have looked a little further back , into the stillness and the darkness before Time dawned , she would have read there a different incantation . She would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in a traitor ’s stead , the Table would crack and Death itself would start working backwards . And now — ”
39241	39247	39249	39249	Lucy	48	“ Oh yes . Now ? ”
39258	39263	39265	39266	the Lion	756	“ Oh , children , ”
39268	39288	39289	39289	He	60	“ I feel my strength coming back to me . Oh , children , catch me if you can ! ”
39497	39501	39503	39503	Aslan	60	“ And now , ”
39506	39528	39503	39503	Aslan	60	“ to business . I feel I am going to roar . You had better put your fingers in your ears . ”
39591	39606	39588	39588	he	60	“ We have a long journey to go . You must ride on me . ”
40055	40061	40062	40062	he	60	“ The Witch ’s home ! ”
40065	40073	40062	40062	he	60	“ Now , children , hold tight . ”
40161	40167	40169	40169	Lucy	48	“ WHAT an extraordinary place ! ”
40171	40189	40169	40169	Lucy	48	“ All those stone animals — and people too ! It’s — it ’s like a museum . ”
40190	40193	40195	40195	Susan	27	“ Hush , ”
40197	40203	40195	40195	Susan	27	“ Aslan ’s doing something . ”
40311	40323	40308	40308	Lucy	48	“ Oh , Susan ! Look ! Look at the lion . ”
40722	40725	40727	40727	Susan	27	“ Oh ! ”
40733	40746	40727	40727	Susan	27	“ Look ! I wonder — I mean , is it safe ? ”
40764	40770	40772	40772	Aslan	60	“ It ’s all right ! ”
40775	40791	40772	40772	Aslan	60	“ Once the feet are put right , all the rest of him will follow . ”
40792	40801	40803	40803	Susan	27	“ That was n’t exactly what I meant , ”
40862	40896	40848	40848	he	60	“ Bless me ! I must have been asleep . Now ! Where ’s that dratted little Witch that was running about on the ground . Somewhere just by my feet it was . ”
41016	41025	41027	41027	Aslan	60	“ Now for the inside of this house ! ”
41029	41063	41027	41027	Aslan	60	“ Look alive , everyone . Up stairs and down stairs and in my lady ’s chamber ! Leave no corner unsearched . You never know where some poor prisoner may be concealed . ”
41102	41166	41094	41094	everyone	133	“ Do n’t forget the dungeons — Give us a hand with this door ! Here ’s another little winding stair — Oh ! I say . Here ’s a poor kangaroo . Call Aslan — Phew ! How it smells in here — Look out for trap - doors — Up here ! There are a whole lot more on the landing ! ”
41181	41198	41174	41174	Lucy	48	“ Aslan ! Aslan ! I ’ve found Mr Tumnus . Oh , do come quick . ”
41321	41331	41311	41311	someone	284	“ But how are we going to get out ? ”
41347	41354	41356	41356	Aslan	60	“ That ’ll be all right , ”
41375	41382	41383	41383	he	60	“ Hi ! You up there , ”
41386	41392	41383	41383	he	60	“ What ’s your name ? ”
41393	41403	41405	41406	the Giant	93	“ Giant Rumblebuffin , if it please your honour , ”
41414	41421	41423	41423	Aslan	60	“ Well then , Giant Rumblebuffin , ”
41425	41436	41423	41423	Aslan	60	“ just let us out of this , will you ? ”
41437	41449	41451	41452	Giant Rumblebuffin	93	“ Certainly , your honour . It will be a pleasure , ”
41454	41468	41451	41452	Giant Rumblebuffin	93	“ Stand well away from the gates , all you little ’ uns . ”
41598	41610	41612	41620	the Giant , puffing like the largest railway engine	1062	“ Blowed if I ai n’t all in a muck sweat , ”
41622	41649	41612	41620	the Giant , puffing like the largest railway engine	1062	“ Comes of being out of condition . I suppose neither of you young ladies has such a thing as a pocket - handkerchee about you ? ”
41650	41656	41658	41658	Lucy	48	“ Yes , I have , ”
41677	41683	41685	41686	Giant Rumblebuffin	93	“ Thank you , Missie , ”
41739	41766	41725	41725	he	93	“ Bless me ! I ’ve picked up the little girl instead . I beg your pardon , Missie , I thought you was the handkerchee ! ”
41767	41772	41774	41774	Lucy	48	“ No , no , ”
41777	41782	41774	41774	Lucy	48	“ here it is ! ”
41830	41845	41827	41827	she	48	“ I ’m afraid it ’s not much use to you , Mr Rumblebuffin . ”
41846	41855	41857	41858	the giant	1036	“ Not at all . Not at all , ”
41861	41885	41857	41858	the giant	1036	“ Never met a nicer handkerchee . So fine , so handy . So — I do n’t know how to describe it . ”
41886	41894	41896	41896	Lucy	48	“ What a nice giant he is ! ”
41901	41905	41907	41908	the Faun	160	“ Oh yes , ”
41910	41972	41907	41908	the Faun	160	“ All the Buffins always were . One of the most respected of all the giant families in Narnia . Not very clever , perhaps ( I never knew a giant that was ) , but an old family . With traditions , you know . If he ’d been the other sort she ’d never have turned him into stone . ”
41986	41996	41997	41997	he	60	“ Our day ’s work is not yet over , ”
42000	42022	41997	41997	he	60	“ and if the Witch is to be finally defeated before bed - time we must find the battle at once . ”
42023	42033	42035	42039	the largest of the Centaurs	1066	“ And join in , I hope , sir ! ”
42041	42045	42047	42047	Aslan	60	“ Of course , ”
42049	42124	42047	42047	Aslan	60	“ And now ! Those who ca n’t keep up — that is , children , dwarfs , and small animals — must ride on the backs of those who can — that is , lions , centaurs , unicorns , horses , giants and eagles . Those who are good with their noses must come in front with us lions to smell out where the battle is . Look lively and sort yourselves . ”
42168	42215	42218	42218	he	1069	“ Did you hear what he said ? Us Lions . That means him and me . Us Lions . That ’s what I like about Aslan . No side , no stand - off - ishness . Us Lions . That meant him and me . ”
42678	42685	42687	42687	Aslan	60	“ Off my back , children , ”
42948	42958	42959	42959	Peter	26	“ It was all Edmund ’s doing , Aslan , ”
42963	43095	42959	42959	Peter	26	“ We ’d have been beaten if it had n’t been for him . The Witch was turning our troops into stone right and left . But nothing would stop him . He fought his way through three ogres to where she was just turning one of your leopards into a statue . And when he reached her he had sense to bring his sword smashing down on her wand instead of trying to go for her directly and simply getting made a statue himself for his pains . That was the mistake all the rest were making . Once her wand was broken we began to have some chance — if we had n’t lost so many already . He was terribly wounded . We must go and see him . ”
43132	43137	43139	43139	Aslan	60	“ Quick , Lucy , ”
43196	43203	43205	43205	Aslan	60	“ There are other people wounded , ”
43227	43233	43235	43235	Lucy	48	“ Yes , I know , ”
43238	43243	43235	43235	Lucy	48	“ Wait a minute . ”
43244	43249	43251	43251	Aslan	60	“ Daughter of Eve , ”
43257	43274	43251	43251	Aslan	60	“ others also are at the point of death . Must more people die for Edmund ? ”
43275	43282	43284	43284	Lucy	48	“ I ’m sorry , Aslan , ”
43410	43415	43417	43417	Lucy	48	“ Does he know , ”
43421	43440	43417	43417	Lucy	48	“ what Aslan did for him ? Does he know what the arrangement with the Witch really was ? ”
43441	43450	43452	43452	Susan	27	“ Hush ! No . Of course not , ”
43454	43462	43464	43464	Lucy	48	“ Ought n’t he to be told ? ”
43466	43472	43474	43474	Susan	27	“ Oh , surely not , ”
43476	43495	43474	43474	Susan	27	“ It would be too awful for him . Think how you ’d feel if you were he . ”
43496	43507	43509	43509	Lucy	48	“ All the same I think he ought to know , ”
43773	43794	43757	43757	Aslan	60	“ Long Live King Peter ! Long Live Queen Susan ! Long Live King Edmund ! Long Live Queen Lucy ! ”
43795	43826	43828	43828	Aslan	60	“ Once a king or queen in Narnia , always a king or queen . Bear it well , Sons of Adam ! Bear it well , Daughters of Eve ! ”
44008	44016	44017	44017	he	59	“ He ’ll be coming and going , ”
44021	44085	44017	44017	he	59	“ One day you ’ll see him and another you wo n’t . He does n’t like being tied down and of course he has other countries to attend to . It ’s quite all right . He ’ll often drop in . Only you must n’t press him . He ’s wild , ’ you know . Not like a tame lion . ”
44658	44689	44639	44639	they	1166	“ Fair Consorts , let us now alight from our horses and follow this beast into the thicket ; for in all my days I never hunted a nobler quarry . ”
44690	44693	44695	44696	the others	1238	“ Sir , ”
44698	44705	44695	44696	the others	1238	“ even so let us do . ”
44737	44757	44733	44734	Queen Susan	27	“ Fair friends , here is a great marvel , for I seem to see a tree of iron . ”
44758	44761	44764	44765	King Edmund	28	“ Madam , ”
44767	44792	44764	44765	King Edmund	28	“ if you look well upon it you shall see it is a pillar of iron with a lantern set on the top thereof . ”
44793	44804	44806	44807	King Peter	97	“ By the Lion ’s Mane , a strange device , ”
44809	44841	44806	44807	King Peter	97	“ to set a lantern here where the trees cluster so thick about it and so high above it that if it were lit it should give light to no man ! ”
44842	44845	44847	44848	Queen Lucy	48	“ Sir , ”
44850	44889	44847	44848	Queen Lucy	48	“ By likelihood when this post and this lamp were set here there were smaller trees in the place , or fewer , or none . For this is a young wood and the iron post is old . ”
44902	44949	44806	44807	King Peter	97	“ I know not how it is , but this lamp on the post worketh upon me strangely . It runs in my mind that I have seen the like before ; as it were in a dream , or in the dream of a dream . ”
44950	44953	44955	44955	they	1166	“ Sir , ”
44958	44967	44955	44955	they	1166	“ it is even so with us also . ”
44968	44972	44974	44975	Queen Lucy	48	“ And more , ”
44977	45010	44974	44975	Queen Lucy	48	“ for it will not go out of my mind that if we pass this post and lantern either we shall find strange adventures or else some great change of our fortunes . ”
45011	45014	45016	45017	King Edmund	28	“ Madam , ”
45019	45029	45016	45017	King Edmund	28	“ the like foreboding stirreth in my heart also . ”
45030	45038	45040	45041	King Peter	97	“ And in mine , fair brother , ”
45043	45049	45051	45052	Queen Susan	27	“ And in mine too , ”
45054	45074	45051	45052	Queen Susan	27	“ Wherefore by my counsel we shall lightly return to our horses and follow this White Stag no further . ”
45075	45078	45080	45081	King Peter	97	“ Madam , ”
45083	45151	45080	45081	King Peter	97	“ therein I pray thee to have me excused . For never since we four were Kings and Queens in Narnia have we set our hands to any high matter , as battles , quests , feats of arms , acts of justice , and the like , and then given over ; but always what we have taken in hand , the same we have achieved . ”
45152	45155	45157	45158	Queen Lucy	48	“ Sister , ”
45160	45198	45157	45158	Queen Lucy	48	“ my royal brother speaks rightly . And it seems to me we should be shamed if for any fearing or foreboding we turned back from following so noble a beast as now we have in chase . ”
45199	45205	45207	45208	King Edmund	28	“ And so say I , ”
45210	45245	45207	45208	King Edmund	28	“ And I have such desire to find the signification of this thing that I would not by my good will turn back for the richest jewel in all Narnia and all the islands . ”
45246	45254	45256	45257	Queen Susan	27	“ Then in the name of Aslan , ”
45259	45282	45256	45257	Queen Susan	27	“ if ye will all have it so , let us go on and take the adventure that shall fall to us . ”
45503	45506	45507	45507	he	117	“ No , ”
45510	45706	45507	45507	he	117	“ I do n’t think it will be any good trying to go back through the wardrobe door to get the coats . You wo n’t get into Narnia again by that route . Nor would the coats be much use by now if you did ! Eh ? What ’s that ? Yes , of course you ’ll get back to Narnia again some day . Once a King in Narnia , always a King in Narnia . But do n’t go trying to use the same route twice . Indeed , do n’t try to get there at all . It ’ll happen when you ’re not looking for it . And do n’t talk too much about it even among yourselves . And do n’t mention it to anyone else unless you find that they ’ve had adventures of the same sort themselves . What ’s that ? How will you know ? Oh , you ’ll know all right . Odd things they say — even their looks — will let the secret out . Keep your eyes open . Bless me , what do they teach them at these schools ? ”
