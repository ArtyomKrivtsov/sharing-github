5328	5334	5335	5335	he	280	“ Yes , it is , ”
5338	5379	5335	5335	he	280	“ Jurisdiction issue is clear . No way out for you there , Mr. Reacher . The town limit extends fourteen miles , right up to the highway . The warehousing out there is mine , no doubt about that . ”

5451	5524	5448	5448	Finlay	280	“ His operation out there pays us a lot of taxes , does us a lot of good . A lot of revenue and a lot of benefit for the town without a lot of mess , because it ’s so far away , right ? So we try to take care of it for him . But now it ’s a homicide scene , and you ’ve got explaining to do . ”

5548	5630	5545	5545	I	0	“ I ’ll make a statement describing every little thing I did since I entered your lousy town limits until I got hauled in here in the middle of my damn breakfast . If you can make anything out of it , I ’ll give you a damn medal . Because all I did was to place one foot in front of the other for nearly four hours in the pouring rain all the way through your precious fourteen damn miles . ”

5884	5924	5881	5881	he	280	“ You ’re in deep shit . Bad things happened up there . Our witness saw you leaving the scene . You ’re a stranger with no ID and no story . So do n’t get smart with me . ”

5954	6009	5951	5951	I	0	“ I was walking down a damn road . There ’s a difference , right ? People leaving homicide scenes run and hide . They do n’t walk straight down the road . What ’s wrong about walking down a road ? People walk down roads all the damn time , do n’t they ? ”
6018	6021	6022	6022	he	280	“ No , ”
6025	6061	6022	6022	he	280	“ Nobody has walked the length of that road since the invention of the automobile . So why no address ? Where are you from ? Answer the questions . Let ’s get this done . ”
6062	6073	6074	6074	I	0	“ OK , Finlay , let ’s get it done , ”
6077	6133	6074	6074	I	0	“ I do n’t have an address because I do n’t live anywhere . Maybe one day I ’ll live somewhere and then I ’ll have an address and I ’ll send you a picture postcard and you can put it in your damn address book , since you seem so damn concerned about it . ”

6226	6229	6230	6230	he	280	“ OK , ”
6233	6286	6230	6230	he	280	“ You do n’t understand my question , so let me try to make it quite clear . What I mean is , where were you born , or where have you lived for that majority period of your life which you instinctively regard as predominant in a social or cultural context ? ”
6293	6301	6302	6302	he	280	“ I ’ll give you an example , ”
6305	6344	6287	6287	I	0	“ I myself was born in Boston , was educated in Boston and subsequently worked for twenty years in Boston , so I would say , and I think you would agree , that I come from Boston . ”
6362	6365	6366	6366	I	0	“ OK , ”
6369	6416	6366	6366	I	0	“ You ’ve asked the questions . I ’ll answer them . But let me tell you something . I ’m not your guy . By Monday you ’ll know I ’m not your guy . So do yourself a favor . Do n’t stop looking . ”

6455	6459	6460	6460	he	280	“ Go on , ”
6463	6466	6467	6467	I	0	“ OK , ”
6470	6528	6467	6467	I	0	“ According to your fancy definition , I do n’t come from anywhere . I come from a place called Military . I was born on a U.S. Army base in West Berlin . My old man was Marine Corps and my mother was a French civilian he met in Holland . They got married in Korea . ”
6536	6543	6544	6544	I	0	“ I was a military kid , ”
6547	6588	6544	6544	I	0	“ Show me a list of U.S. bases all around the world and that ’s a list of where I lived . I did high school in two dozen different countries and I did four years up at West Point . ”
6589	6593	6594	6594	Finlay	280	“ Go on , ”
6597	6604	6605	6605	I	0	“ I stayed in the army , ”
6608	6727	6605	6605	I	0	“ Military Police . I served and lived in all those bases all over again . Then , Finlay , after thirty - six years of first being an officer ’s kid and then being an officer myself , suddenly there ’s no need for a great big army anymore because the Soviets have gone belly - up . So hooray , we get the peace dividend . Which for you means your taxes get spent on something else , but for me means I ’m a thirty - six - year - old unemployed ex - military policeman getting called a vagrant by smug civilian bastards who would n’t last five minutes in the world I survived . ”
6738	6741	6742	6742	he	647	“ Continue , ”
6750	6760	6761	6761	I	0	“ So right now I ’m just enjoying myself , ”
6764	6800	6761	6761	I	0	“ Maybe eventually I ’ll find something to do , maybe I wo n’t . Maybe I ’ll settle somewhere , maybe I wo n’t . But right now , I ’m not looking to . ”
6809	6817	6818	6818	he	647	“ When did you leave the army ? ”

6937	6940	6941	6941	I	0	“ Major , ”
6944	6971	6941	6941	I	0	“ They give you severance pay when they kick you out . Still got most of it . Trying to make it last , you know ? ”
6991	7004	7005	7005	he	280	“ SO LET ’S TALK ABOUT THE LAST TWENTY - FOUR HOURS , ”
7018	7027	7028	7028	I	0	“ I came up on the Greyhound bus , ”

7374	7378	7379	7379	he	280	“ So why ? ”
7382	7411	7379	7379	he	280	“ Why get off the bus at an unscheduled stop and walk fourteen miles in the rain to a place you had absolutely no reason to go to ? ”
7438	7445	7446	7446	I	0	“ What can I tell you ? ”

7540	7578	7537	7537	Finlay	280	“ Do n’t give me that shit . How could you pick this place out ? It ’s just a name . It ’s just a dot on the map . You must have had a reason . ”

We ’ll check with the bus company . Check your ticket . Find the driver , find the passengers . If what you say is right , we ’ll know soon enough . And if it ’s true , it may let you off the hook .

Obviously soft - nosed slugs , because the exit wounds removed the guy ’s face . Rain has washed away the powder deposits but the burn patterns suggest the silencer . Fatal shot must have been the first . No bullets remained in the skull . No shell cases were found . ”

12269	12371	12266	12266	I	0	“ Think about it psychologically . That ’s the key to this thing . A guy who uses a silenced small - caliber automatic for a neat head shot and an insurance shot is not the type of guy who then suddenly goes berserk and kicks the shit out of a corpse , right ? And the type of guy who does get in a frenzy like that does n’t then suddenly calm down and hide the body under some old cardboard . You ’re looking at three completely separate things there , Finlay . So there were three guys involved . ”

12403	12489	12400	12400	I	0	“ He would n’t have waited around . He would n’t like that kind of frenzy . It would embarrass him . And it would worry him because it adds visibility and danger to the whole thing . And a guy like that , if he had tidied up afterward , he ’d have done it right . He would n’t have left the body where the first guy who came along was going to find it . So you ’re looking at three guys . ”
12494	12497	12498	12498	he	280	“ So ? ”
12501	12511	12512	12512	I	0	“ So which one am I supposed to be ? ”

12623	12799	12620	12620	I	0	“ Or a car . So the very best you can do is to say the victim walked there , and I walked there . I met him , and I very carefully shot him , like a pro , then recovered my shell cases and took his wallet and emptied his pockets , but forgot to search his shoes . Then I stashed my weapon , silencer , flashlight , mobile phone , the shell cases , the wallet and all . Then I completely changed my whole personality and kicked the corpse to pieces like a maniac . Then I completely changed my whole personality again and made a useless attempt to hide the body . And then I waited eight hours in the rain and then I walked down into town . That ’s the very best you can do . And it ’s total crap , Finlay . Because why the hell would I wait eight hours , in the rain , until daylight , to walk away from a homicide ? ”

13101	13129	13098	13098	I	0	“ But you ca n’t identify who it belongs to because you have no reverse directories for mobiles and their office wo n’t tell you , right ? ”

13140	13153	13154	13154	I	0	“ But you need to know whose number it is , right ? ”

If you ’d been near the top , you know , active and unsolved , we ’d have heard almost right away . It ’s automatic . They do n’t want any big fugitive to slip away , so the system gets right back . But you ’ve been in there almost three hours and we have n’t heard . So I can tell you ’re not on record for anything very bad . ”

Like all this is about some guy called Jack Reacher . He ’s never heard of any guy called Jack Reacher , so he ’s here for nothing . He ’s cool , right ? ”

So I tell him we know the tall guy is dead . Shot to death . Well , that ’s like another poker up the ass . He practically fell off the chair . ”
19240	19244	19245	19245	I	0	“ Go on , ”
19259	19268	19269	19269	Finlay	280	“ He ’s shaking all over the place , ”
19272	19315	19269	19269	Finlay	280	“ Then I tell him we know about the phone number in the shoe . His phone number printed on a piece of paper , with the word ‘ Pluribus ’ printed above it . That ’s another poker up the ass . ”
19331	19338	19339	19339	he	280	“ He would n’t say anything , ”
19343	19481	19339	19339	he	280	“ Not a word . He was rigid with shock . All gray in the face . I thought he was having a heart attack . His mouth was opening and closing like a fish . But he was n’t talking . So I told him we knew about the corpse getting beaten up . I asked him who else was involved . I told him we knew about hiding the body under the cardboard . He would n’t say a damn word . He just kept looking around . After a while I realized he was thinking like crazy . Trying to decide what to tell me . He just kept silent , thinking like mad , must have been forty minutes . The tape was running the whole time . Recorded forty minutes of silence . ”
19496	19501	19502	19502	he	280	“ Then he confessed , ”
19505	19531	19502	19502	he	280	“ I did it , he said . I shot him , he said . The guy is confessing , right ? On the tape . ”

19555	19731	19552	19552	he	280	“ He says no , keeps repeating he killed the guy . So I Mirandize him , loud and clear , on the tape . Then I think to myself maybe he ’s crazy or something , you know ? So I ask him , who did you kill ? He says the tall guy with the shaved head . I ask him , how ? He says , shot him in the head . I ask him , when ? He says last night , about midnight . I ask him who kicked the body around ? Who was the guy ? What does Pluribus mean ? He does n’t answer . Goes rigid with fright all over again . Refuses to say a damn word . I say to him , I ’m not sure you did anything at all . He jumps up and grabs me . He ’s screaming I confess , I confess , I shot him , I shot him . I shove him back . He goes quiet . ”

19894	19897	19898	19898	he	280	“ Wrong , ”
19901	19981	19898	19898	he	280	“ I do n’t believe him . There were three guys involved here . You persuaded me of that yourself . So which one is Hubble claiming to be ? I do n’t think he ’s the maniac . I ca n’t see enough strength in him for that . I do n’t see him as the gofer . And he ’s definitely not the shooter , for God ’s sake . Guy like that could n’t shoot pool . ”
19996	20008	20009	20009	he	280	“ Got to throw his ass in the can for now , ”
20012	20033	20009	20009	he	280	“ No option . He ’s confessed , couple of plausible details . But it definitely wo n’t hold up . ”

Did n’t leave until after two o’clock in the morning . Two dozen people saw him arrive , two dozen people saw him leave . He got a ride home from his sister - in - law ’s brother - in - law . He got a ride because it was already pouring rain by then . ”

20418	20530	20415	20415	Finlay	280	“ He ’s saying it ’s maybe a conspiracy , you know , maybe Hubble was n’t literally there , but he recruited you to do it . A conspiracy , right ? He reckons the confession is exaggerated because maybe Hubble ’s afraid of you and is scared to finger you right away . Morrison figures you were on your way down to Hubble ’s place to get paid when we hauled you in . He figures that ’s why you waited the eight hours . Figures that ’s why Hubble was at home today . Did n’t go to work because he was waiting around to pay you off . ”

But you ’ve come down here with no woman , because if you had , she ’d have spent some of that spare cash on new clothes for you . She probably hated that wintry tweed thing you ’re wearing . She ’d have junked it and put you in a Sunbelt outfit to start your new life on the right foot . But you ’re still wearing that terrible old suit , so the woman is gone . She either died or divorced you , so it was a fifty - fifty guess . Looks like I guessed right . ”

21244	21301	21241	21241	I	0	“ You were just stressed out and you were patting your pockets , looking for cigarettes . That means you quit fairly recently . Easy guess is you quit in April , you know , new life , new job , no more cigarettes . You figured quit now and you might beat the cancer thing . ”

So we ai n’t got the men to do the job the way it ought to be done . Trying to do our job with a half a crew on every shift , right ?

31932	32003	31929	31929	he	0	“ I had three problems . If they were after me too , I had to avoid them . Hide , you know ? To protect myself . But if they were n’t after me , then I had to stay silent , right ? To protect my wife and kids . And from their point of view that particular guy needed shooting . Three problems . So I confessed . ”

32043	32246	32040	32040	he	0	“ I decided to get arrested . Then I was safe if they were after me . Because they ca n’t get at me in here , right ? They ’re out there and I ’m in here . That ’s problem number one solved . But I also figured , this is the complicated bit , if they actually were not after me at all , then why do n’t I get arrested but do n’t say anything about them ? They would think I had got arrested by mistake or whatever , and they see that I ’m not talking . They see , OK ? It proves I ’m safe . It ’s like a demonstration that I ’m dependable . A sort of proof . Trial by ordeal sort of a thing . That ’s problem number two solved . And by saying it was me actually killed the guy , it sort of definitely puts me on their side . It ’s like a statement of loyalty , right ? And I thought they might be grateful I ’d pointed the heat in the wrong direction for a while . So that was problem number three solved . ”

Right now it ’s a very tense situation . But it ’s all going to calm back down very soon . I might just make it through . If they get me , they get me . I do n’t care anymore . It ’s my family I ’m worried about . ”

And if they find out it was me brought him down here , they ’ll kill me . And if they do n’t kill me , I ’ll probably go to jail for a thousand years anyway , because right now the whole damn thing is very exposed and very dangerous . ”

But now it could go either way . If we get through it , nobody will ever know anything . But if we do n’t get through it , it ’ll be the biggest sensation you ever heard of , believe me .

40354	40399	40351	40351	I	0	“ Fourteen hours . So if it takes fourteen hours to reach nearly to the bottom of the pyramid , it ’s got to take more than fourteen hours to get all the way down to the bottom . That ’s logical , right ? ”

40420	40513	40417	40417	I	0	“ The body was found at eight o’clock , so the prints went in when ? Eight thirty , earliest . But Baker was already telling me there was no match on file when they were talking to me at two thirty . I remember the time , because I was looking at the clock . That ’s only six hours . If it took fourteen hours to find out that I ’m in there , how could it take just six hours to say the dead guy ’s not in there ? ”

40521	40614	40518	40518	she	1545	“ You ’re right . Baker must have screwed up . Finlay took the prints and Baker sent them . He must have screwed up the scan . You got to be careful , or it does n’t transmit clearly . If the scan ’s not clear , the database tries to decipher it , then it comes back as unreadable . Baker must have thought that meant a null result . The codes are similar . Anyway , I sent them again , first thing . We ’ll know soon enough . ”

41017	41020	41021	41021	she	303	“ OK , ”
42235	42240	42241	42241	I	0	“ Who is that ? ”
42257	42263	42264	42264	he	591	“ That ’s Mrs. Kliner , ”

42286	42305	42283	42283	I	0	“ I ’m a stranger in town . Kliner owns the warehouses up near the highway , right ? ”
42306	42309	42310	42310	he	591	“ Right , ”
42313	42329	42310	42310	he	591	“ And a whole lot more besides . Big deal round here , Mr. Kliner . ”

42346	42353	42342	42343	the guy	591	“ You heard about the Foundation ? ”
42371	42379	42380	42381	the guy	591	“ Kliner set up the Kliner Foundation , ”
42384	42406	42380	42381	the guy	591	“ Benefits the town in a lot of ways . Came here five years ago , been like Christmas ever since . ”
42410	42416	42417	42417	I	0	“ Is Mrs. Kliner OK ? ”
42431	42438	42439	42439	he	591	“ She ’s a sick woman , ”
42442	42502	42439	42439	he	591	“ Very sick . Very pale , right ? A very sick woman . Could be tuberculosis . I seen tuberculosis do that to folks . She used to be a fine - looking woman , but now she looks like something grown in a closet , right ? A very sick woman , that ’s for damn sure . ”
42503	42512	42513	42513	I	0	“ Who ’s the guy in the truck ? ”
42516	42519	42520	42520	he	591	“ Stepson , ”
42523	42552	42520	42520	he	591	“ Kliner ’s kid by his first wife . Mrs. Kliner ’s his second . I ’ve heard she do n’t get along so good with the kid . ”
42808	42813	42814	42814	he	591	“ Try the barbershop , ”
42817	42822	42823	42823	I	0	“ On a Sunday ? ”
42830	42837	42838	42838	he	591	“ They ’re always in there , ”
42841	42852	42838	42838	he	591	“ Never exactly closed . Never exactly open , either . ”
43437	43445	43446	43446	I	0	“ So tell me about the Kliners , ”
43470	43484	43485	43485	he	1697	“ Ca n’t help you with that inquiry , that ’s for sure , ”
43488	43511	43485	43485	he	1697	“ That ’s a subject we prefer not to discuss in here . Best if you ask me about somebody else altogether . ”
43520	43523	43524	43524	I	0	“ OK , ”
43527	43535	43524	43524	I	0	“ You ever heard of Blind Blake ? ”
43536	43547	43548	43550	the old man	1151	“ Him I heard of , that ’s for sure , ”
43553	43567	43548	43550	the old man	1151	“ That ’s a guy we can discuss , no problem at all . ”

43584	43596	43597	43597	he	1697	“ He was here , time to time , way back , ”
43600	43698	43597	43597	he	1697	“ Born in Jacksonville , Florida , they say , just over the state line . Used to kind of trek on up from there , you know , through here , through Atlanta , all the way up north to Chicago , and then trek all the way back down again . Back through Atlanta , back through here , back home . Very different then , you know . No highway , no automobiles , at least not for a poor black man and his friends . All walking or riding on the freight cars . ”
43699	43706	43707	43707	I	0	“ You ever hear him play ? ”
43720	43731	43732	43732	he	1711	“ Man , I ’m seventy - four years old , ”
43735	43853	43711	43711	He	1711	“ This was back when I was just a little boy . We ’re talking about Blind Blake here . Guys like that played in bars . Never was in no bars when I was a little boy , you understand . I would have got my behind whupped real good if I had been . You should talk to my partner here . He ’s a whole lot older than I am . He may have heard him play , only he may not remember it because he do n’t remember much . Not even what he ate for breakfast . Am I right ? Hey , my old friend , what you eat for breakfast ? ”
43883	43894	43895	43895	he	1712	“ I do n’t know what I ate for breakfast , ”
43898	44018	43895	43895	he	1712	“ Do n’t even know if I ate any breakfast at all . But listen up . I may be an old guy , but the truth is old guys remember stuff real well . Not recent things , you understand , but old things . You got to imagine your memory is like an old bucket , you know ? Once it ’s filled up with old stuff there ai n’t no way to get new stuff in . No way at all , you understand ? So I do n’t remember any new stuff because my old bucket is all filled up with old stuff that happened way back . You understand what I ’m saying here ? ”
44019	44024	44025	44025	I	0	“ Sure I understand , ”
44028	44040	44025	44025	I	0	“ So way back , did you ever hear him play ? ”
44041	44044	44045	44045	he	1712	“ Who ? ”
44071	44075	44076	44076	I	0	“ Blind Blake , ”
44079	44087	44076	44076	I	0	“ Did you ever hear him play ? ”
44088	44097	44098	44100	the old guy	689	“ No , I never heard him play , ”
44103	44148	44098	44100	the old guy	689	“ But my sister did . Got me a sister more than about ninety years old or thereabouts , may she be spared . Still alive . She did a little singing way back and she sang with old Blind Blake many a time . ”
44149	44153	44154	44154	I	0	“ She did ? ”
44157	44163	44154	44154	I	0	“ She sang with him ? ”
44164	44169	44171	44174	the gnarled old guy	1717	“ She sure did , ”
44176	44265	44171	44174	the gnarled old guy	1717	“ She sang with just about anybody passing through . You got to remember this old town lay right on the big road to Atlanta . That old county road out there used to come on down through here straight on south into Florida . It was the only route through Georgia north to south . Of course now you got the highway runs right by without stopping off , and you got airplanes and all . No importance to Margrave now , nobody coming on through anymore . ”
44266	44274	44275	44275	I	0	“ So Blind Blake stopped off here ? ”
44279	44287	44275	44275	I	0	“ And your sister sang with him ? ”
44288	44296	44297	44297	he	1717	“ Everybody used to stop off here , ”
44300	44432	44297	44297	he	1717	“ North side of town was just pretty much a mess of bars and rooming houses to cater to the folks passing through . All these fancy gardens between here and the firehouse is where the bars and rooming houses used to be . All tore down now , or else all fell down . Been no passing trade at all for a real long time . But back then , it was a different kind of a town altogether . Streams of people in and out , the whole time . Workers , crop pickers , drummers , fighters , hoboes , truckers , musicians . All kinds of those guys used to stop off and play and my old sister would be right in there singing with them all . ”
44433	44440	44441	44441	I	0	“ And she remembers Blind Blake ? ”
44445	44450	44451	44453	the old man	1151	“ She sure does , ”
44456	44479	44451	44453	the old man	1151	“ Used to think he was the greatest thing alive . Says he used to play real sporty . Real sporty indeed . ”
44480	44486	44487	44487	I	0	“ What happened to him ? ”
44490	44495	44487	44487	I	0	“ Do you know ? ”
44552	44558	44559	44559	he	689	“ Ca n’t rightly say , ”
44562	44633	44559	44559	he	689	“ He came back and forth on the road , time to time . I remember that pretty well . Three , four years later he was gone . I was up in Atlanta for a spell , was n’t here to know . Heard tell somebody killed him , maybe right here in Margrave , maybe not . Some kind of big trouble , got him killed stone dead . ”
44844	44850	44851	44851	she	303	“ We found another body , ”
44854	44857	44858	44858	I	0	“ Where ? ”
44862	44869	44870	44870	she	303	“ Up at the warehouse again , ”
44873	44893	44870	44870	she	303	“ The other side of the road this time , underneath the cloverleaf , where it ’s raised up . ”
44894	44899	44900	44900	I	0	“ Who found it ? ”
44903	44906	44907	44907	she	303	“ Finlay , ”
44910	44944	44907	44907	she	303	“ He was up there this morning , poking around , looking for something to help us with the first one . Some help , right ? All he finds is another one . ”
44945	44954	44955	44955	I	0	“ Do you know who this one is ? ”
44964	44967	44968	44968	she	303	“ Unidentified , ”
44971	44978	44959	44959	She	303	“ Same as the first one . ”
44979	44985	44986	44986	I	0	“ Where ’s Finlay now ? ”
44990	44996	44997	44997	she	303	“ Gone to get Hubble , ”
45000	45010	44997	44997	she	303	“ He thinks Hubble may know something about it . ”
45014	45023	45024	45024	I	0	“ How long was this one up there ? ”
45027	45035	45036	45036	she	303	“ Two or three days , maybe , ”
45039	45053	45036	45036	she	303	“ Finlay says it could have been a double homicide on Thursday night . ”
45130	45135	45136	45136	he	280	“ Morgue , Roscoe , ”
45139	45145	45136	45136	he	280	“ You too , Reacher . ”
45216	45223	45224	45224	Finlay	280	“ I ca n’t find Hubble , ”
45231	45250	45224	45224	Finlay	280	“ There ’s nobody up at his place . Did he say anything to you about going anywhere ? ”
45251	45254	45255	45255	I	0	“ No , ”
45258	45269	45255	45255	I	0	“ Not a word . We hardly spoke all weekend . ”
45275	45288	45289	45289	he	280	“ I need to find out what he knows about all this , ”
45292	45320	45289	45289	he	280	“ This is serious shit and he knows something about it , that ’s for damn sure . What did he tell you about it , Reacher ? ”
45402	45409	45410	45410	I	0	“ You try his mobile number ? ”
45421	45425	45426	45426	he	280	“ Switched off , ”
45429	45439	45426	45426	he	280	“ Some automatic voice came on and told me . ”
45440	45451	45452	45452	I	0	“ Did he come by and pick up his watch ? ”
45456	45460	45461	45461	he	280	“ His what ? ”
45464	45468	45469	45469	I	0	“ His watch , ”
45472	45506	45469	45469	I	0	“ He left a ten - thousand - dollar Rolex with Baker on Friday . When Baker was cuffing us for the ride out to Warburton . Did he come pick it up ? ”
45507	45510	45511	45511	Finlay	280	“ No , ”
45514	45519	45511	45511	Finlay	280	“ Nobody said so . ”
45520	45523	45524	45524	I	0	“ OK , ”
45527	45560	45524	45524	I	0	“ So he ’s got some urgent business some - where . Not even an asshole like Hubble ’s going to forget about a ten - thousand - dollar watch , right ? ”
45561	45566	45567	45567	Finlay	280	“ What urgent business ? ”
45570	45579	45567	45567	Finlay	280	“ What did he tell you about it ? ”
45580	45588	45589	45589	I	0	“ He did n’t tell me diddly , ”
45592	45602	45589	45589	I	0	“ Like I told you , we hardly spoke . ”
45612	45621	45622	45622	he	280	“ Do n’t mess with me , Reacher , ”
45625	45688	45622	45622	he	280	“ Until I get hold of Hubble , I ’m going to keep hold of you and sweat your ass for what he told you . And do n’t make out he kept his mouth shut all weekend , because guys like that never do . I know that and you know that , so do n’t mess with me , OK ? ”
45728	45738	45739	45739	I	0	“ So what ’s the story on this one ? ”
45743	45753	45754	45754	Finlay	280	“ Pretty much the same as the last one , ”
45757	45795	45754	45754	Finlay	280	“ Looks like it happened at the same time . Shot to death , probably the same weapon . This one did n’t get kicked around afterward , but it was probably part of the same incident . ”
45796	45805	45806	45806	I	0	“ You do n’t know who it is ? ”
45809	45815	45816	45816	he	280	“ His name is Sherman , ”
45819	45827	45816	45816	he	280	“ Apart from that , no idea . ”
45828	45834	45835	45835	I	0	“ Tell me about it , ”
45863	45868	45869	45869	he	280	“ Unidentified white male , ”
45872	45993	45869	45869	he	280	“ Same deal as the first one , no ID , no wallet , no distinguishing marks . But this one had a gold wristwatch , engraved on the back : to Sherman , love Judy . He was maybe thirty or thirty - five . Hard to tell , because he ’d been lying there for three nights and he was well gnawed by the small animals , you know ? His lips are gone , and his eyes , but his right hand was OK because it was folded up under his body , so I got some decent prints . We ran them an hour ago and something may come of that , if we ’re lucky . ”
45994	45998	45999	45999	I	0	“ Gunshot wounds ? ”
46006	46013	46014	46014	he	280	“ Looks like the same gun , ”
46017	46088	46014	46014	he	280	“ Small - caliber , soft - nose shells . Looks like maybe the first shot only wounded him and he was able to run . He got hit a couple more times but made it to cover under the highway . He fell down and bled to death . He did n’t get kicked around because they could n’t find him . That ’s how it looks to me . ”
46113	46122	46123	46123	I	0	“ And you figure he was called Sherman ? ”
46126	46134	46135	46135	Finlay	280	“ His name was on his watch , ”
46138	46146	46147	46147	I	0	“ Might not have been his watch , ”
46150	46175	46147	46147	I	0	“ The guy could have stolen it . Could have inherited it , bought it from a pawnshop , found it in the street . ”
46223	46231	46232	46232	I	0	“ Where the hell are we going ? ”
46235	46239	46240	46240	Finlay	280	“ County hospital , ”
46243	46263	46240	46240	Finlay	280	“ Down in Yellow Springs . Next - but - one town to the south . Not long now . ”
46547	46555	46556	46556	he	1770	“ What can I tell you folks ? ”
46575	46582	46583	46583	Finlay	280	“ Was it the same incident ? ”
46606	46618	46619	46619	he	1775	“ I ’ve only had the second corpse for an hour , ”
46622	46670	46619	46619	he	1775	“ But , yes , I would say it ’s the same incident . It ’s almost certainly the same weapon . Looks like small - caliber soft - nose bullets in both cases . The bullets were slow , looks like the gun had a silencer . ”
46671	46675	46676	46676	I	0	“ Small caliber ? ”
46679	46683	46676	46676	I	0	“ How small ? ”
46693	46701	46702	46702	he	5542	“ I ’m not a firearms expert , ”
46705	46770	46702	46702	he	5542	“ But I ’d vote for a twenty - two . Looks that small to me . I ’d say we ’re looking at soft - nose twenty - two - gauge shells . Take the first guy ’s head , for example . Two small splintery entry wounds and two big messy exit wounds , characteristic of a small soft - nose bullet . ”
46869	46872	46873	46873	I	0	“ OK , ”
46876	46887	46873	46873	I	0	“ Were they killed up there where they were found ? ”
46888	46894	46895	46896	the guy	591	“ No doubt about it , ”
46899	46907	46895	46896	the guy	591	“ Hypostasis is clear in both corpses . ”
46940	46944	46945	46945	he	591	“ Postmortem hypostasis , ”
46948	47101	46945	46945	he	591	“ Lividity . When you die , your circulation stops , right ? Heart is n’t beating anymore . Your blood obeys the law of gravity . It settles to the bottom of your body , into the lowest available vessels , usually into the tiny capillaries in the skin next to the floor or whatever you ’ve fallen down onto . The red cells settle first . They stain the skin red . Then they clot , so the stain is fixed , like a photograph . After a few hours , the stains are permanent . The stains on the first guy are entirely consistent with his position on the warehouse forecourt . He was shot , he fell down dead , he was kicked around in some sort of mad frenzy for a few minutes , then he lay there for around eight hours . No doubt about it . ”
47102	47111	47112	47112	Finlay	280	“ What do you make of the kicking ? ”
47124	47131	47132	47132	he	5542	“ Never seen anything like it , ”
47135	47205	47132	47132	he	5542	“ I ’ve read about it in the journals , time to time . Some kind of a psychopathic thing , obviously . No way to explain it . It did n’t make any difference to the dead guy . Did n’t hurt him , because he was dead . So it must have gratified the kicker somehow . Unbelievable fury , tremendous strength . The injuries are grievous . ”
47206	47213	47214	47214	Finlay	280	“ What about the second guy ? ”
47217	47223	47224	47225	the doctor	5542	“ He ran for it , ”
47228	47357	47224	47225	the doctor	5542	“ He was hit close up in the back with the first shot , but it did n’t drop him , and he ran . He took two more on the way . One in the neck , and the fatal shot in the thigh . Blew away his femoral artery . He made it as far as the raised - up section of highway , then lay down and bled to death . No doubt about that . If it had n’t rained all night Thursday , I ’m sure you ’d have seen the trail of blood on the road . There must have been about a gallon and a half lying about somewhere , because it sure as hell is n’t inside the guy anymore . ”
47407	47410	47411	47411	Finlay	280	“ OK , ”
47414	47469	47411	47411	Finlay	280	“ So we ’re safe to assume the two victims were together . The shooter is in a group of three , he surprises them , shoots the first guy in the head twice , mean - while the second guy takes off and gets hit by three shots as he runs , right ? ”
47470	47479	47480	47481	the doctor	5542	“ You ’re assuming there were three assailants ? ”
47502	47508	47509	47509	I	0	“ Three separate personality characteristics , ”
47512	47526	47509	47509	I	0	“ A competent shooter , a frenzied maniac , and an incompetent concealer . ”
47532	47538	47539	47539	he	5542	“ I ’ll buy that , ”
47542	47572	47527	47528	The doctor	5542	“ The first guy was hit at point - blank range , so maybe we should assume he knew the assailants and allowed them to get next to him ? ”
47576	47583	47584	47584	he	5542	“ Had to be that way , ”

47902	47974	47899	47899	he	1792	“ I have n’t got much at all . The body was in a hell of a mess . He was tall , he was fit , he had a shaved head . The main thing is the dental work . Looks like the guy got his teeth fixed all over the place . Some of it is American , some of it looks American , some of it is foreign . ”

He was naked . They nailed him to the wall . Six or seven big carpentry nails through his hands and up his arms . Through the fleshy parts . They nailed his feet to the floor . Then they sliced his balls off . Just hacked them off . Blood everywhere . Pretty bad , let me tell you . Then they slit his throat . Ear to ear . Bad people , Reacher . These are bad people .

But my wife was going crazy . Since last fall , she was getting agitated . It was so ironic . We were married all through those twenty years . I was working my ass off . Boston PD was a madhouse . We were working seven days a week . All day and all night . All around me guys were seeing their marriages fall apart . They were all getting divorced . One after the other . ”

But she started panicking . She did n’t want plenty of time together . She did n’t want me to retire . She did n’t want me at home . She said she woke up to the fact that she did n’t like me . Did n’t love me . Did n’t want me around . She ’d loved the twenty years . Did n’t want it to change . I could n’t believe it . It had been my dream . Twenty years and then retire at forty - five . Then maybe another twenty years enjoying ourselves together before we got too old , you know ? It was my dream and I ’d worked toward it for twenty years . But she did n’t want it . She ended up saying the thought of twenty more years with me in a cabin in the woods was making her flesh crawl . It got really bitter . We fell apart . I was a total basket case . ”

60994	61291	60991	60991	he	2215	“ Nothing else to do . She demanded it . It was terrible . I was totally out of it . Then in my last month in the department I started reading the union vacancy lists again . Saw this job down here . I called an old buddy in Atlanta FBI and asked him about it . He warned me off . He said forget it . He said it was a Mickey Mouse department in a town that was n’t even on the map . The job was called the chief of detectives , but there was only one detective . The previous guy was a weirdo who hung himself . The department was run by a fat moron . The town was run by some old Georgia type who could n’t remember slavery had been abolished . My friend up in Atlanta said forget it . But I was so screwed up I wanted it . I thought I could bury myself down here as a punishment , you know ? A kind of penance . Also , I needed the money . They were offering top dollar and I was looking at alimony and lawyer bills , you know ? So I applied for it and came down . It was Mayor Teale and Morrison who saw me . I was a basket case , Reacher . I was a wreck . I could n’t string two words together . It had to be the worst job application in the history of the world . I must have come across as an idiot . But they gave me the job . I guess they needed a black guy to look good . I ’m the first black cop in Margrave ’s history . ”

It was middle of the morning on a Monday and we had n’t done anything worth a damn about a double homicide from last Thursday night . We needed to get our asses in gear . So I went up to his house to start looking for him . ”

61669	61770	61666	61666	he	280	“ Maybe a half inch . It had a bad feel . I went in , found them upstairs in the master bedroom . It was like a butcher ’s shop . Blood everywhere . He was nailed to the wall , sort of hanging off . Both of them sliced up , him and his wife . It was terrible . About twenty - four hours of decomposition . Warm weather . Very unpleasant . So I called in the whole crew and we went over every inch and pieced it all together . Literally , I ’m afraid . ”

Like you get for the winter up north ? No chance of tracing them . They must sell millions every year . ”

62983	63016	62980	62980	he	280	“ They were cut off . They ’re not connected to him anymore . They were n’t there . They ’re missing . So how can they find them at his autopsy ? ”

63669	63679	63680	63680	Finlay	280	“ What sort of an investigator was your brother ? ”
63683	63692	63680	63680	Finlay	280	“ Who the hell was he working for ? ”
63693	63698	63699	63699	I	0	“ Do n’t know , ”

63738	63748	63735	63735	he	280	“ Time to go to work on this thing . ”
63749	63753	63754	63754	I	0	“ Walk slow , ”

63818	63827	63828	63828	Finlay	280	“ How do you know Hubble ’s dead ? ”
63850	63859	63860	63860	he	280	“ Because he was talking to an investigator ? ”
63873	63876	63877	63877	I	0	“ No , ”
63880	63999	63877	63877	I	0	“ They did n’t know about that . If they had , they ’d have got to him much earlier . Thursday at the latest . I figure they made the decision to waste him Friday , about five o’clock . Because you pulled him in with the phone number in Joe ’s shoe . They figured he could n’t be allowed to talk to cops or prison guards . So they set it up with Spivey . But Spivey ’s boys blew it , so they tried over again . His wife said he got a call to wait at home today . They were setting him up for a second attempt . Looks like it worked . ”
64004	64007	64008	64008	he	280	“ Shit , ”
64011	64043	64008	64008	he	280	“ He was the only link we had to exactly what the hell is going on here . You should have hit on him while you had the chance , Reacher . ”
64044	64049	64050	64050	I	0	“ Thanks , Finlay , ”
64053	64085	64050	64050	I	0	“ If I ’d known the dead guy was Joe , I ’d have hit on him so hard , you ’d have heard him yelling all the way over here . ”
64104	64112	64113	64113	I	0	“ I asked him what Pluribus was , ”
64116	64161	64113	64113	I	0	“ He would n’t answer . He said there were ten local people involved in the scam , plus hired help in from the outside when necessary . And he said the scam is vulnerable until something happens on Sunday . Exposed , somehow . ”
64162	64168	64169	64169	Finlay	280	“ What happens on Sunday ? ”
64172	64179	64180	64180	I	0	“ He did n’t tell me , ”
64183	64191	64192	64192	he	280	“ And you did n’t press him ? ”

64206	64212	64203	64203	I	0	“ I told you that . ”
64213	64227	64228	64228	he	280	“ And he gave you no idea what the scam is all about ? ”
64231	64235	64236	64236	I	0	“ No idea , ”
64239	64249	64250	64250	he	280	“ Did he say who these ten people are ? ”

64290	64320	64287	64287	I	0	“ I thought Hubble was just some asshole . If I could go back and do it again , I ’d do it a lot different , believe me . ”
64321	64325	64326	64326	he	280	“ Ten people ? ”
64330	64335	64336	64336	I	0	“ Not counting himself , ”
64339	64356	64336	64336	I	0	“ Not counting Sherman Stoller , either . But I assume he was counting Chief Morrison . ”
64357	64360	64361	64361	Finlay	280	“ Great , ”
64364	64374	64361	64361	Finlay	280	“ That only leaves me another nine to find . ”
64375	64384	64385	64385	I	0	“ You ’ll find one of them today , ”
64453	64461	64462	64462	I	0	“ You should be thinking about Morrison , ”
64467	64472	64473	64473	he	280	“ What about him ? ”
64476	64483	64462	64462	I	0	“ He ’s dead , right ? ”
64484	64489	64490	64490	I	0	“ But dead how ? ”
64493	64502	64490	64490	I	0	“ What should that be saying to you ? ”
64506	64514	64515	64515	he	280	“ Somebody making an example of him ? ”
64518	64522	64515	64515	he	280	“ A message ? ”
64523	64528	64529	64529	I	0	“ Correct , Finlay , ”
64532	64540	64529	64529	I	0	“ But what had he done wrong ? ”
64541	64549	64550	64550	he	280	“ Screwed something up , I guess , ”
64553	64558	64559	64559	I	0	“ Correct , Finlay , ”
64563	64597	64559	64559	I	0	“ He was told to cover up what went down at the warehouse Thursday night . That was his task for the day . He was up there at midnight , you know . ”
64598	64602	64603	64603	Finlay	280	“ He was ? ”
64606	64615	64603	64603	Finlay	280	“ You said that was a bullshit story . ”
64616	64619	64620	64620	I	0	“ No , ”
64623	64650	64620	64620	I	0	“ He did n’t see me up there . That part was the bullshit story . But he was up there himself . He saw Joe . ”
64651	64655	64656	64656	Finlay	280	“ He did ? ”
64659	64666	64656	64656	Finlay	280	“ How do you know that ? ”
64667	64678	64679	64679	I	0	“ First time he saw me was Friday , right ? ”
64682	64734	64679	64679	I	0	“ In the office ? He was staring at me like he ’d seen me before , but he could n’t place where . That was because he ’d seen Joe . He noticed a resemblance . Hubble said the same thing . He said I reminded him of his investigator . ”
64735	64741	64742	64742	Finlay	280	“ So Morrison was there ? ”
64745	64751	64742	64742	Finlay	280	“ Was he the shooter ? ”
64752	64760	64761	64761	I	0	“ Ca n’t figure it that way , ”
64764	64870	64761	64761	I	0	“ Joe was a reasonably smart guy . He would n’t let a fat idiot like Morrison shoot him . The shooter must have been somebody else . I ca n’t figure Morrison for the maniac , either . That much physical exertion would have dropped him with a heart attack . I think he was the third guy . The clean - up guy . But he did n’t search Joe ’s shoes . And because of that , Hubble got hauled in . That got somebody mad . It meant they had to waste Hubble , so Morrison was wasted as a punishment . ”
64871	64875	64876	64876	Finlay	280	“ Some punishment , ”
64879	64884	64885	64885	I	0	“ Also a message , ”
64888	64894	64876	64876	Finlay	280	“ So think about it . ”
64895	64900	64901	64901	he	280	“ Think about what ? ”
64904	64912	64901	64901	he	280	“ Was n’t a message for me . ”
64913	64922	64923	64923	I	0	“ So who was it a message for ? ”
64926	64934	64935	64935	he	280	“ Who is any such message for ? ”
64938	64947	64935	64935	he	280	“ The next guy in line , right ? ”
64951	64966	64967	64967	I	0	“ See why I was worried who was going to be the next chief ? ”
64981	64984	64985	64985	he	280	“ Christ , ”
64988	65000	64985	64985	he	280	“ You think the next chief will be in the scam ? ”
65001	65006	65007	65007	I	0	“ Got to be , ”
65010	65124	65007	65007	I	0	“ Why would they have Morrison inside ? Not for his wonderful personality , right ? They had him inside because they need the chief on board . Because that ’s useful to them in some particular way . So they would n’t waste Morrison unless they had a replacement ready . And whoever it is , we ’re looking at a very dangerous guy . He ’ll be going in there with Morrison ’s example staring him in the face . Somebody will have just whispered to him : see what we did to Morrison ? That ’s what we ’ll do to you if you screw up the way he did . ”
65125	65131	65132	65132	Finlay	280	“ So who is it ? ”
65135	65145	65132	65132	Finlay	280	“ Who ’s going to be the new chief ? ”
65146	65155	65156	65156	I	0	“ That ’s what I was asking you , ”
65188	65197	65198	65198	I	0	“ It ’s you , me and Roscoe , ”
65201	65217	65198	65198	I	0	“ Right now , the only safe thing is to assume everybody else is involved . ”
65218	65222	65223	65223	he	280	“ Why Roscoe ? ”
65226	65231	65232	65232	I	0	“ Lots of reasons , ”
65235	65306	65232	65232	I	0	“ But mainly because she worked hard to get me out of Warburton . Morrison wanted me in there as a fall guy for Thursday night , right ? So if Roscoe was inside the scam , she ’d have left me in there . But she got me out . She pulled in the exact opposite direction from Morrison . So if he was bent , she is n’t . ”
65314	65320	65321	65321	he	280	“ Only three of us ? ”
65324	65333	65321	65321	he	280	“ You ’re a cautious guy , Reacher . ”
65334	65347	65348	65348	I	0	“ You bet your ass I ’m a cautious guy , Finlay , ”
65351	65366	65348	65348	I	0	“ People are getting killed here . One of them was my only brother . ”
65414	65419	65420	65420	he	280	“ So what now ? ”
65423	65430	65431	65431	I	0	“ You got things to do , ”
65434	65481	65431	65431	I	0	“ You need to get Roscoe on one side and fill her in with the details , OK ? Tell her to take a lot of care . Then you need to make some calls and find out from Washington what Joe was doing down here . ”
65482	65485	65486	65486	Finlay	280	“ OK , ”
65489	65494	65486	65486	Finlay	280	“ What about you ? ”
65503	65515	65516	65516	I	0	“ I ’m going to have a talk with this guy , ”
65519	65526	65516	65516	I	0	“ He keeps looking at me . ”
65686	65691	65692	65692	he	5967	“ You ’re trespassing , ”
65695	65701	65702	65702	I	0	“ This is your sidewalk ? ”
65705	65710	65711	65712	the kid	5967	“ It sure is , ”
65715	65784	65711	65712	the kid	5967	“ My daddy ’s Foundation paid for every inch of it . Every brick . But I ’m not talking about the sidewalk . I ’m talking about Miss Roscoe . She ’s mine . She ’s mine , right from when I first saw her . She ’s waiting for me . Five years , she ’s been waiting for me , until the time is right . ”
65791	65796	65797	65797	I	0	“ You understand English ? ”

65826	65856	65823	65823	I	0	“ First time Miss Roscoe tells me she wants you instead of me , I ’m out of here . Until then , you back off . Understand that ? ”
65901	65904	65905	65905	he	5967	“ OK , ”
65908	65915	65905	65905	he	5967	“ No hard feelings , right ? ”
66339	66343	66344	66344	I	0	“ You OK ? ”
66347	66354	66355	66355	she	303	“ I ’ve had better days , ”
66358	66364	66365	66365	I	0	“ You up to speed ? ”
66369	66376	66365	66365	I	0	“ Finlay give you the spread ? ”
66380	66386	66387	66387	she	303	“ Finlay told me everything , ”
66432	66439	66440	66440	I	0	“ So who ’s getting it ? ”
66443	66450	66440	66440	I	0	“ Who ’s the new chief ? ”
66466	66469	66470	66470	he	280	“ Nobody , ”
66473	66484	66470	66470	he	280	“ Mayor Teale is going to run the department himself . ”
66537	66546	66547	66547	I	0	“ So what do you make of that ? ”
66551	66560	66561	66561	Roscoe	303	“ Everybody else in the department is clean , ”
66564	66572	66573	66573	I	0	“ Looks that way , I guess , ”
66576	66597	66573	66573	I	0	“ But it proves Teale himself is on board . Teale ’s their replacement , so Teale ’s their boy . ”
66598	66609	66610	66610	she	303	“ How do we know he ’s just their boy ? ”
66613	66629	66610	66610	she	303	“ Maybe he ’s the big boss . Maybe he ’s running the whole thing . ”
66630	66633	66634	66634	I	0	“ No , ”
66637	66680	66634	66634	I	0	“ The big boss had Morrison carved up as a message . If Teale was the big boss , why would he send a message to himself ? He belongs to somebody . He ’s been put in here to run interference . ”
66681	66687	66688	66688	Finlay	280	“ That ’s for sure , ”
66691	66780	66688	66688	Finlay	280	“ Started already . Told us Joe and Stoller are going on the back burner . We ’re throwing everything at the Morrison thing . Doing it ourselves , no outside help , no FBI , no nothing . He says the pride of the department is at stake . And he ’s already driving us up a blind alley . Says it ’s obvious Morrison was killed by somebody just out of prison . Somebody Morrison himself put away a long time ago , out for revenge . ”
66781	66792	66793	66793	Roscoe	303	“ And it ’s a hell of a blind alley , ”
66796	66857	66793	66793	Roscoe	303	“ We ’ve got to trawl through twenty years of old files and cross - check every name in every file against parole records from across the entire country . It could take us months . He ’s pulled Ste venson in off the road for it . Until this is over , he drives a desk . So do I. ”
66858	66867	66868	66868	Finlay	280	“ It ’s worse than a blind alley , ”
66871	66917	66868	66868	Finlay	280	“ It ’s a coded warning . Nobody in our files looks good for violent revenge . Never had that sort of crime here . We know that . And Teale knows we know that . But we ca n’t call his bluff , right ? ”
66918	66926	66927	66927	I	0	“ Ca n’t you just ignore him ? ”
66930	66937	66927	66927	I	0	“ Just do what needs doing ? ”
66956	66959	66960	66960	he	280	“ No , ”
66963	67057	66960	66960	he	280	“ We ’re working right under the enemy ’s nose . Right now , Teale ’s got no reason to think we know anything about any of this . And we ’ve got to keep it that way . We ’ve got to play dumb and act innocent , right ? That ’s going to limit our scope . But the big problem is authorization . If I need a warrant or something , I ’m going to need his signature . And I ’m not going to get it , am I ? ”
67063	67072	67073	67073	I	0	“ I ’m not planning on using warrants , ”
67076	67082	67073	67073	I	0	“ Did you call Washington ? ”
67083	67091	67092	67092	he	280	“ They ’re getting back to me , ”
67095	67108	67092	67092	he	280	“ Just hope Teale does n’t grab the phone before I can . ”
67112	67122	67123	67123	I	0	“ What you need is somewhere else to work , ”
67126	67157	67123	67123	I	0	“ What about that buddy of yours up in Atlanta FBI ? The one you told me about ? Could you use his office as a kind of private facility ? ”
67165	67171	67172	67172	he	280	“ Not a bad idea , ”
67175	67251	67172	67172	he	280	“ I ’ll have to go off the record . I ca n’t ask Teale to make a formal request , right ? I ’ll call from home , tonight . Guy called Picard . Nice guy , you ’ll like him . He ’s from the Quarter , down in New Orleans . He did a spell in Boston about a million years ago . Great big guy , very smart , very tough . ”
67252	67262	67263	67263	I	0	“ Tell him we need it kept very quiet , ”
67266	67280	67263	67263	I	0	“ We do n’t want his agents down here until we ’re ready . ”
67281	67291	67292	67292	Roscoe	303	“ What are you going to do about Teale ? ”
67296	67307	67292	67292	Roscoe	303	“ He works for the guys who killed your brother . ”
67312	67319	67320	67320	I	0	“ Depends how involved he was , ”
67323	67330	67320	67320	I	0	“ He was n’t the shooter . ”
67331	67336	67337	67337	Roscoe	303	“ He was n’t ? ”
67340	67347	67337	67337	Roscoe	303	“ How do you know that ? ”
67348	67353	67354	67354	I	0	“ Not fast enough , ”
67357	67430	67354	67354	I	0	“ Limps around with a cane in his hand . Too slow to pull a gun . Too slow to get Joe , anyway . He was n’t the kicker , either . Too old , not vigorous enough . And he was n’t the gofer . That was Morrison . But if he starts messing with me , then he ’s in deep shit . Otherwise , to hell with him . ”
67431	67436	67437	67437	she	2304	“ So what now ? ”
67449	67457	67458	67458	Finlay	280	“ I think Sunday is the thing , ”
67461	67516	67458	67458	Finlay	280	“ Sunday is going to solve some kind of a problem for them . Teale being put in here feels so temporary , you know ? The guy ’s seventy - five years old . He ’s got no police experience . It ’s a temporary fix , to get them through until Sunday . ”
67560	67565	67566	67566	she	2304	“ What about Spivey ? ”
67569	67606	67566	67566	she	2304	“ Over at Warburton ? He was ordered to arrange the attack on Hubble , right ? So he must know who gave him the order . You should go ask him . Might lead somewhere . ”
67607	67610	67611	67611	I	0	“ Maybe , ”
67620	67625	67626	67626	Finlay	280	“ Waste of time , ”
67631	67646	67626	67626	Finlay	280	“ You think Spivey ’s just going to tell you a thing like that ? ”
67652	67662	67663	67663	I	0	“ If he knows , he ’ll tell me , ”
67668	67683	67663	67663	I	0	“ A question like that , it ’s how you ask it , right ? ”
67684	67690	67691	67691	he	280	“ Take care , Reacher , ”
67694	67714	67691	67691	he	280	“ They see you getting close to what Hubble knew , they ’ll waste you like they wasted him . ”
67807	67817	67818	67818	I	0	“ Finlay , call your buddy Picard right now , ”

67864	67894	67861	67861	he	280	“ Get your ass up to Beckman . Right now . Stay there . I ’ll organize Picard . You do n’t leave until he shows up , OK ? ”
67948	67955	67956	67956	I	0	“ What time do you finish ? ”
67959	67966	67967	67967	she	303	“ About six , I guess , ”

67982	67991	67992	67992	she	303	“ You ’re a fool , Jack Reacher , ”

68144	68250	68141	68141	he	352	“ Sergeant Baker has brought me up to date on the warehouse homicides . It all seems pretty clear to me . We made a clumsy mistake in apprehending you , and we ’re all very sorry indeed about your brother , and we ’ll certainly let you know just as soon as we get to any conclusions . So before you get on your way , I ’d be grateful if you ’d kindly accept my apology on behalf of this department . I would n’t want you to take away a bad impression of us . May we just call it a mistake ? ”
68251	68256	68257	68257	I	0	“ OK , Teale , ”
68260	68270	68257	68257	I	0	“ But why do you assume I ’m leaving ? ”
68283	68292	68293	68293	he	2317	“ I understood you were just passing through , ”
68296	68315	68293	68293	he	2317	“ We have no hotel here in Margrave and I imagined you would find no opportunity to stay . ”
68316	68321	68322	68322	I	0	“ I ’m staying , ”
68325	68349	68322	68322	I	0	“ I received a generous offer of hospitality . I understand that ’s what the South is famous for , right ? Hospitality ? ”
68360	68370	68371	68371	he	2317	“ Oh , undoubtedly that ’s true , sir , ”
68374	68515	68371	68371	he	2317	“ The South as a whole , and Georgia in particular , is indeed famous for the warmth of its welcome . However , as you know , just at the present time , we find ourselves in a most awkward predicament . In the circumstances , a motel in Atlanta or Macon would really suit you much better . Naturally , we would keep in close touch , and we would extend you every assistance in arranging your brother ’s funeral , when that sad time comes . Here in Margrave , I ’m afraid , we ’re all going to be very busy . It ’ll be boring for you . Officer Roscoe ’s going to have a lot of work to do . She should n’t be distracted just at the moment , do n’t you think ? ”
68516	68523	68524	68524	I	0	“ I wo n’t distract her , ”
68528	68537	68524	68524	I	0	“ I know she ’s doing vital work . ”

68935	68942	68943	68943	she	2329	“ I do n’t want one , ”
68946	68954	68943	68943	she	2329	“ I like to do things myself . ”
68955	68962	68963	68963	I	0	“ It ’s a big house , ”
68966	68976	68977	68977	she	2329	“ I like to keep busy , I guess , ”
69032	69039	69040	69040	she	2329	“ I heard about the Morrisons , ”

69094	69120	69091	69091	I	0	“ I ’m afraid he was . But he did n’t want to be involved , OK ? Some kind of blackmail was going on . ”
69207	69215	69216	69216	she	2329	“ I ’m afraid that makes sense , ”
69233	69245	69246	69246	she	2329	“ That ’s the only way I can explain his behavior , ”
69249	69255	69246	69246	she	2329	“ Is he in danger ? ”
69256	69270	69271	69271	I	0	“ Charlie , I ’m afraid I have no idea where he is , ”

69513	69519	69520	69520	she	2329	“ I panicked this morning , ”
69523	69645	69504	69504	She	2329	“ That ’s not really like me at all . I must have given you a very bad impression , I ’m afraid . After you left , I calmed down and thought things out . I came to the same conclusion you ’ve just described . Hub ’s blundered into something and he ’s got all tangled up in it . So what am I going to do about it ? Well , I ’m going to stop panicking and start thinking . I ’ve been a mess since Friday and I ’m ashamed of it . That ’s not the real me at all . So I did something , and I hope you ’ll forgive me for it ? ”
69646	69650	69651	69651	I	0	“ Go on , ”
69654	69660	69661	69661	she	2350	“ I called Dwight Stevenson , ”
69664	69704	69661	69661	she	2350	“ He had mentioned he had seen a fax from the Pentagon about your service as a military policeman . I asked him to find it and read it to me . I thought it was an excellent record . ”
69716	69728	69729	69729	she	2350	“ So what I want to do is to hire you , ”
69732	69757	69729	69729	she	2350	“ I want to hire you in a private capacity to solve my husband ’s problem . Would you consider doing that for me ? ”
69758	69761	69762	69762	I	0	“ No , ”
69765	69774	69762	69762	I	0	“ I ca n’t do that , Charlie . ”

69786	69798	69799	69799	I	0	“ There would be a sort of a conflict of interest , ”
69802	69816	69799	69799	I	0	“ It might mean I could n’t do a proper job for you . ”
69817	69821	69822	69822	she	2350	“ A conflict ? ”
69825	69830	69822	69822	she	2350	“ In what way ? ”
69847	69855	69856	69856	I	0	“ Your husband felt bad , OK ? ”
69859	69907	69856	69856	I	0	“ He got hold of some kind of an investigator , a government guy , and they were trying to fix the situation . But the government guy got killed . And I ’m afraid my interest is in the government guy , more than your husband . ”
69917	69921	69922	69922	she	2350	“ But why ? ”
69925	69934	69922	69922	she	2350	“ You do n’t work for the government . ”
69935	69943	69944	69944	I	0	“ The government guy was my brother , ”
69948	69964	69944	69944	I	0	“ Just a crazy coincidence , I know , but I ’m stuck with it . ”
69977	69983	69984	69984	she	2350	“ I ’m very sorry , ”
69987	69997	69984	69984	she	2350	“ You ’re not saying Hub betrayed your brother ? ”
69998	70001	70002	70002	I	0	“ No , ”
70005	70036	70002	70002	I	0	“ That ’s the very last thing he would have done . He was depending on him to get him out from under . Something went wrong , is all . ”
70037	70045	70046	70046	she	2350	“ May I ask you a question ? ”
70049	70062	70046	70046	she	2350	“ Why do you refer to my husband in the past tense ? ”
70069	70075	70076	70076	I	0	“ Because he ’s dead , ”
70079	70085	70076	70076	I	0	“ I ’m very sorry . ”
70112	70121	70122	70122	she	2350	“ I do n’t think he ’s dead , ”
70125	70162	70122	70122	she	2350	“ I would know . I would be able to feel it . I think he ’s just hiding out somewhere . I want you to find him . I ’ll pay you whatever you want . ”
70172	70175	70176	70176	she	2350	“ Please , ”
70179	70188	70189	70189	I	0	“ I wo n’t do it , Charlie , ”
70192	70232	70189	70189	I	0	“ I wo n’t take your money for that . I would be exploiting you . I ca n’t take your money because I know he ’s already dead . I ’m very sorry , but there it is . ”
70258	70270	70271	70271	she	2350	“ Would you do it if I did n’t pay you ? ”
70274	70291	70271	70271	she	2350	“ Maybe you could just look around for him while you find out about your brother ? ”
70308	70311	70312	70312	I	0	“ OK , ”
70315	70344	70312	70312	I	0	“ I ’ll do that , Charlie . But like I say , do n’t expect miracles . I think we ’re looking at something very bad here . ”
70345	70352	70353	70353	she	2350	“ I think he ’s alive , ”

70592	70627	70589	70589	she	2350	“ Is n’t that something to do with politics ? Like on the podium when the president gives a speech ? I never heard Hub talking about it . He graduated in banking studies . ”

74469	74473	74474	74474	she	303	“ I guess , ”

74526	74593	74523	74523	she	303	“ By far the worst thing . But I ’m going to tell you something I would never tell anyone else . I was n’t upset . Not about Morrison . You ca n’t get upset about a guy like that . But I ’m upset about his wife . Bad enough living with a guy like Morrison without dying because of him too , right ? ”
74594	74602	74603	74603	I	0	“ What about the rest of it ? ”
74607	74610	74603	74603	I	0	“ Teale ? ”
74611	74617	74618	74618	she	303	“ I ’m not surprised , ”
74621	74699	74618	74618	she	303	“ That whole family has been scum for two hundred years . I know all about them . His family and my family go way back together . Why should he be any different ? But , God , I ’m glad everybody else in the department turned out clean . I was dreading finding out one of those guys had been in it , too . I do n’t know if I could have faced that . ”
74752	74760	74761	74761	she	303	“ You want to buy me dinner ? ”

75314	75325	75326	75326	Roscoe	303	“ So what are you going to do about Joe ? ”
75406	75419	75420	75420	she	2482	“ I think you should find out who it was killed him , ”
75423	75428	75429	75429	I	0	“ And then what ? ”
76255	76262	76263	76263	she	303	“ Is this a basic emergency ? ”
76266	76272	76273	76273	I	0	“ It will be soon , ”
76276	76286	76273	76273	I	0	“ if you do n’t take that shirt off . ”
77710	77717	77718	77718	she	303	“ So who were they after ? ”

77745	77778	77742	77742	I	0	“ They figure Hubble talked to me in prison . They figure I ’ve told you all about it . So they think you and I know whatever it was Hubble knew . ”
77902	77912	77913	77913	she	303	“ Thank God we were n’t here last night , ”
77967	77975	77976	77976	I	0	“ I wish we had been here , ”

78013	78018	78010	78010	she	303	“ Killed four men ? ”
78019	78023	78024	78024	I	0	“ Only three , ”
78027	78037	78024	78024	I	0	“ The fourth would have given us the answers . ”
78166	78182	78183	78183	I	0	“ It ’s going to take more than four little country boys to get me , ”
78186	78237	78183	78183	I	0	“ Who are they kidding ? I ’ve shit better opponents than that . They come in here again , they ’ll go out in a bucket . And I ’ll tell you what , Roscoe , someone even thinks about hurting you , they die before they finish thinking . ”

78292	78302	78289	78289	I	0	“ Stick with me and you ’ll be OK . ”
78314	78317	78318	78318	she	303	“ Promise ? ”
78321	78328	78329	78329	I	0	“ You got it , babe , ”
78366	78376	78377	78377	I	0	“ Now we get the hell out of here , ”
78380	78399	78377	78377	I	0	“ We ca n’t stay around like sitting targets . So throw what you need into a bag . ”
78400	78403	78404	78404	she	303	“ OK , ”
78407	78417	78404	78404	she	303	“ Are we going to fix my door first ? ”

78438	78553	78435	78435	I	0	“ If we fix it , it means we ’ve seen it . If we ’ve seen it , it means we know we ’re under attack . Better if they figure we do n’t know we ’re under attack . Because then they ’ll figure they do n’t need to be too careful next time . So we do n’t react at all . We make out we have n’t been back here . We make out we have n’t seen the door . We carry on acting dumb and innocent . If they think we ’re dumb and innocent , they ’ll get careless . Easier to spot them coming next time . ”
78554	78557	78558	78558	she	2594	“ OK , ”
78572	78582	78583	78583	I	0	“ So throw what you need into a bag , ”

78664	78668	78669	78669	I	0	“ Got to , ”
78672	78772	78669	78669	I	0	“ Ca n’t do anything different from normal . And we need to speak with Finlay . He ’s expecting the call from Washington . And we need what we can get on Sherman Stoller . But do n’t worry , they ’re not going to gun us down in the middle of the squad room . They ’ll go for somewhere quiet and isolated , probably at night . Teale ’s the only bad guy up there , so just do n’t be on your own with him . Stick around Finlay or Baker or Stevenson , OK ? ”
78813	78816	78817	78817	she	2597	“ Promise ? ”

79034	79043	79044	79044	she	303	“ Foundation ’s got a lot of trucks , ”

79059	79065	79066	79066	she	303	“ Big deal around here , ”
79069	79106	79066	79066	she	303	“ Old man Kliner . The town sold him the land for his warehouses and part of the deal was he set up a community program . Teale runs it out of the mayor ’s office . ”
79107	79112	79113	79113	I	0	“ Teale runs it ? ”
79116	79122	79113	79113	I	0	“ Teale ’s the enemy . ”
79123	79133	79134	79134	she	303	“ He runs it because he ’s the mayor , ”
79137	79193	79134	79134	she	303	“ Not because he ’s Teale . The program assigns a lot of money , spends it on public things , roads , gardens , the library , local business grants . Gives the police department a hell of a lot . Gives me a mortgage subsidy , just because I ’m with the department . ”
79194	79202	79203	79203	I	0	“ Gives Teale a lot of power , ”
79206	79233	79203	79203	I	0	“ And what ’s the story with the Kliner boy ? He tried to warn me off you . Made out he had a prior claim . ”
79237	79243	79244	79244	she	303	“ He ’s a jerk , ”
79247	79261	79244	79244	she	303	“ I avoid him when I can . You should do the same . ”
79538	79543	79544	79544	she	303	“ That ’s Kliner , ”
79547	79553	79544	79544	she	303	“ The old man himself . ”
79742	79752	79753	79753	I	0	“ So tell me more about these Kliner people , ”
79761	79764	79765	79765	she	303	“ Why ? ”
79768	79785	79765	79765	she	303	“ We ’re fighting for our lives here and you want to talk about the Kliners ? ”
79786	79793	79794	79794	I	0	“ I ’m looking for information , ”
79797	79844	79794	79794	I	0	“ Kliner ’s name crops up everywhere . He looks like an interesting guy . His son is a piece of work . And I saw his wife . She looked unhappy . I ’m wondering if all that ’s got anything to do with anything . ”
79852	79859	79860	79860	she	303	“ I do n’t see how , ”
79863	79964	79860	79860	she	303	“ They ’re newcomers , only been here five years . The family made a fortune in cotton processing , generations back , over in Mississippi . Invented some kind of a new chemical thing , some kind of a new formula . Chlorine or sodium something , I do n’t know for sure . Made a huge fortune , but they ran into trouble with the EPA over there , you know , about five years ago , pollution or something . There were fish dying all the way down to New Orleans because of dumping into the river . ”
79965	79970	79971	79971	I	0	“ So what happened ? ”
79975	79982	79983	79983	she	303	“ Kliner moved the whole plant , ”
79986	80038	79983	79983	she	303	“ The company was his by then . He shut down the whole Mississippi operation and set it up again in Venezuela or somewhere . Then he tried to diversify . He turned up here in Georgia five years ago with this warehouse thing , consumer goods , electronics or something . ”
80039	80046	80047	80047	I	0	“ So they ’re not local ? ”
80050	80059	80060	80060	she	303	“ Never saw them before five years ago , ”
80063	80105	80060	80060	she	303	“ Do n’t know much about them . But I never heard anything bad . Kliner ’s probably a tough guy , maybe even ruthless , but he ’s OK as long as you ’re not a fish , I guess . ”
80106	80115	80116	80116	I	0	“ So why is his wife so scared ? ”
80124	80130	80131	80131	she	303	“ She ’s not scared , ”
80134	80163	80131	80131	she	303	“ She ’s sick . Maybe she ’s scared because she ’s sick . She ’s going to die , right ? That ’s not Kliner ’s fault . ”
80224	80233	80234	80234	Roscoe	303	“ Pluribus means nothing at all to you ? ”
80237	80253	80234	80234	Roscoe	303	“ You guys never knew anything about some Pluribus thing ? When you were kids ? ”
80262	80267	80268	80268	she	303	“ Is it Latin ? ”
80271	80284	80285	80285	I	0	“ It ’s part of the United States ’ motto , right ? ”
80288	80310	80285	80285	I	0	“ E Pluribus Unum . It means out of many , one . One nation built out of many former colonies . ”
80311	80317	80318	80318	she	303	“ So Pluribus means many ? ”
80321	80327	80318	80318	she	303	“ Did Joe know Latin ? ”
80331	80338	80339	80339	I	0	“ I ’ve got no idea , ”
80342	80365	80339	80339	I	0	“ Probably . He was a smart guy . He probably knew bits and pieces of Latin . I ’m not sure . ”
80366	80369	80370	80370	she	303	“ OK , ”
80373	80387	80370	80370	she	303	“ You got no other ideas at all why Joe was down here ? ”
80388	80393	80394	80394	I	0	“ Money , maybe , ”
80397	80458	80394	80394	I	0	“ That ’s all I can think of . Joe worked for the Treasury Department , as far as I know . Hubble worked for a bank . Their only thing in common would be money . Maybe we ’ll find out from Washington . If we do n’t , we ’re going to have to start from the beginning . ”
80459	80462	80463	80463	she	303	“ OK , ”

80472	80482	80483	80483	I	0	“ I ’ll need that arrest report from Florida , ”
80486	80491	80492	80492	she	303	“ For Sherman Stoller ? ”

80503	80509	80510	80510	I	0	“ Got to start somewhere , ”
80513	80522	80523	80523	she	303	“ OK , I ’ll ask for it , ”
80526	80535	80523	80523	she	303	“ I ’ll call Florida . Anything else ? ”
80536	80542	80543	80543	I	0	“ I need a gun , ”

80585	80619	80581	80581	I	0	“ This is a big deal , right ? So I ’ll need a weapon . I ca n’t just go to the store and buy one . No ID , no address . ”
80620	80623	80624	80624	she	303	“ OK , ”
80627	80634	80624	80624	she	303	“ I ’ll get you one . ”

Whatever the hell he was doing , it looks like Joe knew he would have won or lost by then . But she would n’t say anything more . She was out of line talking to me at all and she sounded like she was being overheard . So call her , but do n’t pin your hopes on her , Reacher . She may not know anything . Left hand does n’t know what the right hand is doing up there . Big - time secrecy , right ? ”

81692	81761	81679	81679	I	0	“ No other way . You can sell Teale some story . You can double bluff him . Tell him you figure the escaped con who he says did the Morrison thing must have been in a rental car . Tell him you need to check it out . He ca n’t say no to that , or else he ’s undermining his own cover story , right ? ”

I bet it ’s in his hotel room , just sitting there , covered with phone numbers , with Hubble ’s number torn off the top .

Heavy bruising on the forearms and the upper arms , some ligament damage from twisting the arms up her back . Obviously the bruising continued to develop from the time she was first seized until the time she died . The bruising stops developing when the circulation stops , you understand ? ”

Slightly rough hands , a fair bit of old diesel fuel ingrained in the skin . Also traces of old diesel fuel on the soles of his shoes . Internally , a poor diet , high in fat , plus a bit too much hydrogen sulfide in the blood gases and the tissues . This guy spent his life on the road , sniffing other people ’s catalytic converters . I make him a truck driver , because of the diesel fuel . ”

Printing money in the States just does n’t happen anymore . Joe made sure of that . It all happens abroad . Any fakes we get here are shipped in . That ’s what Joe spent his time chasing . International stuff . Why he was in Georgia , I do n’t know . I really do n’t . But I ’ll find out tomorrow , I promise you that . ”

86908	86920	86905	86905	he	591	“ Big overhead , small margin . It had to go . ”
86921	86930	86931	86931	I	0	“ And Hubble was a part of that ? ”
86938	86946	86947	86947	he	591	“ Mr. Hubble was our currency manager , ”
86950	86962	86947	86947	he	591	“ It was an important position . He was very good . ”
86963	86971	86972	86972	I	0	“ So what was his exact role ? ”
87004	87010	87011	87011	he	591	“ Do you understand cash ? ”
87014	87020	87021	87021	I	0	“ I ’ve got some , ”
87024	87036	87021	87021	I	0	“ I do n’t know if I understand it , exactly . ”
87087	87092	87093	87093	he	591	“ Take that gentleman , ”
87096	87168	87093	87093	he	591	“ Let ’s make a few guesses , shall we ? Probably lives in the outer suburbs , maybe has a vacation cabin somewhere , two big mortgages , two cars , half a dozen mutual funds , IRA provision , some blue chip stock , college plans , five or six credit cards , store cards , charge cards . Net worth about a half million , shall we say ? ”
87169	87172	87173	87173	I	0	“ OK , ”
87176	87185	87186	87187	the guy	591	“ But how much cash does he have ? ”
87191	87195	87196	87196	I	0	“ No idea , ”
87199	87205	87206	87206	he	591	“ Probably about fifty dollars , ”
87209	87226	87206	87206	he	591	“ About fifty dollars in a leather billfold which cost him a hundred and fifty dollars . ”
87250	87257	87258	87258	he	591	“ The U.S. economy is huge , ”
87261	87348	87258	87258	he	591	“ Net assets and net liabilities are incalculably large . Trillions of dollars . But almost none of it is actually represented by cash . That gentleman had a net worth of a half million dollars , but only fifty of it was in actual cash . All the rest of it is on paper or in computers . The fact is , there is n’t much actual cash around . There ’s only about a hundred and thirty billion actual cash dollars inside the whole U.S. ”
87355	87362	87363	87363	I	0	“ Sounds like enough to me , ”
87373	87381	87382	87382	he	591	“ But how many people are there ? ”
87386	87462	87366	87367	The guy	591	“ Nearly three hundred million . That ’s only about four hundred and fifty actual cash dollars per head of population . That ’s the problem a retail bank has to deal with , day by day . Four hundred and fifty dollars is a very modest cash withdrawal , but if everybody chose to make such a withdrawal , the nation ’s banks would run out of cash in the blink of an eye . ”
87473	87476	87477	87477	I	0	“ OK , ”
87480	87485	87477	87477	I	0	“ I see that . ”
87486	87497	87498	87498	he	591	“ And most of that cash is n’t in banks , ”
87501	87652	87498	87498	he	591	“ It ’s in Vegas or at the racetrack . It ’s concentrated in what we call cash - intensive areas of the economy . So a good currency manager , and Mr. Hubble was one of the very best , has a constant battle just to keep enough paper dollars on hand in our part of the system . He has to reach out and find them . He has to know where to locate them . He has to sniff them out . It ’s not easy . In the end , it was one of the factors which made retail so expensive for us . One of the reasons why we pulled out . We kept it going as long as we could , but we had to close the operation eventually . We had to let Mr. Hubble go . We were very sorry about it . ”
87653	87662	87663	87663	I	0	“ Any idea where he ’s working now ? ”
87671	87677	87678	87678	he	2804	“ I ’m afraid not , ”
87681	87689	87690	87690	I	0	“ Must be working somewhere , right ? ”
87700	87710	87711	87711	he	591	“ Professionally , he ’s dropped out of sight , ”
87714	87784	87693	87694	The guy	591	“ He ’s not working in banking , I ’m sure of that . His institute membership lapsed immediately , and we ’ve never had an inquiry for a recommendation . I ’m sorry , but I ca n’t help you . If he was working anywhere in banking , I ’d know it , I can assure you of that . He must be in something else now . ”
88036	88041	88042	88042	she	303	“ Hello , Reacher , ”
88045	88055	88042	88042	she	303	“ Come to take me away from all this ? ”
88056	88061	88062	88062	I	0	“ What ’s new ? ”
88090	88095	88096	88096	she	303	“ Couple of things , ”
88099	88140	88096	88096	she	303	“ Teale ’s got a Foundation board meeting in ten minutes . I ’m getting the fax from Florida soon as he ’s out of here . And we ’re due a call from the state police about abandoned cars . ”
88141	88152	88153	88153	I	0	“ Where ’s the gun you ’ve got for me ? ”
88172	88179	88180	88180	she	303	“ It ’s in a box , ”
88183	88212	88180	88180	she	303	“ In my desk . We ’ll have to wait until Teale is gone . And do n’t open it here , OK ? Nobody knows about it . ”
88332	88337	88338	88338	he	273	“ Teale ’s gone , ”
88437	88447	88448	88448	I	0	“ She ’s got the damn mobile switched off , ”
88497	88505	88506	88506	I	0	“ Does Baker want in on this ? ”
88510	88515	88516	88516	she	303	“ He seems to , ”
88519	88538	88516	88516	she	303	“ Finlay ’s got him acting as a kind of a lookout . Should we get him involved ? ”
88552	88555	88556	88556	I	0	“ No , ”
88559	88571	88556	88556	I	0	“ Smaller the better , a thing like this , right ? ”
88603	88606	88607	88607	I	0	“ Damn , ”

88725	88734	88722	88722	Roscoe	303	“ I got the stuff on Sherman Stoller . ”
88747	88750	88751	88751	I	0	“ Great , ”
88754	88761	88751	88751	I	0	“ Let ’s take a look . ”
88771	88778	88779	88779	he	280	“ State guys are calling back , ”

88791	88794	88795	88795	I	0	“ Great , ”
88799	88806	88795	88795	I	0	“ Maybe we ’re getting somewhere . ”

88857	88863	88854	88854	I	0	“ Did you know that ? ”
88864	88870	88871	88871	Roscoe	303	“ Who ’s Blind Blake ? ”
88874	88877	88878	88878	Finlay	280	“ Singer , ”

89130	89133	89134	89134	Finlay	280	“ Interesting , ”
89137	89182	89134	89134	Finlay	280	“ The guy ’s three hundred miles from home , it ’s midnight , and he gets lawyered up within twenty minutes ? With a partner from a respected firm ? Stoller was some kind of a truck driver , that ’s for sure . ”
89183	89189	89190	89190	I	0	“ You recognize his address ? ”
89199	89203	89204	89204	she	303	“ Not really , ”

89227	89234	89235	89235	he	273	“ State police on the line , ”
89238	89248	89220	89220	Baker	273	“ Sounds like they got a car for you . ”
89263	89266	89267	89267	he	280	“ OK , ”
89270	89278	89267	89267	he	280	“ Punch it through here , Baker . ”
89312	89315	89316	89316	he	280	“ OK , ”
89319	89327	89316	89316	he	280	“ Let ’s go take a look . ”
89360	89367	89368	89368	he	273	“ What should I tell Teale ? ”
89371	89379	89380	89380	Finlay	280	“ Tell him we traced the car , ”
89383	89409	89380	89380	Finlay	280	“ The one the crazy ex - con used to get down to Morrison ’s place . Tell him we ’re making some real progress , OK?”<empty
89534	89541	89542	89542	Finlay	280	“ They noticed it Friday morning , ”
89545	89564	89542	89542	Finlay	280	“ Was n’t here Thursday , they ’re sure about that . It could have been Joe ’s . ”
89719	89726	89727	89727	Finlay	280	“ So what do you think ? ”
89730	89736	89737	89737	I	0	“ Could be the one , ”
89740	89794	89737	89737	I	0	“ Say he rented it Thursday evening up at the airport in Atlanta , full tank of gas . Drove it to the warehouses at the Margrave cloverleaf , then somebody drove it on down here afterward . Couple of gallons gone , maybe two and a half . Plenty left to burn . ”
89798	89802	89803	89803	he	280	“ Makes sense , ”
89806	89903	89803	89803	he	280	“ But they ’d have to be local guys . This is a great spot to dump a car , right ? Pull onto the shoulder up there , wheels in the dirt , push the car off the edge , scramble down and torch it , then jump in with your buddy who ’s already down here in his own car waiting for you , and you ’re away . But only if you knew about this little maintenance track . And only a local guy would know about this little maintenance track , right ? ”
89926	89934	89935	89935	he	567	“ Teale wants you in the office , ”
89952	89959	89960	89960	I	0	“ Keep him talking a while , ”
89963	89977	89960	89960	I	0	“ Give Roscoe a chance to phone in that number from the car . ”

90130	90138	90127	90127	I	0	“ Now make those calls , OK ? ”
90999	91006	91007	91007	I	0	“ What was that all about ? ”
91014	91021	91022	91022	he	280	“ I was winding him up , ”
91025	91069	91022	91022	he	280	“ He asked what we ’d been doing , looking at a car . I said we were n’t . Said we ’d told Baker we were n’t going far , but he ’d misheard it as we ’re looking at a car . ”
91070	91076	91077	91077	I	0	“ Take care , Finlay , ”
91080	91092	91077	91077	I	0	“ They ’re killing people . This is a big deal . ”
91096	91103	91104	91104	he	280	“ It ’s driving me crazy , ”
91107	91116	91093	91093	He	280	“ Got to have some fun , right ? ”
91130	91137	91138	91138	I	0	“ What ’s happening with Picard ? ”
91142	91148	91138	91138	I	0	“ You heard from him ? ”
91149	91152	91153	91153	he	280	“ Nothing , ”

91162	91176	91177	91177	I	0	“ No possibility he might have put a couple of guys on surveillance ? ”
91190	91194	91195	91195	he	280	“ No way , ”
91198	91207	91195	91195	he	280	“ Not without telling me first . Why ? ”
91208	91219	91220	91220	I	0	“ There ’s a couple of guys watching this place , ”
91223	91251	91220	91220	I	0	“ Got here about ten minutes ago . Plain brown sedan . They were at Hubble ’s yesterday and around town this morning , asking after me . ”
91258	91265	91266	91266	he	280	“ They ’re not Picard ’s , ”
91269	91276	91266	91266	he	280	“ He ’d have told me . ”
91301	91306	91307	91307	she	303	“ I called Detroit , ”
91310	91370	91307	91307	she	303	“ It was a Pontiac . Delivered four months ago . Big fleet order for a rental company . DMV is tracing the registration . I told them to get back to Picard up in Atlanta . The rental people might be able to give him the story about where it was rented . We might be getting somewhere . ”
91388	91391	91392	91392	I	0	“ Great , ”
91397	91428	91392	91392	I	0	“ Good work , Roscoe . I ’m out of here . Meet you back here at six . You two stick close together , OK ? Watch your backs . ”
91429	91435	91436	91436	Finlay	280	“ Where are you going ? ”
91439	91450	91451	91451	I	0	“ I ’m going for a drive in the country , ”
94054	94062	94063	94063	I	0	“ Anything from the car rental people ? ”
94072	94075	94076	94076	she	303	“ Tomorrow , ”

94093	94096	94097	94097	I	0	“ OK , ”
94100	94110	94097	94097	I	0	“ What hotels you got up at the airport ? ”
94212	94216	94217	94217	she	303	“ Two down , ”
94220	94231	94217	94217	she	303	“ Good work , Reacher . Were they the ones ? ”
94232	94237	94238	94238	I	0	“ From last night ? ”
94241	94266	94238	94238	I	0	“ No . They were n’t local . We ca n’t count them in Hubble ’s ten . They were hired help from outside . ”
94267	94273	94274	94274	she	303	“ Were they any good ? ”
94292	94296	94297	94297	I	0	“ Not really , ”
94300	94307	94297	94297	I	0	“ Not good enough , anyway . ”
94326	94335	94336	94336	she	303	“ So is he one of the ten ? ”
94339	94342	94336	94336	she	303	“ Spivey ? ”
94348	94351	94352	94352	I	0	“ No , ”
94355	94380	94352	94352	I	0	“ I ca n’t see it . He was outside help , too . Nobody would have a slug like that on the inside . ”
94457	94466	94467	94467	I	0	“ I ’m going to call Molly again , ”
94470	94491	94467	94467	I	0	“ I ’m getting in pretty deep . I need some background . There are things I do n’t understand . ”
94516	94521	94522	94522	I	0	“ Can you talk ? ”
94544	94552	94553	94553	she	371	“ It ’s too soon , Jack , ”
94556	94566	94553	94553	she	371	“ I ca n’t get the stuff until tomorrow . ”
94567	94572	94573	94573	I	0	“ I need background , ”
94576	94607	94573	94573	I	0	“ I need to understand this international stuff Joe was doing . I need to know why things are happening here , if the action is supposed to be overseas . ”
94617	94622	94623	94623	she	371	“ OK , background , ”
94626	94725	94623	94623	she	371	“ I guess Joe ’s assumption was it ’s maybe controlled from this country . And it ’s a very difficult problem to explain , but I ’ll try . The forging happens abroad , and the trick is most of it stays abroad . Only a few of the fake bills ever come back here , which is not a huge deal domestically , but obviously it ’s something we want to stop . But abroad , it presents a completely different type of problem . You know how much cash is inside the U.S. , Jack ? ”
94738	94746	94747	94747	I	0	“ A hundred and thirty billion dollars , ”
94750	94753	94754	94754	she	371	“ Right , ”
94757	94837	94754	94754	she	371	“ But exactly twice that much is held offshore . That ’s a fact . People all over the world are holding onto two hundred and sixty billion dollars ’ worth of American cash . It ’s in safety deposits in London , Rome , Berlin , Moscow , stuffed into mattresses all over South America , Eastern Europe , hidden under floorboards , false walls , in banks , travel agencies , everywhere . And why is that ? ”
94838	94843	94844	94844	I	0	“ Do n’t know , ”
94847	94859	94860	94860	she	371	“ Because the dollar is the world ’s most trusted currency , ”
94863	94886	94860	94860	she	371	“ People believe in it . They want it . And naturally , the government is very , very happy about that . ”
94887	94895	94896	94896	I	0	“ Good for the ego , right ? ”
94910	94918	94919	94919	she	371	“ It ’s not an emotional thing , ”
94922	95043	94919	94919	she	371	“ It ’s business . Think about it , Jack . If there ’s a hundred - dollar bill in somebody ’s bureau in Bucharest , that means somebody somewhere once exchanged a hundred dollars ’ worth of foreign assets for it . It means our government sold them a piece of paper with green and black ink on it for a hundred bucks . Good business . And because it ’s a trusted currency , chances are that hundred - dollar bill will probably stay in that bureau in Bucharest for many years . The U.S. will never have to deliver the foreign assets back again . As long as the dollar stays trusted , we ca n’t lose . ”
95044	95051	95052	95052	I	0	“ So what ’s the problem ? ”
95056	95061	95062	95062	Molly	371	“ Difficult to describe , ”
95065	95192	95062	95062	Molly	371	“ It ’s all about trust and faith . It ’s almost metaphysical . If foreign markets are getting flooded with fake dollars , that does n’t really matter in itself . But if the people in those foreign markets find out , then it does matter . Because they panic . They lose their faith . They lose their trust . They do n’t want dollars anymore . They ’ll turn to Japanese yen or German marks to stuff their mattresses with . They ’ll get rid of their dollars . In effect , overnight , the government would have to repay a two - hundred - sixty - billion - dollar foreign loan . Overnight . And we could n’t do that , Jack . ”
95193	95197	95198	95198	I	0	“ Big problem , ”
95201	95207	95208	95208	she	371	“ That ’s the truth , ”
95211	95301	95208	95208	she	371	“ And a remote problem . The fakes are all made abroad , and they ’re mostly distributed abroad . It makes sense that way . The factories are hidden away in some remote foreign region , where we do n’t know about them , and the fakes are distributed to foreigners who are happy as long as the stuff looks vaguely like real dollars are supposed to look . That ’s why not very many are imported . Only the very best fakes come back to the States . ”
95302	95308	95309	95309	I	0	“ How many come back ? ”
95330	95334	95335	95335	she	371	“ Not many , ”
95338	95350	95335	95335	she	371	“ A few billion , now and then , I guess . ”
95351	95356	95357	95357	I	0	“ A few billion ? ”
95360	95366	95357	95357	I	0	“ That ’s not many ? ”
95367	95374	95375	95375	she	371	“ A drop in the ocean , ”
95378	95397	95375	95375	she	371	“ From a macroeconomic point of view . Compared to the size of the economy , I mean . ”

Lived with us for a while . Then we moved out here . Left his folks in the old house . He made good money for three years . Busy all the time . Then it stopped , a year ago . He hardly worked at all since . Just an odd day , now and then . ”

We got lawyers and doctors and all sorts living here . And he had enough saved so he did n’t have to work at all since last September . If he did all that on the level , then I ’m the First Lady , right ? ”

Kept everything neat and tidy . You said he was a meticulous guy , right ? ”

So I figured he meant some kind of a business grant , a thousand bucks a year , right ? ”

It comes in by boat and they ’re hauling it up from Florida to the warehouse in Margrave . Then they ’re trucking it north and west , up to the big cities , L.A. , Chicago , Detroit , New York , Boston . They ’re feeding it into the cash flows in the big cities . It ’s an international counterfeit money distribution network . It ’s obvious , Finlay . ”

113028	113101	113024	113024	she	3610	“ Think of Sherman Stoller . He drove up and down to Florida to meet the boat coming in from the sea , at Jacksonville Beach .

113114	113199	113111	113111	she	3610	“ Think of a map of the States . The money is printed in South America , comes here by sea . Lands in Florida . Flows up the southeast , and then sort of branches out from Margrave . Flows on out to L.A. in the west , up to Chicago in the middle , New York and Boston in the east . Separate branches , right ? It looks like a candelabra or a menorah . You know what a menorah is ? ”

113224	113270	113221	113221	she	3610	“ That ’s how it looks on a map . Florida to Margrave is the stem . Then the individual arms lead out and up to the big cities , L.A. across to Chicago across to Boston . It ’s an import network , Finlay . ”
113507	113515	113516	113516	he	280	“ What about the last twelve months ? ”
113519	113610	113516	113516	he	280	“ There ’s been no import flow at all . Look at Gray ’s list . The incoming deliveries did n’t happen . They stopped exactly a year ago . Sherman Stoller got laid off , right ? There ’s been nothing coming up for a year . But they ’re still distributing something . There were still six trucks a day going out . Nothing coming in , but six trucks a day going out ? What does that mean ? What kind of an import flow is that ? ”
113622	113629	113630	113630	she	303	“ The answer ’s in here , ”
113633	113819	113630	113630	she	303	“ It ’s been in the papers since Friday . The Coast Guard . Last September , they started their big operation against smuggling , right ? There was a lot of advance publicity . Kliner must have known it was coming . So he built up a stockpile ahead of time . See Gray ’s list ? For the six months before last September , he doubled the incoming deliveries . He was building up a stockpile in the warehouse . He ’s kept on distributing it all year . That ’s why they ’ve been panicking about exposure . They ’ve been sitting there on top of a massive stockpile of counterfeit money for a year . Now the Coast Guard is going to abandon its operation , right ? So they can start importing again as usual . That ’s what ’s going to happen on Sunday . That ’s what poor Molly meant when she said we have to get in before Sunday . We have to get in the warehouse while the last of the stockpile is still in there . ”</section><section><title

115162	115170	115171	115171	I	0	“ Then we ’ll check it out , ”
115174	115190	115171	115171	I	0	“ We ’ll have to speak to that doctor again . Down in Yellow Springs . ”
115191	115200	115201	115201	she	303	“ But he ’d have said , right ? ”
115205	115222	115201	115201	she	303	“ If he ’d had doubts , would n’t he have raised them at the time ? ”
115223	115232	115233	115233	I	0	“ He ’d have raised them with Morrison , ”
115236	115264	115233	115233	I	0	“ Morrison would have ignored them . Because his people had caused them in the first place . We ’ll have to check it out for ourselves . ”
115268	115275	115276	115276	she	303	“ I was at his funeral , ”
115279	115323	115276	115276	she	303	“ We were all there . Chief Morrison made a speech on the lawn outside the church . So did Mayor Teale . They said he was a fine officer . They said he was Margrave ’s finest . But they killed him . ”
115569	115574	115575	115575	he	5542	“ Morning , folks , ”
115578	115586	115575	115575	he	5542	“ What can I do for you ? ”
115622	115627	115628	115628	she	303	“ February this year , ”
115631	115648	115628	115628	she	303	“ My chief of detectives up at the Margrave PD killed himself . Do you remember ? ”
115649	115657	115658	115659	the doctor	5542	“ Was that some guy called Gray ? ”
115701	115704	115705	115705	he	5542	“ February , ”
115708	115711	115705	115705	he	5542	“ Gray . ”
115750	115753	115754	115754	he	5542	“ Gray , ”
115758	115802	115754	115754	he	5542	“ Yes , I remember this guy . Hung himself , right ? First time we had a Margrave case in thirty years . I was called up to his house . In the garage , was n’t it ? From a rafter ? ”
115803	115808	115809	115809	Roscoe	303	“ That ’s right , ”
115816	115824	115825	115826	the doctor	5542	“ So how can I help you ? ”
115829	115835	115836	115836	she	303	“ Anything wrong with it ? ”
115850	115863	115864	115864	he	5542	“ Guy hangs himself , there ’s always something wrong with it , ”
115867	115874	115875	115875	I	0	“ Anything specially wrong with it ? ”
115890	115893	115894	115894	he	5542	“ Suspicious ? ”
115911	115919	115920	115920	I	0	“ Was there anything suspicious about it ? ”
115929	115932	115933	115933	he	5542	“ No , ”
115936	115988	115924	115924	He	5542	“ Suicide by hanging . Open and shut . He was on a kitchen stool in his garage . Made himself a noose , jumped off the stool . Everything was consistent . We got the background story from the local people up there . I could n’t see a problem . ”
115989	115996	115997	115997	Roscoe	303	“ What was the background story ? ”
116014	116019	116020	116020	he	5542	“ He was depressed , ”
116023	116123	116020	116020	he	5542	“ Had been for a while . The night it happened he was out drinking with his chief , who was the Morrison guy we just had in here , and the town mayor up there , some guy called Teale . The three of them were drowning their sorrows over some case Gray had screwed up on . He got falling down drunk and they had to help him home . They got him in to his house and left him there . He must have felt bad . He made it to the garage and hung himself . ”
116124	116130	116131	116131	Roscoe	303	“ That was the story ? ”
116134	116140	116141	116142	the doctor	5542	“ Morrison signed a statement , ”
116145	116167	116141	116142	the doctor	5542	“ He was real upset . Felt he should have done more , you know , stayed with him or something . ”
116168	116176	116177	116177	she	5542	“ Did it sound right to you ? ”
116181	116190	116191	116191	he	5542	“ I did n’t know Gray at all , ”
116194	116248	116191	116191	he	5542	“ This facility deals with a dozen police departments . I ’d never seen anybody from Margrave before then . Quiet sort of a place , right ? At least , it used to be . But what happened with this guy is consistent with what usually happens . Drinking sets people off . ”
116249	116254	116255	116255	I	0	“ Any physical evidence ? ”
116272	116278	116279	116279	he	5542	“ Corpse stank of whiskey , ”
116282	116312	116279	116279	he	5542	“ Some fresh bruising on the upper and lower arms . Consistent with him being walked home by two men while inebriated . I could n’t see a problem . ”
116313	116320	116321	116321	Roscoe	303	“ Did you do a postmortem ? ”
116331	116335	116336	116336	he	5542	“ No need , ”
116339	116460	116336	116336	he	5542	“ It was open and shut , we were very busy . Like I say , we have more to worry about down here than suicides over in Margrave . February , we had cases all over the place . Up to our eyes . Your Chief Morrison asked for minimum fuss . I think he sent us a note . Said it was kind of sensitive . Did n’t want Gray ’s family to know that the old guy had been blind drunk . Wanted to preserve some kind of dignity . It was OK with me . I could n’t see a problem and we were very busy , so I released the body for cremation right away . ”
116490	116495	116496	116496	he	5542	“ OK , folks ? ”
116499	116513	116496	116496	he	5542	“ If you ’ll excuse me , I ’ve got things to do . ”
116566	116571	116572	116572	I	0	“ I ’m sorry , ”
116575	116584	116585	116585	she	303	“ A bullshit story from beginning to end , ”
116588	116707	116585	116585	she	303	“ He had n’t just screwed up on a case . He never screwed up on any case . He was n’t especially depressed . And he did n’t drink . Never touched a drop . So he certainly was n’t falling down drunk . And he would never socialize with Morrison . Or the damn mayor . He just would n’t . He did n’t like them . Never in a million years would he spend a social evening with them . And he had no family . So all that stuff about his family and sensitivity and dignity is total bullshit . They killed him and bullshitted the coroner so he would n’t look too closely . ”
116740	116750	116751	116751	she	3669	“ Do you think it was Morrison and Teale ? ”
116755	116760	116761	116761	I	0	“ And somebody else , ”
116764	116849	116761	116761	I	0	“ There were three guys involved . I figure the three of them went around to his place and knocked on the door . Gray opened up and Teale pulled a gun . Morrison and the third guy grabbed him and held him by the arms . That explains the bruising . Teale maybe poured a bottle of whiskey down his throat , or at least splashed it all over his clothes . They hustled him off to the garage and strung him up . ”
116887	116892	116893	116893	she	303	“ They killed him , ”
116901	116917	116893	116893	she	303	“ Like they killed Joe . I think I know how you must be feeling . ”
116921	116928	116929	116929	I	0	“ They ’ll pay for it , ”
116932	116938	116929	116929	I	0	“ For both of them . ”
116939	116945	116946	116946	she	303	“ You bet your ass , ”
116974	116979	116980	116980	she	303	“ Poor old Gray , ”
116983	116998	116980	116980	she	303	“ I ca n’t believe it . He was so smart , so cautious . ”
116999	117004	117005	117005	I	0	“ Not smart enough , ”
117008	117058	117005	117005	I	0	“ Or cautious enough . We ’ve got to remember that . You know the rules , right ? Do n’t be on your own . If you see somebody coming , run like hell . Or shoot the bastard . Stick with Finlay if you can , OK ? ”
117082	117085	117086	117086	she	303	“ Finlay , ”
117089	117098	117086	117086	she	303	“ You know what I ca n’t figure ? ”
117099	117102	117103	117103	I	0	“ What ? ”
117106	117116	117117	117117	she	303	“ There ’s the two of them , right ? ”
117120	117256	117117	117117	she	303	“ Teale and Morrison . They run the town for Kliner . They run the police department . Between them , they run everything . Their chief of detectives is Gray . An old guy , a wise head , smart and stubborn . He ’s been there for twenty - five years , since well before any of this shit started up . They inherited him and they ca n’t get rid of him . So sure enough , one day their smart and stubborn detective sniffs them out . He ’s found out that something is going on . And they find out that he ’s found out . So they put him out of the way . They murder him to keep it all safe . Then what do they do next ? ”
117257	117261	117262	117262	I	0	“ Go on , ”
117265	117272	117273	117273	she	3678	“ They hire in a replacement , ”
117276	117340	117273	117273	she	3678	“ Finlay , down from Boston . A guy who is even smarter and even more stubborn than Gray was . Why the hell would they do that ? If Gray was a danger to them , then Finlay would be twice as dangerous . So why did they do that ? Why did they hire somebody even smarter than the last guy ? ”
117341	117346	117347	117347	I	0	“ That ’s easy , ”
117350	117358	117347	117347	I	0	“ They thought Finlay was really dumb . ”
117359	117362	117363	117363	she	3678	“ Dumb ? ”
117366	117375	117363	117363	she	3678	“ How the hell could they think that ? ”
117429	117438	117439	117439	I	0	“ Chief Morrison and Mayor Teale interviewed him , ”
117443	117490	117439	117439	I	0	“ He thought it was the worst job application in history . He thought he had come across as an idiot . He was totally amazed they gave him the job . Now I understand why they did . They really were looking for an idiot . ”

117507	117551	117504	117504	she	3678	“ That ’s ironic . They must have sat down and planned it out . Gray was a problem , they said . Better replace him with a fool , they said . Better pick the worst candidate who applies , they said . ”
117552	117555	117556	117556	I	0	“ Right , ”
117559	117602	117556	117556	I	0	“ And they did . They picked a shell - shocked idiot from Boston . But by the time he turns up to start work , he ’s calmed down and turned back into the cool and intelligent guy he always was . ”

118028	118036	118025	118025	he	280	“ And we got a slight problem . ”
118054	118058	118059	118059	he	280	“ Picard called , ”
118062	118069	118070	118070	I	0	“ So what ’s the problem ? ”
118073	118080	118081	118081	he	280	“ It ’s the safe house , ”

118132	118206	118129	118129	he	280	“ That ’s the problem . He ca n’t staff it . He needs somebody to be up there with Charlie . He ’s been doing duty himself . But he ca n’t do any more . Ca n’t take any more time out . And he feels it ’s not appropriate , you know , Charlie being a woman , and the little girl and all . Kid ’s terrified of him . ”

They were the actual operation itself . They were exporting something boxed up in air conditioner cartons . Sherman Stoller was driving them down to Florida every day to meet a boat . That ’s why he got so up - tight when he was flagged down for speeding . That ’s why the fancy lawyer came running over . Not because he was on his way to load up . Because he was on his way to unload . He had the Jacksonville police sniffing around a full load for fifty - five minutes . ”

129717	129727	129728	129728	he	397	“ Because I am the biggest counterfeiter in history , ”
129731	129763	129728	129728	he	397	“ I was going to say I was one of the two biggest in history , but after the events of last night at Princeton , sadly now I alone remain . ”
129764	129769	129770	129770	I	0	“ You and Bartholomew ? ”
129773	129778	129770	129770	I	0	“ You were counterfeiters ? ”
129785	129790	129791	129791	he	397	“ Not by choice , ”
129794	129920	129791	129791	he	397	“ During the Second World War , young men like Walter and me ended up with strange occupations . He and I were considered more useful in an intelligence role than in combat . We were drafted into the SIS , which as you know was the very earliest incarnation of the CIA . Other people were responsible for attacking the enemy with guns and bombs . We were handed the job of attacking the enemy with economics . We derived a scheme for shattering the Nazi economy with an assault on the value of its paper currency . Our project manufactured hundreds of billions of counterfeit reichsmarks . Spare bombers littered Germany with them . They came down out of the sky like confetti . ”
129921	129926	129927	129927	I	0	“ Did it work ? ”
129931	129936	129937	129937	he	689	“ Yes and no , ”
129940	130053	129937	129937	he	689	“ Certainly , their economy was shattered . Their currency was worthless very quickly . But of course , much of their production used slave labor . Slaves are n’t interested one way or the other whether the content of somebody else ’s wage packet is worth anything . And of course , alternative currencies were found . Chocolate , cigarettes , anything . Altogether , it was only a partial success . But it left Walter and me two of history ’s greatest forgers . That is , if you use sheer volume as a measure . I ca n’t claim any great talent for the inky end of the process . ”
130054	130062	130063	130063	I	0	“ So Joe was picking your brains ? ”
130067	130074	130075	130075	Kelstein	397	“ Walter and I became obsessed , ”
130078	130179	130075	130075	Kelstein	397	“ We studied the history of money forging . It started the day after paper money was first introduced . It ’s never gone away . We became experts . We carried on the interest after the war . We developed a loose relationship with the government . Finally , some years ago , a Senate subcommittee commissioned a report from us . With all due modesty , I can claim that it became the Treasury ’s anticounterfeiting bible . Your brother was familiar with it , of course . That ’s why he was talking to Walter and me . ”
130180	130190	130191	130191	I	0	“ But what was he talking to you about ? ”
130194	130201	130202	130202	Kelstein	397	“ Joe was a new broom , ”
130205	130273	130202	130202	Kelstein	397	“ He was brought in to solve problems . He was a very talented man indeed . His job was to eradicate counterfeiting . Now , that ’s an impossible job . Walter and I told him that . But he nearly succeeded . He thought hard , and he applied strokes of appealing simplicity . He just about halted all illicit printing within the United States . ”
130435	130441	130442	130442	Kelstein	397	“ His systems were brilliant , ”
130445	130546	130442	130442	Kelstein	397	“ His analysis was acute . He targeted ink and paper . In the end , it all boils down to ink and paper , does n’t it ? If anybody bought the sort of ink or paper that could be used to forge a banknote , Joe ’s people knew within hours . He swept people up within days . Inside the States , he reduced counterfeiting activity by ninety percent . And he tracked the remaining ten percent so vigorously he got almost all of them before they ’d even distributed the fakes . He impressed me greatly . ”
130547	130554	130555	130555	I	0	“ So what was the problem ? ”
130584	130590	130591	130591	he	397	“ The problem lay abroad , ”
130594	130622	130591	130591	he	397	“ Outside the United States . The situation there is very different . Did you know there are twice as many dollars outside the U.S. as inside ? ”
130671	130675	130676	130676	he	397	“ Quite so , ”
130679	130863	130676	130676	he	397	“ It ’s more about politics than crime . In the end , a government ’s primary duty is to defend the value of its currency . We have two hundred and sixty billion dollars abroad . The dollar is the unofficial currency of dozens of nations . In the new Russia , for instance , there are more dollars than rubles . In effect , it ’s like Washington has raised a massive foreign loan . Raised any other way , that loan would cost us twenty - six billion dollars a year in interest payments alone . But this way , it costs us nothing at all except what we spend on printing pictures of dead politicians on little pieces of paper . That ’s what it ’s all about , Mr. Reacher . Printing currency for foreigners to buy is the best racket a government can get into . So Joe ’s job in reality was worth twenty - six billion dollars a year to this country . And he pursued it with an energy appropriate to those high stakes . ”
130864	130871	130872	130872	I	0	“ So where was the problem ? ”
130875	130878	130872	130872	I	0	“ Geographically ? ”
130879	130884	130885	130885	Kelstein	397	“ Two main places , ”
130888	130931	130885	130885	Kelstein	397	“ First , the Middle East . Joe believed there was a plant in the Bekaa Valley that turned out fake hundreds which were practically perfect . But there was very little he could do about it . Have you been there ? ”
130976	130982	130983	130983	Kelstein	397	“ Syrian - controlled Lebanon , ”
130986	131033	130983	130983	Kelstein	397	“ Joe called it the badlands . They do everything there . Training camps for the world ’s terrorists , drug processing laboratories , you name it , they ’ve got it . Including a pretty good replica of our own Bureau of Printing and Engraving . ”
131045	131050	131051	131051	I	0	“ Protected by who ? ”
131063	131068	131069	131069	he	397	“ A perceptive question , ”
131072	131155	131069	131069	he	397	“ You instinctively grasp that an operation of that size is so visible , so complex , that it must be in some way sponsored . Joe believed it was protected by , or maybe even owned by , the Syrian government . Therefore his involvement was marginal . His conclusion was that the only solution was diplomatic . Failing that , he was in favor of air strikes against it . We may live to see such a solution one day . ”
131156	131162	131163	131163	I	0	“ And the second place ? ”
131183	131187	131188	131188	he	397	“ South America , ”
131191	131235	131188	131188	he	397	“ The second source is Venezuela . Joe had located it . That is what he was working on . Absolutely outstanding counterfeit hundred - dollar bills are coming out of Venezuela . But strictly private enterprise . No suggestion of government involvement . ”
131239	131245	131246	131246	I	0	“ We got that far , ”
131249	131264	131246	131246	I	0	“ A guy called Kliner , based down in Georgia where Joe was killed . ”
131265	131269	131270	131270	Kelstein	397	“ Quite so , ”
131273	131301	131270	131270	Kelstein	397	“ The ingenious Mr. Kliner . It ’s his operation . He ’s running the whole thing . We knew that for certain . How is he ? ”
131302	131307	131308	131308	I	0	“ He ’s panicking , ”
131311	131317	131308	131308	I	0	“ He ’s killing people . ”
131322	131329	131330	131330	he	397	“ We thought Kliner might panic , ”
131333	131349	131330	131330	he	397	“ He ’s protecting an outstanding operation . The very best we ’ve ever seen . ”
131350	131354	131355	131355	I	0	“ The best ? ”
131362	131365	131366	131366	he	397	“ Outstanding , ”
131370	131379	131366	131366	he	397	“ How much do you know about counterfeiting ? ”
131385	131393	131394	131394	I	0	“ More than I did last week , ”
131397	131405	131394	131394	I	0	“ But not enough , I guess . ”
131435	131443	131444	131444	he	397	“ There are two sorts of counterfeiters , ”
131447	131473	131444	131444	he	397	“ The bad ones and the good ones . The good ones do it properly . Do you know the difference between intaglio and lithography ? ”
131505	131509	131510	131510	he	397	“ Open it , ”
131513	131569	131510	131510	he	397	“ Any page will do . Run your fingers over the paper . It ’s smooth , is n’t it ? That ’s lithographic printing . That ’s how virtually everything is printed . Books , magazines , newspapers , everything . An inked roller passes over the blank paper . But intaglio is different . ”
131590	131595	131596	131596	he	397	“ That ’s intaglio , ”
131599	131638	131596	131596	he	397	“ A metal plate is smashed into the paper with considerable force . It leaves a definite embossed feel to the product . The printed image looks three dimensional . It feels three dimensional . It ’s unmistakable . ”
131667	131673	131674	131674	he	397	“ Can you feel it ? ”
131677	131772	131674	131674	he	397	“ The metal plates are nickel , coated with chromium . Fine lines are engraved into the chromium and the lines are filled with ink . The plate hits the paper and the ink is printed onto its topmost surface . Understand ? The ink is in the valleys of the plate , so it ’s transferred to the ridges on the paper . Intaglio printing is the only way to get that raised image . The only way to make the forgery feel right . It ’s how the real thing is done . ”
131773	131779	131780	131780	I	0	“ What about the ink ? ”
131783	131789	131790	131790	he	397	“ There are three colors , ”
131793	131910	131790	131790	he	397	“ Black , and two greens . The back of the bill is printed first , with the darker green . Then the paper is left to dry , and the next day , the front is printed with the black ink . That dries , and the front is printed again , with the lighter green . That ’s the other stuff you see there on the front , including the serial number . But the lighter green is printed by a different process , called letterpress . It ’s a stamping action , the same as intaglio , but the ink is stamped into the valleys on the paper , not onto the peaks . ”
131941	131947	131948	131948	Kelstein	397	“ So , four problems , ”
131951	132033	131948	131948	Kelstein	397	“ The press , the plates , the inks , and the paper . The press can be bought , new or used , anywhere in the world . There are hundreds of sources . Most countries print money and securities and bonds on them . So the presses are obtainable abroad . They can even be improvised . Joe found one intaglio operation in Thailand which was using a converted squid - processing machine . Their hundreds were absolutely immaculate . ”
132034	132040	132041	132041	I	0	“ What about the plates ? ”
132045	132052	132053	132053	he	397	“ Plates are problem number two , ”
132056	132173	132053	132053	he	397	“ But it ’s a matter of talent . There are people in the world who can forge Old Master paintings and there are people who can play a Mozart piano concerto after hearing it once . And certainly there are engravers who can reproduce banknotes . It ’s a perfectly logical proposition , is n’t it ? If a human being in Washington can engrave the original , certainly there ’s a human being somewhere else who can copy it . But they ’re rare . Really good copyists , rarer still . There are a few in Armenia . The Thai operation using the squid - processor got a Malaysian to make the plates . ”
132174	132177	132178	132178	I	0	“ OK , ”
132181	132201	132178	132178	I	0	“ So Kliner has bought a press , and he ’s found an engraver . What about the inks ? ”
132202	132210	132211	132211	he	397	“ The inks are problem number three , ”
132214	132311	132211	132211	he	397	“ You ca n’t buy anything vaguely like them in the U.S. Joe saw to that . But abroad , they ’re available . As I said , virtually every country in the world has its own banknote printing industry . And obviously , Joe could n’t enforce his systems in every country in the world . So the inks are easy enough to find . The greens are only a question of color . They mix them and experiment until they get them right . The black ink is magnetic , did you know that ? ”
132327	132334	132335	132335	he	397	“ You ca n’t see it , ”
132338	132391	132335	132335	he	397	“ A liquid ferrous chemical is mixed with the black ink . That ’s how electronic money counters work . They scan the engraving down the center of the portrait , and the machine reads the signal it gives off , like a tape head reads the sounds on a music cassette . ”
132392	132400	132401	132401	I	0	“ And they can get that ink ? ”
132404	132410	132411	132411	he	397	“ Anywhere in the world , ”
132414	132436	132411	132411	he	397	“ Everybody uses it . We lag behind other countries . We do n’t like to admit we worry about counterfeiting . ”
132451	132458	132459	132459	Kelstein	397	“ The currency must look stable , ”
132462	132494	132459	132459	Kelstein	397	“ That ’s why we ’re so reluctant to change it . It ’s got to look reliable , solid , unchanging . Turn that ten over and take a look . ”
132534	132540	132541	132541	Kelstein	397	“ Hardly changed since 1929 , ”
132544	132571	132541	132541	Kelstein	397	“ Psychologically , it ’s very important . We choose to put the appearance of dependability before security . It made Joe ’s job very difficult . ”
132576	132579	132580	132580	I	0	“ Right , ”
132583	132603	132580	132580	I	0	“ So we ’ve covered the press , the plates , and the inks . What about the paper ? ”
132621	132628	132629	132629	he	397	“ Paper is problem number four , ”
132632	132668	132629	132629	he	397	“ Actually , we should really say it ’s problem number one . It ’s by far the biggest problem . It ’s the thing Joe and I could n’t understand about Kliner ’s operation . ”
132669	132673	132674	132674	I	0	“ Why not ? ”
132678	132685	132686	132686	he	397	“ Because their paper is perfect , ”
132689	132712	132686	132686	he	397	“ It ’s one hundred percent perfect . Their paper is better than their printing . And that is absolutely unheard of . ”
132748	132751	132752	132752	I	0	“ Perfect ? ”
132766	132772	132773	132773	he	397	“ It ’s unheard of , ”
132777	132828	132773	132773	he	397	“ The paper is the hardest part of the whole process . Do n’t forget , we ’re not talking about some amateur thing here . We ’re talking about an industrial - scale operation . In a year , they ’re printing four billion dollars ’ worth of hundreds . ”
132829	132833	132834	132834	I	0	“ That many ? ”
132839	132843	132844	132844	he	397	“ Four billion , ”
132848	132911	132844	132844	he	397	“ About the same as the Lebanon operation . Those were Joe ’s figures . He was in a position to know . And that makes it inexplicable . Four billion in hundreds is forty million banknotes . That ’s a lot of paper . That ’s a completely inexplicable amount of paper , Mr. Reacher . And their paper is perfect . ”
132912	132921	132922	132922	I	0	“ What sort of paper would they need ? ”

132961	133081	132958	132958	he	397	“ Very clever and entirely unique . About eighty percent cotton , about twenty percent linen . No wood pulp in it at all . It ’s got more in common with the shirt on your back than with a newspaper , for instance . It ’s got a very clever chemical colorant in it , to give it a unique cream tint . And it ’s got random red and blue polymer threads pulped in , as fine as silk . Currency stock is wonderful paper . Durable , lasts for years , wo n’t come apart in water , hot or cold . Absolutely precise absorbency , capable of accepting the finest engraving the platemakers can achieve . ”
133082	133092	133093	133093	I	0	“ So the paper would be difficult to copy ? ”
133096	133100	133101	133101	he	397	“ Virtually impossible , ”
133104	133153	133101	133101	he	397	“ In a way , it ’s so difficult to copy that even the official government supplier ca n’t copy it . They have tremendous difficulty just keeping it consistent , batch to batch , and they ’re by far the most sophisticated papermaker in the entire world . ”
133171	133184	133185	133185	I	0	“ So the paper supply is really the key to all this ? ”
133192	133198	133199	133199	he	397	“ That was our conclusion , ”
133202	133252	133199	133199	he	397	“ We agreed the paper supply was crucial , and we agreed we had no idea how they were managing it . That ’s why I ca n’t really help you . I could n’t help Joe , and I ca n’t help you . I ’m terribly sorry . ”
133258	133268	133269	133269	I	0	“ They ’ve got a warehouse full of something , ”

133302	133353	133299	133299	he	397	“ Currency stock is unobtainable . Completely unobtainable . You could n’t get forty sheets of currency stock , never mind forty million sheets . The whole thing is a total mystery . Joe and Walter and I racked our brains for a year and we came up with nothing . ”

133782	133819	133779	133779	he	689	“ That ’s what Joe told me . He said you were very fierce . Very tough . I guess if Joe wanted anybody to take care of the Kliners , he ’d have nominated you . ”

Anywhere else , the high - value notes are bigger than the small - value notes . There ’s a progression , right ? Anywhere else , the one is a small bill , the five is bigger , the ten is bigger and so on . The biggest value bills are usually great big sheets of paper . But American dollars are all the same size . The hundred - dollar bill is the same size as the one - dollar bill . ”

150331	150365	150328	150328	Picard	357	“ I sent the little guy to Joe ’s hotel two hours before I told you about it . You disappointed me . I expected to be doing this scene way before now . ”
150436	150441	150442	150442	Picard	357	“ Get over there , ”
150447	150452	150442	150442	Picard	357	“ Next to Finlay . ”
150606	150611	150612	150612	Picard	357	“ Get over there , ”
150618	150623	150624	150624	I	0	“ Where ’s Roscoe ? ”
150795	150802	150803	150803	Finlay	280	“ What ’s this all about ? ”
150806	150816	150803	150803	Finlay	280	“ We go back a long way , right ? ”
150823	150831	150832	150832	he	357	“ I told you to stay away , ”
150835	150883	150832	150832	he	357	“ Back in March , I tried to stop you coming down here . I warned you off . That ’s true , right ? But you would n’t listen , would you , you stubborn asshole ? So you get what you get , my friend . ”
151441	151444	151445	151445	Teale	352	“ Baker ? ”
151448	151454	151445	151445	Teale	352	“ In here , please . ”
151502	151506	151507	151507	he	273	“ A tape , ”
151510	151522	151507	151507	he	273	“ Listen up . You ’re going to find this interesting . ”
151576	151579	151580	151580	Roscoe	303	“ Reacher ? ”
151585	151669	151580	151580	Roscoe	303	“ This is a message for you , OK ? The message is you better do what they tell you , or I ’m in trouble . The message is if you ’re in any doubt about what kind of trouble , you should go back down to the morgue and pull Mrs. Morrison ’s autopsy report . That ’s the kind of trouble I ’m going to be in . So help me out , OK ? End of message , Reacher . ”
151793	151797	151798	151798	he	352	“ Another one , ”
151801	151805	151798	151798	he	352	“ Listen up . ”
151844	151847	151848	151848	Charlie	340	“ Hub ? ”
151853	151943	151848	151848	Charlie	340	“ This is Charlie . I ’ve got the children with me . I ’m not at home , you understand what that means ? I ’ve got to give you a message . If you do n’t come back , something will happen to the children . They tell me you know what that something is . It ’s the same thing they said would happen to you and me , but it ’ll be the children instead . So you have to come back straightaway , OK ? ”
152001	152011	152012	152012	he	279	“ You ’re going to take that with you , ”
152017	152040	152012	152012	he	279	“ You ’re going to take it to wherever you ’ve hidden Hubble and you ’re going to play it to him . ”
152067	152073	152074	152074	I	0	“ You killed Hubble already , ”
152083	152090	152091	152091	he	279	“ Do n’t try that shit , ”
152094	152118	152091	152091	he	279	“ We were going to , but you got him out of the way . You ’re hiding him . Charlie told us . ”
152119	152124	152125	152125	I	0	“ Charlie told you ? ”
152128	152136	152137	152137	he	279	“ We asked her where he was , ”
152140	152234	152137	152137	he	279	“ She promised us you ’d be able to find him . She was most insistent about it . We had a knife between her little girl ’s legs at the time . She became very anxious to convince us that her husband was not beyond our reach . She said you ’d given him all sorts of advice and guidance . She said you ’d given him all sorts of help . She said you ’d be able to find him . I hope for everybody ’s sake she was n’t lying . ”
152235	152240	152241	152241	I	0	“ You killed him , ”
152245	152254	152241	152241	I	0	“ I do n’t know anything about it . ”
152265	152272	152273	152273	he	279	“ Let ’s cut the crap , ”
152276	152372	152273	152273	he	279	“ You ’re hiding him , and we need him back . We need him back right away . It ’s a matter of urgency to us . We ’ve got a business to run . So we ’ve got a number of options . We could beat it out of you . We discussed that . It ’s a tactical problem , right ? But we figured you might send us off in the wrong direction , because time is tight right now . You might figure that was your best option , right ? ”
152390	152401	152402	152402	he	279	“ So what we ’re going to do is this , ”
152405	152452	152402	152402	he	279	“ Picard is going to go with you to pick him up . When you get wherever he is , Picard is going to call me . On my mobile . He knows the number . Then you all three come on back here . OK ? ”
152458	152463	152464	152464	Kliner	279	“ Where is he ? ”
152483	152495	152496	152496	he	279	“ Like I told you , let ’s cut the crap , ”
152499	152543	152496	152496	he	279	“ For instance , you ’ve been sitting there thinking as hard as you can . No doubt you were trying to figure some way you might be able to take Picard out . But you wo n’t be able to do that . ”
152550	152554	152555	152555	Kliner	279	“ Two problems , ”
152558	152594	152555	152555	Kliner	279	“ I doubt if you could take Picard out . I doubt if anybody could . Nobody ever has . And my mobile number is n’t written down . It ’s in Picard ’s head . ”
152609	152618	152619	152619	he	279	“ Let me add a couple of factors , ”
152622	152669	152619	152619	he	279	“ We do n’t know exactly how far away Hubble is . And you ’re not going to tell us the truth about that . So I ’ll tell you what we ’re going to do . We ’re going to give you a time limit . ”
152710	152720	152721	152721	he	279	“ The detective here is going in a cell , ”
152724	152891	152721	152721	he	279	“ He ’s going to be handcuffed to the bars . If Picard has n’t called me by one hour before dawn tomorrow , I ’m going to aim my shotgun into the detective ’s cell and blow him apart . Then I ’m going to make the delightful Officer Roscoe clean his guts off the back wall with a sponge . Then I ’m going to give you another hour . If Picard has n’t called me by the time the sun comes up , I ’m going to start in on the delightful Officer Roscoe herself . She ’ll end up in a lot of pain , Reacher . But first there will be a great deal of sexual interference . A great deal . You have my word on that , Reacher . It ’ll be very messy . Very messy indeed . Mayor Teale and I have spent a pleasant hour discussing just exactly what we ’re going to do to her . ”
152963	152966	152967	152967	Kliner	279	“ Understand ? ”
152972	153010	152967	152967	Kliner	279	“ Call it six o’clock tomorrow morning to save Mr. Finlay ’s life , seven o’clock to save Miss Roscoe ’s life . And do n’t go messing with Picard . Nobody else knows my phone number . ”
153017	153022	153023	153023	he	279	“ Do you understand ? ”
153026	153031	153032	153032	I	0	“ I think so , ”
153035	153060	153032	153032	I	0	“ Hubble ’s run away and you do n’t know how to find him , right ? Is that what you ’re telling me ? ”
153064	153074	153075	153075	I	0	“ You ca n’t find him , can you ? ”
153078	153127	153075	153075	I	0	“ You ’re useless , Kliner . You ’re a useless piece of shit . You think you ’re some kind of a smart guy , but you ca n’t find Hubble . You could n’t find your asshole if I gave you a mirror on a stick . ”
153294	153305	153306	153306	I	0	“ What ’s Hubble got that you want so much ? ”
153314	153323	153324	153324	he	279	“ He ’s the only loose end left , ”
153327	153381	153324	153324	he	279	“ I ’ve taken care of everything else . And I ’m not going out of business just because an asshole like Hubble is running around somewhere shooting his stupid mouth off . So I need him at home . Where he belongs . So you ’re going to get him for me . ”
153392	153402	153403	153403	I	0	“ Ca n’t your son get him for you ? ”
153417	153427	153428	153428	I	0	“ Tell your boy to go pick him up , ”

154853	154863	154864	154864	Picard	357	“ You better not be bullshitting , my friend , ”
154867	154905	154864	154864	Picard	357	“ Kliner would n’t like that . It ’ll make it worse for the woman . He ’s got a cruel streak in him a mile wide . Believe me , I ’ve seen him in action . ”
154906	154910	154911	154911	I	0	“ Like when ? ”

158757	158808	158754	158754	I	0	“ That was the exact point . That ’s what made it easy . You had no credit cards , no driver ’s license , no ID . All you had was cash . So you were n’t using planes or rental cars . You were stuck with the bus . ”

158853	158910	158848	158848	I	0	“ Then I put myself in your shoes , psychologically . You were terrified for your family . So I figured you ’d circle around Margrave at a distance . You ’d want to feel you were still connected , consciously or subconsciously . You took the taxi up to the Atlanta bus depot , right ? ”
158911	158914	158915	158915	he	903	“ Right , ”
158918	158951	158915	158915	he	903	“ First bus out of there was to Memphis , but I waited for the next one . Memphis was too far . I did n’t want to go that far away . ”

158964	159065	158961	158961	I	0	“ You were circling Margrave . Not too close , not too far . And counterclockwise . Give people a free choice , they always go counterclockwise . It ’s a universal truth , Hubble . All I had to do was to count the days and study the map and predict the hop you ’d take each time . I figure Monday you were in Birmingham , Alabama . Tuesday was Montgomery , Wednesday was Columbus . I had a problem with Thursday . I gambled on Macon , but I thought it was maybe too close to Margrave . ”

159356	159359	159360	159360	he	340	“ Right , ”
159363	159368	159369	159369	I	0	“ Not John Lennon , ”
159372	159436	159369	159369	I	0	“ People usually stick with their own first name . I do n’t know why , but they usually do . So you were Paul Lennon . Tuesday , you were Paul Mc - Cartney . Wednesday , you were Paul Harrison . Thursday , you were Paul Starr . Friday in Augusta , you started over again with Paul Lennon , right ? ”
159437	159440	159441	159441	he	340	“ Right , ”
159444	159468	159441	159441	he	340	“ But there ’s a million hotels in Augusta . Conventions , golf . How the hell did you know where to look ? ”

159479	159574	159476	159476	I	0	“ You got in Friday , late morning , coming in from the west . Guy like you walks back the way he ’s already seen . Feels safer that way . You ’d been on the bus four hours , you were cramped up , you wanted the air , so you walked a spell , maybe a quarter mile . Then you got panicky and dived off the main drag a block or two . So I had a pretty small target area . Eighteen places . You were in number fifteen . ”
159607	159615	159616	159616	he	340	“ How are things in Margrave now ? ”

159924	159941	159921	159921	I	0	“ But I ’ll need your help . That ’s why I picked you up first . ”
160077	160086	160087	160087	he	340	“ I ’m very sorry about your brother , ”

160146	160157	160158	160158	I	0	“ How the hell did you get into all this ? ”
160199	160205	160206	160206	he	340	“ I lost my job , ”
160213	160316	160206	160206	he	340	“ I was devastated . I felt angry and upset . And scared , Reacher . We ’d been living a dream , you know ? A golden dream . It was a perfect , idyllic life . I was earning a fortune and I was spending a fortune . It was totally fabulous . But then I started hearing things . The retail operation was under threat . My department was under review . I suddenly realized I was just one paycheck away from disaster . Then the department got shut down . I got canned . And the paychecks stopped . ”

And they just slung me out like suddenly I was shit on their shoe . And I was scared . I was going to lose it all , right ? And I was tired . I could n’t start again at the bottom of something else . I was too old and I had no energy . I just did n’t know what to do . ”
160433	160440	160441	160441	I	0	“ And then Kliner turned up ? ”

160461	160549	160458	160458	he	4807	“ I guess Teale told him . Teale knows everything about everybody . Kliner called me within a couple of days . I had n’t even told Charlie at that point . I could n’t face it . He called me and asked me to meet him up at the airport . He was in a private jet , on his way back from Venezuela . He flew me out to the Bahamas for lunch , and we talked . I was flattered , to be honest . ”
160550	160553	160554	160554	I	0	“ And ? ”
160557	160566	160567	160567	Hubble	340	“ He gave me a lot of crap , ”
160570	160701	160567	160567	Hubble	340	“ He was telling me to look at it as an opportunity to get out . He was saying I should dump the corporate thing , I should come and do a real job , make some real money , with him . I did n’t know much about him . I knew about the family fortune and the Foundation , obviously , but I ’d never met him face to face . But he was clearly a very rich and successful guy . And very , very smart . And there he was , sitting in a private jet , asking me to work with him . Not for him , with him . I was flattered and I was desperate and I was worried and I said yes . ”
160702	160706	160707	160707	I	0	“ And then ? ”
160710	160719	160720	160720	Hubble	340	“ He called me again the next day , ”
160723	160798	160720	160720	Hubble	340	“ He was sending the plane for me . I had to fly down to the Kliner plant in Venezuela to meet with him . So I did . I was only there one day . Did n’t get to see anything . Then he flew me to Jacksonville . I was in the lawyer ’s office for a week . After that , it was too late . I could n’t get out . ”

160821	160977	160818	160818	he	340	“ It sounds like a short time , right ? Just a week . But he did a real job on me . First day , it was all flattery . All temptation . He signed me up to a huge salary , bonuses , whatever I wanted . We went to clubs and hotels and he was spending money like it was out of a faucet . Tuesday , I started work . The actual job was a challenge . It was very difficult after what I ’d been doing at the bank . It was so specialized . He wanted cash , of course , but he wanted dollars only . Nothing but singles . I had no idea why . And he wanted records . Very tight books . But I could handle it . And he was a relaxed boss . No pressures , no problems . The problems started Wednesday . ”
160978	160981	160982	160982	I	0	“ How ? ”
160985	160996	160997	160997	he	4808	“ Wednesday , I asked him what was going on , ”
161000	161173	160997	160997	he	4808	“ And he told me . He just told me exactly what he was doing . But he said now I was doing it too . I was involved . I had to stay quiet . Thursday , I was getting really unhappy . I could n’t believe it . I told him I wanted out . So he drove me down to some awful place . His son was there . He had two Hispanic guys there with him . There was this other guy chained up in a back room . Kliner said this was a guy who had stepped out of line . He told me to watch carefully . His son just kicked the guy to a pulp . All over the room , right in front of me . Then the Hispanic guys got their knives out and just hacked the poor guy apart . There was blood everywhere . It was horrible . I could n’t believe it . I threw up all over the place . ”

161182	161188	161189	161189	Hubble	340	“ It was a nightmare , ”
161192	161408	161189	161189	Hubble	340	“ I could n’t sleep that night . I thought I ’d never sleep again , any night . Friday morning , we flew home . We sat together on the little jet and he told me what would happen . He said it would n’t be just me who got cut up . It would be Charlie too . He was discussing it with me . Which of her nipples would he slice off first ? Left or right ? Then after we were dead , which of the children would he start with ? Lucy or Ben ? It was a nightmare . He said they ’d nail me to the wall . I was shitting myself . Then we landed and he called Charlie and insisted we go to dinner with him . He told her we were doing business together . Charlie was delighted because Kliner is such a big deal in the county . It was a total nightmare because I had to pretend there was nothing wrong . I had n’t even told Charlie I ’d lost my job . I had to pretend I was still at the bank . And the whole evening that bastard was asking politely after Charlie and the children and smiling at me . ”

161480	161488	161489	161489	he	4817	“ I started work at the warehouse , ”

161501	161505	161506	161506	I	0	“ Doing what ? ”
161509	161514	161515	161515	he	4817	“ Managing the supply , ”
161518	161547	161515	161515	he	4817	“ I had a little office in there , and I had to arrange to get the dollars , and then I ’d supervise the loading and shipping . ”

161567	161656	161564	161564	he	4817	“ He was trusted to do the Florida run . I ’d send him out with a million dollar bills a week . Sometimes the gatemen did it if Sherman had a day off . But it was usually him . He helped me with the boxes and the loading . We had to work like crazy . A million dollars in singles is a hell of a sight . You ’ve got no idea . It was like trying to empty a swimming pool with a shovel . ”
161657	161665	161666	161666	I	0	“ But Sherman was stealing , right ? ”
161687	161696	161697	161697	he	4817	“ The money got counted properly in Venezuela , ”
161700	161799	161697	161697	he	4817	“ I used to get accurate totals back after about a month or so . I used them to cross - check my weighing formula . Many times , we were about a hundred grand down . No way had I made that kind of mistake . It was a trivial amount , because we were generating four billion in excellent fakes at the other end , so who cared ? But it was about a boxful every time . That would be a large margin of error , so I figured Sherman was stealing the occasional box . ”
161800	161803	161804	161804	I	0	“ And ? ”

161817	161913	161814	161814	Hubble	340	“ I mean , I was n’t going to tell anybody about it . I just told him to take care , because Kliner would kill him if he found out . Might get me into trouble as well . I was already worried enough about what I was doing . The whole thing was insane . Kliner was importing a lot of the fakes . He could n’t resist it . I thought it made the whole thing way too visible . Teale was spending the fakes like confetti , prettying up the town . ”

161935	161943	161944	161944	he	340	“ We had to stop the shipping , ”
161947	162065	161928	161928	He	340	“ The Coast Guard thing made it impossible . Kliner decided to stockpile instead . He figured the interdiction could n’t last . He knew the Coast Guard budget would n’t stand it for long . But it just lasted and lasted . It was a hell of a year . The tension was awful . And now the Coast Guard ’s finally pulling back , it ’s caught us by surprise . Kliner figured it ’s lasted this long , it would last until after the election in November . We ’re not ready to ship . Not ready at all . It ’s all just piled up in there . It ’s not boxed yet . ”

Had a lot of spirit and energy . Walked fast and talked fast , always moving , always smiling his sweet fool head off . But one time , we came out of a place in town here , walking down the sidewalk , laughing . Nobody else around but for two white folks coming toward us on the sidewalk . A man and a boy . I saw them and ducked off the sidewalk , like we were supposed to . Stood in the dirt to let them pass . But poor Blake was blind . Did n’t see them . Just crashed into the white boy . A white boy , maybe ten years old , maybe twelve . Blake sent him flying into the dirt . White boy cut his head on a stone , set up such a hollering like you never heard . The white boy ’s daddy was there with him . I knew him . He was a big important man in this town . His boy was screaming fit to burst . Screaming at his daddy to punish the nigger . So the daddy lost his temper and set about Blake with his cane . Big silver knob on the top . He beat poor Blake with that cane until his head was just split open like a burst watermelon . Killed him stone dead . Picked up the boy and turned to me . Sent me over to the horse trough to wash poor Blake ’s hair and blood and brains off from the end of his cane . Told me never to say a word about it , or he ’d kill me too . So I just hid out and waited until somebody else found poor Blake there on the sidewalk . Then I ran out screaming and hollering with the rest of them all . Never said a word about it to another living soul , that day to this . ”
