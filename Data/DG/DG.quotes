815	832	834	835	Lord Henry	105	" It is your best work , Basil , the best thing you have ever done , "
838	914	834	835	Lord Henry	105	" You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor . The Academy is too large and too vulgar . Whenever I have gone there , there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the pictures , which was dreadful , or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people , which was worse . The Grosvenor is really the only place . "
915	926	927	927	he	386	" I do n't think I shall send it anywhere , "
950	960	931	931	his	386	" No , I wo n't send it anywhere . "
995	1109	964	964	his	105	" Not send it anywhere ? My dear fellow , why ? Have you any reason ? What odd chaps you painters are ! You do anything in the world to gain a reputation . As soon as you have one , you seem to want to throw it away . It is silly of you , for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about , and that is not being talked about . A portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in England , and make the old men quite jealous , if old men are ever capable of any emotion . "
1110	1119	1120	1120	he	386	" I know you will laugh at me , "
1123	1142	1120	1120	he	386	" but I really ca n't exhibit it . I have put too much of myself into it . "
1154	1172	964	964	his	105	" Yes , I knew you would ; but it is quite true , all the same . "
1173	1471	964	964	his	105	" Too much of yourself in it ! Upon my word , Basil , I did n't know you were so vain ; and I really ca n't see any resemblance between you , with your rugged strong face and your coal - black hair , and this young Adonis , who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose - leaves . Why , my dear Basil , he is a Narcissus , and you -- well , of course you have an intellectual expression and all that . But beauty , real beauty , ends where an intellectual expression begins . Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration , and destroys the harmony of any face . The moment one sits down to think , one becomes all nose , or all forehead , or something horrid . Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions . How perfectly hideous they are ! Except , of course , in the Church . But then in the Church they do n't think . A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen , and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful . Your mysterious young friend , whose name you have never told me , but whose picture really fascinates me , never thinks . I feel quite sure of that . He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at , and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence . Do n't flatter yourself , Basil : you are not in the least like him . "
1472	1481	1483	1484	the artist	353	" You do n't understand me , Harry , "
1486	1682	1483	1484	the artist	353	" Of course I am not like him . I know that perfectly well . Indeed , I should be sorry to look like him . You shrug your shoulders ? I am telling you the truth . There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction , the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings . It is better not to be different from one 's fellows . The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world . They can sit at their ease and gape at the play . If they know nothing of victory , they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat . They live as we all should live -- undisturbed , indifferent , and without disquiet . They neither bring ruin upon others , nor ever receive it from alien hands . Your rank and wealth , Harry ; my brains , such as they are -- my art , whatever it may be worth ; Dorian Gray 's good looks -- we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us , suffer terribly . "
1683	1692	1694	1695	Lord Henry	105	" Dorian Gray ? Is that his name ? "
1705	1723	964	964	his	105	" Yes , that is his name . I did n't intend to tell it to you . "
1724	1729	964	964	his	105	" But why not ? "
1730	1860	964	964	his	105	" Oh , I ca n't explain . When I like people immensely , I never tell their names to any one . It is like surrendering a part of them . I have grown to love secrecy . It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us . The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it . When I leave town now I never tell my people where I am going . If I did , I would lose all my pleasure . It is a silly habit , I dare say , but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one 's life . I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it ? "
1861	1866	1868	1869	Lord Henry	105	" Not at all , "
1871	2022	1868	1869	Lord Henry	105	" not at all , my dear Basil . You seem to forget that I am married , and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties . I never know where my wife is , and my wife never knows what I am doing . When we meet -- we do meet occasionally , when we dine out together , or go down to the Duke's -- we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces . My wife is very good at it -- much better , in fact , than I am . She never gets confused over her dates , and I always do . But when she does find me out , she makes no row at all . I sometimes wish she would ; but she merely laughs at me . "
2023	2037	2039	2040	Basil Hallward	106	" I hate the way you talk about your married life , Harry , "
2052	2103	2039	2040	Basil Hallward	106	" I believe that you are really a very good husband , but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues . You are an extraordinary fellow . You never say a moral thing , and you never do a wrong thing . Your cynicism is simply a pose . "
2104	2120	2122	2123	Lord Henry	105	" Being natural is simply a pose , and the most irritating pose I know , "
2185	2196	2197	2197	he	105	" I am afraid I must be going , Basil , "
2200	2221	2197	2197	he	105	" and before I go , I insist on your answering a question I put to you some time ago . "
2222	2227	2229	2230	the painter	386	" What is that ? "
2240	2246	2197	2197	he	105	" You know quite well . "
2247	2254	2197	2197	he	105	" I do not , Harry . "
2255	2289	2197	2197	he	105	" Well , I will tell you what it is . I want you to explain to me why you wo n't exhibit Dorian Gray 's picture . I want the real reason . "
2290	2298	2197	2197	he	105	" I told you the real reason . "
2299	2326	2197	2197	he	105	" No , you did not . You said it was because there was too much of yourself in it . Now , that is childish . "
2327	2330	2332	2333	Basil Hallward	106	" Harry , "
2342	2424	2332	2333	Basil Hallward	106	" every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist , not of the sitter . The sitter is merely the accident , the occasion . It is not he who is revealed by the painter ; it is rather the painter who , on the coloured canvas , reveals himself . The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul . "
2429	2435	2436	2436	he	105	" And what is that ? "
2439	2445	2447	2447	Hallward	106	" I will tell you , "
2459	2467	2469	2470	his companion	394	" I am all expectation , Basil , "
2476	2489	2491	2492	the painter	386	" Oh , there is really very little to tell , Harry , "
2494	2512	2491	2492	the painter	386	" and I am afraid you will hardly understand it . Perhaps you will hardly believe it . "
2534	2544	2545	2545	he	105	" I am quite sure I shall understand it , "
2560	2579	2545	2545	he	105	" and as for believing things , I can believe anything , provided that it is quite incredible . "
2658	2665	2667	2668	the painter	386	" The story is simply this , "
2673	2994	2667	2668	the painter	386	" Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon 's . You know we poor artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time , just to remind the public that we are not savages . With an evening coat and a white tie , as you told me once , anybody , even a stock - broker , can gain a reputation for being civilized . Well , after I had been in the room about ten minutes , talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious academicians , I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at me . I turned half - way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time . When our eyes met , I felt that I was growing pale . A curious sensation of terror came over me . I knew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that , if I allowed it to do so , it would absorb my whole nature , my whole soul , my very art itself . I did not want any external influence in my life . You know yourself , Harry , how independent I am by nature . I have always been my own master ; had at least always been so , till I met Dorian Gray . Then -- but I do n't know how to explain it to you . Something seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life . I had a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows . I grew afraid and turned to quit the room . It was not conscience that made me do so : it was a sort of cowardice . I take no credit to myself for trying to escape . "
2995	3021	2667	2668	the painter	386	" Conscience and cowardice are really the same things , Basil . Conscience is the trade - name of the firm . That is all . "
3022	3106	2667	2668	the painter	386	" I do n't believe that , Harry , and I do n't believe you do either . However , whatever was my motive -- and it may have been pride , for I used to be very proud -- I certainly struggled to the door . There , of course , I stumbled against Lady Brandon . ' You are not going to run away so soon , Mr. Hallward ? ' she screamed out . You know her curiously shrill voice ? "
3107	3119	3121	3122	Lord Henry	105	" Yes ; she is a peacock in everything but beauty , "
3135	3333	2667	2668	the painter	386	" I could not get rid of her . She brought me up to royalties , and people with stars and garters , and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and parrot noses . She spoke of me as her dearest friend . I had only met her once before , but she took it into her head to lionize me . I believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time , at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers , which is the nineteenth - century standard of immortality . Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely stirred me . We were quite close , almost touching . Our eyes met again . It was reckless of me , but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him . Perhaps it was not so reckless , after all . It was simply inevitable . We would have spoken to each other without any introduction . I am sure of that . Dorian told me so afterwards . He , too , felt that we were destined to know each other . "
3334	3346	3348	3349	his companion	394	" And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man ? "
3351	3464	3348	3349	his companion	394	" I know she goes in for giving a rapid precis of all her guests . I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red - faced old gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons , and hissing into my ear , in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody in the room , the most astounding details . I simply fled . I like to find out people for myself . But Lady Brandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods . She either explains them entirely away , or tells one everything about them except what one wants to know . "
3465	3478	3480	3480	Hallward	106	" Poor Lady Brandon ! You are hard on her , Harry ! "
3483	3522	3348	3349	his companion	394	" My dear fellow , she tried to found a salon , and only succeeded in opening a restaurant . How could I admire her ? But tell me , what did she say about Mr. Dorian Gray ? "
3523	3587	3348	3349	his companion	394	" Oh , something like , ' Charming boy -- poor dear mother and I absolutely inseparable . Quite forget what he does -- afraid he -- doesn't do anything -- oh , yes , plays the piano -- or is it the violin , dear Mr. Gray ? ' Neither of us could help laughing , and we became friends at once . "
3588	3611	3613	3615	the young lord	399	" Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship , and it is far the best ending for one , "
3626	3637	3638	3638	he	106	" You do n't understand what friendship is , Harry , "
3639	3665	3348	3349	his companion	394	murmured--"or what enmity is , for that matter . You like every one ; that is to say , you are indifferent to every one . "
3666	3673	3675	3676	Lord Henry	105	" How horribly unjust of you ! "
3710	3804	3679	3679	his	105	" Yes ; horribly unjust of you . I make a great difference between people . I choose my friends for their good looks , my acquaintances for their good characters , and my enemies for their good intellects . A man can not be too careful in the choice of his enemies . I have not got one who is a fool . They are all men of some intellectual power , and consequently they all appreciate me . Is that very vain of me ? I think it is rather vain . "
3805	3826	3348	3349	his companion	394	" I should think it was , Harry . But according to your category I must be merely an acquaintance . "
3827	3841	3679	3679	his	105	" My dear old Basil , you are much more than an acquaintance . "
3842	3858	3348	3349	his companion	394	" And much less than a friend . A sort of brother , I suppose ? "
3859	3889	3679	3679	his	105	" Oh , brothers ! I do n't care for brothers . My elder brother wo n't die , and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else . "
3890	3893	3895	3895	Hallward	106	" Harry ! "
3899	4030	3679	3679	his	105	" My dear fellow , I am not quite serious . But I ca n't help detesting my relations . I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves . I quite sympathize with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices of the upper orders . The masses feel that drunkenness , stupidity , and immorality should be their own special property , and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself , he is poaching on their preserves . When poor Southwark got into the divorce court , their indignation was quite magnificent . And yet I do n't suppose that ten per cent of the proletariat live correctly . "
4031	4061	3679	3679	his	105	" I do n't agree with a single word that you have said , and , what is more , Harry , I feel sure you do n't either . "
4085	4268	4065	4065	his	105	" How English you are Basil ! That is the second time you have made that observation . If one puts forward an idea to a true Englishman -- always a rash thing to do -- he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong . The only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself . Now , the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it . Indeed , the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is , the more purely intellectual will the idea be , as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants , his desires , or his prejudices . However , I do n't propose to discuss politics , sociology , or metaphysics with you . I like persons better than principles , and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world . Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray . How often do you see him ? "
4269	4294	3679	3679	his	105	" Every day . I could n't be happy if I did n't see him every day . He is absolutely necessary to me . "
4295	4311	4065	4065	his	105	" How extraordinary ! I thought you would never care for anything but your art . "
4312	4322	4324	4325	the painter	386	" He is all my art to me now , "
4328	4825	4324	4325	the painter	386	" I sometimes think , Harry , that there are only two eras of any importance in the world 's history . The first is the appearance of a new medium for art , and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also . What the invention of oil - painting was to the Venetians , the face of Antinous was to late Greek sculpture , and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to me . It is not merely that I paint from him , draw from him , sketch from him . Of course , I have done all that . But he is much more to me than a model or a sitter . I wo n't tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him , or that his beauty is such that art can not express it . There is nothing that art can not express , and I know that the work I have done , since I met Dorian Gray , is good work , is the best work of my life . But in some curious way -- I wonder will you understand me?--his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art , an entirely new mode of style . I see things differently , I think of them differently . I can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before . ' A dream of form in days of thought'--who is it who says that ? I forget ; but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me . The merely visible presence of this lad -- for he seems to me little more than a lad , though he is really over twenty -- his merely visible presence -- ah ! I wonder can you realize all that that means ? Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school , a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit , all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek . The harmony of soul and body -- how much that is ! We in our madness have separated the two , and have invented a realism that is vulgar , an ideality that is void . Harry ! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me ! You remember that landscape of mine , for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but which I would not part with ? It is one of the best things I have ever done . And why is it so ? Because , while I was painting it , Dorian Gray sat beside me . Some subtle influence passed from him to me , and for the first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had always looked for and always missed . "
4826	4839	5218	5219	The painter	386	" Basil , this is extraordinary ! I must see Dorian Gray . "
4861	4864	4865	4865	he	106	" Harry , "
4868	4948	4865	4865	he	106	" Dorian Gray is to me simply a motive in art . You might see nothing in him . I see everything in him . He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there . He is a suggestion , as I have said , of a new manner . I find him in the curves of certain lines , in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colours . That is all . "
4949	4959	4961	4962	Lord Henry	105	" Then why wo n't you exhibit his portrait ? "
4964	5061	5218	5219	The painter	386	" Because , without intending it , I have put into it some expression of all this curious artistic idolatry , of which , of course , I have never cared to speak to him . He knows nothing about it . He shall never know anything about it . But the world might guess it , and I will not bare my soul to their shallow prying eyes . My heart shall never be put under their microscope . There is too much of myself in the thing , Harry -- too much of myself ! "
5062	5091	4865	4865	he	106	" Poets are not so scrupulous as you are . They know how useful passion is for publication . Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions . "
5092	5099	5101	5101	Hallward	106	" I hate them for it , "
5103	5178	5101	5101	Hallward	106	" An artist should create beautiful things , but should put nothing of his own life into them . We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography . We have lost the abstract sense of beauty . Some day I will show the world what it is ; and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait of Dorian Gray . "
5179	5217	4865	4865	he	106	" I think you are wrong , Basil , but I wo n't argue with you . It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue . Tell me , is Dorian Gray very fond of you ? "
5226	5231	5232	5232	he	386	" He likes me , "
5238	5368	5232	5232	he	386	" I know he likes me . Of course I flatter him dreadfully . I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall be sorry for having said . As a rule , he is charming to me , and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things . Now and then , however , he is horribly thoughtless , and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain . Then I feel , Harry , that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat , a bit of decoration to charm his vanity , an ornament for a summer 's day . "
5369	5381	5383	5384	Lord Henry	105	" Days in summer , Basil , are apt to linger , "
5386	5654	5383	5384	Lord Henry	105	" Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will . It is a sad thing to think of , but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty . That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over - educate ourselves . In the wild struggle for existence , we want to have something that endures , and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts , in the silly hope of keeping our place . The thoroughly well - informed man -- that is the modern ideal . And the mind of the thoroughly well - informed man is a dreadful thing . It is like a bric - a - brac shop , all monsters and dust , with everything priced above its proper value . I think you will tire first , all the same . Some day you will look at your friend , and he will seem to you to be a little out of drawing , or you wo n't like his tone of colour , or something . You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart , and seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you . The next time he calls , you will be perfectly cold and indifferent . It will be a great pity , for it will alter you . What you have told me is quite a romance , a romance of art one might call it , and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic . "
5655	5692	5232	5232	he	386	" Harry , do n't talk like that . As long as I live , the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me . You ca n't feel what I feel . You change too often . "
5693	5731	5383	5384	Lord Henry	105	" Ah , my dear Basil , that is exactly why I can feel it . Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love : it is the faithless who know love 's tragedies . "
5987	5997	5980	5980	He	105	" My dear fellow , I have just remembered . "
5998	6004	5980	5980	He	105	" Remembered what , Harry ? "
6005	6015	5980	5980	He	105	" Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray . "
6016	6021	6023	6023	Hallward	106	" Where was it ? "
6030	6157	5980	5980	He	105	" Do n't look so angry , Basil . It was at my aunt , Lady Agatha 's . She told me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her in the East End , and that his name was Dorian Gray . I am bound to state that she never told me he was good - looking . Women have no appreciation of good looks ; at least , good women have not . She said that he was very earnest and had a beautiful nature . I at once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair , horribly freckled , and tramping about on huge feet . I wish I had known it was your friend . "
6158	6169	6278	6278	he	2000	" I am very glad you did n't , Harry . "
6170	6173	5980	5980	He	105	" Why ? "
6174	6184	6278	6278	he	2000	" I do n't want you to meet him . "
6185	6195	5980	5980	He	105	" You do n't want me to meet him ? "
6196	6199	6278	6278	he	2000	" No . "
6200	6211	6213	6214	the butler	416	" Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio , sir , "
6221	6228	6230	6231	Lord Henry	105	" You must introduce me now , "
6249	6267	6268	6269	The man	2000	" Ask Mr. Gray to wait , Parker : I shall be in in a few moments . "
6284	6292	6293	6293	he	2000	" Dorian Gray is my dearest friend , "
6296	6385	6293	6293	he	2000	" He has a simple and a beautiful nature . Your aunt was quite right in what she said of him . Do n't spoil him . Do n't try to influence him . Your influence would be bad . The world is wide , and has many marvellous people in it . Do n't take away from me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses : my life as an artist depends on him . Mind , Harry , I trust you . "
6404	6410	6412	6413	Lord Henry	105	" What nonsense you talk ! "
6463	6467	6440	6440	He	108	" Forest Scenes . "
6468	6477	6478	6478	he	108	" You must lend me these , Basil , "
6481	6493	6478	6478	he	108	" I want to learn them . They are perfectly charming . "
6494	6508	6448	6448	his	108	" That entirely depends on how you sit to - day , Dorian . "
6509	6531	6533	6534	the lad	425	" Oh , I am tired of sitting , and I do n't want a life - sized portrait of myself , "
6573	6593	6569	6569	he	108	" I beg your pardon , Basil , but I did n't know you had any one with you . "
6594	6630	6702	6702	Dorian	108	" This is Lord Henry Wotton , Dorian , an old Oxford friend of mine . I have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were , and now you have spoiled everything . "
6631	6645	6647	6648	Lord Henry	105	" You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you , Mr. Gray , "
6657	6687	6647	6648	Lord Henry	105	" My aunt has often spoken to me about you . You are one of her favourites , and , I am afraid , one of her victims also . "
6688	6700	6702	6702	Dorian	108	" I am in Lady Agatha 's black books at present , "
6710	6767	6702	6702	Dorian	108	" I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel with her last Tuesday , and I really forgot all about it . We were to have played a duet together -- three duets , I believe . I do n't know what she will say to me . I am far too frightened to call . "
6768	6828	6850	6851	Lord Henry	105	" Oh , I will make your peace with my aunt . She is quite devoted to you . And I do n't think it really matters about your not being there . The audience probably thought it was a duet . When Aunt Agatha sits down to the piano , she makes quite enough noise for two people . "
6829	6844	6846	6846	Dorian	108	" That is very horrid to her , and not very nice to me , "
6931	6949	6951	6952	Lord Henry	105	" You are too charming to go in for philanthropy , Mr. Gray -- far too charming . "
7009	7038	6995	6995	he	386	" Harry , I want to finish this picture to - day . Would you think it awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away ? "
7048	7057	7058	7058	he	386	" Am I to go , Mr. Gray ? "
7061	7110	6995	6995	he	386	" Oh , please do n't , Lord Henry . I see that Basil is in one of his sulky moods , and I ca n't bear him when he sulks . Besides , I want you to tell me why I should not go in for philanthropy . "
7111	7188	7039	7040	Lord Henry	105	" I do n't know that I shall tell you that , Mr. Gray . It is so tedious a subject that one would have to talk seriously about it . But I certainly shall not run away , now that you have asked me to stop . You do n't really mind , Basil , do you ? You have often told me that you liked your sitters to have some one to chat to . "
7194	7217	7191	7191	his	106	" If Dorian wishes it , of course you must stay . Dorian 's whims are laws to everybody , except himself . "
7227	7297	7218	7219	Lord Henry	105	" You are very pressing , Basil , but I am afraid I must go . I have promised to meet a man at the Orleans . Good - bye , Mr. Gray . Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon Street . I am nearly always at home at five o'clock . Write to me when you are coming . I should be sorry to miss you . "
7298	7301	7303	7304	Dorian Gray	108	" Basil , "
7306	7354	7303	7304	Dorian Gray	108	" if Lord Henry Wotton goes , I shall go , too . You never open your lips while you are painting , and it is horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant . Ask him to stay . I insist upon it . "
7355	7369	7371	7371	Hallward	106	" Stay , Harry , to oblige Dorian , and to oblige me , "
7379	7415	7371	7371	Hallward	106	" It is quite true , I never talk when I am working , and never listen either , and it must be dreadfully tedious for my unfortunate sitters . I beg you to stay . "
7416	7426	7303	7304	Dorian Gray	108	" But what about my man at the Orleans ? "
7431	7497	7427	7428	The painter	386	" I do n't think there will be any difficulty about that . Sit down again , Harry . And now , Dorian , get up on the platform , and do n't move about too much , or pay any attention to what Lord Henry says . He has a very bad influence over all his friends , with the single exception of myself . "
7563	7581	7558	7558	he	108	" Have you really a very bad influence , Lord Henry ? As bad as Basil says ? "
7582	7609	7558	7558	he	108	" There is no such thing as a good influence , Mr. Gray . All influence is immoral -- immoral from the scientific point of view . "
7610	7613	7558	7558	he	108	" Why ? "
7614	7819	7558	7558	he	108	" Because to influence a person is to give him one 's own soul . He does not think his natural thoughts , or burn with his natural passions . His virtues are not real to him . His sins , if there are such things as sins , are borrowed . He becomes an echo of some one else 's music , an actor of a part that has not been written for him . The aim of life is self - development . To realize one 's nature perfectly -- that is what each of us is here for . People are afraid of themselves , nowadays . They have forgotten the highest of all duties , the duty that one owes to one 's self . Of course , they are charitable . They feed the hungry and clothe the beggar . But their own souls starve , and are naked . Courage has gone out of our race . Perhaps we never really had it . The terror of society , which is the basis of morals , the terror of God , which is the secret of religion -- these are the two things that govern us . And yet-- "
7820	7839	7841	7842	the painter	386	" Just turn your head a little more to the right , Dorian , like a good boy , "
7869	7873	7879	7879	his	105	" And yet , "
7911	8219	7903	7903	he	105	" I believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely , were to give form to every feeling , expression to every thought , reality to every dream -- I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism , and return to the Hellenic ideal -- to something finer , richer than the Hellenic ideal , it may be . But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself . The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self - denial that mars our lives . We are punished for our refusals . Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us . The body sins once , and has done with its sin , for action is a mode of purification . Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure , or the luxury of a regret . The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it . Resist it , and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself , with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful . It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain . It is in the brain , and the brain only , that the great sins of the world take place also . You , Mr. Gray , you yourself , with your rose - red youth and your rose - white boyhood , you have had passions that have made you afraid , thoughts that have filled you with terror , day - dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame-- "
8220	8223	8225	8226	Dorian Gray	108	" Stop ! "
8228	8276	8225	8226	Dorian Gray	108	" stop ! you bewilder me . I do n't know what to say . There is some answer to you , but I can not find it . Do n't speak . Let me think . Or , rather , let me try not to think . "
8679	8688	8690	8691	Dorian Gray	108	" Basil , I am tired of standing , "
8694	8711	8690	8691	Dorian Gray	108	" I must go out and sit in the garden . The air is stifling here . "
8712	8811	8856	8856	his	105	" My dear fellow , I am so sorry . When I am painting , I ca n't think of anything else . But you never sat better . You were perfectly still . And I have caught the effect I wanted -- the half - parted lips and the bright look in the eyes . I do n't know what Harry has been saying to you , but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression . I suppose he has been paying you compliments . You must n't believe a word that he says . "
8812	8838	8690	8691	Dorian Gray	108	" He has certainly not been paying me compliments . Perhaps that is the reason that I do n't believe anything he has told me . "
8839	8847	8849	8850	Lord Henry	105	" You know you believe it all , "
8861	8896	8849	8850	Lord Henry	105	" I will go out to the garden with you . It is horribly hot in the studio . Basil , let us have something iced to drink , something with strawberries in it . "
8897	8975	9010	9010	He	105	" Certainly , Harry . Just touch the bell , and when Parker comes I will tell him what you want . I have got to work up this background , so I will join you later on . Do n't keep Dorian too long . I have never been in better form for painting than I am to - day . This is going to be my masterpiece . It is my masterpiece as it stands . "
9023	9032	9033	9033	he	105	" You are quite right to do that , "
9036	9057	9033	9033	he	105	" Nothing can cure the soul but the senses , just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul . "
9125	9128	9130	9131	Lord Henry	105	" Yes , "
9133	9189	9130	9131	Lord Henry	105	" that is one of the great secrets of life -- to cure the soul by means of the senses , and the senses by means of the soul . You are a wonderful creation . You know more than you think you know , just as you know less than you want to know . "
9370	9380	9382	9383	Lord Henry	105	" Let us go and sit in the shade , "
9385	9432	9382	9383	Lord Henry	105	" Parker has brought out the drinks , and if you stay any longer in this glare , you will be quite spoiled , and Basil will never paint you again . You really must not allow yourself to become sunburnt . It would be unbecoming . "
9433	9439	9441	9442	Dorian Gray	108	" What can it matter ? "
9460	9471	9382	9383	Lord Henry	105	" It should matter everything to you , Mr. Gray . "
9472	9475	9382	9383	Lord Henry	105	" Why ? "
9476	9494	9382	9383	Lord Henry	105	" Because you have the most marvellous youth , and youth is the one thing worth having . "
9495	9505	9382	9383	Lord Henry	105	" I do n't feel that , Lord Henry . "
9506	10220	9382	9383	Lord Henry	105	" No , you do n't feel it now . Some day , when you are old and wrinkled and ugly , when thought has seared your forehead with its lines , and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires , you will feel it , you will feel it terribly . Now , wherever you go , you charm the world . Will it always be so ? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face , Mr. Gray . Do n't frown . You have . And beauty is a form of genius -- is higher , indeed , than genius , as it needs no explanation . It is of the great facts of the world , like sunlight , or spring - time , or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon . It can not be questioned . It has its divine right of sovereignty . It makes princes of those who have it . You smile ? Ah ! when you have lost it you wo n't smile .... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial . That may be so , but at least it is not so superficial as thought is . To me , beauty is the wonder of wonders . It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances . The true mystery of the world is the visible , not the invisible .... Yes , Mr. Gray , the gods have been good to you . But what the gods give they quickly take away . You have only a few years in which to live really , perfectly , and fully . When your youth goes , your beauty will go with it , and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you , or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats . Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful . Time is jealous of you , and wars against your lilies and your roses . You will become sallow , and hollow - cheeked , and dull - eyed . You will suffer horribly .... Ah ! realize your youth while you have it . Do n't squander the gold of your days , listening to the tedious , trying to improve the hopeless failure , or giving away your life to the ignorant , the common , and the vulgar . These are the sickly aims , the false ideals , of our age . Live ! Live the wonderful life that is in you ! Let nothing be lost upon you . Be always searching for new sensations . Be afraid of nothing .... A new Hedonism -- that is what our century wants . You might be its visible symbol . With your personality there is nothing you could not do . The world belongs to you for a season .... The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are , of what you really might be . There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself . I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted . For there is such a little time that your youth will last -- such a little time . The common hill - flowers wither , but they blossom again . The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now . In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis , and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars . But we never get back our youth . The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish . Our limbs fail , our senses rot . We degenerate into hideous puppets , haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid , and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to . Youth ! Youth ! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth ! "
10395	10400	10401	10401	he	386	" I am waiting , "
10404	10422	10401	10401	he	386	" Do come in . The light is quite perfect , and you can bring your drinks . "
10462	10474	10476	10477	Lord Henry	105	" You are glad you have met me , Mr. Gray , "
10483	10499	10476	10477	Lord Henry	105	" Yes , I am glad now . I wonder shall I always be glad ? "
10500	10566	10576	10576	his	108	" Always ! That is a dreadful word . It makes me shudder when I hear it . Women are so fond of using it . They spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever . It is a meaningless word , too . The only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer . "
10584	10596	10597	10597	he	108	" In that case , let our friendship be a caprice , "
10741	10747	10748	10748	he	106	" It is quite finished , "
10799	10810	10811	10811	he	105	" My dear fellow , I congratulate you most warmly , "
10814	10834	10811	10811	he	105	" It is the finest portrait of modern times . Mr. Gray , come over and look at yourself . "
10846	10852	10853	10853	he	105	" Is it really finished ? "
10862	10866	10868	10869	the painter	386	" Quite finished , "
10871	10888	10868	10869	the painter	386	" And you have sat splendidly to - day . I am awfully obliged to you . "
10889	10897	10900	10901	Lord Henry	105	" That is entirely due to me , "
10903	10911	10900	10901	Lord Henry	105	" Is n't it , Mr. Gray ? "
11231	11238	11240	11240	Hallward	106	" Do n't you like it ? "
11259	11266	11268	11269	Lord Henry	105	" Of course he likes it , "
11271	11306	11268	11269	Lord Henry	105	" Who would n't like it ? It is one of the greatest things in modern art . I will give you anything you like to ask for it . I must have it . "
11307	11316	11240	11240	Hallward	106	" It is not my property , Harry . "
11317	11323	11268	11269	Lord Henry	105	" Whose property is it ? "
11324	11331	11333	11334	the painter	386	" Dorian 's , of course , "
11336	11344	11268	11269	Lord Henry	105	" He is a very lucky fellow . "
11345	11351	11353	11354	Dorian Gray	108	" How sad it is ! "
11365	11463	11353	11354	Dorian Gray	108	" How sad it is ! I shall grow old , and horrible , and dreadful . But this picture will remain always young . It will never be older than this particular day of June .... If it were only the other way ! If it were I who was to be always young , and the picture that was to grow old ! For that -- for that -- I would give everything ! Yes , there is nothing in the whole world I would not give ! I would give my soul for that ! "
11464	11476	11478	11479	Lord Henry	105	" You would hardly care for such an arrangement , Basil , "
11483	11494	11478	11479	Lord Henry	105	" It would be rather hard lines on your work . "
11495	11504	11506	11506	Hallward	106	" I should object very strongly , Harry , "
11516	11553	11508	11509	Dorian Gray	108	" I believe you would , Basil . You like your art better than your friends . I am no more to you than a green bronze figure . Hardly as much , I dare say . "
11588	11591	11592	11592	he	108	" Yes , "
11595	11692	11592	11592	he	108	" I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your silver Faun . You will like them always . How long will you like me ? Till I have my first wrinkle , I suppose . I know , now , that when one loses one 's good looks , whatever they may be , one loses everything . Your picture has taught me that . Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right . Youth is the only thing worth having . When I find that I am growing old , I shall kill myself . "
11701	11706	11707	11707	he	106	" Dorian ! Dorian ! "
11710	11753	11707	11707	he	106	" do n't talk like that . I have never had such a friend as you , and I shall never have such another . You are not jealous of material things , are you?--you who are finer than any of them ! "
11754	11844	11890	11891	the painter	386	" I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die . I am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me . Why should it keep what I must lose ? Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives something to it . Oh , if it were only the other way ! If the picture could change , and I could be always what I am now ! Why did you paint it ? It will mock me some day -- mock me horribly ! "
11880	11888	11890	11891	the painter	386	" This is your doing , Harry , "
11900	11912	11897	11897	his	105	" It is the real Dorian Gray -- that is all . "
11913	11918	11894	11895	Lord Henry	105	" It is not . "
11919	11933	11897	11897	his	105	" If it is not , what have I to do with it ? "
11934	11945	11946	11946	he	106	" You should have gone away when I asked you , "
11949	11957	11959	11960	Lord Henry	105	" I stayed when you asked me , "
11964	12026	11897	11897	his	105	" Harry , I ca n't quarrel with my two best friends at once , but between you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever done , and I will destroy it . What is it but canvas and colour ? I will not let it come across our three lives and mar them . "
12165	12174	12175	12175	he	425	" Do n't , Basil , do n't ! "
12178	12184	12175	12175	he	425	" It would be murder ! "
12185	12198	12200	12201	the painter	386	" I am glad you appreciate my work at last , Dorian , "
12211	12218	12200	12201	the painter	386	" I never thought you would . "
12219	12242	12175	12175	he	425	" Appreciate it ? I am in love with it , Basil . It is part of myself . I feel that . "
12243	12275	12277	12277	he	386	" Well , as soon as you are dry , you shall be varnished , and framed , and sent home . Then you can do what you like with yourself . "
12289	12316	12277	12277	he	386	" You will have tea , of course , Dorian ? And so will you , Harry ? Or do you object to such simple pleasures ? "
12317	12323	12325	12326	Lord Henry	105	" I adore simple pleasures , "
12328	12439	12325	12326	Lord Henry	105	" They are the last refuge of the complex . But I do n't like scenes , except on the stage . What absurd fellows you are , both of you ! I wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal . It was the most premature definition ever given . Man is many things , but he is not rational . I am glad he is not , after all -- though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture . You had much better let me have it , Basil . This silly boy does n't really want it , and I really do . "
12440	12459	12461	12462	Dorian Gray	108	" If you let any one have it but me , Basil , I shall never forgive you ! "
12464	12478	12461	12462	Dorian Gray	108	" and I do n't allow people to call me a silly boy . "
12479	12498	12277	12277	he	386	" You know the picture is yours , Dorian . I gave it to you before it existed . "
12499	12529	12461	12462	Dorian Gray	108	" And you know you have been a little silly , Mr. Gray , and that you do n't really object to being reminded that you are extremely young . "
12530	12543	12277	12277	he	386	" I should have objected very strongly this morning , Lord Henry . "
12544	12556	12461	12462	Dorian Gray	108	" Ah ! this morning ! You have lived since then . "
12641	12652	12654	12655	Lord Henry	105	" Let us go to the theatre to - night , "
12657	12733	12654	12655	Lord Henry	105	" There is sure to be something on , somewhere . I have promised to dine at White 's , but it is only with an old friend , so I can send him a wire to say that I am ill , or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent engagement . I think that would be a rather nice excuse : it would have all the surprise of candour . "
12734	12748	12750	12750	Hallward	106	" It is such a bore putting on one 's dress - clothes , "
12752	12766	12750	12750	Hallward	106	" And , when one has them on , they are so horrid . "
12767	12770	12772	12773	Lord Henry	105	" Yes , "
12776	12807	12772	12773	Lord Henry	105	" the costume of the nineteenth century is detestable . It is so sombre , so depressing . Sin is the only real colour - element left in modern life . "
12808	12822	12654	12655	Lord Henry	105	" You really must not say things like that before Dorian , Harry . "
12823	12845	12772	12773	Lord Henry	105	" Before which Dorian ? The one who is pouring out tea for us , or the one in the picture ? "
12846	12850	12654	12655	Lord Henry	105	" Before either . "
12851	12866	12868	12869	the lad	425	" I should like to come to the theatre with you , Lord Henry , "
12871	12890	12654	12655	Lord Henry	105	" Then you shall come ; and you will come , too , Basil , wo n't you ? "
12891	12912	12654	12655	Lord Henry	105	" I ca n't , really . I would sooner not . I have a lot of work to do . "
12913	12928	12654	12655	Lord Henry	105	" Well , then , you and I will go alone , Mr. Gray . "
12929	12936	12654	12655	Lord Henry	105	" I should like that awfully . "
12954	12963	12964	12964	he	386	" I shall stay with the real Dorian , "
12969	12976	12978	12982	the original of the portrait	477	" Is it the real Dorian ? "
12989	12996	12978	12982	the original of the portrait	477	" Am I really like that ? "
12997	13006	12937	12938	The painter	386	" Yes ; you are just like that . "
13007	13013	12978	12982	the original of the portrait	477	" How wonderful , Basil ! "
13014	13030	13032	13032	Hallward	106	" At least you are like it in appearance . But it will never alter , "
13034	13039	13032	13032	Hallward	106	" That is something . "
13040	13049	13051	13052	Lord Henry	105	" What a fuss people make about fidelity ! "
13054	13107	13051	13052	Lord Henry	105	" Why , even in love it is purely a question for physiology . It has nothing to do with our own will . Young men want to be faithful , and are not ; old men want to be faithless , and can not : that is all one can say . "
13108	13121	13123	13123	Hallward	106	" Do n't go to the theatre to - night , Dorian , "
13125	13132	13123	13123	Hallward	106	" Stop and dine with me . "
13133	13140	13051	13052	Lord Henry	105	" I ca n't , Basil . "
13141	13144	13123	13123	Hallward	106	" Why ? "
13145	13158	13051	13052	Lord Henry	105	" Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him . "
13159	13185	13123	13123	Hallward	106	" He wo n't like you the better for keeping your promises . He always breaks his own . I beg you not to go . "
13194	13199	13191	13191	his	108	" I entreat you . "
13225	13232	13233	13233	he	105	" I must go , Basil , "
13236	13240	13242	13242	Hallward	106	" Very well , "
13257	13301	13245	13245	he	106	" It is rather late , and , as you have to dress , you had better lose no time . Good - bye , Harry . Good - bye , Dorian . Come and see me soon . Come to - morrow . "
13302	13305	13376	13377	Lord Henry	105	" Certainly . "
13306	13312	13245	13245	he	106	" You wo n't forget ? "
13313	13320	13322	13322	Dorian	108	" No , of course not , "
13324	13329	13245	13245	he	106	" And ... Harry ! "
13330	13335	13245	13245	he	106	" Yes , Basil ? "
13336	13352	13245	13245	he	106	" Remember what I asked you , when we were in the garden this morning . "
13353	13359	13245	13245	he	106	" I have forgotten it . "
13360	13365	13245	13245	he	106	" I trust you . "
13366	13374	13376	13377	Lord Henry	105	" I wish I could trust myself , "
13381	13416	13376	13377	Lord Henry	105	" Come , Mr. Gray , my hansom is outside , and I can drop you at your own place . Good - bye , Basil . It has been a most interesting afternoon . "
13841	13846	13848	13850	the old gentleman	509	" Well , Harry , "
13852	13877	13848	13850	the old gentleman	509	" what brings you out so early ? I thought you dandies never got up till two , and were not visible till five . "
13878	13899	13848	13850	the old gentleman	509	" Pure family affection , I assure you , Uncle George . I want to get something out of you . "
13900	13906	13908	13909	Lord Fermor	127	" Money , I suppose , "
13916	13939	13908	13909	Lord Fermor	127	" Well , sit down and tell me all about it . Young people , nowadays , imagine that money is everything . "
13940	13943	13945	13946	Lord Henry	105	" Yes , "
13957	14044	13945	13946	Lord Henry	105	" and when they grow older they know it . But I do n't want money . It is only people who pay their bills who want that , Uncle George , and I never pay mine . Credit is the capital of a younger son , and one lives charmingly upon it . Besides , I always deal with Dartmoor 's tradesmen , and consequently they never bother me . What I want is information : not useful information , of course ; useless information . "
14045	14141	13908	13909	Lord Fermor	127	" Well , I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book , Harry , although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense . When I was in the Diplomatic , things were much better . But I hear they let them in now by examination . What can you expect ? Examinations , sir , are pure humbug from beginning to end . If a man is a gentleman , he knows quite enough , and if he is not a gentleman , whatever he knows is bad for him . "
14142	14156	14158	14159	Lord Henry	105	" Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books , Uncle George , "
14162	14171	14173	14174	Lord Fermor	127	" Mr. Dorian Gray ? Who is he ? "
14182	14277	13908	13909	Lord Fermor	127	" That is what I have come to learn , Uncle George . Or rather , I know who he is . He is the last Lord Kelso 's grandson . His mother was a Devereux , Lady Margaret Devereux . I want you to tell me about his mother . What was she like ? Whom did she marry ? You have known nearly everybody in your time , so you might have known her . I am very much interested in Mr. Gray at present . I have only just met him . "
14278	14283	14285	14287	the old gentleman	509	" Kelso 's grandson ! "
14289	14545	14285	14287	the old gentleman	509	" Kelso 's grandson ! ... Of course .... I knew his mother intimately . I believe I was at her christening . She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl , Margaret Devereux , and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless young fellow -- a mere nobody , sir , a subaltern in a foot regiment , or something of that kind . Certainly . I remember the whole thing as if it happened yesterday . The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few months after the marriage . There was an ugly story about it . They said Kelso got some rascally adventurer , some Belgian brute , to insult his son - in - law in public -- paid him , sir , to do it , paid him -- and that the fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon . The thing was hushed up , but , egad , Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time afterwards . He brought his daughter back with him , I was told , and she never spoke to him again . Oh , yes ; it was a bad business . The girl died , too , died within a year . So she left a son , did she ? I had forgotten that . What sort of boy is he ? If he is like his mother , he must be a good - looking chap . "
14546	14554	14556	14557	Lord Henry	105	" He is very good - looking , "
14559	14569	14571	14573	the old man	511	" I hope he will fall into proper hands , "
14575	14702	14571	14573	the old man	511	" He should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the right thing by him . His mother had money , too . All the Selby property came to her , through her grandfather . Her grandfather hated Kelso , thought him a mean dog . He was , too . Came to Madrid once when I was there . Egad , I was ashamed of him . The Queen used to ask me about the English noble who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares . They made quite a story of it . I did n't dare show my face at Court for a month . I hope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies . "
14703	14709	14711	14712	Lord Henry	105	" I do n't know , "
14714	14752	14711	14712	Lord Henry	105	" I fancy that the boy will be well off . He is not of age yet . He has Selby , I know . He told me so . And ... his mother was very beautiful ? "
14753	14900	15002	15004	the old gentleman	509	" Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw , Harry . What on earth induced her to behave as she did , I never could understand . She could have married anybody she chose . Carlington was mad after her . She was romantic , though . All the women of that family were . The men were a poor lot , but , egad ! the women were wonderful . Carlington went on his knees to her . Told me so himself . She laughed at him , and there was n't a girl in London at the time who was n't after him . And by the way , Harry , talking about silly marriages , what is this humbug your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an American ? Ai n't English girls good enough for him ? "
14901	14915	14711	14712	Lord Henry	105	" It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now , Uncle George . "
14916	14928	14930	14931	Lord Fermor	127	" I 'll back English women against the world , Harry , "
14940	14948	14937	14937	his	127	" The betting is on the Americans . "
14949	14959	14961	14962	his uncle	483	" They do n't last , I am told , "
14964	14993	15002	15004	the old gentleman	509	" A long engagement exhausts them , but they are capital at a steeplechase . They take things flying . I do n't think Dartmoor has a chance . "
14994	15000	15002	15004	the old gentleman	509	" Who are her people ? "
15006	15012	15002	15004	the old gentleman	509	" Has she got any ? "
15019	15039	15040	15040	he	105	" American girls are as clever at concealing their parents , as English women are at concealing their past , "
15047	15057	15002	15004	the old gentleman	509	" They are pork - packers , I suppose ? "
15058	15089	15002	15004	the old gentleman	509	" I hope so , Uncle George , for Dartmoor 's sake . I am told that pork - packing is the most lucrative profession in America , after politics . "
15090	15095	15002	15004	the old gentleman	509	" Is she pretty ? "
15096	15118	15002	15004	the old gentleman	509	" She behaves as if she was beautiful . Most American women do . It is the secret of their charm . "
15119	15145	15002	15004	the old gentleman	509	" Why ca n't these American women stay in their own country ? They are always telling us that it is the paradise for women . "
15146	15170	15172	15173	Lord Henry	105	" It is . That is the reason why , like Eve , they are so excessively anxious to get out of it , "
15175	15223	15172	15173	Lord Henry	105	" Good - bye , Uncle George . I shall be late for lunch , if I stop any longer . Thanks for giving me the information I wanted . I always like to know everything about my new friends , and nothing about my old ones . "
15224	15232	15002	15004	the old gentleman	509	" Where are you lunching , Harry ? "
15233	15253	15172	15173	Lord Henry	105	" At Aunt Agatha 's . I have asked myself and Mr. Gray . He is her latest protege . "
15254	15302	15002	15004	the old gentleman	509	" Humph ! tell your Aunt Agatha , Harry , not to bother me any more with her charity appeals . I am sick of them . Why , the good woman thinks that I have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads . "
15303	15337	15172	15173	Lord Henry	105	" All right , Uncle George , I 'll tell her , but it wo n't have any effect . Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity . It is their distinguishing characteristic . "
16127	16134	16140	16140	her	408	" Late as usual , Harry , "
16460	16471	16473	16474	the duchess	566	" We are talking about poor Dartmoor , Lord Henry , "
16484	16497	16473	16474	the duchess	566	" Do you think he will really marry this fascinating young person ? "
16498	16514	16473	16474	the duchess	566	" I believe she has made up her mind to propose to him , Duchess . "
16515	16519	16521	16522	Lady Agatha	119	" How dreadful ! "
16524	16532	16521	16522	Lady Agatha	119	" Really , some one should interfere . "
16533	16553	16555	16557	Sir Thomas Burdon	142	" I am told , on excellent authority , that her father keeps an American dry - goods store , "
16562	16575	16521	16522	Lady Agatha	119	" My uncle has already suggested pork - packing , Sir Thomas . "
16576	16588	16590	16591	the duchess	566	" Dry - goods ! What are American dry - goods ? "
16604	16608	16610	16611	Lord Henry	105	" American novels , "
16624	16633	16635	16636	Lady Agatha	119	" Do n't mind him , my dear , "
16638	16647	16635	16636	Lady Agatha	119	" He never means anything that he says . "
16648	16654	16656	16658	the Radical member	569	" When America was discovered , "
16694	16707	16708	16708	she	566	" I wish to goodness it never had been discovered at all ! "
16711	16726	16708	16708	she	566	" Really , our girls have no chance nowadays . It is most unfair . "
16727	16739	16741	16742	Mr. Erskine	143	" Perhaps , after all , America never has been discovered , "
16744	16756	16741	16742	Mr. Erskine	143	" I myself would say that it had merely been detected . "
16757	16769	16771	16772	the duchess	566	" Oh ! but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants , "
16775	16812	16771	16772	the duchess	566	" I must confess that most of them are extremely pretty . And they dress well , too . They get all their dresses in Paris . I wish I could afford to do the same . "
16813	16826	16828	16829	Sir Thomas	142	" They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris , "
16844	16858	16860	16861	the duchess	566	" Really ! And where do bad Americans go to when they die ? "
16863	16869	16871	16872	Lord Henry	105	" They go to America , "
16878	16892	16893	16893	he	142	" I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against that great country , "
16899	16935	16893	16893	he	142	" I have travelled all over it in cars provided by the directors , who , in such matters , are extremely civil . I assure you that it is an education to visit it . "
16936	16949	16951	16952	Mr. Erskine	143	" But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated ? "
16955	16965	16951	16952	Mr. Erskine	143	" I do n't feel up to the journey . "
16972	17040	16966	16967	Sir Thomas	142	" Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on his shelves . We practical men like to see things , not to read about them . The Americans are an extremely interesting people . They are absolutely reasonable . I think that is their distinguishing characteristic . Yes , Mr. Erskine , an absolutely reasonable people . I assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans . "
17041	17045	17047	17048	Lord Henry	105	" How dreadful ! "
17050	17079	17047	17048	Lord Henry	105	" I can stand brute force , but brute reason is quite unbearable . There is something unfair about its use . It is hitting below the intellect . "
17080	17087	17089	17090	Sir Thomas	142	" I do not understand you , "
17096	17103	17105	17106	Mr. Erskine	143	" I do , Lord Henry , "
17112	17122	17124	17125	the baronet	575	" Paradoxes are all very well in their way .... "
17127	17133	17135	17136	Mr. Erskine	143	" Was that a paradox ? "
17138	17184	17135	17136	Mr. Erskine	143	" I did not think so . Perhaps it was . Well , the way of paradoxes is the way of truth . To test reality we must see it on the tight rope . When the verities become acrobats , we can judge them . "
17185	17189	17191	17192	Lady Agatha	119	" Dear me ! "
17194	17258	17191	17192	Lady Agatha	119	" how you men argue ! I am sure I never can make out what you are talking about . Oh ! Harry , I am quite vexed with you . Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the East End ? I assure you he would be quite invaluable . They would love his playing . "
17259	17268	17270	17271	Lord Henry	105	" I want him to play to me , "
17288	17297	17299	17300	Lady Agatha	119	" But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel , "
17302	17311	17313	17314	Lord Henry	105	" I can sympathize with everything except suffering , "
17320	17377	17313	17314	Lord Henry	105	" I can not sympathize with that . It is too ugly , too horrible , too distressing . There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain . One should sympathize with the colour , the beauty , the joy of life . The less said about life 's sores , the better . "
17378	17390	17392	17393	Sir Thomas	142	" Still , the East End is a very important problem , "
17402	17406	17408	17410	the young lord	399	" Quite so , "
17412	17431	17408	17410	the young lord	399	" It is the problem of slavery , and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves . "
17439	17448	17449	17449	he	577	" What change do you propose , then ? "
17456	17470	17471	17471	he	577	" I do n't desire to change anything in England except the weather , "
17474	17538	17471	17471	he	577	" I am quite content with philosophic contemplation . But , as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through an over - expenditure of sympathy , I would suggest that we should appeal to science to put us straight . The advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray , and the advantage of science is that it is not emotional . "
17539	17547	17549	17550	Mrs. Vandeleur	144	" But we have such grave responsibilities , "
17553	17557	17559	17560	Lady Agatha	119	" Terribly grave , "
17570	17600	17567	17568	Mr. Erskine	143	" Humanity takes itself too seriously . It is the world 's original sin . If the caveman had known how to laugh , history would have been different . "
17601	17608	17610	17611	the duchess	566	" You are really very comforting , "
17613	17658	17610	17611	the duchess	566	" I have always felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt , for I take no interest at all in the East End . For the future I shall be able to look her in the face without a blush . "
17659	17668	17670	17671	Lord Henry	105	" A blush is very becoming , Duchess , "
17673	17680	17681	17681	she	566	" Only when one is young , "
17684	17717	17681	17681	she	566	" When an old woman like myself blushes , it is a very bad sign . Ah ! Lord Henry , I wish you would tell me how to become young again . "
17724	17741	17742	17742	he	105	" Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days , Duchess ? "
17752	17760	17761	17761	she	566	" A great many , I fear , "
17764	17771	17772	17772	he	105	" Then commit them over again , "
17776	17793	17772	17772	he	105	" To get back one 's youth , one has merely to repeat one 's follies . "
17794	17799	17800	17800	she	566	" A delightful theory ! "
17803	17811	17800	17800	she	566	" I must put it into practice . "
17812	17817	17772	17772	he	105	" A dangerous theory ! "
17843	17846	17847	17847	he	143	" Yes , "
17850	17892	17847	17847	he	143	" that is one of the great secrets of life . Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense , and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one 's mistakes . "
18200	18204	18205	18205	she	566	" How annoying ! "
18208	18336	18205	18205	she	566	" I must go . I have to call for my husband at the club , to take him to some absurd meeting at Willis 's Rooms , where he is going to be in the chair . If I am late he is sure to be furious , and I could n't have a scene in this bonnet . It is far too fragile . A harsh word would ruin it . No , I must go , dear Agatha . Good - bye , Lord Henry , you are quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing . I am sure I do n't know what to say about your views . You must come and dine with us some night . Tuesday ? Are you disengaged Tuesday ? "
18337	18348	18350	18351	Lord Henry	105	" For you I would throw over anybody , Duchess , "
18356	18370	18371	18371	she	588	" Ah ! that is very nice , and very wrong of you , "
18374	18379	18382	18382	she	588	" so mind you come "
18426	18432	18433	18433	he	143	" You talk books away , "
18436	18444	18433	18433	he	143	" why do n't you write one ? "
18445	18522	18406	18407	Mr. Erskine	143	" I am too fond of reading books to care to write them , Mr. Erskine . I should like to write a novel certainly , a novel that would be as lovely as a Persian carpet and as unreal . But there is no literary public in England for anything except newspapers , primers , and encyclopaedias . Of all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty of literature . "
18523	18530	18532	18533	Mr. Erskine	143	" I fear you are right , "
18535	18586	18532	18533	Mr. Erskine	143	" I myself used to have literary ambitions , but I gave them up long ago . And now , my dear young friend , if you will allow me to call you so , may I ask if you really meant all that you said to us at lunch ? "
18587	18595	18597	18598	Lord Henry	105	" I quite forget what I said , "
18600	18607	18597	18598	Lord Henry	105	" Was it all very bad ? "
18608	18695	18406	18407	Mr. Erskine	143	" Very bad indeed . In fact I consider you extremely dangerous , and if anything happens to our good duchess , we shall all look on you as being primarily responsible . But I should like to talk to you about life . The generation into which I was born was tedious . Some day , when you are tired of London , come down to Treadley and expound to me your philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate enough to possess . "
18696	18723	18597	18598	Lord Henry	105	" I shall be charmed . A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege . It has a perfect host , and a perfect library . "
18724	18730	18732	18734	the old gentleman	509	" You will complete it , "
18740	18770	18732	18734	the old gentleman	509	" And now I must bid good - bye to your excellent aunt . I am due at the Athenaeum . It is the hour when we sleep there . "
18771	18779	18597	18598	Lord Henry	105	" All of you , Mr. Erskine ? "
18780	18801	18732	18734	the old gentleman	509	" Forty of us , in forty arm - chairs . We are practising for an English Academy of Letters . "
18808	18816	18817	18817	he	105	" I am going to the park , "
18837	18844	18845	18845	he	108	" Let me come with you , "
18848	18863	18865	18866	Lord Henry	105	" But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him , "
18868	18911	18865	18866	Lord Henry	105	" I would sooner come with you ; yes , I feel I must come with you . Do let me . And you will promise to talk to me all the time ? No one talks so wonderfully as you do . "
18912	18925	18927	18928	Lord Henry	105	" Ah ! I have talked quite enough for to - day , "
18932	18958	18927	18928	Lord Henry	105	" All I want now is to look at life . You may come and look at it with me , if you care to . "
19216	19224	19225	19225	he	425	" How late you are , Harry ! "
19228	19240	19339	19339	she	596	" I am afraid it is not Harry , Mr. Gray , "
19256	19264	19246	19246	He	425	" I beg your pardon . I thought-- "
19265	19305	19339	19339	she	596	" You thought it was my husband . It is only his wife . You must let me introduce myself . I know you quite well by your photographs . I think my husband has got seventeen of them . "
19306	19313	19246	19246	He	425	" Not seventeen , Lady Henry ? "
19314	19334	19335	19335	She	596	" Well , eighteen , then . And I saw you with him the other night at the opera . "
19434	19446	19424	19424	she	596	" That was at Lohengrin , Lady Henry , I think ? "
19447	19500	19508	19508	her	596	" Yes ; it was at dear Lohengrin . I like Wagner 's music better than anybody 's . It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other people hearing what one says . That is a great advantage , do n't you think so , Mr. Gray ? "
19535	19578	19532	19532	his	108	" I am afraid I do n't think so , Lady Henry . I never talk during music -- at least , during good music . If one hears bad music , it is one 's duty to drown it in conversation . "
19579	19850	19508	19508	her	596	" Ah ! that is one of Harry 's views , is n't it , Mr. Gray ? I always hear Harry 's views from his friends . It is the only way I get to know of them . But you must not think I do n't like good music . I adore it , but I am afraid of it . It makes me too romantic . I have simply worshipped pianists -- two at a time , sometimes , Harry tells me . I do n't know what it is about them . Perhaps it is that they are foreigners . They all are , ai n't they ? Even those that are born in England become foreigners after a time , do n't they ? It is so clever of them , and such a compliment to art . Makes it quite cosmopolitan , does n't it ? You have never been to any of my parties , have you , Mr. Gray ? You must come . I ca n't afford orchids , but I spare no expense in foreigners . They make one 's rooms look so picturesque . But here is Harry ! Harry , I came in to look for you , to ask you something -- I forget what it was -- and I found Mr. Gray here . We have had such a pleasant chat about music . We have quite the same ideas . No ; I think our ideas are quite different . But he has been most pleasant . I am so glad I 've seen him . "
19851	19862	19864	19865	Lord Henry	105	" I am charmed , my love , quite charmed , "
19885	19929	19864	19865	Lord Henry	105	" So sorry I am late , Dorian . I went to look after a piece of old brocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it . Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing . "
19930	19939	19941	19942	Lady Henry	155	" I am afraid I must be going , "
19954	19998	19949	19949	her	155	" I have promised to drive with the duchess . Good - bye , Mr. Gray . Good - bye , Harry . You are dining out , I suppose ? So am I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady Thornbury 's . "
19999	20007	20009	20010	Lord Henry	105	" I dare say , my dear , "
20062	20075	20076	20076	he	105	" Never marry a woman with straw - coloured hair , Dorian , "
20083	20088	20203	20204	Lord Henry	105	" Why , Harry ? "
20089	20096	20203	20204	Lord Henry	105	" Because they are so sentimental . "
20097	20104	20203	20204	Lord Henry	105	" But I like sentimental people . "
20105	20131	20203	20204	Lord Henry	105	" Never marry at all , Dorian . Men marry because they are tired ; women , because they are curious : both are disappointed . "
20132	20174	20203	20204	Lord Henry	105	" I do n't think I am likely to marry , Harry . I am too much in love . That is one of your aphorisms . I am putting it into practice , as I do everything that you say . "
20175	20183	20185	20186	Lord Henry	105	" Who are you in love with ? "
20191	20196	20198	20199	Dorian Gray	108	" With an actress , "
20209	20217	20206	20206	his	105	" That is a rather commonplace debut . "
20218	20231	20203	20204	Lord Henry	105	" You would not say so if you saw her , Harry . "
20232	20237	20206	20206	his	105	" Who is she ? "
20238	20245	20203	20204	Lord Henry	105	" Her name is Sibyl Vane . "
20246	20252	20206	20206	his	105	" Never heard of her . "
20253	20270	20203	20204	Lord Henry	105	" No one has . People will some day , however . She is a genius . "
20271	20321	20206	20206	his	105	" My dear boy , no woman is a genius . Women are a decorative sex . They never have anything to say , but they say it charmingly . Women represent the triumph of matter over mind , just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals . "
20322	20329	20203	20204	Lord Henry	105	" Harry , how can you ? "
20330	20523	20206	20206	his	105	" My dear Dorian , it is quite true . I am analysing women at present , so I ought to know . The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was . I find that , ultimately , there are only two kinds of women , the plain and the coloured . The plain women are very useful . If you want to gain a reputation for respectability , you have merely to take them down to supper . The other women are very charming . They commit one mistake , however . They paint in order to try and look young . Our grandmothers painted in order to try and talk brilliantly . Rouge and esprit used to go together . That is all over now . As long as a woman can look ten years younger than her own daughter , she is perfectly satisfied . As for conversation , there are only five women in London worth talking to , and two of these ca n't be admitted into decent society . However , tell me about your genius . How long have you known her ? "
20524	20534	20203	20204	Lord Henry	105	" Ah ! Harry , your views terrify me . "
20535	20547	20206	20206	his	105	" Never mind that . How long have you known her ? "
20548	20553	20203	20204	Lord Henry	105	" About three weeks . "
20554	20563	20206	20206	his	105	" And where did you come across her ? "
20564	21018	20203	20204	Lord Henry	105	" I will tell you , Harry , but you must n't be unsympathetic about it . After all , it never would have happened if I had not met you . You filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life . For days after I met you , something seemed to throb in my veins . As I lounged in the park , or strolled down Piccadilly , I used to look at every one who passed me and wonder , with a mad curiosity , what sort of lives they led . Some of them fascinated me . Others filled me with terror . There was an exquisite poison in the air . I had a passion for sensations .... Well , one evening about seven o'clock , I determined to go out in search of some adventure . I felt that this grey monstrous London of ours , with its myriads of people , its sordid sinners , and its splendid sins , as you once phrased it , must have something in store for me . I fancied a thousand things . The mere danger gave me a sense of delight . I remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we first dined together , about the search for beauty being the real secret of life . I do n't know what I expected , but I went out and wandered eastward , soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black grassless squares . About half - past eight I passed by an absurd little theatre , with great flaring gas - jets and gaudy play - bills . A hideous Jew , in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life , was standing at the entrance , smoking a vile cigar . He had greasy ringlets , and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt . ' Have a box , my Lord ? ' he said , when he saw me , and he took off his hat with an air of gorgeous servility . There was something about him , Harry , that amused me . He was such a monster . You will laugh at me , I know , but I really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage - box . To the present day I ca n't make out why I did so ; and yet if I hadn't -- my dear Harry , if I hadn't -- I should have missed the greatest romance of my life . I see you are laughing . It is horrid of you ! "
21019	21121	20206	20206	his	105	" I am not laughing , Dorian ; at least I am not laughing at you . But you should not say the greatest romance of your life . You should say the first romance of your life . You will always be loved , and you will always be in love with love . A grande passion is the privilege of people who have nothing to do . That is the one use of the idle classes of a country . Do n't be afraid . There are exquisite things in store for you . This is merely the beginning . "
21122	21131	21133	21134	Dorian Gray	108	" Do you think my nature so shallow ? "
21137	21147	20206	20206	his	105	" No ; I think your nature so deep . "
21148	21154	20206	20206	his	105	" How do you mean ? "
21155	21273	20206	20206	his	105	" My dear boy , the people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people . What they call their loyalty , and their fidelity , I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination . Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect -- simply a confession of failure . Faithfulness ! I must analyse it some day . The passion for property is in it . There are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up . But I do n't want to interrupt you . Go on with your story . "
21274	21389	20206	20206	his	105	" Well , I found myself seated in a horrid little private box , with a vulgar drop - scene staring me in the face . I looked out from behind the curtain and surveyed the house . It was a tawdry affair , all Cupids and cornucopias , like a third - rate wedding - cake . The gallery and pit were fairly full , but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty , and there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the dress - circle . Women went about with oranges and ginger - beer , and there was a terrible consumption of nuts going on . "
21390	21405	20206	20206	his	105	" It must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama . "
21406	21448	20206	20206	his	105	" Just like , I should fancy , and very depressing . I began to wonder what on earth I should do when I caught sight of the play - bill . What do you think the play was , Harry ? "
21449	21519	20206	20206	his	105	" I should think ' The Idiot Boy ' , or ' Dumb but Innocent ' . Our fathers used to like that sort of piece , I believe . The longer I live , Dorian , the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is not good enough for us . In art , as in politics , les grandperes ont toujours tort . "
21520	22219	20206	20206	his	105	" This play was good enough for us , Harry . It was Romeo and Juliet . I must admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare done in such a wretched hole of a place . Still , I felt interested , in a sort of way . At any rate , I determined to wait for the first act . There was a dreadful orchestra , presided over by a young Hebrew who sat at a cracked piano , that nearly drove me away , but at last the drop - scene was drawn up and the play began . Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman , with corked eyebrows , a husky tragedy voice , and a figure like a beer - barrel . Mercutio was almost as bad . He was played by the low - comedian , who had introduced gags of his own and was on most friendly terms with the pit . They were both as grotesque as the scenery , and that looked as if it had come out of a country - booth . But Juliet ! Harry , imagine a girl , hardly seventeen years of age , with a little , flowerlike face , a small Greek head with plaited coils of dark - brown hair , eyes that were violet wells of passion , lips that were like the petals of a rose . She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen in my life . You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved , but that beauty , mere beauty , could fill your eyes with tears . I tell you , Harry , I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came across me . And her voice -- I never heard such a voice . It was very low at first , with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one 's ear . Then it became a little louder , and sounded like a flute or a distant hautboy . In the garden - scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing . There were moments , later on , when it had the wild passion of violins . You know how a voice can stir one . Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane are two things that I shall never forget . When I close my eyes , I hear them , and each of them says something different . I do n't know which to follow . Why should I not love her ? Harry , I do love her . She is everything to me in life . Night after night I go to see her play . One evening she is Rosalind , and the next evening she is Imogen . I have seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb , sucking the poison from her lover 's lips . I have watched her wandering through the forest of Arden , disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap . She has been mad , and has come into the presence of a guilty king , and given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of . She has been innocent , and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike throat . I have seen her in every age and in every costume . Ordinary women never appeal to one 's imagination . They are limited to their century . No glamour ever transfigures them . One knows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets . One can always find them . There is no mystery in any of them . They ride in the park in the morning and chatter at tea - parties in the afternoon . They have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable manner . They are quite obvious . But an actress ! How different an actress is ! Harry ! why did n't you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an actress ? "
22220	22232	20206	20206	his	105	" Because I have loved so many of them , Dorian . "
22233	22247	20206	20206	his	105	" Oh , yes , horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces . "
22248	22269	22271	22272	Lord Henry	105	" Do n't run down dyed hair and painted faces . There is an extraordinary charm in them , sometimes , "
22274	22287	20206	20206	his	105	" I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane . "
22288	22311	20206	20206	his	105	" You could not have helped telling me , Dorian . All through your life you will tell me everything you do . "
22312	22360	20206	20206	his	105	" Yes , Harry , I believe that is true . I can not help telling you things . You have a curious influence over me . If I ever did a crime , I would come and confess it to you . You would understand me . "
22361	22417	20206	20206	his	105	" People like you -- the wilful sunbeams of life -- don't commit crimes , Dorian . But I am much obliged for the compliment , all the same . And now tell me -- reach me the matches , like a good boy -- thanks -- what are your actual relations with Sibyl Vane ? "
22432	22440	22418	22419	Dorian Gray	108	" Harry ! Sibyl Vane is sacred ! "
22441	22455	22457	22458	Lord Henry	105	" It is only the sacred things that are worth touching , Dorian , "
22470	22531	22457	22458	Lord Henry	105	" But why should you be annoyed ? I suppose she will belong to you some day . When one is in love , one always begins by deceiving one 's self , and one always ends by deceiving others . That is what the world calls a romance . You know her , at any rate , I suppose ? "
22532	22635	22418	22419	Dorian Gray	108	" Of course I know her . On the first night I was at the theatre , the horrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over and offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her . I was furious with him , and told him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona . I think , from his blank look of amazement , that he was under the impression that I had taken too much champagne , or something . "
22636	22642	22457	22458	Lord Henry	105	" I am not surprised . "
22643	22701	22418	22419	Dorian Gray	108	" Then he asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers . I told him I never even read them . He seemed terribly disappointed at that , and confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy against him , and that they were every one of them to be bought . "
22702	22736	22457	22458	Lord Henry	105	" I should not wonder if he was quite right there . But , on the other hand , judging from their appearance , most of them can not be at all expensive . "
22737	22750	22752	22752	Dorian	108	" Well , he seemed to think they were beyond his means , "
22754	22884	22752	22752	Dorian	108	" By this time , however , the lights were being put out in the theatre , and I had to go . He wanted me to try some cigars that he strongly recommended . I declined . The next night , of course , I arrived at the place again . When he saw me , he made me a low bow and assured me that I was a munificent patron of art . He was a most offensive brute , though he had an extraordinary passion for Shakespeare . He told me once , with an air of pride , that his five bankruptcies were entirely due to ' The Bard , ' as he insisted on calling him . He seemed to think it a distinction . "
22885	22937	22457	22458	Lord Henry	105	" It was a distinction , my dear Dorian -- a great distinction . Most people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of life . To have ruined one 's self over poetry is an honour . But when did you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane ? "
22938	23010	22752	22752	Dorian	108	" The third night . She had been playing Rosalind . I could not help going round . I had thrown her some flowers , and she had looked at me -- at least I fancied that she had . The old Jew was persistent . He seemed determined to take me behind , so I consented . It was curious my not wanting to know her , was n't it ? "
23011	23020	22457	22458	Lord Henry	105	" No ; I do n't think so . "
23021	23028	22752	22752	Dorian	108	" My dear Harry , why ? "
23029	23047	22457	22458	Lord Henry	105	" I will tell you some other time . Now I want to know about the girl . "
23048	23184	22752	22752	Dorian	108	" Sibyl ? Oh , she was so shy and so gentle . There is something of a child about her . Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I told her what I thought of her performance , and she seemed quite unconscious of her power . I think we were both rather nervous . The old Jew stood grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom , making elaborate speeches about us both , while we stood looking at each other like children . He would insist on calling me ' My Lord , ' so I had to assure Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind . She said quite simply to me , ' You look more like a prince . I must call you Prince Charming . ' "
23185	23200	22457	22458	Lord Henry	105	" Upon my word , Dorian , Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments . "
23201	23264	22752	22752	Dorian	108	" You do n't understand her , Harry . She regarded me merely as a person in a play . She knows nothing of life . She lives with her mother , a faded tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta dressing - wrapper on the first night , and looks as if she had seen better days . "
23265	23275	23277	23278	Lord Henry	105	" I know that look . It depresses me , "
23284	23303	22752	22752	Dorian	108	" The Jew wanted to tell me her history , but I said it did not interest me . "
23304	23322	22752	22752	Dorian	108	" You were quite right . There is always something infinitely mean about other people 's tragedies . "
23323	23379	22752	22752	Dorian	108	" Sibyl is the only thing I care about . What is it to me where she came from ? From her little head to her little feet , she is absolutely and entirely divine . Every night of my life I go to see her act , and every night she is more marvellous . "
23380	23420	22752	22752	Dorian	108	" That is the reason , I suppose , that you never dine with me now . I thought you must have some curious romance on hand . You have ; but it is not quite what I expected . "
23421	23447	23449	23449	Dorian	108	" My dear Harry , we either lunch or sup together every day , and I have been to the opera with you several times , "
23458	23465	22752	22752	Dorian	108	" You always come dreadfully late . "
23466	23479	23480	23480	he	108	" Well , I ca n't help going to see Sibyl play , "
23483	23525	23480	23480	he	108	" even if it is only for a single act . I get hungry for her presence ; and when I think of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body , I am filled with awe . "
23526	23542	22752	22752	Dorian	108	" You can dine with me to - night , Dorian , ca n't you ? "
23548	23556	23557	23557	he	108	" To - night she is Imogen , "
23560	23571	23543	23543	He	108	" and to - morrow night she will be Juliet . "
23572	23579	22752	22752	Dorian	108	" When is she Sibyl Vane ? "
23580	23583	23543	23543	He	108	" Never . "
23584	23589	22752	22752	Dorian	108	" I congratulate you . "
23590	23713	23543	23543	He	108	" How horrid you are ! She is all the great heroines of the world in one . She is more than an individual . You laugh , but I tell you she has genius . I love her , and I must make her love me . You , who know all the secrets of life , tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me ! I want to make Romeo jealous . I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our laughter and grow sad . I want a breath of our passion to stir their dust into consciousness , to wake their ashes into pain . My God , Harry , how I worship her ! "
23808	23817	23819	23820	Lord Henry	105	" And what do you propose to do ? "
23824	23937	24530	24530	he	108	" I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act . I have not the slightest fear of the result . You are certain to acknowledge her genius . Then we must get her out of the Jew 's hands . She is bound to him for three years -- at least for two years and eight months -- from the present time . I shall have to pay him something , of course . When all that is settled , I shall take a West End theatre and bring her out properly . She will make the world as mad as she has made me . "
23938	23948	23819	23820	Lord Henry	105	" That would be impossible , my dear boy . "
23949	23994	24530	24530	he	108	" Yes , she will . She has not merely art , consummate art - instinct , in her , but she has personality also ; and you have often told me that it is personalities , not principles , that move the age . "
23995	24004	23819	23820	Lord Henry	105	" Well , what night shall we go ? "
24005	24030	24530	24530	he	108	" Let me see . To - day is Tuesday . Let us fix to - morrow . She plays Juliet to - morrow . "
24031	24047	23819	23820	Lord Henry	105	" All right . The Bristol at eight o'clock ; and I will get Basil . "
24048	24084	24530	24530	he	108	" Not eight , Harry , please . Half - past six . We must be there before the curtain rises . You must see her in the first act , where she meets Romeo . "
24085	24138	23819	23820	Lord Henry	105	" Half - past six ! What an hour ! It will be like having a meat - tea , or reading an English novel . It must be seven . No gentleman dines before seven . Shall you see Basil between this and then ? Or shall I write to him ? "
24139	24239	24530	24530	he	108	" Dear Basil ! I have not laid eyes on him for a week . It is rather horrid of me , as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful frame , specially designed by himself , and , though I am a little jealous of the picture for being a whole month younger than I am , I must admit that I delight in it . Perhaps you had better write to him . I do n't want to see him alone . He says things that annoy me . He gives me good advice . "
24244	24268	24240	24241	Lord Henry	105	" People are very fond of giving away what they need most themselves . It is what I call the depth of generosity . "
24269	24306	23819	23820	Lord Henry	105	" Oh , Basil is the best of fellows , but he seems to me to be just a bit of a Philistine . Since I have known you , Harry , I have discovered that . "
24307	24457	24240	24241	Lord Henry	105	" Basil , my dear boy , puts everything that is charming in him into his work . The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his prejudices , his principles , and his common sense . The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists . Good artists exist simply in what they make , and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are . A great poet , a really great poet , is the most unpoetical of all creatures . But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating . The worse their rhymes are , the more picturesque they look . The mere fact of having published a book of second - rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible . He lives the poetry that he can not write . The others write the poetry that they dare not realize . "
24458	24468	24470	24471	Dorian Gray	108	" I wonder is that really so , Harry ? "
24494	24528	24470	24471	Dorian Gray	108	" It must be , if you say it . And now I am off . Imogen is waiting for me . Do n't forget about to - morrow . Good - bye . "
25776	25786	25788	25789	the girl	2183	" Mother , Mother , I am so happy ! "
25832	25838	25839	25839	she	159	" I am so happy ! "
25842	25851	25839	25839	she	159	" and you must be happy , too ! "
25870	25873	25874	25874	she	173	" Happy ! "
25877	25916	25874	25874	she	173	" I am only happy , Sibyl , when I see you act . You must not think of anything but your acting . Mr. Isaacs has been very good to us , and we owe him money . "
25924	25929	25930	25930	she	2183	" Money , Mother ? "
25933	25945	25930	25930	she	2183	" what does money matter ? Love is more than money . "
25946	25991	25874	25874	she	173	" Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to get a proper outfit for James . You must not forget that , Sibyl . Fifty pounds is a very large sum . Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate . "
25992	26011	26013	26014	the girl	2183	" He is not a gentleman , Mother , and I hate the way he talks to me , "
26027	26039	26041	26043	the elder woman	646	" I do n't know how we could manage without him , "
26054	26073	26049	26049	her	159	" We do n't want him any more , Mother . Prince Charming rules life for us now . "
26118	26123	26124	26124	she	159	" I love him , "
26128	26135	26160	26161	The girl	2183	" Foolish child ! foolish child ! "
26384	26389	26390	26390	she	2183	" Mother , Mother , "
26393	26481	26390	26390	she	2183	" why does he love me so much ? I know why I love him . I love him because he is like what love himself should be . But what does he see in me ? I am not worthy of him . And yet -- why , I can not tell -- though I feel so much beneath him , I do n't feel humble . I feel proud , terribly proud . Mother , did you love my father as I love Prince Charming ? "
26523	26581	26513	26513	her	159	" Forgive me , Mother . I know it pains you to talk about our father . But it only pains you because you loved him so much . Do n't look so sad . I am as happy to - day as you were twenty years ago . Ah ! let me be happy for ever ! "
26582	26667	26681	26682	Mrs. Vane	173	" My child , you are far too young to think of falling in love . Besides , what do you know of this young man ? You do n't even know his name . The whole thing is most inconvenient , and really , when James is going away to Australia , and I have so much to think of , I must say that you should have shown more consideration . However , as I said before , if he is rich ... "
26668	26680	26513	26513	her	159	" Ah ! Mother , Mother , let me be happy ! "
26813	26829	26831	26832	the lad	425	" You might keep some of your kisses for me , Sibyl , I think , "
26840	26853	26854	26854	she	173	" Ah ! but you do n't like being kissed , Jim , "
26857	26865	26854	26854	she	173	" You are a dreadful old bear . "
26887	26924	26876	26877	James Vane	175	" I want you to come out with me for a walk , Sibyl . I do n't suppose I shall ever see this horrid London again . I am sure I do n't want to . "
26925	26936	26938	26939	Mrs. Vane	173	" My son , do n't say such dreadful things , "
26982	26992	26876	26877	James Vane	175	" Why not , Mother ? I mean it . "
26993	27052	26876	26877	James Vane	175	" You pain me , my son . I trust you will return from Australia in a position of affluence . I believe there is no society of any kind in the Colonies -- nothing that I would call society -- so when you have made your fortune , you must come back and assert yourself in London . "
27053	27056	27058	27059	the lad	425	" Society ! "
27061	27092	27058	27059	the lad	425	" I do n't want to know anything about that . I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the stage . I hate it . "
27093	27098	27100	27100	Sibyl	159	" Oh , Jim ! "
27104	27193	27100	27100	Sibyl	159	" how unkind of you ! But are you really going for a walk with me ? That will be nice ! I was afraid you were going to say good - bye to some of your friends -- to Tom Hardy , who gave you that hideous pipe , or Ned Langton , who makes fun of you for smoking it . It is very sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon . Where shall we go ? Let us go to the park . "
27194	27200	27201	27201	he	667	" I am too shabby , "
27206	27215	27201	27201	he	667	" Only swell people go to the park . "
27216	27221	27222	27222	she	668	" Nonsense , Jim , "
27238	27242	27243	27243	he	667	" Very well , "
27248	27257	27243	27243	he	667	" but do n't be too long dressing . "
27304	27312	27313	27313	he	667	" Mother , are my things ready ? "
27316	27322	27323	27323	she	668	" Quite ready , James , "
27411	27428	27429	27429	she	668	" I hope you will be contented , James , with your sea - faring life , "
27432	27470	27429	27429	she	668	" You must remember that it is your own choice . You might have entered a solicitor 's office . Solicitors are a very respectable class , and in the country often dine with the best families . "
27471	27481	27482	27482	he	676	" I hate offices , and I hate clerks , "
27485	27525	27482	27482	he	676	" But you are quite right . I have chosen my own life . All I say is , watch over Sibyl . Do n't let her come to any harm . Mother , you must watch over her . "
27526	27542	27429	27429	she	668	" James , you really talk very strangely . Of course I watch over Sibyl . "
27543	27570	27482	27482	he	676	" I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to talk to her . Is that right ? What about that ? "
27571	27679	27429	27429	she	668	" You are speaking about things you do n't understand , James . In the profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying attention . I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time . That was when acting was really understood . As for Sibyl , I do not know at present whether her attachment is serious or not . But there is no doubt that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman . He is always most polite to me . Besides , he has the appearance of being rich , and the flowers he sends are lovely . "
27680	27690	27692	27693	the lad	425	" You do n't know his name , though , "
27696	27699	27708	27708	her	2159	" No , "
27711	27739	27708	27708	her	2159	" He has not yet revealed his real name . I think it is quite romantic of him . He is probably a member of the aristocracy . "
27746	27753	27754	27754	he	175	" Watch over Sibyl , Mother , "
27757	27762	27754	27754	he	175	" watch over her . "
27763	27854	27855	27856	The lad	425	" My son , you distress me very much . Sibyl is always under my special care . Of course , if this gentleman is wealthy , there is no reason why she should not contract an alliance with him . I trust he is one of the aristocracy . He has all the appearance of it , I must say . It might be a most brilliant marriage for Sibyl . They would make a charming couple . His good looks are really quite remarkable ; everybody notices them . "
27890	27897	27898	27898	she	159	" How serious you both are ! "
27901	27907	27898	27898	she	159	" What is the matter ? "
27908	27911	27912	27912	he	425	" Nothing , "
27915	27953	27912	27912	he	425	" I suppose one must be serious sometimes . Good - bye , Mother ; I will have my dinner at five o'clock . Everything is packed , except my shirts , so you need not trouble . "
27954	27962	27963	27963	she	159	" Good - bye , my son , "
27999	28005	28007	28008	the girl	2183	" Kiss me , Mother , "
28022	28029	28031	28032	Mrs. Vane	173	" My child ! my child ! "
28046	28051	28057	28057	He	681	" Come , Sibyl , "
28910	28924	28926	28926	Sibyl	159	" You are not listening to a word I am saying , Jim , "
28928	28945	28926	28926	Sibyl	159	" and I am making the most delightful plans for your future . Do say something . "
28946	28955	29002	29002	She	159	" What do you want me to say ? "
28956	28971	28972	28972	she	159	" Oh ! that you will be a good boy and not forget us , "
28984	29001	28979	28979	He	175	" You are more likely to forget me than I am to forget you , Sibyl . "
29005	29013	29014	29014	she	159	" What do you mean , Jim ? "
29017	29046	28979	28979	He	175	" You have a new friend , I hear . Who is he ? Why have you not told me about him ? He means you no good . "
29047	29052	29053	29053	she	159	" Stop , Jim ! "
29056	29069	29053	29053	she	159	" You must not say anything against him . I love him . "
29070	29081	29083	29084	the lad	425	" Why , you do n't even know his name , "
29086	29098	29083	29084	the lad	425	" Who is he ? I have a right to know . "
29099	29382	29053	29053	she	159	" He is called Prince Charming . Do n't you like the name . Oh ! you silly boy ! you should never forget it . If you only saw him , you would think him the most wonderful person in the world . Some day you will meet him -- when you come back from Australia . You will like him so much . Everybody likes him , and I ... love him . I wish you could come to the theatre to - night . He is going to be there , and I am to play Juliet . Oh ! how I shall play it ! Fancy , Jim , to be in love and play Juliet ! To have him sitting there ! To play for his delight ! I am afraid I may frighten the company , frighten or enthrall them . To be in love is to surpass one 's self . Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting ' genius ' to his loafers at the bar . He has preached me as a dogma ; to - night he will announce me as a revelation . I feel it . And it is all his , his only , Prince Charming , my wonderful lover , my god of graces . But I am poor beside him . Poor ? What does that matter ? When poverty creeps in at the door , love flies in through the window . Our proverbs want rewriting . They were made in winter , and it is summer now ; spring - time for me , I think , a very dance of blossoms in blue skies . "
29383	29389	29391	29392	the lad	425	" He is a gentleman , "
29395	29399	29400	29400	she	727	" A prince ! "
29404	29411	29400	29400	she	727	" What more do you want ? "
29412	29419	29053	29053	she	159	" He wants to enslave you . "
29420	29430	29400	29400	she	727	" I shudder at the thought of being free . "
29431	29440	29053	29053	she	159	" I want you to beware of him . "
29441	29458	29400	29400	she	727	" To see him is to worship him ; to know him is to trust him . "
29459	29468	29053	29053	she	159	" Sibyl , you are mad about him . "
29476	29591	29469	29469	She	727	" You dear old Jim , you talk as if you were a hundred . Some day you will be in love yourself . Then you will know what it is . Do n't look so sulky . Surely you should be glad to think that , though you are going away , you leave me happier than I have ever been before . Life has been hard for us both , terribly hard and difficult . But it will be different now . You are going to a new world , and I have found one . Here are two chairs ; let us sit down and see the smart people go by . "
29745	29750	29751	29751	she	159	" There he is ! "
29754	29757	29759	29760	Jim Vane	175	" Who ? "
29762	29766	29767	29767	she	159	" Prince Charming , "
29786	29805	29806	29806	he	681	" Show him to me . Which is he ? Point him out . I must see him ! "
29844	29849	29851	29851	Sibyl	159	" He is gone , "
29854	29862	29851	29851	Sibyl	159	" I wish you had seen him . "
29863	29893	29903	29903	his	681	" I wish I had , for as sure as there is a God in heaven , if he ever does you any wrong , I shall kill him . "
29929	29938	29939	29939	she	743	" Come away , Jim ; come away , "
29993	30060	29988	29988	her	743	" You are foolish , Jim , utterly foolish ; a bad - tempered boy , that is all . How can you say such horrible things ? You do n't know what you are talking about . You are simply jealous and unkind . Ah ! I wish you would fall in love . Love makes people good , and what you said was wicked . "
30061	30066	30067	30067	he	681	" I am sixteen , "
30070	30132	29988	29988	her	743	" and I know what I am about . Mother is no help to you . She does n't understand how to look after you . I wish now that I was not going to Australia at all . I have a great mind to chuck the whole thing up . I would , if my articles had n't been signed . "
30133	30208	30263	30263	she	746	" Oh , do n't be so serious , Jim . You are like one of the heroes of those silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in . I am not going to quarrel with you . I have seen him , and oh ! to see him is perfect happiness . We wo n't quarrel . I know you would never harm any one I love , would you ? "
30209	30221	30263	30263	she	746	" Not as long as you love him , I suppose , "
30227	30235	30236	30236	she	746	" I shall love him for ever ! "
30239	30243	30263	30263	she	746	" And he ? "
30244	30250	30263	30263	she	746	" For ever , too ! "
30251	30256	30263	30263	she	746	" He had better . "
30622	30632	30633	30633	he	175	" Mother , I have something to ask you , "
30649	30669	30644	30644	She	2159	" Tell me the truth . I have a right to know . Were you married to my father ? "
30761	30764	30765	30765	she	2159	" No , "
30776	30784	30786	30787	the lad	425	" My father was a scoundrel then ! "
30798	30851	30793	30793	She	2159	" I knew he was not free . We loved each other very much . If he had lived , he would have made provision for us . Do n't speak against him , my son . He was your father , and a gentleman . Indeed , he was highly connected . "
30859	30867	30868	30868	he	425	" I do n't care for myself , "
30871	30907	30868	30868	he	425	" but do n't let Sibyl .... It is a gentleman , is n't it , who is in love with her , or says he is ? Highly connected , too , I suppose . "
30933	30939	30940	30940	she	765	" Sibyl has a mother , "
30943	30948	30940	30940	she	765	" I had none . "
30967	30982	30983	30983	he	425	" I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my father , "
30986	31052	30983	30983	he	425	" but I could not help it . I must go now . Good - bye . Do n't forget that you will have only one child now to look after , and believe me that if this man wrongs my sister , I will find out who he is , track him down , and kill him like a dog . I swear it . "
31262	31273	31275	31276	Lord Henry	105	" I suppose you have heard the news , Basil ? "
31299	31304	31306	31307	the artist	353	" No , Harry , "
31319	31364	31306	31307	the artist	353	" What is it ? Nothing about politics , I hope ! They do n't interest me . There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons worth painting , though many of them would be the better for a little whitewashing . "
31365	31374	31376	31377	Lord Henry	105	" Dorian Gray is engaged to be married , "
31391	31398	31399	31399	he	106	" Dorian engaged to be married ! "
31402	31405	31399	31399	he	106	" Impossible ! "
31406	31412	31306	31307	the artist	353	" It is perfectly true . "
31413	31417	31399	31399	he	106	" To whom ? "
31418	31426	31306	31307	the artist	353	" To some little actress or other . "
31427	31440	31399	31399	he	106	" I ca n't believe it . Dorian is far too sensible . "
31441	31460	31306	31307	the artist	353	" Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then , my dear Basil . "
31461	31477	31399	31399	he	106	" Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then , Harry . "
31478	31483	31485	31486	Lord Henry	105	" Except in America , "
31489	31545	31485	31486	Lord Henry	105	" But I did n't say he was married . I said he was engaged to be married . There is a great difference . I have a distinct remembrance of being married , but I have no recollection at all of being engaged . I am inclined to think that I never was engaged . "
31546	31573	31399	31399	he	106	" But think of Dorian 's birth , and position , and wealth . It would be absurd for him to marry so much beneath him . "
31574	31617	31485	31486	Lord Henry	105	" If you want to make him marry this girl , tell him that , Basil . He is sure to do it , then . Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing , it is always from the noblest motives . "
31618	31651	31399	31399	he	106	" I hope the girl is good , Harry . I do n't want to see Dorian tied to some vile creature , who might degrade his nature and ruin his intellect . "
31652	31665	31667	31668	Lord Henry	105	" Oh , she is better than good -- she is beautiful , "
31680	31743	31399	31399	he	106	" Dorian says she is beautiful , and he is not often wrong about things of that kind . Your portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal appearance of other people . It has had that excellent effect , amongst others . We are to see her to - night , if that boy does n't forget his appointment . "
31744	31749	31399	31399	he	106	" Are you serious ? "
31750	31777	31399	31399	he	106	" Quite serious , Basil . I should be miserable if I thought I should ever be more serious than I am at the present moment . "
31778	31788	31790	31791	the painter	386	" But do you approve of it , Harry ? "
31804	31820	31801	31801	his	386	" You ca n't approve of it , possibly . It is some silly infatuation . "
31821	32080	31399	31399	he	106	" I never approve , or disapprove , of anything now . It is an absurd attitude to take towards life . We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices . I never take any notice of what common people say , and I never interfere with what charming people do . If a personality fascinates me , whatever mode of expression that personality selects is absolutely delightful to me . Dorian Gray falls in love with a beautiful girl who acts Juliet , and proposes to marry her . Why not ? If he wedded Messalina , he would be none the less interesting . You know I am not a champion of marriage . The real drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish . And unselfish people are colourless . They lack individuality . Still , there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex . They retain their egotism , and add to it many other egos . They are forced to have more than one life . They become more highly organized , and to be highly organized is , I should fancy , the object of man 's existence . Besides , every experience is of value , and whatever one may say against marriage , it is certainly an experience . I hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife , passionately adore her for six months , and then suddenly become fascinated by some one else . He would be a wonderful study . "
32081	32127	31801	31801	his	386	" You do n't mean a single word of all that , Harry ; you know you do n't . If Dorian Gray 's life were spoiled , no one would be sorrier than yourself . You are much better than you pretend to be . "
32132	32317	32128	32129	Lord Henry	105	" The reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves . The basis of optimism is sheer terror . We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to us . We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account , and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our pockets . I mean everything that I have said . I have the greatest contempt for optimism . As for a spoiled life , no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested . If you want to mar a nature , you have merely to reform it . As for marriage , of course that would be silly , but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women . I will certainly encourage them . They have the charm of being fashionable . But here is Dorian himself . He will tell you more than I can . "
32318	32333	32335	32336	the lad	425	" My dear Harry , my dear Basil , you must both congratulate me ! "
32361	32402	32403	32403	He	425	" I have never been so happy . Of course , it is sudden -- all really delightful things are . And yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my life . "
32416	32428	32430	32430	Hallward	106	" I hope you will always be very happy , Dorian , "
32432	32455	32430	32430	Hallward	106	" but I do n't quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement . You let Harry know . "
32456	32469	32472	32473	Lord Henry	105	" And I do n't forgive you for being late for dinner , "
32489	32518	32472	32473	Lord Henry	105	" Come , let us sit down and try what the new chef here is like , and then you will tell us how it all came about . "
32519	32528	32530	32530	Dorian	108	" There is really not much to tell , "
32542	33018	32530	32530	Dorian	108	" What happened was simply this . After I left you yesterday evening , Harry , I dressed , had some dinner at that little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to , and went down at eight o'clock to the theatre . Sibyl was playing Rosalind . Of course , the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd . But Sibyl ! You should have seen her ! When she came on in her boy 's clothes , she was perfectly wonderful . She wore a moss - coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves , slim , brown , cross - gartered hose , a dainty little green cap with a hawk 's feather caught in a jewel , and a hooded cloak lined with dull red . She had never seemed to me more exquisite . She had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your studio , Basil . Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose . As for her acting -- well , you shall see her to - night . She is simply a born artist . I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled . I forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century . I was away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen . After the performance was over , I went behind and spoke to her . As we were sitting together , suddenly there came into her eyes a look that I had never seen there before . My lips moved towards hers . We kissed each other . I ca n't describe to you what I felt at that moment . It seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose - coloured joy . She trembled all over and shook like a white narcissus . Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands . I feel that I should not tell you all this , but I ca n't help it . Of course , our engagement is a dead secret . She has not even told her own mother . I do n't know what my guardians will say . Lord Radley is sure to be furious . I do n't care . I shall be of age in less than a year , and then I can do what I like . I have been right , Basil , have n't I , to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare 's plays ? Lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear . I have had the arms of Rosalind around me , and kissed Juliet on the mouth . "
33019	33030	33032	33032	Hallward	106	" Yes , Dorian , I suppose you were right , "
33035	33044	33046	33047	Lord Henry	105	" Have you seen her to - day ? "
33055	33075	33052	33052	his	108	" I left her in the forest of Arden ; I shall find her in an orchard in Verona . "
33086	33115	33079	33079	his	105	" At what particular point did you mention the word marriage , Dorian ? And what did she say in answer ? Perhaps you forgot all about it . "
33116	33176	33217	33217	Hallward	106	" My dear Harry , I did not treat it as a business transaction , and I did not make any formal proposal . I told her that I loved her , and she said she was not worthy to be my wife . Not worthy ! Why , the whole world is nothing to me compared with her . "
33177	33183	33185	33186	Lord Henry	105	" Women are wonderfully practical , "
33188	33216	33185	33186	Lord Henry	105	" much more practical than we are . In situations of that kind we often forget to say anything about marriage , and they always remind us . "
33225	33260	33219	33219	his	106	" Do n't , Harry . You have annoyed Dorian . He is not like other men . He would never bring misery upon any one . His nature is too fine for that . "
33268	33276	33277	33277	he	105	" Dorian is never annoyed with me , "
33280	33353	33277	33277	he	105	" I asked the question for the best reason possible , for the only reason , indeed , that excuses one for asking any question -- simple curiosity . I have a theory that it is always the women who propose to us , and not we who propose to the women . Except , of course , in middle - class life . But then the middle classes are not modern . "
33363	33556	33360	33360	his	108	" You are quite incorrigible , Harry ; but I do n't mind . It is impossible to be angry with you . When you see Sibyl Vane , you will feel that the man who could wrong her would be a beast , a beast without a heart . I can not understand how any one can wish to shame the thing he loves . I love Sibyl Vane . I want to place her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman who is mine . What is marriage ? An irrevocable vow . You mock at it for that . Ah ! do n't mock . It is an irrevocable vow that I want to take . Her trust makes me faithful , her belief makes me good . When I am with her , I regret all that you have taught me . I become different from what you have known me to be . I am changed , and the mere touch of Sibyl Vane 's hand makes me forget you and all your wrong , fascinating , poisonous , delightful theories . "
33557	33563	33565	33566	Lord Henry	105	" And those are ... ? "
33574	33601	33707	33707	his	108	" Oh , your theories about life , your theories about love , your theories about pleasure . All your theories , in fact , Harry . "
33602	33614	33615	33615	he	105	" Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about , "
33623	33680	33618	33618	his	105	" But I am afraid I can not claim my theory as my own . It belongs to Nature , not to me . Pleasure is Nature 's test , her sign of approval . When we are happy , we are always good , but when we are good , we are not always happy . "
33681	33692	33694	33695	Basil Hallward	106	" Ah ! but what do you mean by good ? "
33697	33700	33702	33702	Dorian	108	" Yes , "
33732	33742	33712	33713	Lord Henry	105	" what do you mean by good , Harry ? "
33743	33757	33758	33758	he	105	" To be good is to be in harmony with one 's self , "
33777	33883	33758	33758	he	105	" Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others . One 's own life -- that is the important thing . As for the lives of one 's neighbours , if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan , one can flaunt one 's moral views about them , but they are not one 's concern . Besides , individualism has really the higher aim . Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one 's age . I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality . "
33884	33909	33911	33912	the painter	386	" But , surely , if one lives merely for one 's self , Harry , one pays a terrible price for doing so ? "
33914	33959	33758	33758	he	105	" Yes , we are overcharged for everything nowadays . I should fancy that the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but self - denial . Beautiful sins , like beautiful things , are the privilege of the rich . "
33960	33971	33758	33758	he	105	" One has to pay in other ways but money . "
33972	33980	33758	33758	he	105	" What sort of ways , Basil ? "
33981	34003	33758	33758	he	105	" Oh ! I should fancy in remorse , in suffering , in ... well , in the consciousness of degradation . "
34010	34083	34007	34007	his	105	" My dear fellow , mediaeval art is charming , but mediaeval emotions are out of date . One can use them in fiction , of course . But then the only things that one can use in fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact . Believe me , no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure , and no uncivilized man ever knows what a pleasure is . "
34084	34091	34093	34094	Dorian Gray	108	" I know what pleasure is , "
34096	34104	34093	34094	Dorian Gray	108	" It is to adore some one . "
34105	34114	34115	34115	he	108	" That is certainly better than being adored , "
34123	34155	34115	34115	he	108	" Being adored is a nuisance . Women treat us just as humanity treats its gods . They worship us , and are always bothering us to do something for them . "
34156	34173	34175	34176	the lad	425	" I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to us , "
34179	34196	34175	34176	the lad	425	" They create love in our natures . They have a right to demand it back . "
34197	34205	34207	34207	Hallward	106	" That is quite true , Dorian , "
34209	34216	34218	34219	Lord Henry	105	" Nothing is ever quite true , "
34221	34225	34227	34227	Dorian	108	" This is , "
34229	34248	34227	34227	Dorian	108	" You must admit , Harry , that women give to men the very gold of their lives . "
34249	34252	34253	34253	he	105	" Possibly , "
34256	34301	34253	34253	he	105	" but they invariably want it back in such very small change . That is the worry . Women , as some witty Frenchman once put it , inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always prevent us from carrying them out . "
34302	34320	34227	34227	Dorian	108	" Harry , you are dreadful ! I do n't know why I like you so much . "
34321	34330	34331	34331	he	105	" You will always like me , Dorian , "
34334	34442	34331	34331	he	105	" Will you have some coffee , you fellows ? Waiter , bring coffee , and fine - champagne , and some cigarettes . No , do n't mind the cigarettes -- I have some . Basil , I ca n't allow you to smoke cigars . You must have a cigarette . A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure . It is exquisite , and it leaves one unsatisfied . What more can one want ? Yes , Dorian , you will always be fond of me . I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit . "
34443	34451	34453	34454	the lad	425	" What nonsense you talk , Harry ! "
34475	34511	34453	34454	the lad	425	" Let us go down to the theatre . When Sibyl comes on the stage you will have a new ideal of life . She will represent something to you that you have never known . "
34512	34518	34520	34521	Lord Henry	105	" I have known everything , "
34531	34622	34520	34521	Lord Henry	105	" but I am always ready for a new emotion . I am afraid , however , that , for me at any rate , there is no such thing . Still , your wonderful girl may thrill me . I love acting . It is so much more real than life . Let us go . Dorian , you will come with me . I am so sorry , Basil , but there is only room for two in the brougham . You must follow us in a hansom . "
35021	35032	35034	35035	Lord Henry	105	" What a place to find one 's divinity in ! "
35037	35040	35042	35043	Dorian Gray	108	" Yes ! "
35045	35142	35042	35043	Dorian Gray	108	" It was here I found her , and she is divine beyond all living things . When she acts , you will forget everything . These common rough people , with their coarse faces and brutal gestures , become quite different when she is on the stage . They sit silently and watch her . They weep and laugh as she wills them to do . She makes them as responsive as a violin . She spiritualizes them , and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one 's self . "
35143	35160	35162	35163	Lord Henry	105	" The same flesh and blood as one 's self ! Oh , I hope not ! "
35179	35190	35192	35193	the painter	386	" Do n't pay any attention to him , Dorian , "
35195	35349	35192	35193	the painter	386	" I understand what you mean , and I believe in this girl . Any one you love must be marvellous , and any girl who has the effect you describe must be fine and noble . To spiritualize one 's age -- that is something worth doing . If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without one , if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and ugly , if she can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own , she is worthy of all your adoration , worthy of the adoration of the world . This marriage is quite right . I did not think so at first , but I admit it now . The gods made Sibyl Vane for you . Without her you would have been incomplete . "
35350	35355	35357	35358	Dorian Gray	108	" Thanks , Basil , "
35364	35436	35357	35358	Dorian Gray	108	" I knew that you would understand me . Harry is so cynical , he terrifies me . But here is the orchestra . It is quite dreadful , but it only lasts for about five minutes . Then the curtain rises , and you will see the girl to whom I am going to give all my life , to whom I have given everything that is good in me . "
35578	35583	35573	35573	his	105	" Charming ! charming ! "
36046	36050	36075	36075	she	159	" It lightens . "
36209	36217	36218	36218	he	105	" She is quite beautiful , Dorian , "
36221	36232	36218	36218	he	105	" but she ca n't act . Let us go . "
36233	36243	36245	36246	the lad	425	" I am going to see the play through , "
36254	36276	36245	36246	the lad	425	" I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an evening , Harry . I apologize to you both . "
36277	36290	36292	36292	Hallward	106	" My dear Dorian , I should think Miss Vane was ill , "
36294	36302	36292	36292	Hallward	106	" We will come some other night . "
36303	36310	36311	36311	he	106	" I wish she were ill , "
36314	36350	36311	36311	he	106	" But she seems to me to be simply callous and cold . She has entirely altered . Last night she was a great artist . This evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress . "
36351	36374	36245	36246	the lad	425	" Do n't talk like that about any one you love , Dorian . Love is a more wonderful thing than art . "
36375	36384	36386	36387	Lord Henry	105	" They are both simply forms of imitation , "
36389	36558	36386	36387	Lord Henry	105	" But do let us go . Dorian , you must not stay here any longer . It is not good for one 's morals to see bad acting . Besides , I do n't suppose you will want your wife to act , so what does it matter if she plays Juliet like a wooden doll ? She is very lovely , and if she knows as little about life as she does about acting , she will be a delightful experience . There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating -- people who know absolutely everything , and people who know absolutely nothing . Good heavens , my dear boy , do n't look so tragic ! The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming . Come to the club with Basil and myself . We will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane . She is beautiful . What more can you want ? "
36559	36565	36567	36568	the lad	425	" Go away , Harry , "
36570	36595	36567	36568	the lad	425	" I want to be alone . Basil , you must go . Ah ! ca n't you see that my heart is breaking ? "
36631	36638	36640	36641	Lord Henry	105	" Let us go , Basil , "
36825	36836	36837	36837	she	2183	" How badly I acted to - night , Dorian ! "
36840	36843	36844	36844	he	108	" Horribly ! "
36853	36880	36844	36844	he	108	" Horribly ! It was dreadful . Are you ill ? You have no idea what it was . You have no idea what I suffered . "
36885	36888	36889	36889	she	2183	" Dorian , "
36920	36937	36889	36889	she	2183	" Dorian , you should have understood . But you understand now , do n't you ? "
36938	36942	36943	36943	he	108	" Understand what ? "
36948	36973	36902	36902	her	2183	" Why I was so bad to - night . Why I shall always be bad . Why I shall never act well again . "
36979	37010	36974	36974	He	108	" You are ill , I suppose . When you are ill you should n't act . You make yourself ridiculous . My friends were bored . I was bored . "
37032	37037	37038	37038	she	2183	" Dorian , Dorian , "
37041	37494	37038	37038	she	2183	" before I knew you , acting was the one reality of my life . It was only in the theatre that I lived . I thought that it was all true . I was Rosalind one night and Portia the other . The joy of Beatrice was my joy , and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine also . I believed in everything . The common people who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike . The painted scenes were my world . I knew nothing but shadows , and I thought them real . You came -- oh , my beautiful love!--and you freed my soul from prison . You taught me what reality really is . To - night , for the first time in my life , I saw through the hollowness , the sham , the silliness of the empty pageant in which I had always played . To - night , for the first time , I became conscious that the Romeo was hideous , and old , and painted , that the moonlight in the orchard was false , that the scenery was vulgar , and that the words I had to speak were unreal , were not my words , were not what I wanted to say . You had brought me something higher , something of which all art is but a reflection . You had made me understand what love really is . My love ! My love ! Prince Charming ! Prince of life ! I have grown sick of shadows . You are more to me than all art can ever be . What have I to do with the puppets of a play ? When I came on to - night , I could not understand how it was that everything had gone from me . I thought that I was going to be wonderful . I found that I could do nothing . Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant . The knowledge was exquisite to me . I heard them hissing , and I smiled . What could they know of love such as ours ? Take me away , Dorian -- take me away with you , where we can be quite alone . I hate the stage . I might mimic a passion that I do not feel , but I can not mimic one that burns me like fire . Oh , Dorian , Dorian , you understand now what it signifies ? Even if I could do it , it would be profanation for me to play at being in love . You have made me see that . "
37508	37515	37516	37516	he	840	" You have killed my love , "
37581	37584	37585	37585	he	840	" Yes , "
37588	37821	37585	37585	he	840	" you have killed my love . You used to stir my imagination . Now you do n't even stir my curiosity . You simply produce no effect . I loved you because you were marvellous , because you had genius and intellect , because you realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the shadows of art . You have thrown it all away . You are shallow and stupid . My God ! how mad I was to love you ! What a fool I have been ! You are nothing to me now . I will never see you again . I will never think of you . I will never mention your name . You do n't know what you were to me , once . Why , once ... Oh , I ca n't bear to think of it ! I wish I had never laid eyes upon you ! You have spoiled the romance of my life . How little you can know of love , if you say it mars your art ! Without your art , you are nothing . I would have made you famous , splendid , magnificent . The world would have worshipped you , and you would have borne my name . What are you now ? A third - rate actress with a pretty face . "
37846	37854	37855	37855	she	2183	" You are not serious , Dorian ? "
37858	37863	37855	37855	she	2183	" You are acting . "
37864	37879	37880	37880	he	843	" Acting ! I leave that to you . You do it so well , "
37926	37932	37933	37933	he	843	" Do n't touch me ! "
37958	37968	37969	37969	she	2183	" Dorian , Dorian , do n't leave me ! "
37972	38187	37969	37969	she	2183	" I am so sorry I did n't act well . I was thinking of you all the time . But I will try -- indeed , I will try . It came so suddenly across me , my love for you . I think I should never have known it if you had not kissed me -- if we had not kissed each other . Kiss me again , my love . Do n't go away from me . I could n't bear it . Oh ! do n't go away from me . My brother ... No ; never mind . He did n't mean it . He was in jest .... But you , oh ! ca n't you forgive me for to - night ? I will work so hard and try to improve . Do n't be cruel to me , because I love you better than anything in the world . After all , it is only once that I have not pleased you . But you are quite right , Dorian . I should have shown myself more of an artist . It was foolish of me , and yet I could n't help it . Oh , do n't leave me , do n't leave me . "
38263	38268	38269	38269	he	108	" I am going , "
38279	38301	38269	38269	he	108	" I do n't wish to be unkind , but I ca n't see you again . You have disappointed me . "
40005	40009	40010	40010	he	108	" How horrible ! "
40195	40203	40204	40204	he	188	" Monsieur has well slept this morning , "
40209	40217	40219	40220	Dorian Gray	108	" What o'clock is it , Victor ? "
40223	40232	40219	40220	Dorian Gray	108	" One hour and a quarter , Monsieur . "
40602	40608	40610	40611	his valet	504	" Too cold for Monsieur ? "
40620	40626	40610	40611	his valet	504	" I shut the window ? "
40632	40638	40639	40639	he	108	" I am not cold , "
40834	40846	40847	40847	he	108	" I am not at home to any one , Victor , "
41572	41599	41566	41567	Lord Henry	105	" My dear boy , I must see you . Let me in at once . I ca n't bear your shutting yourself up like this . "
41680	41691	41696	41696	he	108	" I am so sorry for it all , Dorian , "
41699	41710	41696	41696	he	108	" But you must not think too much about it . "
41711	41719	41721	41722	the lad	425	" Do you mean about Sibyl Vane ? "
41724	41730	41732	41733	Lord Henry	105	" Yes , of course , "
41747	41782	41732	41733	Lord Henry	105	" It is dreadful , from one point of view , but it was not your fault . Tell me , did you go behind and see her , after the play was over ? "
41783	41786	41696	41696	he	108	" Yes . "
41787	41802	41732	41733	Lord Henry	105	" I felt sure you had . Did you make a scene with her ? "
41803	41839	41696	41696	he	108	" I was brutal , Harry -- perfectly brutal . But it is all right now . I am not sorry for anything that has happened . It has taught me to know myself better . "
41840	41875	41732	41733	Lord Henry	105	" Ah , Dorian , I am so glad you take it in that way ! I was afraid I would find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours . "
41876	41884	41886	41886	Dorian	108	" I have got through all that , "
41894	41964	41886	41886	Dorian	108	" I am perfectly happy now . I know what conscience is , to begin with . It is not what you told me it was . It is the divinest thing in us . Do n't sneer at it , Harry , any more -- at least not before me . I want to be good . I ca n't bear the idea of my soul being hideous . "
41965	41990	41732	41733	Lord Henry	105	" A very charming artistic basis for ethics , Dorian ! I congratulate you on it . But how are you going to begin ? "
41991	41997	41886	41886	Dorian	108	" By marrying Sibyl Vane . "
41998	42003	42005	42006	Lord Henry	105	" Marrying Sibyl Vane ! "
42018	42024	42005	42006	Lord Henry	105	" But , my dear Dorian-- "
42025	42089	41886	41886	Dorian	108	" Yes , Harry , I know what you are going to say . Something dreadful about marriage . Do n't say it . Do n't ever say things of that kind to me again . Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me . I am not going to break my word to her . She is to be my wife . "
42090	42121	42005	42006	Lord Henry	105	" Your wife ! Dorian ! ... Did n't you get my letter ? I wrote to you this morning , and sent the note down by my own man . "
42122	42166	41886	41886	Dorian	108	" Your letter ? Oh , yes , I remember . I have not read it yet , Harry . I was afraid there might be something in it that I would n't like . You cut life to pieces with your epigrams . "
42167	42173	42005	42006	Lord Henry	105	" You know nothing then ? "
42174	42180	41886	41886	Dorian	108	" What do you mean ? "
42207	42210	42211	42211	he	105	" Dorian , "
42214	42232	42211	42211	he	105	" my letter -- don't be frightened -- was to tell you that Sibyl Vane is dead . "
42261	42284	42245	42245	he	425	" Dead ! Sibyl dead ! It is not true ! It is a horrible lie ! How dare you say it ? "
42285	42293	42295	42296	Lord Henry	105	" It is quite true , Dorian , "
42300	42431	42295	42296	Lord Henry	105	" It is in all the morning papers . I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till I came . There will have to be an inquest , of course , and you must not be mixed up in it . Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris . But in London people are so prejudiced . Here , one should never make one 's debut with a scandal . One should reserve that to give an interest to one 's old age . I suppose they do n't know your name at the theatre ? If they do n't , it is all right . Did any one see you going round to her room ? That is an important point . "
42456	42495	42448	42448	he	108	" Harry , did you say an inquest ? What did you mean by that ? Did Sibyl-- ? Oh , Harry , I ca n't bear it ! But be quick . Tell me everything at once . "
42496	42631	42295	42296	Lord Henry	105	" I have no doubt it was not an accident , Dorian , though it must be put in that way to the public . It seems that as she was leaving the theatre with her mother , about half - past twelve or so , she said she had forgotten something upstairs . They waited some time for her , but she did not come down again . They ultimately found her lying dead on the floor of her dressing - room . She had swallowed something by mistake , some dreadful thing they use at theatres . I do n't know what it was , but it had either prussic acid or white lead in it . I should fancy it was prussic acid , as she seems to have died instantaneously . "
42632	42641	42643	42644	the lad	425	" Harry , Harry , it is terrible ! "
42646	42765	42295	42296	Lord Henry	105	" Yes ; it is very tragic , of course , but you must not get yourself mixed up in it . I see by The Standard that she was seventeen . I should have thought she was almost younger than that . She looked such a child , and seemed to know so little about acting . Dorian , you must n't let this thing get on your nerves . You must come and dine with me , and afterwards we will look in at the opera . It is a Patti night , and everybody will be there . You can come to my sister 's box . She has got some smart women with her . "
42766	42774	42776	42777	Dorian Gray	108	" So I have murdered Sibyl Vane , "
42783	43129	42776	42777	Dorian Gray	108	" murdered her as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife . Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that . The birds sing just as happily in my garden . And to - night I am to dine with you , and then go on to the opera , and sup somewhere , I suppose , afterwards . How extraordinarily dramatic life is ! If I had read all this in a book , Harry , I think I would have wept over it . Somehow , now that it has happened actually , and to me , it seems far too wonderful for tears . Here is the first passionate love - letter I have ever written in my life . Strange , that my first passionate love - letter should have been addressed to a dead girl . Can they feel , I wonder , those white silent people we call the dead ? Sibyl ! Can she feel , or know , or listen ? Oh , Harry , how I loved her once ! It seems years ago to me now . She was everything to me . Then came that dreadful night -- was it really only last night?--when she played so badly , and my heart almost broke . She explained it all to me . It was terribly pathetic . But I was not moved a bit . I thought her shallow . Suddenly something happened that made me afraid . I ca n't tell you what it was , but it was terrible . I said I would go back to her . I felt I had done wrong . And now she is dead . My God ! My God ! Harry , what shall I do ? You do n't know the danger I am in , and there is nothing to keep me straight . She would have done that for me . She had no right to kill herself . It was selfish of her . "
43130	43135	43137	43138	Lord Henry	105	" My dear Dorian , "
43154	43307	43137	43138	Lord Henry	105	" the only way a woman can ever reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible interest in life . If you had married this girl , you would have been wretched . Of course , you would have treated her kindly . One can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing . But she would have soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her . And when a woman finds that out about her husband , she either becomes dreadfully dowdy , or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman 's husband has to pay for . I say nothing about the social mistake , which would have been abject -- which , of course , I would not have allowed -- but I assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure . "
43308	43314	43316	43317	the lad	425	" I suppose it would , "
43330	43382	43316	43317	the lad	425	" But I thought it was my duty . It is not my fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right . I remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good resolutions -- that they are always made too late . Mine certainly were . "
43383	43456	43137	43138	Lord Henry	105	" Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws . Their origin is pure vanity . Their result is absolutely nil . They give us , now and then , some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak . That is all that can be said for them . They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they have no account . "
43457	43460	43462	43463	Dorian Gray	108	" Harry , "
43473	43502	43462	43463	Dorian Gray	108	" why is it that I can not feel this tragedy as much as I want to ? I do n't think I am heartless . Do you ? "
43503	43526	43528	43529	Lord Henry	105	" You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be entitled to give yourself that name , Dorian , "
43540	43550	43551	43551	he	425	" I do n't like that explanation , Harry , "
43554	43645	43551	43551	he	425	" but I am glad you do n't think I am heartless . I am nothing of the kind . I know I am not . And yet I must admit that this thing that has happened does not affect me as it should . It seems to me to be simply like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play . It has all the terrible beauty of a Greek tragedy , a tragedy in which I took a great part , but by which I have not been wounded . "
43646	43653	43655	43656	Lord Henry	105	" It is an interesting question , "
43672	43984	43655	43656	Lord Henry	105	" an extremely interesting question . I fancy that the true explanation is this : It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence , their absolute incoherence , their absurd want of meaning , their entire lack of style . They affect us just as vulgarity affects us . They give us an impression of sheer brute force , and we revolt against that . Sometimes , however , a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives . If these elements of beauty are real , the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect . Suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors , but the spectators of the play . Or rather we are both . We watch ourselves , and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us . In the present case , what is it that has really happened ? Some one has killed herself for love of you . I wish that I had ever had such an experience . It would have made me in love with love for the rest of my life . The people who have adored me -- there have not been very many , but there have been some -- have always insisted on living on , long after I had ceased to care for them , or they to care for me . They have become stout and tedious , and when I meet them , they go in at once for reminiscences . That awful memory of woman ! What a fearful thing it is ! And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals ! One should absorb the colour of life , but one should never remember its details . Details are always vulgar . "
43985	43994	43996	43996	Dorian	108	" I must sow poppies in my garden , "
43998	44004	44006	44007	his companion	394	" There is no necessity , "
44009	44490	44006	44007	his companion	394	" Life has always poppies in her hands . Of course , now and then things linger . I once wore nothing but violets all through one season , as a form of artistic mourning for a romance that would not die . Ultimately , however , it did die . I forget what killed it . I think it was her proposing to sacrifice the whole world for me . That is always a dreadful moment . It fills one with the terror of eternity . Well -- would you believe it?--a week ago , at Lady Hampshire 's , I found myself seated at dinner next the lady in question , and she insisted on going over the whole thing again , and digging up the past , and raking up the future . I had buried my romance in a bed of asphodel . She dragged it out again and assured me that I had spoiled her life . I am bound to state that she ate an enormous dinner , so I did not feel any anxiety . But what a lack of taste she showed ! The one charm of the past is that it is the past . But women never know when the curtain has fallen . They always want a sixth act , and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over , they propose to continue it . If they were allowed their own way , every comedy would have a tragic ending , and every tragedy would culminate in a farce . They are charmingly artificial , but they have no sense of art . You are more fortunate than I am . I assure you , Dorian , that not one of the women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you . Ordinary women always console themselves . Some of them do it by going in for sentimental colours . Never trust a woman who wears mauve , whatever her age may be , or a woman over thirty - five who is fond of pink ribbons . It always means that they have a history . Others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands . They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one 's face , as if it were the most fascinating of sins . Religion consoles some . Its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation , a woman once told me , and I can quite understand it . Besides , nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner . Conscience makes egotists of us all . Yes ; there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern life . Indeed , I have not mentioned the most important one . "
44491	44498	44500	44501	the lad	425	" What is that , Harry ? "
44504	44601	44006	44007	his companion	394	" Oh , the obvious consolation . Taking some one else 's admirer when one loses one 's own . In good society that always whitewashes a woman . But really , Dorian , how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the women one meets ! There is something to me quite beautiful about her death . I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen . They make one believe in the reality of the things we all play with , such as romance , passion , and love . "
44602	44614	44006	44007	his companion	394	" I was terribly cruel to her . You forget that . "
44615	44730	44006	44007	his companion	394	" I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty , downright cruelty , more than anything else . They have wonderfully primitive instincts . We have emancipated them , but they remain slaves looking for their masters , all the same . They love being dominated . I am sure you were splendid . I have never seen you really and absolutely angry , but I can fancy how delightful you looked . And , after all , you said something to me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful , but that I see now was absolutely true , and it holds the key to everything . "
44731	44738	44006	44007	his companion	394	" What was that , Harry ? "
44739	44782	44006	44007	his companion	394	" You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines of romance -- that she was Desdemona one night , and Ophelia the other ; that if she died as Juliet , she came to life as Imogen . "
44783	44793	44795	44796	the lad	425	" She will never come to life again now , "
44805	44985	44006	44007	his companion	394	" No , she will never come to life . She has played her last part . But you must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing - room simply as a strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy , as a wonderful scene from Webster , or Ford , or Cyril Tourneur . The girl never really lived , and so she has never really died . To you at least she was always a dream , a phantom that flitted through Shakespeare 's plays and left them lovelier for its presence , a reed through which Shakespeare 's music sounded richer and more full of joy . The moment she touched actual life , she marred it , and it marred her , and so she passed away . Mourn for Ophelia , if you like . Put ashes on your head because Cordelia was strangled . Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio died . But do n't waste your tears over Sibyl Vane . She was less real than they are . "
45029	45039	45040	45040	he	108	" You have explained me to myself , Harry , "
45050	45118	45040	45040	he	108	" I felt all that you have said , but somehow I was afraid of it , and I could not express it to myself . How well you know me ! But we will not talk again of what has happened . It has been a marvellous experience . That is all . I wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous . "
45119	45149	45436	45436	he	105	" Life has everything in store for you , Dorian . There is nothing that you , with your extraordinary good looks , will not be able to do . "
45150	45169	45040	45040	he	108	" But suppose , Harry , I became haggard , and old , and wrinkled ? What then ? "
45170	45175	45177	45178	Lord Henry	105	" Ah , then , "
45184	45269	45177	45178	Lord Henry	105	" then , my dear Dorian , you would have to fight for your victories . As it is , they are brought to you . No , you must keep your good looks . We live in an age that reads too much to be wise , and that thinks too much to be beautiful . We can not spare you . And now you had better dress and drive down to the club . We are rather late , as it is . "
45270	45301	45040	45040	he	108	" I think I shall join you at the opera , Harry . I feel too tired to eat anything . What is the number of your sister 's box ? "
45302	45337	45177	45178	Lord Henry	105	" Twenty - seven , I believe . It is on the grand tier . You will see her name on the door . But I am sorry you wo n't come and dine . "
45338	45347	45349	45349	Dorian	108	" I do n't feel up to it , "
45352	45386	45349	45349	Dorian	108	" But I am awfully obliged to you for all that you have said to me . You are certainly my best friend . No one has ever understood me as you have . "
45387	45400	45402	45403	Lord Henry	105	" We are only at the beginning of our friendship , Dorian , "
45411	45434	45402	45403	Lord Henry	105	" Good - bye . I shall see you before nine - thirty , I hope . Remember , Patti is singing . "
46469	46481	46482	46482	he	106	" I am so glad I have found you , Dorian , "
46486	46700	46482	46482	he	106	" I called last night , and they told me you were at the opera . Of course , I knew that was impossible . But I wish you had left word where you had really gone to . I passed a dreadful evening , half afraid that one tragedy might be followed by another . I think you might have telegraphed for me when you heard of it first . I read of it quite by chance in a late edition of The Globe that I picked up at the club . I came here at once and was miserable at not finding you . I ca n't tell you how heart - broken I am about the whole thing . I know what you must suffer . But where were you ? Did you go down and see the girl 's mother ? For a moment I thought of following you there . They gave the address in the paper . Somewhere in the Euston Road , is n't it ? But I was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten . Poor woman ! What a state she must be in ! And her only child , too ! What did she say about it all ? "
46701	46711	46713	46714	Dorian Gray	108	" My dear Basil , how do I know ? "
46738	46872	46482	46482	he	106	" I was at the opera . You should have come on there . I met Lady Gwendolen , Harry 's sister , for the first time . We were in her box . She is perfectly charming ; and Patti sang divinely . Do n't talk about horrid subjects . If one does n't talk about a thing , it has never happened . It is simply expression , as Harry says , that gives reality to things . I may mention that she was not the woman 's only child . There is a son , a charming fellow , I believe . But he is not on the stage . He is a sailor , or something . And now , tell me about yourself and what you are painting . "
46873	46880	46882	46882	Hallward	106	" You went to the opera ? "
46898	46965	46895	46895	his	106	" You went to the opera while Sibyl Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging ? You can talk to me of other women being charming , and of Patti singing divinely , before the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in ? Why , man , there are horrors in store for that little white body of hers ! "
46966	46977	46979	46979	Dorian	108	" Stop , Basil ! I wo n't hear it ! "
46986	47007	46979	46979	Dorian	108	" You must not tell me about things . What is done is done . What is past is past . "
47008	47015	46895	46895	his	106	" You call yesterday the past ? "
47016	47093	46979	46979	Dorian	108	" What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it ? It is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion . A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure . I do n't want to be at the mercy of my emotions . I want to use them , to enjoy them , and to dominate them . "
47094	47192	46895	46895	his	106	" Dorian , this is horrible ! Something has changed you completely . You look exactly the same wonderful boy who , day after day , used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture . But you were simple , natural , and affectionate then . You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world . Now , I do n't know what has come over you . You talk as if you had no heart , no pity in you . It is all Harry 's influence . I see that . "
47221	47232	47233	47233	he	425	" I owe a great deal to Harry , Basil , "
47238	47254	47233	47233	he	425	" more than I owe to you . You only taught me to be vain . "
47255	47272	46895	46895	his	106	" Well , I am punished for that , Dorian -- or shall be some day . "
47273	47284	47285	47285	he	425	" I do n't know what you mean , Basil , "
47291	47305	47285	47285	he	425	" I do n't know what you want . What do you want ? "
47306	47317	47319	47320	the artist	353	" I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint , "
47323	47326	47328	47329	the lad	425	" Basil , "
47343	47361	47328	47329	the lad	425	" you have come too late . Yesterday , when I heard that Sibyl Vane had killed herself-- "
47362	47376	47378	47378	Hallward	106	" Killed herself ! Good heavens ! is there no doubt about that ? "
47390	47412	47328	47329	the lad	425	" My dear Basil ! Surely you do n't think it was a vulgar accident ? Of course she killed herself . "
47423	47427	47428	47428	he	955	" How fearful , "
47438	47441	47443	47444	Dorian Gray	108	" No , "
47446	48148	47443	47444	Dorian Gray	108	" there is nothing fearful about it . It is one of the great romantic tragedies of the age . As a rule , people who act lead the most commonplace lives . They are good husbands , or faithful wives , or something tedious . You know what I mean -- middle - class virtue and all that kind of thing . How different Sibyl was ! She lived her finest tragedy . She was always a heroine . The last night she played -- the night you saw her -- she acted badly because she had known the reality of love . When she knew its unreality , she died , as Juliet might have died . She passed again into the sphere of art . There is something of the martyr about her . Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom , all its wasted beauty . But , as I was saying , you must not think I have not suffered . If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment -- about half - past five , perhaps , or a quarter to six -- you would have found me in tears . Even Harry , who was here , who brought me the news , in fact , had no idea what I was going through . I suffered immensely . Then it passed away . I can not repeat an emotion . No one can , except sentimentalists . And you are awfully unjust , Basil . You come down here to console me . That is charming of you . You find me consoled , and you are furious . How like a sympathetic person ! You remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed , or some unjust law altered -- I forget exactly what it was . Finally he succeeded , and nothing could exceed his disappointment . He had absolutely nothing to do , almost died of ennui , and became a confirmed misanthrope . And besides , my dear old Basil , if you really want to console me , teach me rather to forget what has happened , or to see it from a proper artistic point of view . Was it not Gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts ? I remember picking up a little vellum - covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase . Well , I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow together , the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life . I love beautiful things that one can touch and handle . Old brocades , green bronzes , lacquer - work , carved ivories , exquisite surroundings , luxury , pomp -- there is much to be got from all these . But the artistic temperament that they create , or at any rate reveal , is still more to me . To become the spectator of one 's own life , as Harry says , is to escape the suffering of life . I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this . You have not realized how I have developed . I was a schoolboy when you knew me . I am a man now . I have new passions , new thoughts , new ideas . I am different , but you must not like me less . I am changed , but you must always be my friend . Of course , I am very fond of Harry . But I know that you are better than he is . You are not stronger -- you are too much afraid of life -- but you are better . And how happy we used to be together ! Do n't leave me , Basil , and do n't quarrel with me . I am what I am . There is nothing more to be said . "
48221	48226	48227	48227	he	386	" Well , Dorian , "
48237	48283	48227	48227	he	386	" I wo n't speak to you again about this horrible thing , after to - day . I only trust your name wo n't be mentioned in connection with it . The inquest is to take place this afternoon . Have they summoned you ? "
48304	48307	48286	48286	his	108	" inquest . "
48321	48329	48330	48330	he	108	" They do n't know my name , "
48333	48339	48286	48286	his	108	" But surely she did ? "
48340	48426	48286	48286	his	108	" Only my Christian name , and that I am quite sure she never mentioned to any one . She told me once that they were all rather curious to learn who I was , and that she invariably told them my name was Prince Charming . It was pretty of her . You must do me a drawing of Sibyl , Basil . I should like to have something more of her than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic words . "
48427	48462	48286	48286	his	108	" I will try and do something , Dorian , if it would please you . But you must come and sit to me yourself again . I ca n't get on without you . "
48463	48478	48479	48479	he	958	" I can never sit to you again , Basil . It is impossible ! "
48491	48499	48500	48500	he	386	" My dear boy , what nonsense ! "
48503	48582	48500	48500	he	386	" Do you mean to say you do n't like what I did of you ? Where is it ? Why have you pulled the screen in front of it ? Let me look at it . It is the best thing I have ever done . Do take the screen away , Dorian . It is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that . I felt the room looked different as I came in . "
48583	48636	48684	48684	he	108	" My servant has nothing to do with it , Basil . You do n't imagine I let him arrange my room for me ? He settles my flowers for me sometimes -- that is all . No ; I did it myself . The light was too strong on the portrait . "
48637	48661	48500	48500	he	386	" Too strong ! Surely not , my dear fellow ? It is an admirable place for it . Let me see it . "
48693	48696	48697	48697	he	108	" Basil , "
48704	48719	48697	48697	he	108	" you must not look at it . I do n't wish you to . "
48720	48741	48743	48743	Hallward	106	" Not look at my own work ! You are not serious . Why should n't I look at it ? "
48747	48813	48697	48697	he	108	" If you try to look at it , Basil , on my word of honour I will never speak to you again as long as I live . I am quite serious . I do n't offer any explanation , and you are not to ask for any . But , remember , if you touch this screen , everything is over between us . "
48868	48871	48862	48862	He	425	" Dorian ! "
48872	48877	48836	48837	The lad	425	" Do n't speak ! "
48878	48901	48902	48902	he	425	" But what is the matter ? Of course I wo n't look at it if you do n't want me to , "
48919	48980	48902	48902	he	425	" But , really , it seems rather absurd that I should n't see my own work , especially as I am going to exhibit it in Paris in the autumn . I shall probably have to give it another coat of varnish before that , so I must see it some day , and why not to - day ? "
48981	48992	48994	48995	Dorian Gray	108	" To exhibit it ! You want to exhibit it ? "
49046	49139	49140	49141	Dorian Gray	108	" Yes ; I do n't suppose you will object to that . Georges Petit is going to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de Seze , which will open the first week in October . The portrait will only be away a month . I should think you could easily spare it for that time . In fact , you are sure to be out of town . And if you keep it always behind a screen , you ca n't care much about it . "
49169	49183	49184	49184	he	108	" You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it , "
49187	49257	49184	49184	he	108	" Why have you changed your mind ? You people who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others have . The only difference is that your moods are rather meaningless . You ca n't have forgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to any exhibition . You told Harry exactly the same thing . "
49290	49332	49275	49276	Lord Henry	105	" If you want to have a strange quarter of an hour , get Basil to tell you why he wo n't exhibit your picture . He told me why he would n't , and it was a revelation to me . "
49351	49354	49355	49355	he	108	" Basil , "
49370	49402	49355	49355	he	108	" we have each of us a secret . Let me know yours , and I shall tell you mine . What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my picture ? "
49411	49505	49403	49404	The painter	386	" Dorian , if I told you , you might like me less than you do , and you would certainly laugh at me . I could not bear your doing either of those two things . If you wish me never to look at your picture again , I am content . I have always you to look at . If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden from the world , I am satisfied . Your friendship is dearer to me than any fame or reputation . "
49506	49516	49518	49519	Dorian Gray	108	" No , Basil , you must tell me , "
49521	49531	49518	49519	Dorian Gray	108	" I think I have a right to know . "
49558	49566	49568	49569	the painter	386	" Let us sit down , Dorian , "
49574	49612	49568	49569	the painter	386	" Let us sit down . And just answer me one question . Have you noticed in the picture something curious?--something that probably at first did not strike you , but that revealed itself to you suddenly ? "
49613	49616	49618	49619	the lad	425	" Basil ! "
49639	50380	49618	49619	the lad	425	" I see you did . Do n't speak . Wait till you hear what I have to say . Dorian , from the moment I met you , your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me . I was dominated , soul , brain , and power , by you . You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream . I worshipped you . I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke . I wanted to have you all to myself . I was only happy when I was with you . When you were away from me , you were still present in my art .... Of course , I never let you know anything about this . It would have been impossible . You would not have understood it . I hardly understood it myself . I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face , and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes -- too wonderful , perhaps , for in such mad worships there is peril , the peril of losing them , no less than the peril of keeping them .... Weeks and weeks went on , and I grew more and more absorbed in you . Then came a new development . I had drawn you as Paris in dainty armour , and as Adonis with huntsman 's cloak and polished boar - spear . Crowned with heavy lotus - blossoms you had sat on the prow of Adrian 's barge , gazing across the green turbid Nile . You had leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in the water 's silent silver the marvel of your own face . And it had all been what art should be -- unconscious , ideal , and remote . One day , a fatal day I sometimes think , I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are , not in the costume of dead ages , but in your own dress and in your own time . Whether it was the realism of the method , or the mere wonder of your own personality , thus directly presented to me without mist or veil , I can not tell . But I know that as I worked at it , every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret . I grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry . I felt , Dorian , that I had told too much , that I had put too much of myself into it . Then it was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited . You were a little annoyed ; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me . Harry , to whom I talked about it , laughed at me . But I did not mind that . When the picture was finished , and I sat alone with it , I felt that I was right .... Well , after a few days the thing left my studio , and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its presence , it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that I had seen anything in it , more than that you were extremely good - looking and that I could paint . Even now I can not help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates . Art is always more abstract than we fancy . Form and colour tell us of form and colour -- that is all . It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him . And so when I got this offer from Paris , I determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition . It never occurred to me that you would refuse . I see now that you were right . The picture can not be shown . You must not be angry with me , Dorian , for what I have told you . As I said to Harry , once , you are made to be worshipped . "
50509	50518	50520	50520	Hallward	106	" It is extraordinary to me , Dorian , "
50522	50539	50520	50520	Hallward	106	" that you should have seen this in the portrait . Did you really see it ? "
50540	50547	50548	50548	he	108	" I saw something in it , "
50551	50560	50548	50548	he	108	" something that seemed to me very curious . "
50561	50575	50520	50520	Hallward	106	" Well , you do n't mind my looking at the thing now ? "
50581	50604	50576	50576	Dorian	108	" You must not ask me that , Basil . I could not possibly let you stand in front of that picture . "
50605	50613	50520	50520	Hallward	106	" You will some day , surely ? "
50614	50617	50576	50576	Dorian	108	" Never . "
50618	50683	50520	50520	Hallward	106	" Well , perhaps you are right . And now good - bye , Dorian . You have been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art . Whatever I have done that is good , I owe to you . Ah ! you do n't know what it cost me to tell you all that I have told you . "
50684	50689	50691	50691	Dorian	108	" My dear Basil , "
50693	50718	50691	50691	Dorian	108	" what have you told me ? Simply that you felt that you admired me too much . That is not even a compliment . "
50719	50760	50520	50520	Hallward	106	" It was not intended as a compliment . It was a confession . Now that I have made it , something seems to have gone out of me . Perhaps one should never put one 's worship into words . "
50761	50769	50691	50691	Dorian	108	" It was a very disappointing confession . "
50770	50800	50520	50520	Hallward	106	" Why , what did you expect , Dorian ? You did n't see anything else in the picture , did you ? There was nothing else to see ? "
50801	50843	50691	50691	Dorian	108	" No ; there was nothing else to see . Why do you ask ? But you must n't talk about worship . It is foolish . You and I are friends , Basil , and we must always remain so . "
50844	50850	50852	50853	the painter	386	" You have got Harry , "
50856	50861	50863	50864	the lad	425	" Oh , Harry ! "
50872	50928	50863	50864	the lad	425	" Harry spends his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is improbable . Just the sort of life I would like to lead . But still I do n't think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble . I would sooner go to you , Basil . "
50929	50937	50691	50691	Dorian	108	" You will sit to me again ? "
50938	50941	50863	50864	the lad	425	" Impossible ! "
50942	50968	50691	50691	Dorian	108	" You spoil my life as an artist by refusing , Dorian . No man comes across two ideal things . Few come across one . "
50969	51021	50863	50864	the lad	425	" I ca n't explain it to you , Basil , but I must never sit to you again . There is something fatal about a portrait . It has a life of its own . I will come and have tea with you . That will be just as pleasant . "
51022	51031	51033	51033	Hallward	106	" Pleasanter for you , I am afraid , "
51036	51074	51033	51033	Hallward	106	" And now good - bye . I am sorry you wo n't let me look at the picture once again . But that ca n't be helped . I quite understand what you feel about it . "
51447	51455	51456	51456	she	980	" The old schoolroom , Mr. Dorian ? "
51459	51499	51456	51456	she	980	" Why , it is full of dust . I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it . It is not fit for you to see , sir . It is not , indeed . "
51500	51517	51560	51561	his grandfather	988	" I do n't want it put straight , Leaf . I only want the key . "
51518	51553	51456	51456	she	980	" Well , sir , you 'll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it . Why , it has n't been opened for nearly five years -- not since his lordship died . "
51570	51576	51577	51577	he	108	" That does not matter , "
51580	51598	51577	51577	he	108	" I simply want to see the place -- that is all . Give me the key . "
51599	51608	51610	51612	the old lady	989	" And here is the key , sir , "
51626	51661	51610	51612	the old lady	989	" Here is the key . I 'll have it off the bunch in a moment . But you do n't think of living up there , sir , and you so comfortable here ? "
51662	51667	51668	51668	he	108	" No , no , "
51672	51682	51668	51668	he	108	" Thank you , Leaf . That will do . "
52245	52253	52237	52237	He	108	" The persons are here , Monsieur . "
52336	52342	52343	52343	he	108	" Wait for an answer , "
52351	52359	52343	52343	he	108	" and show the men in here . "
52478	52489	52490	52490	he	209	" What can I do for you , Mr. Gray ? "
52499	52553	52490	52490	he	209	" I thought I would do myself the honour of coming round in person . I have just got a beauty of a frame , sir . Picked it up at a sale . Old Florentine . Came from Fonthill , I believe . Admirably suited for a religious subject , Mr. Gray . "
52554	52636	52729	52729	his	1009	" I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round , Mr. Hubbard . I shall certainly drop in and look at the frame -- though I do n't go in much at present for religious art -- but to - day I only want a picture carried to the top of the house for me . It is rather heavy , so I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men . "
52637	52666	52490	52490	he	209	" No trouble at all , Mr. Gray . I am delighted to be of any service to you . Which is the work of art , sir ? "
52667	52670	52672	52672	Dorian	108	" This , "
52679	52705	52672	52672	Dorian	108	" Can you move it , covering and all , just as it is ? I do n't want it to get scratched going upstairs . "
52706	52715	52729	52729	his	1009	" There will be no difficulty , sir , "
52747	52762	52729	52729	his	1009	" And , now , where shall we carry it to , Mr. Gray ? "
52763	52817	52818	52818	He	1009	" I will show you the way , Mr. Hubbard , if you will kindly follow me . Or perhaps you had better go in front . I am afraid it is right at the top of the house . We will go up by the front staircase , as it is wider . "
52894	52904	52906	52908	the little man	1015	" Something of a load to carry , sir , "
52923	52932	52934	52934	Dorian	108	" I am afraid it is rather heavy , "
53567	53577	53578	53578	he	108	" Bring it in , Mr. Hubbard , please , "
53586	53603	53578	53578	he	108	" I am sorry I kept you so long . I was thinking of something else . "
53604	53615	53617	53627	the frame - maker , who was still gasping for breath	1037	" Always glad to have a rest , Mr. Gray , "
53629	53638	53617	53627	the frame - maker , who was still gasping for breath	1037	" Where shall we put it , sir ? "
53639	53669	53578	53578	he	108	" Oh , anywhere . Here : this will do . I do n't want to have it hung up . Just lean it against the wall . Thanks . "
53670	53682	53617	53627	the frame - maker , who was still gasping for breath	1037	" Might one look at the work of art , sir ? "
53686	53696	53697	53697	he	108	" It would not interest you , Mr. Hubbard , "
53736	53757	53721	53721	he	108	" I sha n't trouble you any more now . I am much obliged for your kindness in coming round . "
53758	53780	53782	53783	Mr. Hubbard	209	" Not at all , not at all , Mr. Gray . Ever ready to do anything for you , sir . "
55001	55009	55010	55010	he	108	" I am so sorry , Harry , "
55013	55039	55010	55010	he	108	" but really it is entirely your fault . That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the time was going . "
55040	55050	55057	55057	his	1088	" Yes , I thought you would like it , "
55060	55083	55057	55057	his	1088	" I did n't say I liked it , Harry . I said it fascinated me . There is a great difference . "

63726	63823	63719	63719	his	106	" Dorian ! What an extraordinary piece of luck ! I have been waiting for you in your library ever since nine o'clock . Finally I took pity on your tired servant and told him to go to bed , as he let me out . I am off to Paris by the midnight train , and I particularly wanted to see you before I left . I thought it was you , or rather your fur coat , as you passed me . But I was n't quite sure . Did n't you recognize me ? "
63824	63889	63719	63719	his	106	" In this fog , my dear Basil ? Why , I ca n't even recognize Grosvenor Square . I believe my house is somewhere about here , but I do n't feel at all certain about it . I am sorry you are going away , as I have not seen you for ages . But I suppose you will be back soon ? "
63890	63965	63719	63719	his	106	" No : I am going to be out of England for six months . I intend to take a studio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a great picture I have in my head . However , it was n't about myself I wanted to talk . Here we are at your door . Let me come in for a moment . I have something to say to you . "
63966	63980	63982	63983	Dorian Gray	108	" I shall be charmed . But wo n't you miss your train ? "
64016	64023	64024	64024	he	106	" I have heaps of time , "
64027	64108	64024	64024	he	106	" The train does n't go till twelve - fifteen , and it is only just eleven . In fact , I was on my way to the club to look for you , when I met you . You see , I sha n't have any delay about luggage , as I have sent on my heavy things . All I have with me is in this bag , and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes . "
64116	64167	64109	64109	Dorian	108	" What a way for a fashionable painter to travel ! A Gladstone bag and an ulster ! Come in , or the fog will get into the house . And mind you do n't talk about anything serious . Nothing is serious nowadays . At least nothing should be . "
64232	64291	64510	64510	his	108	" You see your servant made me quite at home , Dorian . He gave me everything I wanted , including your best gold - tipped cigarettes . He is a most hospitable creature . I like him much better than the Frenchman you used to have . What has become of the Frenchman , by the bye ? "
64297	64430	64292	64292	Dorian	108	" I believe he married Lady Radley 's maid , and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker . Anglomania is very fashionable over there now , I hear . It seems silly of the French , does n't it ? But -- do you know?--he was not at all a bad servant . I never liked him , but I had nothing to complain about . One often imagines things that are quite absurd . He was really very devoted to me and seemed quite sorry when he went away . Have another brandy - and - soda ? Or would you like hock - and - seltzer ? I always take hock - and - seltzer myself . There is sure to be some in the next room . "
64431	64441	64443	64444	the painter	386	" Thanks , I wo n't have anything more , "
64466	64498	64443	64444	the painter	386	" And now , my dear fellow , I want to speak to you seriously . Do n't frown like that . You make it so much more difficult for me . "
64499	64506	64508	64508	Dorian	108	" What is it all about ? "
64521	64547	64515	64515	himself	108	" I hope it is not about myself . I am tired of myself to - night . I should like to be somebody else . "
64548	64554	64556	64556	Hallward	106	" It is about yourself , "
64563	64581	64558	64558	his	106	" and I must say it to you . I shall only keep you half an hour . "
64589	64594	64595	64595	he	108	" Half an hour ! "
64598	64644	64510	64510	his	108	" It is not much to ask of you , Dorian , and it is entirely for your own sake that I am speaking . I think it right that you should know that the most dreadful things are being said against you in London . "
64645	64681	64558	64558	his	106	" I do n't wish to know anything about them . I love scandals about other people , but scandals about myself do n't interest me . They have not got the charm of novelty . "
64682	65281	64510	64510	his	108	" They must interest you , Dorian . Every gentleman is interested in his good name . You do n't want people to talk of you as something vile and degraded . Of course , you have your position , and your wealth , and all that kind of thing . But position and wealth are not everything . Mind you , I do n't believe these rumours at all . At least , I ca n't believe them when I see you . Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man 's face . It can not be concealed . People talk sometimes of secret vices . There are no such things . If a wretched man has a vice , it shows itself in the lines of his mouth , the droop of his eyelids , the moulding of his hands even . Somebody -- I wo n't mention his name , but you know him -- came to me last year to have his portrait done . I had never seen him before , and had never heard anything about him at the time , though I have heard a good deal since . He offered an extravagant price . I refused him . There was something in the shape of his fingers that I hated . I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied about him . His life is dreadful . But you , Dorian , with your pure , bright , innocent face , and your marvellous untroubled youth -- I ca n't believe anything against you . And yet I see you very seldom , and you never come down to the studio now , and when I am away from you , and I hear all these hideous things that people are whispering about you , I do n't know what to say . Why is it , Dorian , that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves the room of a club when you enter it ? Why is it that so many gentlemen in London will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs ? You used to be a friend of Lord Staveley . I met him at dinner last week . Your name happened to come up in conversation , in connection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the Dudley . Staveley curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes , but that you were a man whom no pure - minded girl should be allowed to know , and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with . I reminded him that I was a friend of yours , and asked him what he meant . He told me . He told me right out before everybody . It was horrible ! Why is your friendship so fatal to young men ? There was that wretched boy in the Guards who committed suicide . You were his great friend . There was Sir Henry Ashton , who had to leave England with a tarnished name . You and he were inseparable . What about Adrian Singleton and his dreadful end ? What about Lord Kent 's only son and his career ? I met his father yesterday in St. James 's Street . He seemed broken with shame and sorrow . What about the young Duke of Perth ? What sort of life has he got now ? What gentleman would associate with him ? "
65282	65298	65300	65301	Dorian Gray	108	" Stop , Basil . You are talking about things of which you know nothing , "
65318	65540	65315	65315	his	108	" You ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter it . It is because I know everything about his life , not because he knows anything about mine . With such blood as he has in his veins , how could his record be clean ? You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth . Did I teach the one his vices , and the other his debauchery ? If Kent 's silly son takes his wife from the streets , what is that to me ? If Adrian Singleton writes his friend 's name across a bill , am I his keeper ? I know how people chatter in England . The middle classes air their moral prejudices over their gross dinner - tables , and whisper about what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try and pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with the people they slander . In this country , it is enough for a man to have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him . And what sort of lives do these people , who pose as being moral , lead themselves ? My dear fellow , you forget that we are in the native land of the hypocrite . "
65541	65544	65546	65546	Hallward	106	" Dorian , "
65548	65700	65546	65546	Hallward	106	" that is not the question . England is bad enough I know , and English society is all wrong . That is the reason why I want you to be fine . You have not been fine . One has a right to judge of a man by the effect he has over his friends . Yours seem to lose all sense of honour , of goodness , of purity . You have filled them with a madness for pleasure . They have gone down into the depths . You led them there . Yes : you led them there , and yet you can smile , as you are smiling now . And there is worse behind . I know you and Harry are inseparable . Surely for that reason , if for none other , you should not have made his sister 's name a by - word . "
65701	65712	65315	65315	his	108	" Take care , Basil . You go too far . "
65713	66150	65546	65546	Hallward	106	" I must speak , and you must listen . You shall listen . When you met Lady Gwendolen , not a breath of scandal had ever touched her . Is there a single decent woman in London now who would drive with her in the park ? Why , even her children are not allowed to live with her . Then there are other stories -- stories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in London . Are they true ? Can they be true ? When I first heard them , I laughed . I hear them now , and they make me shudder . What about your country - house and the life that is led there ? Dorian , you do n't know what is said about you . I wo n't tell you that I do n't want to preach to you . I remember Harry saying once that every man who turned himself into an amateur curate for the moment always began by saying that , and then proceeded to break his word . I do want to preach to you . I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you . I want you to have a clean name and a fair record . I want you to get rid of the dreadful people you associate with . Do n't shrug your shoulders like that . Do n't be so indifferent . You have a wonderful influence . Let it be for good , not for evil . They say that you corrupt every one with whom you become intimate , and that it is quite sufficient for you to enter a house for shame of some kind to follow after . I do n't know whether it is so or not . How should I know ? But it is said of you . I am told things that it seems impossible to doubt . Lord Gloucester was one of my greatest friends at Oxford . He showed me a letter that his wife had written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at Mentone . Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I ever read . I told him that it was absurd -- that I knew you thoroughly and that you were incapable of anything of the kind . Know you ? I wonder do I know you ? Before I could answer that , I should have to see your soul . "
66151	66157	66159	66160	Dorian Gray	108	" To see my soul ! "
66174	66177	66179	66179	Hallward	106	" Yes , "
66192	66205	66189	66189	his	106	" to see your soul . But only God can do that . "
66220	66231	66232	66232	he	106	" You shall see it yourself , to - night ! "
66242	66335	66232	66232	he	106	" Come : it is your own handiwork . Why should n't you look at it ? You can tell the world all about it afterwards , if you choose . Nobody would believe you . If they did believe you , they would like me all the better for it . I know the age better than you do , though you will prate about it so tediously . Come , I tell you . You have chattered enough about corruption . Now you shall look on it face to face . "
66416	66419	66420	66420	he	106	" Yes , "
66435	66456	66420	66420	he	106	" I shall show you my soul . You shall see the thing that you fancy only God can see . "
66461	66468	66469	66469	he	106	" This is blasphemy , Dorian ! "
66472	66492	66469	66469	he	106	" You must not say things like that . They are horrible , and they do n't mean anything . "
66493	66498	66499	66499	He	106	" You think so ? "
66503	66538	66499	66499	He	106	" I know so . As for what I said to you to - night , I said it for your good . You know I have been always a stanch friend to you . "
66539	66552	66469	66469	he	106	" Do n't touch me . Finish what you have to say . "
66652	66659	66661	66663	the young man	1382	" I am waiting , Basil , "
66674	66683	66684	66684	he	106	" What I have to say is this , "
66687	66759	66684	66684	he	106	" You must give me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you . If you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end , I shall believe you . Deny them , Dorian , deny them ! Ca n't you see what I am going through ? My God ! do n't tell me that you are bad , and corrupt , and shameful . "
66774	66780	66781	66781	he	106	" Come upstairs , Basil , "
66785	66822	66781	66781	he	106	" I keep a diary of my life from day to day , and it never leaves the room in which it is written . I shall show it to you if you come with me . "
66823	66880	66771	66771	his	106	" I shall come with you , Dorian , if you wish it . I see I have missed my train . That makes no matter . I can go to - morrow . But do n't ask me to read anything to - night . All I want is a plain answer to my question . "
66881	66905	66781	66781	he	106	" That shall be given to you upstairs . I could not give it here . You will not have to read long . "
66983	66991	66992	66992	he	108	" You insist on knowing , Basil ? "
66999	67002	66992	66992	he	108	" Yes . "
67003	67008	67009	67009	he	108	" I am delighted , "
67021	67051	67015	67015	he	108	" You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know everything about me . You have had more to do with my life than you think "
67094	67101	67102	67102	he	108	" Shut the door behind you , "
67226	67253	67277	67277	Hallward	106	" So you think that it is only God who sees the soul , Basil ? Draw that curtain back , and you will see mine . "
67263	67275	67277	67277	Hallward	106	" You are mad , Dorian , or playing a part , "
67281	67293	67300	67300	he	1382	" You wo n't ? Then I must do it myself , "
67696	67702	67704	67704	Hallward	106	" What does this mean ? "
67720	67730	67732	67733	Dorian Gray	108	" Years ago , when I was a boy , "
67742	67829	67732	67733	Dorian Gray	108	" you met me , flattered me , and taught me to be vain of my good looks . One day you introduced me to a friend of yours , who explained to me the wonder of youth , and you finished a portrait of me that revealed to me the wonder of beauty . In a mad moment that , even now , I do n't know whether I regret or not , I made a wish , perhaps you would call it a prayer .... "
67830	67882	67709	67709	His	106	" I remember it ! Oh , how well I remember it ! No ! the thing is impossible . The room is damp . Mildew has got into the canvas . The paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them . I tell you the thing is impossible . "
67883	67890	67892	67894	the young man	1382	" Ah , what is impossible ? "
67914	67923	67709	67709	His	106	" You told me you had destroyed it . "
67924	67934	67709	67709	His	106	" I was wrong . It has destroyed me . "
67935	67945	67709	67709	His	106	" I do n't believe it is my picture . "
67946	67956	67958	67958	Dorian	108	" Ca n't you see your ideal in it ? "
67961	67970	67709	67709	His	106	" My ideal , as you call it ... "
67971	67977	67709	67709	His	106	" As you called it . "
67978	68011	67709	67709	His	106	" There was nothing evil in it , nothing shameful . You were to me such an ideal as I shall never meet again . This is the face of a satyr . "
68012	68021	67709	67709	His	106	" It is the face of my soul . "
68022	68041	67709	67709	His	106	" Christ ! what a thing I must have worshipped ! It has the eyes of a devil . "
68042	68055	68057	68057	Dorian	108	" Each of us has heaven and hell in him , Basil , "
68076	68085	68086	68086	he	106	" My God ! If it is true , "
68089	68119	68086	68086	he	106	" and this is what you have done with your life , why , you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you to be ! "
68246	68261	68225	68225	he	106	" Good God , Dorian , what a lesson ! What an awful lesson ! "
68279	68286	68287	68287	he	106	" Pray , Dorian , pray , "
68290	68371	68287	68287	he	106	" What is it that one was taught to say in one 's boyhood ? ' Lead us not into temptation . Forgive us our sins . Wash away our iniquities . ' Let us say that together . The prayer of your pride has been answered . The prayer of your repentance will be answered also . I worshipped you too much . I am punished for it . You worshipped yourself too much . We are both punished . "
68387	68395	68396	68396	he	108	" It is too late , Basil , "
68399	68448	68372	68373	Dorian Gray	108	" It is never too late , Dorian . Let us kneel down and try if we can not remember a prayer . Is n't there a verse somewhere , ' Though your sins be as scarlet , yet I will make them as white as snow ' ? "
68449	68458	68372	68373	Dorian Gray	108	" Those words mean nothing to me now . "
68459	68490	68372	68373	Dorian Gray	108	" Hush ! Do n't say that . You have done enough evil in your life . My God ! Do n't you see that accursed thing leering at us ? "
69645	69659	69660	69660	he	504	" I am sorry to have had to wake you up , Francis , "
69666	69681	69660	69660	he	504	" but I had forgotten my latch - key . What time is it ? "
69682	69690	69692	69693	the man	2000	" Ten minutes past two , sir , "
69702	69729	69623	69623	he	108	" Ten minutes past two ? How horribly late ! You must wake me at nine to - morrow . I have some work to do . "
69730	69736	69660	69660	he	504	" All right , sir . "
69737	69745	69623	69623	he	108	" Did any one call this evening ? "
69746	69768	69660	69660	he	504	" Mr. Hallward , sir . He stayed here till eleven , and then he went away to catch his train . "
69769	69787	69623	69623	he	108	" Oh ! I am sorry I did n't see him . Did he leave any message ? "
69788	69813	69660	69660	he	504	" No , sir , except that he would write to you from Paris , if he did not find you at the club . "
69814	69833	69623	69623	he	108	" That will do , Francis . Do n't forget to call me at nine to - morrow . "
69834	69839	69660	69660	he	504	" No , sir . "
69906	69917	69887	69887	he	108	" Alan Campbell , 152 , Hertford Street , Mayfair . "

72278	72302	72253	72253	his	303	" Yes : it is a matter of life and death , Alan , and to more than one person . Sit down . "
72378	72460	72352	72352	he	108	" Alan , in a locked room at the top of this house , a room to which nobody but myself has access , a dead man is seated at a table . He has been dead ten hours now . Do n't stir , and do n't look at me like that . Who the man is , why he died , how he died , are matters that do not concern you . What you have to do is this-- "
72461	72517	72352	72352	he	108	" Stop , Gray . I do n't want to know anything further . Whether what you have told me is true or not true does n't concern me . I entirely decline to be mixed up in your life . Keep your horrible secrets to yourself . They do n't interest me any more . "
72518	72704	72352	72352	he	108	" Alan , they will have to interest you . This one will have to interest you . I am awfully sorry for you , Alan . But I ca n't help myself . You are the one man who is able to save me . I am forced to bring you into the matter . I have no option . Alan , you are scientific . You know about chemistry and things of that kind . You have made experiments . What you have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs -- to destroy it so that not a vestige of it will be left . Nobody saw this person come into the house . Indeed , at the present moment he is supposed to be in Paris . He will not be missed for months . When he is missed , there must be no trace of him found here . You , Alan , you must change him , and everything that belongs to him , into a handful of ashes that I may scatter in the air . "
72705	72712	72352	72352	he	108	" You are mad , Dorian . "
72713	72726	72352	72352	he	108	" Ah ! I was waiting for you to call me Dorian . "
72727	72797	72352	72352	he	108	" You are mad , I tell you -- mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to help you , mad to make this monstrous confession . I will have nothing to do with this matter , whatever it is . Do you think I am going to peril my reputation for you ? What is it to me what devil 's work you are up to ? "
72798	72805	72352	72352	he	108	" It was suicide , Alan . "
72806	72826	72352	72352	he	108	" I am glad of that . But who drove him to it ? You , I should fancy . "
72827	72838	72352	72352	he	108	" Do you still refuse to do this for me ? "
72839	72970	72352	72352	he	108	" Of course I refuse . I will have absolutely nothing to do with it . I do n't care what shame comes on you . You deserve it all . I should not be sorry to see you disgraced , publicly disgraced . How dare you ask me , of all men in the world , to mix myself up in this horror ? I should have thought you knew more about people 's characters . Your friend Lord Henry Wotton ca n't have taught you much about psychology , whatever else he has taught you . Nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you . You have come to the wrong man . Go to some of your friends . Do n't come to me . "
72971	73030	72352	72352	he	108	" Alan , it was murder . I killed him . You do n't know what he had made me suffer . Whatever my life is , he had more to do with the making or the marring of it than poor Harry has had . He may not have intended it , the result was the same . "
73031	73096	72352	72352	he	108	" Murder ! Good God , Dorian , is that what you have come to ? I shall not inform upon you . It is not my business . Besides , without my stirring in the matter , you are certain to be arrested . Nobody ever commits a crime without doing something stupid . But I will have nothing to do with it . "
73097	73325	72352	72352	he	108	" You must have something to do with it . Wait , wait a moment ; listen to me . Only listen , Alan . All I ask of you is to perform a certain scientific experiment . You go to hospitals and dead - houses , and the horrors that you do there do n't affect you . If in some hideous dissecting - room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow through , you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject . You would not turn a hair . You would not believe that you were doing anything wrong . On the contrary , you would probably feel that you were benefiting the human race , or increasing the sum of knowledge in the world , or gratifying intellectual curiosity , or something of that kind . What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before . Indeed , to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are accustomed to work at . And , remember , it is the only piece of evidence against me . If it is discovered , I am lost ; and it is sure to be discovered unless you help me . "
73326	73356	72352	72352	he	108	" I have no desire to help you . You forget that . I am simply indifferent to the whole thing . It has nothing to do with me . "
73357	73456	72352	72352	he	108	" Alan , I entreat you . Think of the position I am in . Just before you came I almost fainted with terror . You may know terror yourself some day . No ! do n't think of that . Look at the matter purely from the scientific point of view . You do n't inquire where the dead things on which you experiment come from . Do n't inquire now . I have told you too much as it is . But I beg of you to do this . We were friends once , Alan . "
73457	73471	72352	72352	he	108	" Do n't speak about those days , Dorian -- they are dead . "
73472	73540	72352	72352	he	108	" The dead linger sometimes . The man upstairs will not go away . He is sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms . Alan ! Alan ! If you do n't come to my assistance , I am ruined . Why , they will hang me , Alan ! Do n't you understand ? They will hang me for what I have done . "
73541	73570	72352	72352	he	108	" There is no good in prolonging this scene . I absolutely refuse to do anything in the matter . It is insane of you to ask me . "
73571	73575	72352	72352	he	108	" You refuse ? "
73576	73579	72352	72352	he	108	" Yes . "
73580	73587	72352	72352	he	108	" I entreat you , Alan . "
73588	73593	72352	72352	he	108	" It is useless . "
73743	73753	73754	73754	he	108	" I am so sorry for you , Alan , "
73757	73889	73754	73754	he	108	" but you leave me no alternative . I have a letter written already . Here it is . You see the address . If you do n't help me , I must send it . If you do n't help me , I will send it . You know what the result will be . But you are going to help me . It is impossible for you to refuse now . I tried to spare you . You will do me the justice to admit that . You were stern , harsh , offensive . You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat me -- no living man , at any rate . I bore it all . Now it is for me to dictate terms . "
73905	73954	73890	73890	Campbell	303	" Yes , it is my turn to dictate terms , Alan . You know what they are . The thing is quite simple . Come , do n't work yourself into this fever . The thing has to be done . Face it , and do it . "
74051	74062	74097	74097	He	303	" Come , Alan , you must decide at once . "
74063	74070	74071	74071	he	303	" I can not do it , "
74083	74096	74071	74071	he	303	" You must . You have no choice . Do n't delay . "
74102	74112	74097	74097	He	303	" Is there a fire in the room upstairs ? "
74113	74125	74097	74097	He	303	" Yes , there is a gas - fire with asbestos . "
74126	74141	74097	74097	He	303	" I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory . "
74142	74179	74097	74097	He	303	" No , Alan , you must not leave the house . Write out on a sheet of notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the things back to you . "
74346	74354	74355	74355	he	303	" You are infamous , absolutely infamous ! "
74358	74369	74371	74371	Dorian	108	" Hush , Alan . You have saved my life , "
74373	74429	74321	74321	his	303	" Your life ? Good heavens ! what a life that is ! You have gone from corruption to corruption , and now you have culminated in crime . In doing what I am going to do -- what you force me to do -- it is not of your life that I am thinking . "
74430	74435	74437	74437	Dorian	108	" Ah , Alan , "
74442	74461	74462	74462	He	303	" I wish you had a thousandth part of the pity for me that I have for you . "
74522	74532	74533	74533	he	303	" Shall I leave the things here , sir ? "
74537	74540	74542	74542	Dorian	108	" Yes , "
74544	74575	74542	74542	Dorian	108	" And I am afraid , Francis , that I have another errand for you . What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies Selby with orchids ? "
74576	74581	74493	74494	the servant	1496	" Harden , sir . "
74582	74659	74542	74542	Dorian	108	" Yes -- Harden . You must go down to Richmond at once , see Harden personally , and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered , and to have as few white ones as possible . In fact , I do n't want any white ones . It is a lovely day , Francis , and Richmond is a very pretty place -- otherwise I would n't bother you about it . "
74660	74674	74493	74494	the servant	1496	" No trouble , sir . At what time shall I be back ? "
74680	74690	74691	74691	he	303	" How long will your experiment take , Alan ? "
74722	74730	74731	74731	he	303	" It will take about five hours , "
74734	74788	74838	74838	He	2000	" It will be time enough , then , if you are back at half - past seven , Francis . Or stay : just leave my things out for dressing . You can have the evening to yourself . I am not dining at home , so I shall not want you . "
74789	74795	74797	74798	the man	2000	" Thank you , sir , "
74804	74837	74838	74838	He	2000	" Now , Alan , there is not a moment to be lost . How heavy this chest is ! I 'll take it for you . You bring the other things . "
74894	74906	74907	74907	he	108	" I do n't think I can go in , Alan , "
74910	74923	74925	74925	Campbell	303	" It is nothing to me . I do n't require you , "
75225	75230	75238	75238	He	108	" Leave me now , "
75305	75316	75317	75317	he	108	" I have done what you asked me to do , "
75319	75335	75317	75317	he	108	" And now , good - bye . Let us never see each other again . "
75336	75352	75354	75354	Dorian	108	" You have saved me from ruin , Alan . I can not forget that , "
75692	75709	75710	75710	she	311	" I know , my dear , I should have fallen madly in love with you , "
75715	75806	75710	75710	she	311	" and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake . It is most fortunate that you were not thought of at the time . As it was , our bonnets were so unbecoming , and the mills were so occupied in trying to raise the wind , that I never had even a flirtation with anybody . However , that was all Narborough 's fault . He was dreadfully short - sighted , and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who never sees anything . "
75861	75874	75875	75875	she	311	" I think it is most unkind of her , my dear , "
75878	76007	75875	75875	she	311	" Of course I go and stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg , but then an old woman like me must have fresh air sometimes , and besides , I really wake them up . You do n't know what an existence they lead down there . It is pure unadulterated country life . They get up early , because they have so much to do , and go to bed early , because they have so little to think about . There has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since the time of Queen Elizabeth , and consequently they all fall asleep after dinner . You sha n't sit next either of them . You shall sit by me and amuse me . "
76233	76262	76209	76210	Lady Narborough	311	" How horrid of Henry Wotton to be so late ! I sent round to him this morning on chance and he promised faithfully not to disappoint me . "
76324	76339	76322	76322	she	311	" an insult to poor Adolphe , who invented the menu specially for you , "
76382	76385	76387	76388	Lord Henry	105	" Dorian , "
76402	76420	76387	76388	Lord Henry	105	" what is the matter with you to - night ? You are quite out of sorts . "
76421	76429	76431	76432	Lady Narborough	311	" I believe he is in love , "
76434	76459	76431	76432	Lady Narborough	311	" and that he is afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous . He is quite right . I certainly should . "
76460	76465	76467	76467	Dorian	108	" Dear Lady Narborough , "
76471	76495	76467	76467	Dorian	108	" I have not been in love for a whole week -- not , in fact , since Madame de Ferrol left town . "
76496	76508	76510	76512	the old lady	989	" How you men can fall in love with that woman ! "
76514	76522	76510	76512	the old lady	989	" I really can not understand it . "
76523	76541	76543	76544	Lord Henry	105	" It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl , Lady Narborough , "
76546	76559	76543	76544	Lord Henry	105	" She is the one link between us and your short frocks . "
76560	76593	76510	76512	the old lady	989	" She does not remember my short frocks at all , Lord Henry . But I remember her very well at Vienna thirty years ago , and how decolletee she was then . "
76594	76600	76601	76601	he	105	" She is still decolletee , "
76612	76667	76608	76608	his	105	" and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an edition de luxe of a bad French novel . She is really wonderful , and full of surprises . Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary . When her third husband died , her hair turned quite gold from grief . "
76668	76675	76677	76677	Dorian	108	" How can you , Harry ! "
76679	76687	76689	76690	the hostess	1552	" It is a most romantic explanation , "
76692	76712	76689	76690	the hostess	1552	" But her third husband , Lord Henry ! You do n't mean to say Ferrol is the fourth ? "
76713	76719	76608	76608	his	105	" Certainly , Lady Narborough . "
76720	76730	76689	76690	the hostess	1552	" I do n't believe a word of it . "
76731	76747	76608	76608	his	105	" Well , ask Mr. Gray . He is one of her most intimate friends . "
76748	76756	76689	76690	the hostess	1552	" Is it true , Mr. Gray ? "
76757	76766	76768	76768	Dorian	108	" She assures me so , Lady Narborough , "
76770	76810	76768	76768	Dorian	108	" I asked her whether , like Marguerite de Navarre , she had their hearts embalmed and hung at her girdle . She told me she did n't , because none of them had had any hearts at all . "
76811	76824	76689	76690	the hostess	1552	" Four husbands ! Upon my word that is trop de zele . "
76825	76833	76835	76835	Dorian	108	" Trop d'audace , I tell her , "
76837	76862	76689	76690	the hostess	1552	" Oh ! she is audacious enough for anything , my dear . And what is Ferrol like ? I do n't know him . "
76863	76876	76878	76879	Lord Henry	105	" The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes , "
76893	76913	76885	76886	Lady Narborough	311	" Lord Henry , I am not at all surprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked . "
76914	76921	76923	76924	Lord Henry	105	" But what world says that ? "
76930	76948	76927	76927	his	105	" It can only be the next world . This world and I are on excellent terms . "
76949	76959	76961	76963	the old lady	989	" Everybody I know says you are very wicked , "
76977	76983	76984	76984	he	105	" It is perfectly monstrous , "
76990	77012	76984	76984	he	105	" the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one 's back that are absolutely and entirely true . "
77013	77019	77021	77021	Dorian	108	" Is n't he incorrigible ? "
77029	77034	77036	77037	his hostess	1514	" I hope so , "
77041	77071	77036	77037	his hostess	1514	" But really , if you all worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way , I shall have to marry again so as to be in the fashion . "
77072	77082	77085	77086	Lord Henry	105	" You will never marry again , Lady Narborough , "
77088	77134	77085	77086	Lord Henry	105	" You were far too happy . When a woman marries again , it is because she detested her first husband . When a man marries again , it is because he adored his first wife . Women try their luck ; men risk theirs . "
77135	77141	77143	77145	the old lady	989	" Narborough was n't perfect , "
77147	77164	77166	77167	the rejoinder	1556	" If he had been , you would not have loved him , my dear lady , "
77169	77219	77166	77167	the rejoinder	1556	" Women love us for our defects . If we have enough of them , they will forgive us everything , even our intellects . You will never ask me to dinner again after saying this , I am afraid , Lady Narborough , but it is quite true . "
77220	77293	77311	77312	his hostess	1514	" Of course it is true , Lord Henry . If we women did not love you for your defects , where would you all be ? Not one of you would ever be married . You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors . Not , however , that that would alter you much . Nowadays all the married men live like bachelors , and all the bachelors like married men . "
77294	77299	77301	77302	Lord Henry	105	" Fin de siecle , "
77304	77309	77311	77312	his hostess	1514	" Fin du globe , "
77314	77323	77325	77325	Dorian	108	" I wish it were fin du globe , "
77330	77337	77325	77325	Dorian	108	" Life is a great disappointment . "
77338	77344	77346	77347	Lady Narborough	311	" Ah , my dear , "
77354	77428	77351	77351	her	311	" do n't tell me that you have exhausted life . When a man says that one knows that life has exhausted him . Lord Henry is very wicked , and I sometimes wish that I had been ; but you are made to be good -- you look so good . I must find you a nice wife . Lord Henry , do n't you think that Mr. Gray should get married ? "
77429	77440	77442	77443	Lord Henry	105	" I am always telling him so , Lady Narborough , "
77448	77483	77351	77351	her	311	" Well , we must look out for a suitable match for him . I shall go through Debrett carefully to - night and draw out a list of all the eligible young ladies . "
77484	77492	77494	77494	Dorian	108	" With their ages , Lady Narborough ? "
77496	77539	77494	77494	Dorian	108	" Of course , with their ages , slightly edited . But nothing must be done in a hurry . I want it to be what The Morning Post calls a suitable alliance , and I want you both to be happy . "
77540	77549	77551	77552	Lord Henry	105	" What nonsense people talk about happy marriages ! "
77554	77573	77551	77552	Lord Henry	105	" A man can be happy with any woman , as long as he does not love her . "
77574	77583	77585	77587	the old lady	989	" Ah ! what a cynic you are ! "
77599	77650	77596	77597	Lady Ruxton	313	" You must come and dine with me soon again . You are really an admirable tonic , much better than what Sir Andrew prescribes for me . You must tell me what people you would like to meet , though . I want it to be a delightful gathering . "
77651	77666	77667	77667	he	1559	" I like men who have a future and women who have a past , "
77670	77683	77667	77667	he	1559	" Or do you think that would make it a petticoat party ? "
77684	77689	77690	77690	she	989	" I fear so , "
77700	77710	77711	77711	she	989	" A thousand pardons , my dear Lady Ruxton , "
77714	77726	77711	77711	she	989	" I did n't see you had n't finished your cigarette . "
77727	77753	77793	77794	Lady Ruxton	313	" Never mind , Lady Narborough . I smoke a great deal too much . I am going to limit myself , for the future . "
77754	77762	77764	77765	Lord Henry	105	" Pray do n't , Lady Ruxton , "
77767	77792	77764	77765	Lord Henry	105	" Moderation is a fatal thing . Enough is as bad as a meal . More than enough is as good as a feast . "
77800	77821	77822	77822	she	989	" You must come and explain that to me some afternoon , Lord Henry . It sounds a fascinating theory , "
77833	77849	77851	77852	Lady Narborough	311	" Now , mind you do n't stay too long over your politics and scandal , "
77857	77869	77851	77852	Lady Narborough	311	" If you do , we are sure to squabble upstairs . "
78016	78025	78026	78026	he	105	" Are you better , my dear fellow ? "
78029	78039	78026	78026	he	105	" You seemed rather out of sorts at dinner . "
78040	78056	78008	78008	he	105	" I am quite well , Harry . I am tired . That is all . "
78057	78083	78026	78026	he	105	" You were charming last night . The little duchess is quite devoted to you . She tells me she is going down to Selby . "
78084	78094	78008	78008	he	105	" She has promised to come on the twentieth . "
78095	78104	78026	78026	he	105	" Is Monmouth to be there , too ? "
78105	78112	78008	78008	he	105	" Oh , yes , Harry . "
78113	78205	78026	78026	he	105	" He bores me dreadfully , almost as much as he bores her . She is very clever , too clever for a woman . She lacks the indefinable charm of weakness . It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image precious . Her feet are very pretty , but they are not feet of clay . White porcelain feet , if you like . They have been through the fire , and what fire does not destroy , it hardens . She has had experiences . "
78206	78214	78216	78216	Dorian	108	" How long has she been married ? "
78218	78260	78026	78026	he	105	" An eternity , she tells me . I believe , according to the peerage , it is ten years , but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity , with time thrown in . Who else is coming ? "
78261	78289	78026	78026	he	105	" Oh , the Willoughbys , Lord Rugby and his wife , our hostess , Geoffrey Clouston , the usual set . I have asked Lord Grotrian . "
78290	78295	78297	78298	Lord Henry	105	" I like him , "
78300	78336	78297	78298	Lord Henry	105	" A great many people do n't , but I find him charming . He atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by being always absolutely over - educated . He is a very modern type . "
78337	78364	78026	78026	he	105	" I do n't know if he will be able to come , Harry . He may have to go to Monte Carlo with his father . "
78365	78413	78297	78298	Lord Henry	105	" Ah ! what a nuisance people 's people are ! Try and make him come . By the way , Dorian , you ran off very early last night . You left before eleven . What did you do afterwards ? Did you go straight home ? "
78422	78427	78428	78428	he	108	" No , Harry , "
78433	78443	78428	78428	he	108	" I did not get home till nearly three . "
78444	78452	78026	78026	he	105	" Did you go to the club ? "
78453	78456	78457	78457	he	108	" Yes , "
78466	78574	78461	78461	he	108	" No , I do n't mean that . I did n't go to the club . I walked about . I forget what I did .... How inquisitive you are , Harry ! You always want to know what one has been doing . I always want to forget what I have been doing . I came in at half - past two , if you wish to know the exact time . I had left my latch - key at home , and my servant had to let me in . If you want any corroborative evidence on the subject , you can ask him . "
78581	78632	78575	78576	Lord Henry	105	" My dear fellow , as if I cared ! Let us go up to the drawing - room . No sherry , thank you , Mr. Chapman . Something has happened to you , Dorian . Tell me what it is . You are not yourself to - night . "
78633	78688	78575	78576	Lord Henry	105	" Do n't mind me , Harry . I am irritable , and out of temper . I shall come round and see you to - morrow , or next day . Make my excuses to Lady Narborough . I sha n't go upstairs . I shall go home . I must go home . "
78689	78715	78762	78763	Lord Henry	105	" All right , Dorian . I dare say I shall see you to - morrow at tea - time . The duchess is coming . "
78716	78726	78727	78727	he	1567	" I will try to be there , Harry , "
79272	79280	79281	79281	he	2000	" It is too far for me , "
79284	79292	79294	79294	Dorian	108	" Here is a sovereign for you , "
79296	79306	79294	79294	Dorian	108	" You shall have another if you drive fast . "
79307	79313	79315	79316	the man	2000	" All right , sir , "
79318	79327	79315	79316	the man	2000	" you will be there in an hour , "
79462	79482	79441	79441	he	108	" To cure the soul by means of the senses , and the senses by means of the soul . "
79620	79640	79667	79667	it	1592	" To cure the soul by means of the senses , and the senses by means of the soul ! "
80307	80318	80319	80319	he	2000	" Somewhere about here , sir , ai n't it ? "
80332	80337	80338	80338	he	108	" This will do , "
80714	80725	80727	80729	one of them	1635	" He thinks he 's got red ants on him , "
80831	80837	80839	80839	Dorian	108	" You here , Adrian ? "
80841	80848	80849	80849	he	108	" Where else should I be ? "
80854	80865	80849	80849	he	108	" None of the chaps will speak to me now . "
80866	80874	80797	80797	he	108	" I thought you had left England . "
80875	80905	80906	80906	he	108	" Darlington is not going to do anything . My brother paid the bill at last . George does n't speak to me either .... I do n't care , "
80912	80936	80906	80906	he	108	" As long as one has this stuff , one does n't want friends . I think I have had too many friends . "
81077	81087	81088	81088	he	108	" I am going on to the other place , "
81094	81099	81088	81088	he	108	" On the wharf ? "
81100	81103	81088	81088	he	108	" Yes . "
81104	81125	81088	81088	he	108	" That mad - cat is sure to be there . They wo n't have her in this place now . "
81131	81157	81126	81126	Dorian	108	" I am sick of women who love one . Women who hate one are much more interesting . Besides , the stuff is better . "
81158	81163	81088	81088	he	108	" Much the same . "
81164	81182	81126	81126	Dorian	108	" I like it better . Come and have something to drink . I must have something . "
81183	81190	81192	81194	the young man	1382	" I do n't want anything , "
81196	81200	81192	81194	the young man	1382	" Never mind . "
81291	81300	81301	81301	she	1648	" We are very proud to - night , "
81304	81315	81317	81317	Dorian	108	" For God 's sake do n't talk to me , "
81326	81346	81317	81317	Dorian	108	" What do you want ? Money ? Here it is . Do n't ever talk to me again . "
81392	81398	81400	81401	Adrian Singleton	204	" It 's no use , "
81403	81423	81400	81401	Adrian Singleton	204	" I do n't care to go back . What does it matter ? I am quite happy here . "
81424	81439	81441	81441	Dorian	108	" You will write to me if you want anything , wo n't you ? "
81447	81450	81400	81401	Adrian Singleton	204	" Perhaps . "
81451	81457	81400	81401	Adrian Singleton	204	" Good night , then . "
81458	81462	81464	81466	the young man	1382	" Good night , "
81519	81527	81528	81528	she	1653	" There goes the devil 's bargain ! "
81536	81540	81541	81541	he	108	" Curse you ! "
81544	81551	81541	81541	he	108	" do n't call me that . "
81557	81572	81573	81573	she	1653	" Prince Charming is what you like to be called , ai n't it ? "
82061	82067	82068	82068	he	108	" What do you want ? "
82071	82075	82077	82078	the man	2000	" Keep quiet , "
82080	82089	82077	82078	the man	2000	" If you stir , I shoot you . "
82090	82102	82077	82078	the man	2000	" You are mad . What have I done to you ? "
82103	82112	82077	82078	the man	2000	" You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane , "
82117	82215	82077	82078	the man	2000	" and Sibyl Vane was my sister . She killed herself . I know it . Her death is at your door . I swore I would kill you in return . For years I have sought you . I had no clue , no trace . The two people who could have described you were dead . I knew nothing of you but the pet name she used to call you . I heard it to - night by chance . Make your peace with God , for to - night you are going to die . "
82223	82229	82230	82230	he	108	" I never knew her , "
82233	82244	82230	82230	he	108	" I never heard of her . You are mad . "
82245	82268	82293	82294	the man	2000	" You had better confess your sin , for as sure as I am James Vane , you are going to die . "
82285	82291	82293	82294	the man	2000	" Down on your knees ! "
82296	82335	82293	82294	the man	2000	" I give you one minute to make your peace -- no more . I go on board to - night for India , and I must do my job first . One minute . That 's all . "
82365	82368	82369	82369	he	108	" Stop , "
82372	82388	82369	82369	he	108	" How long ago is it since your sister died ? Quick , tell me ! "
82389	82393	82395	82396	the man	2000	" Eighteen years , "
82398	82410	82395	82396	the man	2000	" Why do you ask me ? What do years matter ? "
82411	82415	82426	82426	his	108	" Eighteen years , "
82429	82444	82426	82426	his	108	" Eighteen years ! Set me under the lamp and look at my face ! "
82583	82590	82591	82591	he	108	" My God ! my God ! "
82594	82602	82591	82591	he	108	" and I would have murdered you ! "
82610	82626	82627	82627	he	108	" You have been on the brink of committing a terrible crime , my man , "
82635	82652	82627	82627	he	108	" Let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own hands . "
82653	82659	82661	82662	James Vane	175	" Forgive me , sir , "
82664	82685	82661	82662	James Vane	175	" I was deceived . A chance word I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track . "
82686	82705	82707	82707	Dorian	108	" You had better go home and put that pistol away , or you may get into trouble , "
82796	82804	82805	82805	she	1684	" Why did n't you kill him ? "
82817	82855	82805	82805	she	1684	" I knew you were following him when you rushed out from Daly 's . You fool ! You should have killed him . He has lots of money , and he 's as bad as bad . "
82856	82867	82868	82868	he	175	" He is not the man I am looking for , "
82871	82921	82805	82805	she	1684	" and I want no man 's money . I want a man 's life . The man whose life I want must be nearly forty now . This one is little more than a boy . Thank God , I have not got his blood upon my hands . "
82929	82936	82937	82937	she	765	" Little more than a boy ! "
82940	82960	82937	82937	she	765	" Why , man , it 's nigh on eighteen years since Prince Charming made me what I am . "
82961	82965	82967	82968	James Vane	175	" You lie ! "
82978	82987	82988	82988	she	765	" Before God I am telling the truth , "
82991	82995	82937	82937	she	765	" Before God ? "
82996	83053	83054	83054	she	765	" Strike me dumb if it ai n't so . He is the worst one that comes here . They say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face . It 's nigh on eighteen years since I met him . He has n't changed much since then . I have , though , "
83062	83067	82937	82937	she	765	" You swear this ? "
83068	83073	83079	83079	her	765	" I swear it , "
83083	83093	83094	83094	she	765	" But do n't give me away to him , "
83097	83115	83094	83094	she	765	" I am afraid of him . Let me have some money for my night 's lodging . "
83344	83352	83354	83355	Lord Henry	105	" What are you two talking about ? "
83368	83390	83354	83355	Lord Henry	105	" I hope Dorian has told you about my plan for rechristening everything , Gladys . It is a delightful idea . "
83391	83403	83405	83406	the duchess	566	" But I do n't want to be rechristened , Harry , "
83417	83439	83413	83413	her	566	" I am quite satisfied with my own name , and I am sure Mr. Gray should be satisfied with his . "
83440	83600	83354	83355	Lord Henry	105	" My dear Gladys , I would not alter either name for the world . They are both perfect . I was thinking chiefly of flowers . Yesterday I cut an orchid , for my button - hole . It was a marvellous spotted thing , as effective as the seven deadly sins . In a thoughtless moment I asked one of the gardeners what it was called . He told me it was a fine specimen of Robinsoniana , or something dreadful of that kind . It is a sad truth , but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things . Names are everything . I never quarrel with actions . My one quarrel is with words . That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in literature . The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one . It is the only thing he is fit for . "
83601	83611	83612	83612	she	1704	" Then what should we call you , Harry ? "
83615	83622	83624	83624	Dorian	108	" His name is Prince Paradox , "
83626	83634	83636	83637	the duchess	566	" I recognize him in a flash , "
83639	83647	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" I wo n't hear of it , "
83657	83671	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" From a label there is no escape ! I refuse the title . "
83672	83678	83636	83637	the duchess	566	" Royalties may not abdicate , "
83687	83698	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" You wish me to defend my throne , then ? "
83699	83702	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" Yes . "
83703	83713	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" I give the truths of to - morrow . "
83714	83724	83725	83725	she	1704	" I prefer the mistakes of to - day , "
83728	83735	83736	83736	he	105	" You disarm me , Gladys , "
83746	83758	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" Of your shield , Harry , not of your spear . "
83759	83766	83767	83767	he	105	" I never tilt against beauty , "
83777	83795	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" That is your error , Harry , believe me . You value beauty far too much . "
83796	83848	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" How can you say that ? I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good . But on the other hand , no one is more ready than I am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly . "
83849	83861	83863	83864	the duchess	566	" Ugliness is one of the seven deadly sins , then ? "
83866	83876	83863	83864	the duchess	566	" What becomes of your simile about the orchid ? "
83877	83919	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues , Gladys . You , as a good Tory , must not underrate them . Beer , the Bible , and the seven deadly virtues have made our England what she is . "
83920	83930	83931	83931	she	566	" You do n't like your country , then ? "
83934	83940	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" I live in it . "
83941	83950	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" That you may censure it the better . "
83951	83964	83965	83965	he	1707	" Would you have me take the verdict of Europe on it ? "
83968	83976	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" What do they say of us ? "
83977	83989	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" That Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop . "
83990	83997	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" Is that yours , Harry ? "
83998	84005	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" I give it to you . "
84006	84018	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" I could not use it . It is too true . "
84019	84033	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" You need not be afraid . Our countrymen never recognize a description . "
84034	84039	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" They are practical . "
84040	84066	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" They are more cunning than practical . When they make up their ledger , they balance stupidity by wealth , and vice by hypocrisy . "
84067	84076	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" Still , we have done great things . "
84077	84088	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" Great things have been thrust on us , Gladys . "
84089	84096	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" We have carried their burden . "
84097	84106	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" Only as far as the Stock Exchange . "
84112	84119	84120	84120	she	1708	" I believe in the race , "
84123	84132	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" It represents the survival of the pushing . "
84133	84138	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" It has development . "
84139	84145	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" Decay fascinates me more . "
84146	84151	84152	84152	she	1708	" What of art ? "
84155	84161	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" It is a malady . "
84162	84165	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" Love ? "
84166	84170	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" An illusion . "
84171	84174	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" Religion ? "
84175	84182	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" The fashionable substitute for belief . "
84183	84189	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" You are a sceptic . "
84190	84200	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" Never ! Scepticism is the beginning of faith . "
84201	84206	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" What are you ? "
84207	84214	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" To define is to limit . "
84215	84221	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" Give me a clue . "
84222	84235	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" Threads snap . You would lose your way in the labyrinth . "
84236	84249	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" You bewilder me . Let us talk of some one else . "
84250	84266	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" Our host is a delightful topic . Years ago he was christened Prince Charming . "
84267	84277	84279	84280	Dorian Gray	108	" Ah ! do n't remind me of that , "
84282	84291	84293	84294	the duchess	566	" Our host is rather horrid this evening , "
84298	84323	84293	84294	the duchess	566	" I believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern butterfly . "
84324	84339	84341	84341	Dorian	108	" Well , I hope he wo n't stick pins into you , Duchess , "
84343	84362	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" Oh ! my maid does that already , Mr. Gray , when she is annoyed with me . "
84363	84376	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" And what does she get annoyed with you about , Duchess ? "
84377	84415	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" For the most trivial things , Mr. Gray , I assure you . Usually because I come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must be dressed by half - past eight . "
84416	84428	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" How unreasonable of her ! You should give her warning . "
84429	84493	83649	83650	Lord Henry	105	" I dare n't , Mr. Gray . Why , she invents hats for me . You remember the one I wore at Lady Hilstone 's garden - party ? You do n't , but it is nice of you to pretend that you do . Well , she made it out of nothing . All good hats are made out of nothing . "
84494	84502	84504	84505	Lord Henry	105	" Like all good reputations , Gladys , "
84507	84527	84504	84505	Lord Henry	105	" Every effect that one produces gives one an enemy . To be popular one must be a mediocrity . "
84528	84533	84535	84536	the duchess	566	" Not with women , "
84542	84587	84539	84539	her	566	" and women rule the world . I assure you we ca n't bear mediocrities . We women , as some one says , love with our ears , just as you men love with your eyes , if you ever love at all . "
84588	84600	84602	84602	Dorian	108	" It seems to me that we never do anything else , "
84604	84617	84619	84620	the duchess	566	" Ah ! then , you never really love , Mr. Gray , "
84625	84630	84632	84633	Lord Henry	105	" My dear Gladys ! "
84635	84714	84632	84633	Lord Henry	105	" How can you say that ? Romance lives by repetition , and repetition converts an appetite into an art . Besides , each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved . Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion . It merely intensifies it . We can have in life but one great experience at best , and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible . "
84715	84727	84729	84730	the duchess	566	" Even when one has been wounded by it , Harry ? "
84735	84745	84747	84748	Lord Henry	105	" Especially when one has been wounded by it , "
84766	84777	84778	84778	she	566	" What do you say to that , Mr. Gray ? "
84796	84805	84788	84788	he	108	" I always agree with Harry , Duchess . "
84806	84813	84750	84751	The duchess	566	" Even when he is wrong ? "
84814	84822	84788	84788	he	108	" Harry is never wrong , Duchess . "
84823	84832	84750	84751	The duchess	566	" And does his philosophy make you happy ? "
84833	84851	84788	84788	he	108	" I have never searched for happiness . Who wants happiness ? I have searched for pleasure . "
84852	84860	84750	84751	The duchess	566	" And found it , Mr. Gray ? "
84861	84867	84788	84788	he	108	" Often . Too often . "
84872	84879	84880	84880	she	566	" I am searching for peace , "
84883	84900	84880	84880	she	566	" and if I do n't go and dress , I shall have none this evening . "
84901	84911	84913	84913	Dorian	108	" Let me get you some orchids , Duchess , "
84925	84933	84935	84936	Lord Henry	105	" You are flirting disgracefully with him , "
84941	84953	84935	84936	Lord Henry	105	" You had better take care . He is very fascinating . "
84954	84966	84880	84880	she	566	" If he were not , there would be no battle . "
84967	84974	84935	84936	Lord Henry	105	" Greek meets Greek , then ? "
84975	84991	84880	84880	she	566	" I am on the side of the Trojans . They fought for a woman . "
84992	84997	84935	84936	Lord Henry	105	" They were defeated . "
84998	85006	85007	85007	she	1717	" There are worse things than capture , "
85010	85018	84935	84936	Lord Henry	105	" You gallop with a loose rein . "
85019	85024	84935	84936	Lord Henry	105	" Pace gives life , "
85029	85041	84935	84936	Lord Henry	105	" I shall write it in my diary to - night . "
85042	85045	84935	84936	Lord Henry	105	" What ? "
85046	85055	84935	84936	Lord Henry	105	" That a burnt child loves the fire . "
85056	85068	84935	84936	Lord Henry	105	" I am not even singed . My wings are untouched . "
85069	85079	84935	84936	Lord Henry	105	" You use them for everything , except flight . "
85080	85097	84935	84936	Lord Henry	105	" Courage has passed from men to women . It is a new experience for us . "
85098	85104	84935	84936	Lord Henry	105	" You have a rival . "
85105	85108	84935	84936	Lord Henry	105	" Who ? "
85112	85116	85117	85117	he	1718	" Lady Narborough , "
85120	85126	85117	85117	he	1718	" She perfectly adores him . "
85127	85146	84935	84936	Lord Henry	105	" You fill me with apprehension . The appeal to antiquity is fatal to us who are romanticists . "
85147	85158	85117	85117	he	1718	" Romanticists ! You have all the methods of science . "
85159	85165	84935	84936	Lord Henry	105	" Men have educated us . "
85166	85172	85117	85117	he	1718	" But not explained you . "
85173	85180	84935	84936	Lord Henry	105	" Describe us as a sex , "
85185	85190	85117	85117	he	1718	" Sphinxes without secrets . "
85198	85205	85206	85206	she	1719	" How long Mr. Gray is ! "
85209	85229	85191	85191	She	1719	" Let us go and help him . I have not yet told him the colour of my frock . "
85230	85244	85117	85117	he	1718	" Ah ! you must suit your frock to his flowers , Gladys . "
85245	85253	85191	85191	She	1719	" That would be a premature surrender . "
85254	85262	85117	85117	he	1718	" Romantic art begins with its climax . "
85263	85272	85191	85191	She	1719	" I must keep an opportunity for retreat . "
85273	85279	85117	85117	he	1718	" In the Parthian manner ? "
85280	85294	85191	85191	She	1719	" They found safety in the desert . I could not do that . "
85295	85304	85305	85305	he	1718	" Women are not always allowed a choice , "
85415	85420	85421	85421	he	108	" What has happened ? "
85424	85437	85421	85421	he	108	" Oh ! I remember . Am I safe here , Harry ? "
85443	85448	85450	85451	Lord Henry	105	" My dear Dorian , "
85453	85483	85450	85451	Lord Henry	105	" you merely fainted . That was all . You must have overtired yourself . You had better not come down to dinner . I will take your place . "
85484	85492	85493	85493	he	108	" No , I will come down , "
85501	85514	85493	85493	he	108	" I would rather come down . I must not be alone . "
86414	86423	86424	86424	he	2000	" Have you had good sport , Geoffrey ? "
86427	86463	86401	86401	his	2000	" Not very good , Dorian . I think most of the birds have gone to the open . I dare say it will be better after lunch , when we get to new ground . "
86613	86625	86607	86607	he	325	" Do n't shoot it , Geoffrey . Let it live . "
86626	86632	86646	86646	he	325	" What nonsense , Dorian ! "
86679	86689	86691	86692	Sir Geoffrey	325	" Good heavens ! I have hit a beater ! "
86694	86713	86714	86714	he	325	" What an ass the man was to get in front of the guns ! Stop shooting there ! "
86724	86730	86714	86714	he	325	" A man is hurt . "
86745	86754	86755	86755	he	1763	" Where , sir ? Where is he ? "
86770	86773	86775	86776	Sir Geoffrey	325	" Here , "
86784	86803	86775	86776	Sir Geoffrey	325	" Why on earth do n't you keep your men back ? Spoiled my shooting for the day . "
86952	86955	86957	86958	Lord Henry	105	" Dorian , "
86960	86985	86957	86958	Lord Henry	105	" I had better tell them that the shooting is stopped for to - day . It would not look well to go on . "
86986	86997	86998	86998	he	108	" I wish it were stopped for ever , Harry , "
87002	87016	86998	86998	he	108	" The whole thing is hideous and cruel . Is the man ... ? "
87024	87030	87032	87033	Lord Henry	105	" I am afraid so , "
87035	87061	87032	87033	Lord Henry	105	" He got the whole charge of shot in his chest . He must have died almost instantaneously . Come ; let us go home . "
87094	87108	87081	87081	Dorian	108	" It is a bad omen , Harry , a very bad omen . "
87109	87113	87115	87116	Lord Henry	105	" What is ? "
87118	87212	87115	87116	Lord Henry	105	" Oh ! this accident , I suppose . My dear fellow , it ca n't be helped . It was the man 's own fault . Why did he get in front of the guns ? Besides , it is nothing to us . It is rather awkward for Geoffrey , of course . It does not do to pepper beaters . It makes people think that one is a wild shot . And Geoffrey is not ; he shoots very straight . But there is no use talking about the matter . "
87218	87247	87248	87248	he	108	" It is a bad omen , Harry . I feel as if something horrible were going to happen to some of us . To myself , perhaps , "
87269	87395	87264	87266	The elder man	955	" The only horrible thing in the world is ennui , Dorian . That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness . But we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep chattering about this thing at dinner . I must tell them that the subject is to be tabooed . As for omens , there is no such thing as an omen . Destiny does not send us heralds . She is too wise or too cruel for that . Besides , what on earth could happen to you , Dorian ? You have everything in the world that a man can want . There is no one who would not be delighted to change places with you . "
87396	87490	87264	87266	The elder man	955	" There is no one with whom I would not change places , Harry . Do n't laugh like that . I am telling you the truth . The wretched peasant who has just died is better off than I am . I have no terror of death . It is the coming of death that terrifies me . Its monstrous wings seem to wheel in the leaden air around me . Good heavens ! do n't you see a man moving behind the trees there , watching me , waiting for me ? "
87506	87509	87510	87510	he	105	" Yes , "
87515	87569	87510	87510	he	105	" I see the gardener waiting for you . I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the table to - night . How absurdly nervous you are , my dear fellow ! You must come and see my doctor , when we get back to town . "
87614	87625	87626	87626	he	2000	" Her Grace told me to wait for an answer , "
87637	87647	87648	87648	he	2000	" Tell her Grace that I am coming in , "
87667	87677	87679	87680	Lord Henry	105	" How fond women are of doing dangerous things ! "
87682	87714	87679	87680	Lord Henry	105	" It is one of the qualities in them that I admire most . A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on . "
87715	87751	87629	87629	Dorian	108	" How fond you are of saying dangerous things , Harry ! In the present instance , you are quite astray . I like the duchess very much , but I do n't love her . "
87752	87773	87679	87680	Lord Henry	105	" And the duchess loves you very much , but she likes you less , so you are excellently matched . "
87774	87791	87629	87629	Dorian	108	" You are talking scandal , Harry , and there is never any basis for scandal . "
87792	87803	87805	87806	Lord Henry	105	" The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty , "
87812	87827	87629	87629	Dorian	108	" You would sacrifice anybody , Harry , for the sake of an epigram . "
87828	87840	87629	87629	Dorian	108	" The world goes to the altar of its own accord , "
87845	87852	87854	87855	Dorian Gray	108	" I wish I could love , "
87866	87945	87863	87863	his	108	" But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the desire . I am too much concentrated on myself . My own personality has become a burden to me . I want to escape , to go away , to forget . It was silly of me to come down here at all . I think I shall send a wire to Harvey to have the yacht got ready . On a yacht one is safe . "
87946	87974	87629	87629	Dorian	108	" Safe from what , Dorian ? You are in some trouble . Why not tell me what it is ? You know I would help you . "
87975	87984	87985	87985	he	1776	" I ca n't tell you , Harry , "
87989	88024	87985	87985	he	1776	" And I dare say it is only a fancy of mine . This unfortunate accident has upset me . I have a horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me . "
88025	88029	87629	87629	Dorian	108	" What nonsense ! "
88030	88070	87985	87985	he	1776	" I hope it is , but I ca n't help feeling it . Ah ! here is the duchess , looking like Artemis in a tailor - made gown . You see we have come back , Duchess . "
88071	88082	88083	88083	she	1776	" I have heard all about it , Mr. Gray , "
88086	88109	88083	88083	she	1776	" Poor Geoffrey is terribly upset . And it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare . How curious ! "
88110	88160	87985	87985	he	1776	" Yes , it was very curious . I do n't know what made me say it . Some whim , I suppose . It looked the loveliest of little live things . But I am sorry they told you about the man . It is a hideous subject . "
88161	88168	88171	88172	Lord Henry	105	" It is an annoying subject , "
88174	88213	88171	88172	Lord Henry	105	" It has no psychological value at all . Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on purpose , how interesting he would be ! I should like to know some one who had committed a real murder . "
88214	88222	88224	88225	the duchess	566	" How horrid of you , Harry ! "
88227	88249	88224	88225	the duchess	566	" Is n't it , Mr. Gray ? Harry , Mr. Gray is ill again . He is going to faint . "
88260	88267	88268	88268	he	108	" It is nothing , Duchess , "
88271	88333	88268	88268	he	108	" my nerves are dreadfully out of order . That is all . I am afraid I walked too far this morning . I did n't hear what Harry said . Was it very bad ? You must tell me some other time . I think I must go and lie down . You will excuse me , wo n't you ? "
88373	88383	88384	88384	he	105	" Are you very much in love with him ? "
88402	88408	88409	88409	she	566	" I wish I knew , "
88419	88439	88414	88414	He	105	" Knowledge would be fatal . It is the uncertainty that charms one . A mist makes things wonderful . "
88440	88448	88387	88387	She	566	" One may lose one 's way . "
88449	88462	88414	88414	He	105	" All ways end at the same point , my dear Gladys . "
88463	88468	88387	88387	She	566	" What is that ? "
88469	88472	88414	88414	He	105	" Disillusion . "
88473	88481	88482	88482	she	566	" It was my debut in life , "
88485	88492	88414	88414	He	105	" It came to you crowned . "
88493	88501	88414	88414	He	105	" I am tired of strawberry leaves . "
88502	88507	88414	88414	He	105	" They become you . "
88508	88513	88414	88414	He	105	" Only in public . "
88514	88520	88522	88523	Lord Henry	105	" You would miss them , "
88525	88534	88414	88414	He	105	" I will not part with a petal . "
88535	88540	88414	88414	He	105	" Monmouth has ears . "
88541	88549	88414	88414	He	105	" Old age is dull of hearing . "
88550	88557	88414	88414	He	105	" Has he never been jealous ? "
88558	88565	88414	88414	He	105	" I wish he had been . "
88576	88583	88584	88584	she	566	" What are you looking for ? "
88587	88594	88595	88595	he	105	" The button from your foil , "
88598	88604	88595	88595	he	105	" You have dropped it . "
88608	88615	88605	88605	She	566	" I have still the mask . "
88616	88623	88625	88625	his	105	" It makes your eyes lovelier , "
88877	88882	88883	88883	he	105	" Send him in , "
88914	88930	88931	88931	he	108	" I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this morning , Thornton ? "
88939	88944	88946	88947	the gamekeeper	1796	" Yes , sir , "
88949	88964	88966	88966	Dorian	108	" Was the poor fellow married ? Had he any people dependent on him ? "
88971	88999	88966	88966	Dorian	108	" If so , I should not like them to be left in want , and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary . "
89000	89024	89076	89077	Dorian Gray	108	" We do n't know who he is , sir . That is what I took the liberty of coming to you about . "
89025	89033	89035	89035	Dorian	108	" Do n't know who he is ? "
89039	89053	89035	89035	Dorian	108	" What do you mean ? Was n't he one of your men ? "
89054	89071	89076	89077	Dorian Gray	108	" No , sir . Never saw him before . Seems like a sailor , sir . "
89093	89097	89098	89098	he	108	" A sailor ? "
89102	89109	89098	89098	he	108	" Did you say a sailor ? "
89110	89138	89035	89035	Dorian	108	" Yes , sir . He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor ; tattooed on both arms , and that kind of thing . "
89139	89147	89149	89149	Dorian	108	" Was there anything found on him ? "
89162	89170	89149	89149	Dorian	108	" Anything that would tell his name ? "
89171	89214	89035	89035	Dorian	108	" Some money , sir -- not much , and a six - shooter . There was no name of any kind . A decent - looking man , sir , but rough - like . A sort of sailor we think . "
89234	89240	89241	89241	he	108	" Where is the body ? "
89244	89254	89241	89241	he	108	" Quick ! I must see it at once . "
89255	89292	89215	89215	Dorian	108	" It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm , sir . The folk do n't like to have that sort of thing in their houses . They say a corpse brings bad luck . "
89293	89335	89241	89241	he	108	" The Home Farm ! Go there at once and meet me . Tell one of the grooms to bring my horse round . No . Never mind . I 'll go to the stables myself . It will save time . "
89607	89621	89622	89622	he	108	" Take that thing off the face . I wish to see it , "
89700	89716	89718	89719	Lord Henry	105	" There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good , "
89736	89748	89722	89722	his	105	" You are quite perfect . Pray , do n't change . "
89755	89787	89752	89752	his	108	" No , Harry , I have done too many dreadful things in my life . I am not going to do any more . I began my good actions yesterday . "
89788	89794	89749	89750	Dorian Gray	108	" Where were you yesterday ? "
89795	89812	89752	89752	his	108	" In the country , Harry . I was staying at a little inn by myself . "
89813	89818	89820	89821	Lord Henry	105	" My dear boy , "
89825	89906	89820	89821	Lord Henry	105	" anybody can be good in the country . There are no temptations there . That is the reason why people who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized . Civilization is not by any means an easy thing to attain to . There are only two ways by which man can reach it . One is by being cultured , the other by being corrupt . Country people have no opportunity of being either , so they stagnate . "
89907	89912	89914	89914	Dorian	108	" Culture and corruption , "
89916	89959	89914	89914	Dorian	108	" I have known something of both . It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found together . For I have a new ideal , Harry . I am going to alter . I think I have altered . "
89960	89984	89989	89989	he	108	" You have not yet told me what your good action was . Or did you say you had done more than one ? "
90018	90205	89989	89989	he	108	" I can tell you , Harry . It is not a story I could tell to any one else . I spared somebody . It sounds vain , but you understand what I mean . She was quite beautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane . I think it was that which first attracted me to her . You remember Sibyl , do n't you ? How long ago that seems ! Well , Hetty was not one of our own class , of course . She was simply a girl in a village . But I really loved her . I am quite sure that I loved her . All during this wonderful May that we have been having , I used to run down and see her two or three times a week . Yesterday she met me in a little orchard . The apple - blossoms kept tumbling down on her hair , and she was laughing . We were to have gone away together this morning at dawn . Suddenly I determined to leave her as flowerlike as I had found her . "
90206	90227	90229	90230	Lord Henry	105	" I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill of real pleasure , Dorian , "
90232	90260	90229	90230	Lord Henry	105	" But I can finish your idyll for you . You gave her good advice and broke her heart . That was the beginning of your reformation . "
90261	90315	89989	89989	he	108	" Harry , you are horrible ! You must n't say these dreadful things . Hetty 's heart is not broken . Of course , she cried and all that . But there is no disgrace upon her . She can live , like Perdita , in her garden of mint and marigold . "
90316	90324	90326	90327	Lord Henry	105	" And weep over a faithless Florizel , "
90339	90477	90332	90332	he	105	" My dear Dorian , you have the most curiously boyish moods . Do you think this girl will ever be really content now with any one of her own rank ? I suppose she will be married some day to a rough carter or a grinning ploughman . Well , the fact of having met you , and loved you , will teach her to despise her husband , and she will be wretched . From a moral point of view , I can not say that I think much of your great renunciation . Even as a beginning , it is poor . Besides , how do you know that Hetty is n't floating at the present moment in some starlit mill - pond , with lovely water - lilies round her , like Ophelia ? "
90478	90640	89989	89989	he	108	" I ca n't bear this , Harry ! You mock at everything , and then suggest the most serious tragedies . I am sorry I told you now . I do n't care what you say to me . I know I was right in acting as I did . Poor Hetty ! As I rode past the farm this morning , I saw her white face at the window , like a spray of jasmine . Do n't let us talk about it any more , and do n't try to persuade me that the first good action I have done for years , the first little bit of self - sacrifice I have ever known , is really a sort of sin . I want to be better . I am going to be better . Tell me something about yourself . What is going on in town ? I have not been to the club for days . "
90641	90652	90332	90332	he	105	" The people are still discussing poor Basil 's disappearance . "
90653	90668	90670	90670	Dorian	108	" I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time , "
90681	90851	90332	90332	he	105	" My dear boy , they have only been talking about it for six weeks , and the British public are really not equal to the mental strain of having more than one topic every three months . They have been very fortunate lately , however . They have had my own divorce - case and Alan Campbell 's suicide . Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist . Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left for Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor Basil , and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris at all . I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has been seen in San Francisco . It is an odd thing , but every one who disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco . It must be a delightful city , and possess all the attractions of the next world . "
90852	90862	90864	90864	Dorian	108	" What do you think has happened to Basil ? "
90887	90937	90332	90332	he	105	" I have not the slightest idea . If Basil chooses to hide himself , it is no business of mine . If he is dead , I do n't want to think about him . Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me . I hate it . "
90938	90941	90943	90945	the younger man	1377	" Why ? "
90948	90951	90953	90954	Lord Henry	105	" Because , "
90969	91092	90953	90954	Lord Henry	105	" one can survive everything nowadays except that . Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the nineteenth century that one can not explain away . Let us have our coffee in the music - room , Dorian . You must play Chopin to me . The man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely . Poor Victoria ! I was very fond of her . The house is rather lonely without her . Of course , married life is merely a habit , a bad habit . But then one regrets the loss even of one 's worst habits . Perhaps one regrets them the most . They are such an essential part of one 's personality . "
91150	91164	91145	91146	Lord Henry	105	" Harry , did it ever occur to you that Basil was murdered ? "
91169	91266	91165	91166	Lord Henry	105	" Basil was very popular , and always wore a Waterbury watch . Why should he have been murdered ? He was not clever enough to have enemies . Of course , he had a wonderful genius for painting . But a man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as possible . Basil was really rather dull . He only interested me once , and that was when he told me , years ago , that he had a wild adoration for you and that you were the dominant motive of his art . "
91267	91275	91277	91277	Dorian	108	" I was very fond of Basil , "
91287	91298	91284	91284	his	108	" But do n't people say that he was murdered ? "
91299	91354	91165	91166	Lord Henry	105	" Oh , some of the papers do . It does not seem to me to be at all probable . I know there are dreadful places in Paris , but Basil was not the sort of man to have gone to them . He had no curiosity . It was his chief defect . "
91355	91373	91375	91377	the younger man	1377	" What would you say , Harry , if I told you that I had murdered Basil ? "
91388	91495	91379	91379	He	1377	" I would say , my dear fellow , that you were posing for a character that does n't suit you . All crime is vulgar , just as all vulgarity is crime . It is not in you , Dorian , to commit a murder . I am sorry if I hurt your vanity by saying so , but I assure you it is true . Crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders . I do n't blame them in the smallest degree . I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us , simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations . "
91496	91532	91165	91166	Lord Henry	105	" A method of procuring sensations ? Do you think , then , that a man who has once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again ? Do n't tell me that . "
91533	91547	91549	91550	Lord Henry	105	" Oh ! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often , "
91554	91715	91549	91550	Lord Henry	105	" That is one of the most important secrets of life . I should fancy , however , that murder is always a mistake . One should never do anything that one can not talk about after dinner . But let us pass from poor Basil . I wish I could believe that he had come to such a really romantic end as you suggest , but I ca n't . I dare say he fell into the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the scandal . Yes : I should fancy that was his end . I see him lying now on his back under those dull - green waters , with the heavy barges floating over him and long weeds catching in his hair . Do you know , I do n't think he would have done much more good work . During the last ten years his painting had gone off very much . "
91790	91793	91794	91794	he	105	" Yes , "
91808	92011	91794	91794	he	105	" his painting had quite gone off . It seemed to me to have lost something . It had lost an ideal . When you and he ceased to be great friends , he ceased to be a great artist . What was it separated you ? I suppose he bored you . If so , he never forgave you . It 's a habit bores have . By the way , what has become of that wonderful portrait he did of you ? I do n't think I have ever seen it since he finished it . Oh ! I remember your telling me years ago that you had sent it down to Selby , and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the way . You never got it back ? What a pity ! it was really a masterpiece . I remember I wanted to buy it . I wish I had now . It belonged to Basil 's best period . Since then , his work was that curious mixture of bad painting and good intentions that always entitles a man to be called a representative British artist . Did you advertise for it ? You should . "
92012	92016	92018	92018	Dorian	108	" I forget , "
92020	92079	92018	92018	Dorian	108	" I suppose I did . But I never really liked it . I am sorry I sat for it . The memory of the thing is hateful to me . Why do you talk of it ? It used to remind me of those curious lines in some play -- Hamlet , I think -- how do they run?--
92080	92087	91794	91794	he	105	" Like the painting of a sorrow ,
92094	92094	92018	92018	Dorian	108	"
92104	92104	92018	92018	Dorian	108	"
92109	92123	92124	92124	he	105	" If a man treats life artistically , his brain is his heart , "
92148	92158	92159	92159	he	108	" ' Like the painting of a sorrow , ' "
92162	92171	92159	92159	he	108	" ' a face without a heart . ' "
92187	92194	92195	92195	he	108	" By the way , Dorian , "
92201	92227	92195	92195	he	108	" ' what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose -- how does the quotation run?--his own soul ' ? "
92242	92252	92233	92234	Dorian Gray	108	" Why do you ask me that , Harry ? "
92253	92258	92260	92261	Lord Henry	105	" My dear fellow , "
92269	92441	92260	92261	Lord Henry	105	" I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer . That is all . I was going through the park last Sunday , and close by the Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby - looking people listening to some vulgar street - preacher . As I passed by , I heard the man yelling out that question to his audience . It struck me as being rather dramatic . London is very rich in curious effects of that kind . A wet Sunday , an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh , a ring of sickly white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas , and a wonderful phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips -- it was really very good in its way , quite a suggestion . I thought of telling the prophet that art had a soul , but that man had not . I am afraid , however , he would not have understood me . "
92442	92490	92233	92234	Dorian Gray	108	" Do n't , Harry . The soul is a terrible reality . It can be bought , and sold , and bartered away . It can be poisoned , or made perfect . There is a soul in each one of us . I know it . "
92491	92502	92260	92261	Lord Henry	105	" Do you feel quite sure of that , Dorian ? "
92503	92507	92233	92234	Dorian Gray	108	" Quite sure . "
92508	93034	92260	92261	Lord Henry	105	" Ah ! then it must be an illusion . The things one feels absolutely certain about are never true . That is the fatality of faith , and the lesson of romance . How grave you are ! Do n't be so serious . What have you or I to do with the superstitions of our age ? No : we have given up our belief in the soul . Play me something . Play me a nocturne , Dorian , and , as you play , tell me , in a low voice , how you have kept your youth . You must have some secret . I am only ten years older than you are , and I am wrinkled , and worn , and yellow . You are really wonderful , Dorian . You have never looked more charming than you do to - night . You remind me of the day I saw you first . You were rather cheeky , very shy , and absolutely extraordinary . You have changed , of course , but not in appearance . I wish you would tell me your secret . To get back my youth I would do anything in the world , except take exercise , get up early , or be respectable . Youth ! There is nothing like it . It 's absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth . The only people to whose opinions I listen now with any respect are people much younger than myself . They seem in front of me . Life has revealed to them her latest wonder . As for the aged , I always contradict the aged . I do it on principle . If you ask them their opinion on something that happened yesterday , they solemnly give you the opinions current in 1820 , when people wore high stocks , believed in everything , and knew absolutely nothing . How lovely that thing you are playing is ! I wonder , did Chopin write it at Majorca , with the sea weeping round the villa and the salt spray dashing against the panes ? It is marvellously romantic . What a blessing it is that there is one art left to us that is not imitative ! Do n't stop . I want music to - night . It seems to me that you are the young Apollo and that I am Marsyas listening to you . I have sorrows , Dorian , of my own , that even you know nothing of . The tragedy of old age is not that one is old , but that one is young . I am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity . Ah , Dorian , how happy you are ! What an exquisite life you have had ! You have drunk deeply of everything . You have crushed the grapes against your palate . Nothing has been hidden from you . And it has all been to you no more than the sound of music . It has not marred you . You are still the same . "
93035	93044	92233	92234	Dorian Gray	108	" I am not the same , Harry . "
93045	93378	92260	92261	Lord Henry	105	" Yes , you are the same . I wonder what the rest of your life will be . Do n't spoil it by renunciations . At present you are a perfect type . Do n't make yourself incomplete . You are quite flawless now . You need not shake your head : you know you are . Besides , Dorian , do n't deceive yourself . Life is not governed by will or intention . Life is a question of nerves , and fibres , and slowly built - up cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams . You may fancy yourself safe and think yourself strong . But a chance tone of colour in a room or a morning sky , a particular perfume that you had once loved and that brings subtle memories with it , a line from a forgotten poem that you had come across again , a cadence from a piece of music that you had ceased to play -- I tell you , Dorian , that it is on things like these that our lives depend . Browning writes about that somewhere ; but our own senses will imagine them for us . There are moments when the odour of lilas blanc passes suddenly across me , and I have to live the strangest month of my life over again . I wish I could change places with you , Dorian . The world has cried out against us both , but it has always worshipped you . It always will worship you . You are the type of what the age is searching for , and what it is afraid it has found . I am so glad that you have never done anything , never carved a statue , or painted a picture , or produced anything outside of yourself ! Life has been your art . You have set yourself to music . Your days are your sonnets . "
93393	93401	93402	93402	he	108	" Yes , life has been exquisite , "
93405	93459	93402	93402	he	108	" but I am not going to have the same life , Harry . And you must not say these extravagant things to me . You do n't know everything about me . I think that if you did , even you would turn from me . You laugh . Do n't laugh . "
93460	93594	92260	92261	Lord Henry	105	" Why have you stopped playing , Dorian ? Go back and give me the nocturne over again . Look at that great , honey - coloured moon that hangs in the dusky air . She is waiting for you to charm her , and if you play she will come closer to the earth . You wo n't ? Let us go to the club , then . It has been a charming evening , and we must end it charmingly . There is some one at White 's who wants immensely to know you -- young Lord Poole , Bournemouth 's eldest son . He has already copied your neckties , and has begged me to introduce him to you . He is quite delightful and rather reminds me of you . "
93595	93600	93602	93602	Dorian	108	" I hope not , "
93611	93644	93602	93602	Dorian	108	" But I am tired to - night , Harry . I sha n't go to the club . It is nearly eleven , and I want to go to bed early . "
93645	93683	92260	92261	Lord Henry	105	" Do stay . You have never played so well as to - night . There was something in your touch that was wonderful . It had more expression than I had ever heard from it before . "
93684	93695	93696	93696	he	108	" It is because I am going to be good , "
93701	93709	93696	93696	he	108	" I am a little changed already . "
93710	93720	93722	93723	Lord Henry	105	" You can not change to me , Dorian , "
93725	93734	93722	93723	Lord Henry	105	" You and I will always be friends . "
93735	93770	92260	92261	Lord Henry	105	" Yet you poisoned me with a book once . I should not forgive that . Harry , promise me that you will never lend that book to any one . It does harm . "
93771	94010	93722	93723	Lord Henry	105	" My dear boy , you are really beginning to moralize . You will soon be going about like the converted , and the revivalist , warning people against all the sins of which you have grown tired . You are much too delightful to do that . Besides , it is no use . You and I are what we are , and will be what we will be . As for being poisoned by a book , there is no such thing as that . Art has no influence upon action . It annihilates the desire to act . It is superbly sterile . The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame . That is all . But we wo n't discuss literature . Come round to - morrow . I am going to ride at eleven . We might go together , and I will take you to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome . She is a charming woman , and wants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying . Mind you come . Or shall we lunch with our little duchess ? She says she never sees you now . Perhaps you are tired of Gladys ? I thought you would be . Her clever tongue gets on one 's nerves . Well , in any case , be here at eleven . "
94011	94019	92260	92261	Lord Henry	105	" Must I really come , Harry ? "
94020	94046	93722	93723	Lord Henry	105	" Certainly . The park is quite lovely now . I do n't think there have been such lilacs since the year I met you . "
94047	94058	94060	94060	Dorian	108	" Very well . I shall be here at eleven , "
94062	94068	94060	94060	Dorian	108	" Good night , Harry . "
94153	94159	94147	94147	them	1820	" That is Dorian Gray . "
94543	94548	94564	94567	a most just God	1833	" Forgive us our sins "
94550	94556	94564	94567	a most just God	1833	" Smite us for our iniquities "
94669	94691	94648	94654	some one who had terribly loved him	1834	" The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold . The curves of your lips rewrite history . "
96082	96090	96092	96097	the elder of the two gentlemen	1858	" Whose house is that , Constable ? "
96099	96107	96109	96110	the policeman	1410	" Mr. Dorian Gray 's , sir , "
