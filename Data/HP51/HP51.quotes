Marge was right , it should have been the orphanage , we were too damn soft for our own good , thought we could squash it out of you , thought we could turn you normal , but you ’ve been rotten from the beginning , and I ’ve had enough — OWLS ! ”
14255	14264	14266	14266	Harry	156	“ You can open it if you like , ”
14268	14283	14266	14266	Harry	156	“ but I ’ll hear what it says anyway . That ’s a Howler . ”
14284	14292	14294	14295	Uncle Vernon	157	“ Let go of it , Petunia ! ”
14297	14308	14294	14295	Uncle Vernon	157	“ Do n’t touch it , it could be dangerous ! ”
14309	14316	14318	14319	Aunt Petunia	158	“ It ’s addressed to me , ”
14325	14349	14318	14319	Aunt Petunia	158	“ It ’s addressed to me , Vernon , look ! Mrs. Petunia Dursley , The Kitchen , Number Four , Privet Drive — ”

14493	14498	14499	14500	Uncle Vernon	157	“ What is this ? ”
14504	14513	14499	14500	Uncle Vernon	157	“ What — I do n’t — Petunia ? ”
14553	14558	14560	14561	Uncle Vernon	157	“ Petunia , dear ? ”

14636	14648	14649	14649	she	158	“ If we throw him out , the neighbors will talk , ”
14670	14694	14664	14664	she	158	“ They ’ll ask awkward questions , they ’ll want to know where he ’s gone . We ’ll have to keep him . ”

14773	14781	14749	14749	Harry	156	“ Are you in touch with wizards ? ”
14782	14791	14749	14749	Harry	156	“ I told you to get to bed ! ”
14792	14803	14749	14749	Harry	156	“ What did it mean ? Remember the last what ? ”
14804	14809	14749	14749	Harry	156	“ Go to bed ! ”

15232	15236	15238	15238	Harry	156	“ Come here , ”
15261	15302	15238	15238	Harry	156	“ Take these straight to Sirius , Ron , and Hermione and do n’t come back here without good long replies . Keep pecking them till they ’ve written decent - length answers if you ’ve got to . Understand ? ”
15316	15322	15324	15324	Harry	156	“ Get going , then , ”
15891	15897	15898	15898	he	157	“ We ’re going out , ”

15905	15925	15898	15898	he	157	“ We — that is to say , your aunt , Dudley , and I — are going out . ”
15926	15929	15931	15932	Harry dully	156	“ Fine , ”
15940	15953	15898	15898	he	157	“ You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away . ”
15954	15957	15898	15898	he	157	“ Okay . ”
15958	15976	15898	15898	he	157	“ You are not to touch the television , the stereo , or any of our possessions . ”
15977	15980	15898	15898	he	157	“ Right . ”
15981	15992	15898	15898	he	157	“ You are not to steal food from the fridge . ”
15993	15996	15898	15898	he	157	“ Okay . ”
15997	16006	15898	15898	he	157	“ I am going to lock your door . ”
16007	16012	15898	15898	he	157	“ You do that . ”
16436	16451	16459	16459	Harry	156	“ Lower your wand , boy , before you take someone ’s eye out , ”
16479	16483	16484	16484	he	156	“ Professor Moody ? ”
16488	16500	16459	16459	Harry	156	“ I do n’t know so much about ‘ Professor , ’ ”
16505	16527	16459	16459	Harry	156	“ never got round to much teaching , did I ? Get down here , we want to see you properly . ”
16627	16643	16700	16703	this one completely unfamiliar	818	“ It ’s all right , Harry . We ’ve come to take you away . ”
16667	16673	16674	16674	he	156	“ P - Professor Lupin ? ”
16678	16683	16674	16674	he	156	“ Is that you ? ”
16684	16694	16705	16706	a woman	819	“ Why are we all standing in the dark ? ”
16709	16712	16705	16706	a woman	819	“ Lumos . ”
16820	16832	16839	16839	her	824	“ Oooh , he looks just like I thought he would , ”
16875	16880	16850	16850	she	824	“ Wotcher , Harry ! ”
16881	16892	16902	16902	he	826	“ Yeah , I see what you mean , Remus , ”
16919	16926	16902	16902	he	826	“ He looks exactly like James . ”
16927	16932	16934	16945	a wheezy - voiced , silver - haired wizard at the back	827	“ Except the eyes , ”
16947	16952	16934	16945	a wheezy - voiced , silver - haired wizard at the back	827	“ Lily ’s eyes . ”
17025	17036	17037	17037	he	218	“ Are you quite sure it ’s him , Lupin ? ”
17040	17076	17037	17037	he	218	“ It ’d be a nice lookout if we bring back some Death Eater impersonating him . We ought to ask him something only the real Potter would know . Unless anyone brought any Veritaserum ? ”
17077	17087	17089	17089	Lupin	221	“ Harry , what form does your Patronus take ? ”
17091	17095	17097	17097	Harry	156	“ A stag , ”
17100	17109	17111	17111	Lupin	221	“ That ’s him , Mad - Eye , ”
17141	17151	17153	17153	Moody	218	“ Do n’t put your wand there , boy ! ”
17155	17172	17153	17153	Moody	218	“ What if it ignited ? Better wizards than you have lost buttocks , you know ! ”
17173	17183	17184	17188	the violet - haired woman	830	“ Who d’you know who ’s lost a buttock ? ”
17195	17211	17213	17215	Mad - Eye	218	“ Never you mind , you just keep your wand out of your back pocket ! ”
17217	17228	17229	17229	He	218	“ Elementary wand safety , nobody bothers about it anymore ... ”
17236	17242	17243	17243	he	218	“ And I saw that , ”
17267	17272	17273	17273	he	221	“ How are you ? ”
17281	17286	17273	17273	he	221	“ F - fine ... ”
17375	17388	17389	17389	he	156	“ I ’m — you ’re really lucky the Dursleys are out ... ”
17392	17397	17399	17403	the violet - haired woman	830	“ Lucky , ha ! ”
17405	17461	17399	17403	the violet - haired woman	830	“ It was me that lured them out of the way . Sent a letter by Muggle post telling them they ’d been short - listed for the All - England Best - Kept Suburban Lawn Competition . They ’re heading off to the prize - giving right now ... Or they think they are . ”
17488	17497	17498	17498	he	156	“ We are leaving , are n’t we ? ”
17501	17504	17498	17498	he	156	“ Soon ? ”
17505	17510	17512	17512	Lupin	221	“ Almost at once , ”
17514	17525	17512	17512	Lupin	221	“ we ’re just waiting for the all - clear . ”
17526	17535	17536	17536	Harry	156	“ Where are we going ? The Burrow ? ”
17540	17547	17549	17549	Lupin	221	“ Not the Burrow , no , ”
17570	17588	17557	17561	the little knot of wizards	840	“ Too risky . We ’ve set up headquarters somewhere undetectable . It ’s taken a while ... ”
17625	17633	17634	17634	Lupin	221	“ This is Alastor Moody , Harry , ”
17641	17647	17649	17649	Harry	156	“ Yeah , I know , ”
17670	17676	17634	17634	Lupin	221	“ And this is Nymphadora — ”
17677	17686	17688	17690	the young witch	842	“ Do n’t call me Nymphadora , Remus , ”
17695	17700	17688	17690	the young witch	842	“ It ’s Tonks . ”
17701	17716	17718	17718	Lupin	221	“ — Nymphadora Tonks , who prefers to be known by her surname only , ”
17720	17737	17739	17739	Tonks	225	“ So would you if your fool of a mother had called you ‘ Nymphadora , ’ ”
17741	17747	17749	17749	he	221	“ And this is Kingsley Shacklebolt ”
17759	17762	17764	17768	the wheezy - voiced wizard	843	“ Elphias Doge ”
17771	17775	17764	17768	the wheezy - voiced wizard	843	“ Dedalus Diggle — ”
17776	17782	17789	17789	his	228	“ We ’ve met before , ”
17793	17797	17810	17810	her	844	“ — Emmeline Vance ”
17813	17816	17810	17810	her	844	“ Sturgis Podmore ”
17832	17837	17810	17810	her	844	“ and Hestia Jones . ”
17901	17914	17916	17916	Lupin	221	“ A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you , ”
17935	17945	17947	17947	Moody	218	“ Yeah , well , the more the better , ”
17950	17958	17947	17947	Moody	218	“ We ’re your guard , Potter . ”
17959	17977	17979	17979	Lupin	221	“ We ’re just waiting for the signal to tell us it ’s safe to set off , ”
17988	17996	17979	17979	Lupin	221	“ We ’ve got about fifteen minutes . ”
17997	18008	18013	18013	Tonks	225	“ Very clean , are n’t they , these Muggles ? ”
18025	18050	18013	18013	Tonks	225	“ My dad ’s Muggle - born and he ’s a right old slob . I suppose it varies , just like with wizards ? ”
18051	18056	18058	18058	Harry	156	“ Er — yeah , ”
18060	18062	18064	18064	he	156	“ Look ”
18070	18089	18064	18064	he	156	“ what ’s going on , I have n’t heard anything from anyone , what ’s Vol — ? ”
18112	18116	18109	18109	Moody	218	“ Shut up ! ”
18117	18120	18122	18122	Harry	156	“ What ? ”
18124	18137	18139	18139	Moody	218	“ We ’re not discussing anything here , it ’s too risky , ”
18158	18162	18163	18163	he	218	“ Damn it , ”
18176	18188	18163	18163	he	218	“ it keeps sticking — ever since that scum wore it — ”
18211	18227	18229	18229	Tonks	225	“ Mad - Eye , you do know that ’s disgusting , do n’t you ? ”
18232	18245	18247	18247	Moody	218	“ Get me a glass of water , would you , Harry ? ”
18288	18291	18293	18293	Moody	218	“ Cheers , ”
18329	18346	18302	18302	He	156	“ I want three - hundred - and - sixty degrees visibility on the return journey . ”
18347	18358	18359	18359	Harry	156	“ How ’re we getting — wherever we ’re going ? ”
18362	18365	18367	18367	Lupin	221	“ Brooms , ”
18369	18404	18367	18367	Lupin	221	“ Only way . You ’re too young to Apparate , they ’ll be watching the Floo Network , and it ’s more than our life ’s worth to set up an unauthorized Portkey . ”
18405	18414	18419	18419	his	226	“ Remus says you ’re a good flier , ”
18423	18428	18430	18430	Lupin	221	“ He ’s excellent , ”
18438	18463	18430	18430	Lupin	221	“ Anyway , you ’d better go and get packed , Harry , we want to be ready to go when the signal comes . ”
18464	18472	18474	18474	Tonks	225	“ I ’ll come and help you , ”
18497	18501	18502	18502	she	225	“ Funny place , ”
18505	18528	18529	18529	she	225	“ it ’s a bit too clean , d’you know what I mean ? Bit unnatural . Oh , this is better , ”
18679	18693	18694	18694	she	225	“ You know , I do n’t think purple ’s really my color , ”
18706	18717	18694	18694	she	225	“ D’you think it makes me look a bit peaky ? ”
18718	18721	18723	18723	Harry	156	“ Er — ”
18740	18746	18748	18748	Tonks	225	“ Yeah , it does , ”
18782	18789	18791	18791	Harry	156	“ How did you do that ? ”
18803	18809	18810	18810	she	225	“ I ’m a Metamorphmagus , ”
18833	18844	18845	18845	she	225	“ It means I can change my appearance at will , ”
18859	18886	18845	18845	she	225	“ I was born one . I got top marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training without any study at all , it was great . ”
18887	18893	18895	18895	Harry	156	“ You ’re an Auror ? ”
18915	18918	18920	18920	Tonks	225	“ Yeah , ”
18925	18974	18920	18920	Tonks	225	“ Kingsley is as well ; he ’s a bit higher up than I am , though . I only qualified a year ago . Nearly failed on Stealth and Tracking , I ’m dead clumsy , did you hear me break that plate when we arrived downstairs ? ”
18975	18985	18986	18986	Harry	156	“ Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus ? ”
19001	19014	18998	18998	Tonks	225	“ Bet you would n’t mind hiding that scar sometimes , eh ? ”
19028	19036	19037	19037	Harry	156	“ No , I would n’t mind , ”
19053	19069	19071	19071	Tonks	225	“ Well , you ’ll have to learn the hard way , I ’m afraid , ”
19073	19117	19118	19118	she	225	“ Metamorphmagi are really rare , they ’re born , not made . Most wizards need to use a wand or potions to change their appearance ... But we ’ve got to get going , Harry , we ’re supposed to be packing , ”
19132	19137	19139	19139	Harry	156	“ Oh — yeah , ”
19148	19164	19166	19166	Tonks	225	“ Do n’t be stupid , it ’ll be much quicker if I — pack ! ”
19203	19210	19212	19212	Tonks	225	“ It ’s not very neat , ”
19227	19269	19212	19212	Tonks	225	“ My mum ’s got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatly — she even gets the socks to fold themselves — but I ’ve never mastered how she does it — it ’s a kind of flick — ”
19297	19302	19304	19304	Tonks	225	“ Ah , well , ”
19313	19334	19335	19335	She	225	“ at least it ’s all in . That could do with a bit of cleaning , too — Scourgify — ”
19351	19388	19337	19337	her	225	“ Well , that ’s a bit better — I ’ve never quite got the hang of these sort of householdy spells . Right — got everything ? Cauldron ? Broom ? Wow ! A Firebolt ? ”
19421	19432	19434	19434	Tonks	225	“ And I ’m still riding a Comet Two Sixty , ”
19437	19461	19434	19434	Tonks	225	“ Ah well ... wand still in your jeans ? Both buttocks still on ? Okay , let ’s go . Locomotor Trunk . ”
19579	19582	19584	19584	Lupin	221	“ Excellent , ”
19594	19634	19589	19589	Tonks	225	“ We ’ve got about a minute , I think . We should probably get out into the garden so we ’re ready . Harry , I ’ve left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry — ”
19635	19640	19642	19642	Harry	156	“ They wo n’t , ”
19644	19650	19589	19589	Tonks	225	“ That you ’re safe — ”
19651	19658	19589	19589	Tonks	225	“ That ’ll just depress them . ”
19659	19669	19589	19589	Tonks	225	“ — and you ’ll see them next summer . ”
19670	19676	19589	19589	Tonks	225	“ Do I have to ? ”
19684	19690	19692	19692	Moody	218	“ Come here , boy , ”
19703	19710	19700	19700	his	218	“ I need to Disillusion you . ”
19711	19717	19719	19719	Harry	156	“ You need to what ? ”
19722	19726	19728	19728	Moody	218	“ Disillusionment Charm , ”
19734	19765	19731	19731	his	218	“ Lupin says you ’ve got an Invisibility Cloak , but it wo n’t stay on while we ’re flying ; this ’ll disguise you better . Here you go — ”
19809	19817	19819	19819	Tonks	225	“ Nice one , Mad - Eye , ”
19885	19889	19891	19891	Moody	218	“ Come on , ”
19913	19917	19919	19919	Moody	218	“ Clear night , ”
19928	19943	19944	19944	he	218	“ Could ’ve done with a bit more cloud cover . Right , you , ”
19949	20013	19944	19944	he	218	“ we ’re going to be flying in close formation . Tonks’ll be right in front of you , keep close on her tail . Lupin’ll be covering you from below . I ’m going to be behind you . The rest’ll be circling us . We do n’t break ranks for anything , got me ? If one of us is killed — ”
20014	20019	20020	20020	Harry	156	“ Is that likely ? ”
20029	20077	20025	20025	Moody	218	“ — the others keep flying , do n’t stop , do n’t break ranks . If they take out all of us and you survive , Harry , the rear guard are standing by to take over ; keep flying east and they ’ll join you . ”
20078	20098	20103	20103	she	225	“ Stop being so cheerful , Mad - Eye , he ’ll think we ’re not taking this seriously , ”
20120	20130	20132	20132	Moody	218	“ I ’m just telling the boy the plan , ”
20134	20152	20132	20132	Moody	218	“ Our job ’s to deliver him safely to headquarters and if we die in the attempt — ”

20259	20267	20269	20269	Lupin	221	“ Second signal , let ’s go ! ”
20409	20423	20425	20425	Moody	218	“ Hard left , hard left , there ’s a Muggle looking up ! ”
20446	20460	20433	20433	Harry	156	“ We need more height ... Give it another quarter of a mile ! ”
20589	20593	20595	20597	Mad - Eye	218	“ Bearing south ! ”
20599	20603	20595	20597	Mad - Eye	218	“ Town ahead ! ”
20623	20642	20644	20644	Moody	218	“ Bear southeast and keep climbing , there ’s some low cloud ahead we can lose ourselves in ! ”
20646	20654	20656	20656	Tonks	225	“ We ’re not going through clouds ! ”
20659	20669	20656	20656	Tonks	225	“ We ’ll get soaked , Mad - Eye ! ”
20812	20816	20818	20818	Moody	218	“ Turning southwest ! ”
20820	20828	20818	20818	Moody	218	“ We want to avoid the motorway ! ”
20934	20954	20955	20955	Moody	218	“ We ought to double back for a bit , just to make sure we ’re not being followed ! ”
20958	20967	20968	20968	Tonks	225	“ ARE YOU MAD , MAD - EYE ? ”
20974	21006	20968	20968	Tonks	225	“ We ’re all frozen to our brooms ! If we keep going off course we ’re not going to get there until next week ! We ’re nearly there now ! ”
21007	21014	21016	21016	Lupin	221	“ Time to start the descent ! ”
21020	21026	21016	21016	Lupin	221	“ Follow Tonks , Harry ! ”
21114	21119	21121	21121	Tonks	225	“ Here we go ! ”
21216	21221	21222	21222	Harry	156	“ Where are we ? ”
21230	21235	21226	21226	Lupin	221	“ In a minute . ”
21250	21254	21255	21255	he	218	“ Got it , ”
21322	21328	21330	21330	Moody	218	“ Borrowed it from Dumbledore , ”
21338	21361	21330	21330	Moody	218	“ That ’ll take care of any Muggles looking out of the window , see ? Now , come on , quick . ”
21451	21454	21455	21455	Moody	218	“ Here , ”

21543	21549	21551	21551	Moody	218	“ Not here , boy ! ”
21553	21560	21551	21551	Moody	218	“ Wait till we ’re inside ! ”
21630	21636	21603	21603	They	896	“ But where ’s — ? ”
21637	21646	21648	21648	Lupin	221	“ Think about what you ’ve just memorized , ”
21735	21741	21743	21743	Moody	218	“ Come on , hurry , ”
21827	21834	21835	21835	Lupin	221	“ Get in quick , Harry , ”
21838	21851	21835	21835	Lupin	221	“ But do n’t go far inside and do n’t touch anything . ”
21973	21976	21977	21977	He	218	“ Here — ”
22011	22029	22030	22030	Moody	218	“ Now stay still , everyone , while I give us a bit of light in here , ”
22199	22211	22212	22212	she	242	“ Oh , Harry , it ’s lovely to see you ! ”
22235	22261	22212	22212	she	242	“ You ’re looking peaky ; you need feeding up , but you ’ll have to wait a bit for dinner , I ’m afraid ... ”
22275	22286	22262	22262	She	242	“ He ’s just arrived , the meeting ’s started ... ”
22327	22374	22375	22375	she	242	“ No , Harry , the meeting ’s only for members of the Order . Ron and Hermione are upstairs , you can wait with them until the meeting ’s over and then we ’ll have dinner . And keep your voice down in the hall , ”
22382	22385	22321	22322	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Why ? ”
22386	22396	22321	22322	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ I do n’t want to wake anything up . ”
22397	22402	22321	22322	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ What d’you — ? ”
22403	22434	22321	22322	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ I ’ll explain later , I ’ve got to hurry , I ’m supposed to be at the meeting — I ’ll just show you where you ’re sleeping . ”
22565	22572	22534	22534	Harry	156	“ Mrs. Weasley , why — ? ”
22573	22590	22591	22592	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Ron and Hermione will explain everything , dear , I ’ve really got to dash , ”
22596	22598	22591	22592	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ There ”
22607	22625	22591	22592	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ you ’re the door on the right . I ’ll call you when it ’s over . ”
22736	22879	22721	22721	Ron	333	“ HARRY ! Ron , he ’s here , Harry ’s here ! We did n’t hear you arrive ! Oh , how are you ? Are you all right ? Have you been furious with us ? I bet you have , I know our letters were useless — but we could n’t tell you anything , Dumbledore made us swear we would n’t , oh , we ’ve got so much to tell you , and you ’ve got to tell us — the dementors ! When we heard — and that Ministry hearing — it ’s just outrageous , I ’ve looked it all up , they ca n’t expel you , they just ca n’t , there ’s provision in the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of magic in life - threatening situations — ”
22880	22887	22889	22889	Ron	333	“ Let him breathe , Hermione , ”
22979	22982	22949	22949	she	172	“ Hedwig ! ”
23000	23009	23011	23011	Ron	333	“ She ’s been in a right state , ”
23013	23030	23011	23011	Ron	333	“ Pecked us half to death when she brought your last letters , look at this — ”
23053	23057	23058	23058	Harry	156	“ Oh yeah , ”
23061	23074	23058	23058	Harry	156	“ Sorry about that , but I wanted answers , you know ... ”
23075	23086	23088	23088	Ron	333	“ We wanted to give them to you , mate , ”
23090	23120	23088	23088	Ron	333	“ Hermione was going spare , she kept saying you ’d do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own without news , but Dumbledore made us — ”
23121	23129	23131	23131	Harry	156	“ — swear not to tell me , ”
23133	23141	23131	23131	Harry	156	“ Yeah , Hermione ’s already said . ”
23217	23226	23228	23228	Hermione	172	“ He seemed to think it was best , ”
23232	23238	23228	23228	Hermione	172	“ Dumbledore , I mean . ”
23239	23242	23244	23244	Harry	156	“ Right , ”
23269	23281	23282	23282	Ron	333	“ I think he thought you were safest with the Muggles — ”
23285	23288	23290	23290	Harry	156	“ Yeah ? ”
23296	23308	23293	23293	his	156	“ Have either of you been attacked by dementors this summer ? ”
23309	23334	23335	23335	Harry	156	“ Well , no — but that ’s why he ’s had people from the Order of the Phoenix tailing you all the time — ”
23365	23377	23379	23379	Harry	156	“ Did n’t work that well , though , did it ? ”
23390	23403	23379	23379	Harry	156	“ Had to look after myself after all , did n’t I ? ”
23404	23410	23412	23412	Hermione	172	“ He was so angry , ”
23419	23443	23412	23412	Hermione	172	“ Dumbledore . We saw him . When he found out Mundungus had left before his shift had ended . He was scary . ”
23444	23453	23454	23454	Harry	156	“ Well , I ’m glad he left , ”
23458	23483	23454	23454	Harry	156	“ If he had n’t , I would n’t have done magic and Dumbledore would probably have left me at Privet Drive all summer . ”
23484	23500	23502	23502	Hermione	172	“ Are n’t you ... are n’t you worried about the Ministry of Magic hearing ? ”
23505	23508	23509	23509	Harry	156	“ No , ”
23583	23598	23599	23599	Harry	156	“ So why ’s Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark ? ”
23611	23624	23599	23599	Harry	156	“ Did you — er — bother to ask him at all ? ”
23659	23673	23675	23675	Ron	333	“ We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on , ”
23677	23731	23675	23675	Ron	333	“ We did , mate . But he ’s really busy now , we ’ve only seen him twice since we came here and he did n’t have much time , he just made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote , he said the owls might be intercepted — ”
23732	23745	23746	23746	Harry	156	“ He could still’ve kept me informed if he ’d wanted to , ”
23750	23767	23746	23746	Harry	156	“ You ’re not telling me he does n’t know ways to send messages without owls . ”
23776	23792	23771	23771	Ron	333	“ I thought that too . But he did n’t want you to know anything . ”
23793	23803	23805	23805	Harry	156	“ Maybe he thinks I ca n’t be trusted , ”
23811	23817	23819	23819	Ron	333	“ Do n’t be thick , ”
23825	23836	23771	23771	Ron	333	“ Or that I ca n’t take care of myself — ”
23837	23846	23848	23848	Hermione	172	“ Of course he does n’t think that ! ”
23851	23877	23879	23879	Harry	156	“ So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys ’ while you two get to join in everything that ’s going on here ? ”
23899	23915	23891	23891	his	156	“ How come you two are allowed to know everything that ’s going on — ? ”
23916	23921	23922	23922	Ron	333	“ We ’re not ! ”
23925	23942	23922	23922	Ron	333	“ Mum wo n’t let us near the meetings , she says we ’re too young — ”
23953	24027	23949	23949	Harry	156	“ SO YOU HAVEN’T BEEN IN THE MEETINGS , BIG DEAL ! YOU’VE STILL BEEN HERE , HAVEN’T YOU ? YOU’VE STILL BEEN TOGETHER ! ME , I’VE BEEN STUCK AT THE DURSLEYS ’ FOR A MONTH ! AND I’VE HANDLED MORE THAN YOU TWO’VE EVER MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE KNOWS IT — WHO SAVED THE SORCERER ’S STONE ? WHO GOT RID OF RIDDLE ? WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR SKINS FROM THE DEMENTORS ? ”
24119	24151	24107	24107	Pigwidgeon	243	“ WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING LAST YEAR ? WHO SAW HIM COME BACK ? WHO HAD TO ESCAPE FROM HIM ? ME ! ”
24183	24206	24152	24152	Ron	333	“ BUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHAT ’S GOING ON ? WHY SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER TO TELL ME WHAT ’S BEEN HAPPENING ? ”
24207	24220	24221	24221	Hermione	172	“ Harry , we wanted to tell you , we really did — ”
24224	24248	24152	24152	Ron	333	“ CAN’T’VE WANTED TO THAT MUCH , CAN YOU , OR YOU’D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL , BUT DUMBLEDORE MADE YOU SWEAR — ”
24249	24255	24152	24152	Ron	333	“ Well , he did — ”
24256	24282	24152	24152	Ron	333	“ FOUR WEEKS I’VE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE , NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT ’S BEEN GOING ON — ”
24283	24288	24152	24152	Ron	333	“ We wanted to — ”
24289	24308	24152	24152	Ron	333	“ I SUPPOSE YOU’VE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH , HAVEN’T YOU , ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER — ”
24309	24314	24152	24152	Ron	333	“ No , honest — ”
24315	24323	24325	24325	Hermione	172	“ Harry , we ’re really sorry ! ”
24335	24352	24325	24325	Hermione	172	“ You ’re absolutely right , Harry — I ’d be furious if it was me ! ”
24404	24411	24412	24412	he	156	“ What is this place anyway ? ”
24419	24428	24430	24430	Ron	333	“ Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix , ”
24434	24450	24430	24430	Ron	333	“ Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the Phoenix — ? ”
24451	24458	24460	24460	Hermione	172	“ It ’s a secret society , ”
24463	24488	24460	24460	Hermione	172	“ Dumbledore ’s in charge , he founded it . It ’s the people who fought against You - Know - Who last time . ”
24489	24495	24497	24497	Harry	156	“ Who ’s in it ? ”
24510	24516	24460	24460	Hermione	172	“ Quite a few people — ”
24517	24527	24529	24529	Ron	333	“ — we ’ve met about twenty of them , ”
24531	24539	24529	24529	Ron	333	“ but we think there are more ... ”
24545	24548	24549	24549	he	156	“ Well ? ”
24559	24562	24564	24564	Ron	333	“ Er , ”
24566	24570	24564	24564	Ron	333	“ Well what ? ”
24571	24574	24576	24576	Harry	156	“ Voldemort ! ”
24586	24609	24581	24581	Ron	333	“ What ’s happening ? What ’s he up to ? Where is he ? What are we doing to stop him ? ”
24610	24627	24629	24629	Hermione	172	“ We ’ve told you , the Order do n’t let us in on their meetings , ”
24632	24649	24650	24650	she	172	“ So we do n’t know the details — but we ’ve got a general idea — ”
24662	24673	24675	24675	Ron	333	“ Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears , see , ”
24677	24683	24675	24675	Ron	333	“ They ’re really useful . ”
24684	24688	24581	24581	Ron	333	“ Extendable — ? ”
24689	24764	24675	24675	Ron	333	“ Ears , yeah . Only we ’ve had to stop using them lately because Mum found out and went berserk . Fred and George had to hide them all to stop Mum binning them . But we got a good bit of use out of them before Mum realized what was going on . We know some of the Order are following known Death Eaters , keeping tabs on them , you know — ”
24765	24780	24782	24782	Hermione	172	“ — some of them are working on recruiting more people to the Order — ”
24784	24796	24798	24798	Ron	333	“ — and some of them are standing guard over something , ”
24800	24809	24798	24798	Ron	333	“ They ’re always talking about guard duty . ”
24810	24820	24822	24822	Harry	156	“ Could n’t have been me , could it ? ”
24825	24829	24831	24831	Ron	333	“ Oh yeah , ”
24858	24875	24876	24876	he	156	“ So what have you two been doing , if you ’re not allowed in meetings ? ”
24879	24887	24876	24876	he	156	“ You said you ’d been busy . ”
24888	24892	24894	24894	Hermione	172	“ We have , ”
24897	24946	24894	24894	Hermione	172	“ We ’ve been decontaminating this house , it ’s been empty for ages and stuff ’s been breeding in here . We ’ve managed to clean out the kitchen , most of the bedrooms , and I think we ’re doing the drawing room tomo — AARGH ! ”
24993	24998	24999	24999	Hermione	172	“ Stop doing that ! ”
25022	25027	25029	25029	George	245	“ Hello , Harry , ”
25035	25044	25029	25029	George	245	“ We thought we heard your dulcet tones . ”
25045	25065	25067	25067	Fred	244	“ You do n’t want to bottle up your anger like that , Harry , let it all out , ”
25072	25089	25067	25067	Fred	244	“ There might be a couple of people fifty miles away who did n’t hear you . ”
25090	25100	25102	25102	Harry	156	“ You two passed your Apparation tests , then ? ”
25105	25109	25111	25111	Fred	244	“ With distinction , ”
25130	25146	25148	25148	Ron	333	“ It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the stairs , ”
25150	25158	25160	25160	Fred	244	“ Time is Galleons , little brother , ”
25162	25176	25177	25177	he	244	“ Anyway , Harry , you ’re interfering with reception . Extendable Ears , ”
25203	25215	25177	25177	he	244	“ We ’re trying to hear what ’s going on downstairs . ”
25216	25223	25225	25225	Ron	333	“ You want to be careful , ”
25232	25241	25225	25225	Ron	333	“ If Mum sees one of them again ... ”
25242	25258	25260	25260	Fred	244	“ It ’s worth the risk , that ’s a major meeting they ’re having , ”
25274	25280	25287	25287	Ginny	247	“ Oh hello , Harry ! ”
25291	25299	25287	25287	Ginny	247	“ I thought I heard your voice . ”
25308	25331	25305	25305	she	247	“ It ’s no go with the Extendable Ears , she ’s gone and put an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen door . ”
25332	25337	25339	25339	George	245	“ How d’you know ? ”
25344	25353	25355	25355	Ginny	247	“ Tonks told me how to find out , ”
25357	25416	25355	25355	Ginny	247	“ You just chuck stuff at the door and if it ca n’t make contact the door ’s been Imperturbed . I ’ve been flicking Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they just soar away from it , so there ’s no way the Extendable Ears will be able to get under the gap . ”
25423	25439	25417	25417	Fred	244	“ Shame . I really fancied finding out what old Snape ’s been up to . ”
25440	25443	25445	25445	Harry	156	“ Snape ? ”
25448	25453	25445	25445	Harry	156	“ Is he here ? ”
25454	25457	25459	25459	George	245	“ Yeah , ”
25479	25487	25476	25476	Ginny	247	“ Giving a report . Top secret . ”
25488	25491	25493	25493	Fred	244	“ Git , ”
25496	25504	25506	25506	Hermione	172	“ He ’s on our side now , ”
25512	25532	25509	25509	Ron	333	“ Does n’t stop him being a git . The way he looks at us when he sees us ... ”
25533	25541	25543	25543	Ginny	247	“ Bill does n’t like him either , ”
25585	25590	25591	25591	he	156	“ Is Bill here ? ”
25594	25603	25591	25591	he	156	“ I thought he was working in Egypt . ”
25604	25622	25624	25624	Fred	244	“ He applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the Order , ”
25626	25636	25637	25637	he	244	“ He says he misses the tombs , but , ”
25640	25645	25637	25637	he	244	“ there are compensations ... ”
25646	25651	25591	25591	he	156	“ What d’you mean ? ”
25652	25658	25660	25660	George	245	“ Remember old Fleur Delacour ? ”
25662	25676	25660	25660	George	245	“ She ’s got a job at Gringotts to eemprove ’ er Eeenglish — ”
25677	25691	25693	25693	Fred	244	“ — and Bill ’s been giving her a lot of private lessons , ”
25695	25703	25705	25705	George	245	“ Charlie ’s in the Order too , ”
25707	25738	25705	25705	George	245	“ but he ’s still in Romania , Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible , so Charlie ’s trying to make contacts on his days off . ”
25739	25746	25747	25747	Harry	156	“ Could n’t Percy do that ? ”
25788	25804	25805	25805	Ron	333	“ Whatever you do , do n’t mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad , ”
25813	25817	25805	25805	Ron	333	“ Why not ? ”
25818	25839	25840	25840	Fred	244	“ Because every time Percy ’s name ’s mentioned , Dad breaks whatever he ’s holding and Mum starts crying , ”
25843	25849	25851	25851	Ginny	247	“ It ’s been awful , ”
25854	25864	25866	25866	George	245	“ I think we ’re well shut of him , ”
25876	25881	25882	25882	Harry	156	“ What ’s happened ? ”
25885	25893	25895	25895	Fred	244	“ Percy and Dad had a row , ”
25897	25916	25895	25895	Fred	244	“ I ’ve never seen Dad row with anyone like that . It ’s normally Mum who shouts ... ”
25917	25928	25930	25930	Ron	333	“ It was the first week back after term ended , ”
25932	25954	25930	25930	Ron	333	“ We were about to come and join the Order . Percy came home and told us he ’d been promoted . ”
25955	25960	25962	25962	Harry	156	“ You ’re kidding ? ”
26037	26045	26047	26047	George	245	“ Yeah , we were all surprised , ”
26049	26103	26047	26047	George	245	“ because Percy got into a load of trouble about Crouch , there was an inquiry and everything . They said Percy ought to have realized Crouch was off his rocker and informed a superior . But you know Percy , Crouch left him in charge , he was n’t going to complain ... ”
26104	26112	26026	26026	they	2855	“ So how come they promoted him ? ”
26113	26121	26123	26123	Ron	333	“ That ’s exactly what we wondered , ”
26141	26206	26123	26123	Ron	333	“ He came home really pleased with himself — even more pleased than usual if you can imagine that — and told Dad he ’d been offered a position in Fudge ’s own office . A really good one for someone only a year out of Hogwarts — Junior Assistant to the Minister . He expected Dad to be all impressed , I think . ”
26207	26213	26215	26215	Fred	244	“ Only Dad was n’t , ”
26218	26222	26224	26224	Harry	156	“ Why not ? ”
26226	26247	26249	26249	George	245	“ Well , apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry checking that nobody ’s having any contact with Dumbledore , ”
26251	26265	26267	26267	Fred	244	“ Dumbledore ’s name ’s mud with the Ministry these days , see , ”
26269	26287	26267	26267	Fred	244	“ They all think he ’s just making trouble saying You - Know - Who ’s back . ”
26288	26310	26312	26312	George	245	“ Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who ’s in league with Dumbledore can clear out their desks , ”
26314	26348	26267	26267	Fred	244	“ Trouble is , Fudge suspects Dad , he knows he ’s friendly with Dumbledore , and he ’s always thought Dad ’s a bit of a weirdo because of his Muggle obsession — ”
26349	26360	26362	26362	Harry	156	“ But what ’s this got to do with Percy ? ”
26366	26397	26267	26267	Fred	244	“ I ’m coming to that . Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in his office because he wants to use him to spy on the family — and Dumbledore . ”
26405	26411	26398	26398	Harry	156	“ Bet Percy loved that . ”
26421	26487	26412	26412	Ron	333	“ He went completely berserk . He said — well , he said loads of terrible stuff . He said he ’s been having to struggle against Dad ’s lousy reputation ever since he joined the Ministry and that Dad ’s got no ambition and that ’s why we ’ve always been — you know — not had a lot of money , I mean — ”
26488	26491	26493	26493	Harry	156	“ What ? ”
26507	26511	26513	26513	Ron	333	“ I know , ”
26519	26621	26513	26513	Ron	333	“ And it got worse . He said Dad was an idiot to run around with Dumbledore , that Dumbledore was heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him , and that he — Percy — knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the Ministry . And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the Ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he did n’t belong to our family anymore . And he packed his bags the same night and left . He ’s living here in London now . ”
26653	26662	26664	26664	Ron	333	“ Mum ’s been in a right state , ”
26666	26712	26664	26664	Ron	333	“ You know — crying and stuff . She came up to London to try and talk to Percy but he slammed the door in her face . I dunno what he does if he meets Dad at work — ignores him , I s’pose . ”
26713	26722	26724	26724	Harry	156	“ But Percy must know Voldemort ’s back , ”
26727	26747	26724	26724	Harry	156	“ He ’s not stupid , he must know your mum and dad would n’t risk everything without proof — ”
26748	26761	26763	26763	Ron	333	“ Yeah , well , your name got dragged into the row , ”
26771	26794	26763	26763	Ron	333	“ Percy said the only evidence was your word and ... I dunno ... he did n’t think it was good enough . ”
26795	26803	26805	26805	Hermione	172	“ Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously , ”
26814	26821	26822	26822	Harry	156	“ What are you talking about ? ”
26838	26851	26852	26852	Hermione	172	“ Have n’t — have n’t you been getting the Daily Prophet ? ”
26856	26862	26864	26864	Harry	156	“ Yeah , I have ! ”
26866	26877	26878	26878	Hermione	172	“ Have you — er — been reading it thoroughly ? ”
26884	26890	26892	26892	Harry	156	“ Not cover to cover , ”
26895	26915	26892	26892	Harry	156	“ If they were going to report anything about Voldemort it would be headline news , would n’t it ! ”
26930	26962	26926	26926	Hermione	172	“ Well , you ’d need to read it cover to cover to pick it up , but they — um — they mention you a couple of times a week . ”
26963	26970	26926	26926	Hermione	172	“ But I ’d have seen — ”
26971	26987	26992	26992	her	172	“ Not if you ’ve only been reading the front page , you would n’t , ”
26995	27017	26992	26992	her	172	“ I ’m not talking about big articles . They just slip you in , like you ’re a standing joke . ”
27018	27023	26926	26926	Hermione	172	“ What d’you — ? ”
27024	27032	27034	27034	Hermione	172	“ It ’s quite nasty , actually , ”
27042	27052	27034	27034	Hermione	172	“ They ’re just building on Rita ’s stuff . ”
27053	27066	26926	26926	Hermione	172	“ But she ’s not writing for them anymore , is she ? ”
27067	27085	27086	27086	Hermione	172	“ Oh no , she ’s kept her promise — not that she ’s got any choice , ”
27091	27106	27086	27086	Hermione	172	“ But she laid the foundation for what they ’re trying to do now . ”
27107	27112	27114	27114	Harry	156	“ Which is what ? ”
27117	27142	26926	26926	Hermione	172	“ Okay , you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying your scar was hurting and all that ? ”
27143	27146	27148	27148	Harry	156	“ Yeah , ”
27166	27196	27198	27198	Hermione	172	“ Well , they ’re writing about you as though you ’re this deluded , attention - seeking person who thinks he ’s a great tragic hero or something , ”
27218	27282	27198	27198	Hermione	172	“ They keep slipping in snide comments about you . If some far - fetched story appears they say something like ‘ a tale worthy of Harry Potter ’ and if anyone has a funny accident or anything it ’s ‘ let ’s hope he has n’t got a scar on his forehead or we ’ll be asked to worship him next — ’ ”
27283	27292	27293	27293	Harry	156	“ I do n’t want anyone to worship — ”
27297	27304	27306	27306	Hermione	172	“ I know you do n’t , ”
27312	27386	27306	27306	Hermione	172	“ I know , Harry . But you see what they ’re doing ? They want to turn you into someone nobody will believe . Fudge is behind it , I ’ll bet anything . They want wizards on the street to think you ’re just some stupid boy who ’s a bit of a joke , who tells ridiculous tall stories because he loves being famous and wants to keep it going . ”
27387	27403	27404	27404	Harry	156	“ I did n’t ask — I did n’t want — Voldemort killed my parents ! ”
27407	27441	27404	27404	Harry	156	“ I got famous because he murdered my family but could n’t kill me ! Who wants to be famous for that ? Do n’t they think I ’d rather it ’d never — ”
27442	27448	27450	27450	Ginny	247	“ We know , Harry , ”
27453	27470	27472	27472	Hermione	172	“ And of course , they did n’t report a word about the dementors attacking you , ”
27474	27569	27570	27570	she	172	“ Someone ’s told them to keep that quiet . That should ’ve been a really big story , out - of - control dementors . They have n’t even reported that you broke the International Statute of Secrecy — we thought they would , it would tie in so well with this image of you as some stupid show - off — we think they ’re biding their time until you ’re expelled , then they ’re really going to go to town — I mean , if you ’re expelled , obviously , ”
27575	27598	27570	27570	she	172	“ you really should n’t be , not if they abide by their own laws , there ’s no case against you . ”
27642	27647	27648	27648	Fred	244	“ Uh - oh . ”
27679	27715	27671	27672	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ The meeting ’s over , you can come down and have dinner now , everyone ’s dying to see you , Harry . And who ’s left all those Dungbombs outside the kitchen door ? ”
27716	27719	27721	27721	Ginny	247	“ Crookshanks , ”
27724	27731	27721	27721	Ginny	247	“ He loves playing with them . ”
27732	27735	27737	27738	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Oh , ”
27740	27792	27737	27738	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ I thought it might have been Kreacher , he keeps doing odd things like that . Now do n’t forget to keep your voices down in the hall . Ginny , your hands are filthy , what have you been doing ? Go and wash them before dinner , please ... ”
27854	27857	27858	27858	he	156	“ Look ... ”
27872	27903	27862	27862	Ron	333	“ We knew you ’d be angry , Harry , we really do n’t blame you , but you ’ve got to understand , we did try and persuade Dumbledore — ”
27904	27910	27912	27912	Harry	156	“ Yeah , I know , ”
27942	27947	27948	27948	he	156	“ Who ’s Kreacher ? ”
27951	27960	27962	27962	Ron	333	“ The house - elf who lives here , ”
27964	27973	27962	27962	Ron	333	“ Nutter . Never met one like him . ”
27979	27988	27974	27974	Hermione	172	“ He ’s not a nutter , Ron — ”
27989	28012	28014	28014	Ron	333	“ His life ’s ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a plaque just like his mother , ”
28017	28024	28014	28014	Ron	333	“ Is that normal , Hermione ? ”
28025	28043	27974	27974	Hermione	172	“ Well — well , if he is a bit strange , it ’s not his fault — ”
28051	28061	28046	28046	his	333	“ Hermione still has n’t given up on spew — ”
28062	28070	28072	28072	Hermione	172	“ It ’s not ‘ spew ’ ! ”
28075	28104	28072	28072	Hermione	172	“ It ’s the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare , and it ’s not just me , Dumbledore says we should be kind to Kreacher too — ”
28105	28110	28112	28112	Ron	333	“ Yeah , yeah , ”
28114	28122	28112	28112	Ron	333	“ C’m on , I ’m starving . ”
28144	28148	28149	28149	Ron	333	“ Hold it ! ”
28165	28181	28149	28149	Ron	333	“ They ’re still in the hall , we might be able to hear something — ”
28329	28332	28335	28335	Fred	244	“ Dammit , ”
28358	28364	28365	28365	Ron	333	“ Snape never eats here , ”
28370	28377	28365	28365	Ron	333	“ Thank God . C’m on . ”
28378	28394	28395	28395	Hermione	172	“ And do n’t forget to keep your voice down in the hall , Harry , ”
28439	28448	28449	28450	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ We ’re eating down in the kitchen , ”
28462	28483	28449	28450	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Harry , dear , if you ’ll just tiptoe across the hall , it ’s through this door here — ”
28486	28489	28491	28492	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Tonks ! ”
28501	28506	28508	28508	Tonks	225	“ I ’m sorry ! ”
28518	28536	28508	28508	Tonks	225	“ It ’s that stupid umbrella stand , that ’s the second time I ’ve tripped over — ”
28744	28780	28726	28726	she	981	“ Filth ! Scum ! By - products of dirt and vileness ! Half - breeds , mutants , freaks , begone from this place ! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers — ”
28847	28859	28860	28860	he	987	“ Shut up , you horrible old hag , shut UP ! ”
28878	28881	28882	28882	she	981	“ Yoooou ! ”
28895	28906	28882	28882	she	981	“ Blood traitor , abomination , shame of my flesh ! ”
28907	28915	28917	28918	the man	989	“ I said — shut — UP ! ”
28972	28977	28978	28978	he	174	“ Hello , Harry , ”
28982	28991	28978	28978	he	174	“ I see you ’ve met my mother . ”
28992	28996	28952	28952	his	989	“ Your — ? ”
28997	29005	29007	29007	Sirius	174	“ My dear old mum , yeah , ”
29009	29051	29007	29007	Sirius	174	“ We ’ve been trying to get her down for a month but we think she put a Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of the canvas . Let ’s get downstairs , quick , before they all wake up again . ”
29052	29064	29065	29065	Harry	156	“ But what ’s a portrait of your mother doing here ? ”
29097	29111	29113	29113	Sirius	174	“ Has n’t anyone told you ? This was my parents ’ house , ”
29115	29150	29113	29113	Sirius	174	“ But I ’m the last Black left , so it ’s mine now . I offered it to Dumbledore for headquarters — about the only useful thing I ’ve been able to do . ”
29360	29363	29364	29365	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Harry ! ”
29379	29385	29364	29365	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Good to see you ! ”
29415	29422	29423	29423	Bill	250	“ Journey all right , Harry ? ”
29435	29449	29423	29423	Bill	250	“ Mad - Eye did n’t make you come via Greenland , then ? ”
29450	29454	29456	29456	Tonks	225	“ He tried , ”
29476	29482	29456	29456	Tonks	225	“ Oh no — sorry — ”
29483	29488	29490	29491	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Here , dear , ”
29558	29575	29576	29576	she	242	“ This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings , ”
29600	29603	29593	29593	Bill	250	“ Evanesco ! ”
29609	29615	29617	29617	Sirius	174	“ Sit down , Harry , ”
29619	29629	29617	29617	Sirius	174	“ You ’ve met Mundungus , have n’t you ? ”
29652	29659	29660	29660	Mundungus	190	“ Some’n say m ’ name ? ”
29664	29671	29660	29660	Mundungus	190	“ I ’ gree with Sirius ... ”
29695	29703	29705	29705	Sirius	174	“ The meeting ’s over , Dung , ”
29718	29723	29705	29705	Sirius	174	“ Harry ’s arrived . ”
29724	29727	29729	29729	Mundungus	190	“ Eh ? ”
29741	29759	29729	29729	Mundungus	190	“ Blimey , so ’ e ’ as . Yeah ... you all right , ’ arry ? ”
29760	29763	29765	29765	Harry	156	“ Yeah , ”
29822	29829	29800	29800	his	190	“ Owe you a ’ pology , ”
29841	29849	29851	29852	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ For the last time , Mundungus , ”
29854	29875	29851	29852	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ will you please not smoke that thing in the kitchen , especially not when we ’re about to eat ! ”
29876	29879	29881	29881	Mundungus	190	“ Ah , ”
29883	29890	29881	29881	Mundungus	190	“ Right . Sorry , Molly . ”
29915	29929	29930	29931	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ And if you want dinner before midnight I ’ll need a hand , ”
29939	29959	29930	29931	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ No , you can stay where you are , Harry dear , you ’ve had a long journey — ”
29960	29968	29970	29970	Tonks	225	“ What can I do , Molly ? ”
29983	30007	29976	29977	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Er — no , it ’s all right , Tonks , you have a rest too , you ’ve done enough today — ”
30008	30018	30020	30020	Tonks	225	“ No , no , I want to help ! ”
30106	30112	30113	30113	he	156	“ Seen old Figgy since ? ”
30116	30119	30121	30121	Harry	156	“ No , ”
30123	30130	30121	30121	Harry	156	“ I have n’t seen anyone . ”
30131	30141	30143	30143	Mundungus	190	“ See , I would n’t ’ ave left , ”
30155	30164	30152	30152	his	190	“ but I ’ ad a business opportunity — ”
30229	30237	30210	30210	Sirius	174	“ Had a good summer so far ? ”
30238	30246	30248	30248	Harry	156	“ No , it ’s been lousy , ”
30265	30277	30210	30210	Sirius	174	“ Do n’t know what you ’re complaining about , myself . ”
30278	30281	30283	30283	Harry	156	“ What ? ”
30286	30349	30210	30210	Sirius	174	“ Personally , I ’d have welcomed a dementor attack . A deadly struggle for my soul would have broken the monotony nicely . You think you ’ve had it bad , at least you ’ve been able to get out and about , stretch your legs , get into a few fights ... I ’ve been stuck inside for a month . ”
30350	30354	30356	30356	Harry	156	“ How come ? ”
30360	30416	30210	30210	Sirius	174	“ Because the Ministry of Magic ’s still after me , and Voldemort will know all about me being an Animagus by now , Wormtail will have told him , so my big disguise is useless . There ’s not much I can do for the Order of the Phoenix ... or so Dumbledore feels . ”
30459	30471	30472	30472	he	156	“ At least you ’ve known what ’s been going on , ”
30476	30480	30482	30482	Sirius	174	“ Oh yeah , ”
30485	30529	30482	30482	Sirius	174	“ Listening to Snape ’s reports , having to take all his snide hints that he ’s out there risking his life while I ’m sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time ... asking me how the cleaning ’s going — ”
30530	30534	30536	30536	Harry	156	“ What cleaning ? ”
30538	30549	30551	30551	Sirius	174	“ Trying to make this place fit for human habitation , ”
30561	30602	30551	30551	Sirius	174	“ No one ’s lived here for ten years , not since my dear mother died , unless you count her old house - elf , and he ’s gone round the twist , has n’t cleaned anything in ages — ”
30603	30606	30608	30608	Mundungus	190	“ Sirius ? ”
30632	30639	30608	30608	Mundungus	190	“ This solid silver , mate ? ”
30640	30643	30645	30645	Sirius	174	“ Yes , ”
30652	30669	30645	30645	Sirius	174	“ Finest fifteenth - century goblin - wrought silver , embossed with the Black family crest . ”
30670	30678	30680	30680	Mundungus	190	“ That ’d come off , though , ”
30688	30699	30700	30701	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Fred — George — NO , JUST CARRY THEM ! ”
30830	30836	30838	30839	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ FOR HEAVEN ’S SAKE ! ”
30841	30853	30855	30855	Fred	244	“ We were just trying to save a bit of time ! ”
30869	30880	30855	30855	Fred	244	“ Sorry Sirius , mate — did n’t mean to — ”
30931	30934	30935	30936	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Boys , ”
30950	30972	30935	30936	Mr. Weasley	199	“ your mother ’s right , you ’re supposed to show a sense of responsibility now you ’ve come of age — ”
30973	30985	30986	30987	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ — none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble ! ”
31009	31032	30986	30987	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Bill did n’t feel the need to Apparate every few feet ! Charlie did n’t Charm everything he met ! Percy — ”
31054	31059	31061	31061	Bill	250	“ Let ’s eat , ”
31064	31071	31073	31073	Lupin	221	“ It looks wonderful , Molly , ”
31126	31184	31118	31119	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ I ’ve been meaning to tell you , there ’s something trapped in that writing desk in the drawing room , it keeps rattling and shaking . Of course , it could just be a boggart , but I thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at it before we let it out . ”
31185	31190	31192	31192	Sirius	174	“ Whatever you like , ”
31195	31206	31207	31208	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ The curtains in there are full of doxies too , ”
31212	31223	31207	31208	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ I thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow . ”
31224	31231	31233	31233	Sirius	174	“ I look forward to it , ”
31341	31352	31334	31334	Ginny	247	“ Do that one like a pig snout , Tonks ... ”
31394	31403	31405	31405	Bill	250	“ They ’re not giving anything away yet , ”
31407	31441	31405	31405	Bill	250	“ I still ca n’t work out whether they believe he ’s back or not . ’ Course , they might prefer not to take sides at all . Keep out of it . ”
31442	31458	31460	31461	Mr. Weasley	199	“ I ’m sure they ’d never go over to You - Know - Who , ”
31467	31487	31464	31464	his	199	“ They ’ve suffered losses too . Remember that goblin family he murdered last time , somewhere near Nottingham ? ”
31488	31498	31500	31500	Lupin	221	“ I think it depends what they ’re offered , ”
31502	31542	31500	31500	Lupin	221	“ And I ’m not talking about gold ; if they ’re offered freedoms we ’ve been denying them for centuries they ’re going to be tempted . Have you still not had any luck with Ragnok , Bill ? ”
31543	31555	31557	31557	Bill	250	“ He ’s feeling pretty anti - wizard at the moment , ”
31559	31592	31557	31557	Bill	250	“ He has n’t stopped raging about the Bagman business , he reckons the Ministry did a cover - up , those goblins never got their gold from him , you know — ”
31626	31631	31633	31633	Mundungus	190	“ ... and then , ”
31641	31747	31633	31633	Mundungus	190	“ and then , if you ’ll believe it , ’ e says to me , ’ e says , ‘ ’ ere , Dung , where didja get all them toads from ? ’Cos some son of a Bludger ’s gone and nicked all mine ! ’ And I says , ‘ Nicked all your toads , Will , what next ? So you ’ll be wanting some more , then ? ’ And if you ’ll believe me , lads , the gormless gargoyle buys all ’ is own toads back orf me for twice what ’ e paid in the first place — ”
31748	31771	31773	31774	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ I do n’t think we need to hear any more of your business dealings , thank you very much , Mundungus , ”
31789	31795	31797	31797	Mundungus	190	“ Beg pardon , Molly , ”
31809	31834	31797	31797	Mundungus	190	“ But , you know , Will nicked ’em orf Warty Harris in the first place so I was n’t really doing nothing wrong — ”
31835	31861	31863	31864	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ I do n’t know where you learned about right and wrong , Mundungus , but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons , ”
31919	31927	31929	31929	Sirius	174	“ Molly does n’t approve of Mundungus , ”
31934	31943	31944	31944	Harry	156	“ How come he ’s in the Order ? ”
31949	31954	31955	31955	Sirius	174	“ He ’s useful , ”
31958	32043	31955	31955	Sirius	174	“ Knows all the crooks — well , he would , seeing as he ’s one himself . But he ’s also very loyal to Dumbledore , who helped him out of a tight spot once . It pays to have someone like Dung around , he hears things we do n’t . But Molly thinks inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far . She has n’t forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you . ”
32148	32157	32159	32160	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Nearly time for bed , I think , ”
32165	32172	32174	32174	Sirius	174	“ Not just yet , Molly , ”
32188	32219	32174	32174	Sirius	174	“ You know , I ’m surprised at you . I thought the first thing you ’d do when you got here would be to start asking questions about Voldemort . ”
32290	32294	32296	32296	Harry	156	“ I did ! ”
32299	32318	32296	32296	Harry	156	“ I asked Ron and Hermione but they said we ’re not allowed in the Order , so — ”
32319	32326	32328	32329	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ And they ’re quite right , ”
32331	32337	32328	32329	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ You ’re too young . ”
32360	32378	32380	32380	Sirius	174	“ Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to ask questions ? ”
32382	32407	32380	32380	Sirius	174	“ Harry ’s been trapped in that Muggle house for a month . He ’s got the right to know what ’s been happen — ”
32408	32412	32414	32414	George	245	“ Hang on ! ”
32417	32426	32428	32428	Fred	244	“ How come Harry gets his questions answered ? ”
32431	32456	32458	32458	George	245	“ We ’ve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you have n’t told us a single stinking thing ! ”
32460	32475	32477	32477	Fred	244	“ ‘ You ’re too young , you ’re not in the Order , ’ ”
32493	32501	32477	32477	Fred	244	“ Harry ’s not even of age ! ”
32502	32519	32521	32521	Sirius	174	“ It ’s not my fault you have n’t been told what the Order ’s doing , ”
32524	32539	32521	32521	Sirius	174	“ That ’s your parents ’ decision . Harry , on the other hand — ”
32540	32555	32557	32558	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ It ’s not down to you to decide what ’s good for Harry ! ”
32568	32580	32561	32561	Her	242	“ You have n’t forgotten what Dumbledore said , I suppose ? ”
32581	32585	32586	32586	Sirius	174	“ Which bit ? ”
32602	32616	32618	32619	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ The bit about not telling Harry more than he needs to know , ”
32682	32699	32701	32701	Sirius	174	“ I do n’t intend to tell him more than he needs to know , Molly , ”
32703	32715	32701	32701	Sirius	174	“ But as he was the one who saw Voldemort come back ”
32732	32741	32701	32701	Sirius	174	“ he has more right than most to — ”
32742	32755	32757	32758	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ He ’s not a member of the Order of the Phoenix ! ”
32760	32767	32757	32758	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ He ’s only fifteen and — ”
32768	32783	32785	32785	Sirius	174	“ — and he ’s dealt with as much as most in the Order , ”
32787	32793	32785	32785	Sirius	174	“ and more than some — ”
32794	32804	32806	32807	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ No one ’s denying what he ’s done ! ”
32823	32829	32809	32809	her	242	“ But he ’s still — ”
32830	32837	32839	32839	Sirius	174	“ He ’s not a child ! ”
32842	32850	32852	32853	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ He ’s not an adult either ! ”
32862	32870	32852	32853	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ He ’s not James , Sirius ! ”
32871	32884	32886	32886	Sirius	174	“ I ’m perfectly clear who he is , thanks , Molly , ”
32889	32897	32899	32900	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ I ’m not sure you are ! ”
32902	32926	32899	32900	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Sometimes , the way you talk about him , it ’s as though you think you ’ve got your best friend back ! ”
32927	32934	32936	32936	Harry	156	“ What ’s wrong with that ? ”
32938	32961	32963	32964	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ What ’s wrong , Harry , is that you are not your father , however much you might look like him ! ”
32973	32989	32966	32966	her	242	“ You are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it ! ”
32990	32998	33000	33000	Sirius	174	“ Meaning I ’m an irresponsible godfather ? ”
33006	33031	33002	33002	his	174	“ Meaning you ’ve been known to act rashly , Sirius , which is why Dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and — ”
33032	33048	33050	33050	Sirius	174	“ We ’ll leave my instructions from Dumbledore out of this , if you please ! ”
33053	33056	33058	33059	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Arthur ! ”
33066	33073	33058	33059	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Arthur , back me up ! ”
33115	33147	33112	33112	he	199	“ Dumbledore knows the position has changed , Molly . He accepts that Harry will have to be filled in to a certain extent now that he is staying at headquarters — ”
33148	33167	33112	33112	he	199	“ Yes , but there ’s a difference between that and inviting him to ask whatever he likes ! ”
33168	33171	33173	33173	Lupin	221	“ Personally , ”
33202	33237	33194	33194	she	242	“ I think it better that Harry gets the facts — not all the facts , Molly , but the general picture — from us , rather than a garbled version from ... others . ”
33265	33268	33270	33271	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Well , ”
33287	33335	33270	33271	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ well ... I can see I ’m going to be overruled . I ’ll just say this : Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much , and speaking as someone who has got Harry ’s best interests at heart — ”
33336	33343	33345	33345	Sirius	174	“ He ’s not your son , ”
33348	33355	33357	33358	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ He ’s as good as , ”
33361	33368	33357	33358	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Who else has he got ? ”
33369	33375	33270	33271	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ He ’s got me ! ”
33376	33379	33381	33382	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Yes , ”
33388	33417	33384	33384	her	242	“ The thing is , it ’s been rather difficult for you to look after him while you ’ve been locked up in Azkaban , has n’t it ? ”
33426	33443	33445	33445	Lupin	221	“ Molly , you ’re not the only person at this table who cares about Harry , ”
33448	33454	33445	33445	Lupin	221	“ Sirius , sit down . ”
33475	33488	33489	33489	Lupin	221	“ I think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this , ”
33492	33502	33489	33489	Lupin	221	“ He ’s old enough to decide for himself . ”
33503	33514	33515	33515	Harry	156	“ I want to know what ’s been going on , ”
33565	33569	33574	33574	her	242	“ Very well , ”
33578	33599	33574	33574	her	242	“ Ginny — Ron — Hermione — Fred — George — I want you out of this kitchen , now . ”
33605	33611	33612	33612	Fred	244	“ We ’re of age ! ”
33618	33629	33631	33631	Ron	333	“ If Harry ’s allowed , why ca n’t I ? ”
33633	33640	33642	33642	Ginny	247	“ Mum , I want to ! ”
33644	33647	33649	33650	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ NO ! ”
33659	33664	33655	33655	her	242	“ I absolutely forbid — ”
33665	33676	33678	33679	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Molly , you ca n’t stop Fred and George , ”
33682	33688	33678	33679	Mr. Weasley	199	“ They are of age — ”
33689	33696	33655	33655	her	242	“ They ’re still at school — ”
33697	33705	33707	33708	Mr. Weasley	199	“ But they ’re legally adults now , ”
33724	33742	33715	33716	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ I — oh , all right then , Fred and George can stay , but Ron — ”
33743	33754	33756	33756	Ron	333	“ Harry’ll tell me and Hermione everything you say anyway ! ”
33759	33767	33768	33768	he	333	“ Wo n’t — wo n’t you ? ”
33827	33833	33834	33834	Harry	156	“ ’ Course I will , ”
33842	33845	33847	33848	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Fine ! ”
33850	33857	33847	33848	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Fine ! Ginny — BED ! ”
33935	33947	33932	33932	Sirius	174	“ Okay , Harry ... what do you want to know ? ”
33966	33986	33987	33987	he	156	“ Where ’s Voldemort ? What ’s he doing ? I ’ve been trying to watch the Muggle news , ”
34000	34019	33987	33987	he	156	“ and there has n’t been anything that looks like him yet , no funny deaths or anything — ”
34020	34033	34035	34035	Sirius	174	“ That ’s because there have n’t been any suspicious deaths yet , ”
34037	34054	34035	34035	Sirius	174	“ not as far as we know , anyway ... And we know quite a lot . ”
34055	34064	34066	34066	Lupin	221	“ More than he thinks we do anyway , ”
34068	34077	34078	34078	Harry	156	“ How come he ’s stopped killing people ? ”
34096	34111	34113	34113	Sirius	174	“ Because he does n’t want to draw attention to himself at the moment , ”
34115	34145	34113	34113	Sirius	174	“ It would be dangerous for him . His comeback did n’t come off quite the way he wanted it to , you see . He messed it up . ”
34146	34157	34159	34159	Lupin	221	“ Or rather , you messed it up for him , ”
34165	34168	34169	34169	Harry	156	“ How ? ”
34173	34181	34183	34183	Sirius	174	“ You were n’t supposed to survive ! ”
34185	34208	34183	34183	Sirius	174	“ Nobody apart from his Death Eaters was supposed to know he ’d come back . But you survived to bear witness . ”
34209	34229	34231	34231	Lupin	221	“ And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was Dumbledore , ”
34233	34243	34231	34231	Lupin	221	“ And you made sure Dumbledore knew at once . ”
34244	34250	34251	34251	Harry	156	“ How has that helped ? ”
34254	34259	34261	34261	Bill	250	“ Are you kidding ? ”
34264	34280	34261	34261	Bill	250	“ Dumbledore was the only one You - Know - Who was ever scared of ! ”
34281	34303	34305	34305	Sirius	174	“ Thanks to you , Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the Phoenix about an hour after Voldemort returned , ”
34307	34316	34318	34318	Harry	156	“ So what ’s the Order been doing ? ”
34326	34344	34346	34346	Sirius	174	“ Working as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort ca n’t carry out his plans , ”
34348	34357	34358	34358	Harry	156	“ How d’you know what his plans are ? ”
34362	34370	34372	34372	Lupin	221	“ Dumbledore ’s got a shrewd idea , ”
34374	34387	34372	34372	Lupin	221	“ and Dumbledore ’s shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate . ”
34388	34398	34415	34415	Sirius	174	“ So what does Dumbledore reckon he ’s planning ? ”
34399	34413	34415	34415	Sirius	174	“ Well , firstly , he wants to build up his army again , ”
34417	34496	34415	34415	Sirius	174	“ In the old days he had huge numbers at his command ; witches and wizards he ’d bullied or bewitched into following him , his faithful Death Eaters , a great variety of Dark creatures . You heard him planning to recruit the giants ; well , they ’ll be just one group he ’s after . He ’s certainly not going to try and take on the Ministry of Magic with only a dozen Death Eaters . ”
34497	34509	34415	34415	Sirius	174	“ So you ’re trying to stop him getting more followers ? ”
34510	34517	34519	34519	Lupin	221	“ We ’re doing our best , ”
34521	34524	34415	34415	Sirius	174	“ How ? ”
34525	34558	34560	34560	Bill	250	“ Well , the main thing is to try and convince as many people as possible that You - Know - Who really has returned , to put them on their guard , ”
34562	34570	34560	34560	Bill	250	“ It ’s proving tricky , though . ”
34571	34574	34415	34415	Sirius	174	“ Why ? ”
34575	34583	34585	34585	Tonks	225	“ Because of the Ministry ’s attitude , ”
34587	34624	34585	34585	Tonks	225	“ You saw Cornelius Fudge after You - Know - Who came back , Harry . Well , he has n’t shifted his position at all . He ’s absolutely refusing to believe it ’s happened . ”
34625	34629	34631	34631	Harry	156	“ But why ? ”
34634	34645	34631	34631	Harry	156	“ Why ’s he being so stupid ? If Dumbledore — ”
34646	34660	34662	34663	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Ah , well , you ’ve put your finger on the problem , ”
34669	34672	34662	34663	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Dumbledore . ”
34673	34683	34685	34685	Tonks	225	“ Fudge is frightened of him , you see , ”
34688	34693	34695	34695	Harry	156	“ Frightened of Dumbledore ? ”
34698	34707	34709	34710	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Frightened of what he ’s up to , ”
34712	34735	34709	34710	Mr. Weasley	199	“ You see , Fudge thinks Dumbledore ’s plotting to overthrow him . He thinks Dumbledore wants to be Minister of Magic . ”
34736	34743	34662	34663	Mr. Weasley	199	“ But Dumbledore does n’t want — ”
34744	34751	34753	34754	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Of course he does n’t , ”
34756	34810	34753	34754	Mr. Weasley	199	“ He ’s never wanted the Minister ’s job , even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when Millicent Bagnold retired . Fudge came to power instead , but he ’s never quite forgotten how much popular support Dumbledore had , even though Dumbledore never applied for the job . ”
34811	34849	34851	34851	Lupin	221	“ Deep down , Fudge knows Dumbledore ’s much cleverer than he is , a much more powerful wizard , and in the early days of his Ministry he was forever asking Dumbledore for help and advice , ”
34853	34904	34851	34851	Lupin	221	“ But it seems that he ’s become fond of power now , and much more confident . He loves being Minister of Magic , and he ’s managed to convince himself that he ’s the clever one and Dumbledore ’s simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it . ”
34905	34912	34914	34914	Harry	156	“ How can he think that ? ”
34917	34938	34914	34914	Harry	156	“ How can he think Dumbledore would just make it all up — that I ’d make it all up ? ”
34939	34963	34965	34965	Sirius	174	“ Because accepting that Voldemort ’s back would mean trouble like the Ministry has n’t had to cope with for nearly fourteen years , ”
34968	34995	34965	34965	Sirius	174	“ Fudge just ca n’t bring himself to face it . It ’s so much more comfortable to convince himself Dumbledore ’s lying to destabilize him . ”
34996	35002	35004	35004	Lupin	221	“ You see the problem , ”
35006	35103	35004	35004	Lupin	221	“ While the Ministry insists there is nothing to fear from Voldemort , it ’s hard to convince people he ’s back , especially as they really do n’t want to believe it in the first place . What ’s more , the Ministry ’s leaning heavily on the Daily Prophet not to report any of what they ’re calling Dumbledore ’s rumor - mongering , so most of the Wizarding community are completely unaware anything ’s happened , and that makes them easy targets for the Death Eaters if they ’re using the Imperius Curse . ”
35104	35115	35117	35117	Harry	156	“ But you ’re telling people , are n’t you ? ”
35136	35146	35134	35134	Tonks	225	“ You ’re letting people know he ’s back ? ”
35152	35196	35198	35198	Sirius	174	“ Well , as everyone thinks I ’m a mad mass murderer and the Ministry ’s put a ten - thousand - Galleon price on my head , I can hardly stroll up the street and start handing out leaflets , can I ? ”
35201	35217	35219	35219	Lupin	221	“ And I ’m not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community , ”
35221	35232	35219	35219	Lupin	221	“ It ’s an occupational hazard of being a werewolf . ”
35233	35252	35254	35254	Sirius	174	“ Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they started shooting their mouths off , ”
35256	35280	35254	35254	Sirius	174	“ and it ’s very important for us to have spies inside the Ministry , because you can bet Voldemort will have them . ”
35281	35294	35296	35297	Mr. Weasley	199	“ We ’ve managed to convince a couple of people , though , ”
35299	35366	35296	35297	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Tonks here , for one — she ’s too young to have been in the Order of the Phoenix last time , and having Aurors on our side is a huge advantage — Kingsley Shacklebolt ’s been a real asset too . He ’s in charge of the hunt for Sirius , so he ’s been feeding the Ministry information that Sirius is in Tibet . ”
35367	35383	35384	35384	Harry	156	“ But if none of you ’s putting the news out that Voldemort ’s back — ”
35387	35399	35401	35401	Sirius	174	“ Who said none of us was putting the news out ? ”
35403	35413	35401	35401	Sirius	174	“ Why d’you think Dumbledore ’s in such trouble ? ”
35414	35419	35420	35420	Harry	156	“ What d’you mean ? ”
35423	35431	35433	35433	Lupin	221	“ They ’re trying to discredit him , ”
35435	35531	35433	35433	Lupin	221	“ Did n’t you see the Daily Prophet last week ? They reported that he ’d been voted out of the Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards because he ’s getting old and losing his grip , but it ’s not true , he was voted out by Ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing Voldemort ’s return . They ’ve demoted him from Chief Warlock on the Wizengamot — that ’s the Wizard High Court — and they ’re talking about taking away his Order of Merlin , First Class , too . ”
35532	35557	35559	35559	Bill	250	“ But Dumbledore says he does n’t care what they do as long as they do n’t take him off the Chocolate Frog cards , ”
35563	35570	35572	35573	Mr. Weasley	199	“ It ’s no laughing matter , ”
35576	35655	35572	35573	Mr. Weasley	199	“ If he carries on defying the Ministry like this , he could end up in Azkaban and the last thing we want is Dumbledore locked up . While You - Know - Who knows Dumbledore ’s out there and wise to what he ’s up to , he ’s going to go cautiously for a while . If Dumbledore ’s out of the way — well , You - Know - Who will have a clear field . ”
35656	35684	35686	35686	Harry	156	“ But if Voldemort ’s trying to recruit more Death Eaters , it ’s bound to get out that he ’s come back , is n’t it ? ”
35689	35708	35710	35710	Sirius	174	“ Voldemort does n’t march up to people ’s houses and bang on their front doors , Harry , ”
35712	35774	35710	35710	Sirius	174	“ He tricks , jinxes , and blackmails them . He ’s well - practiced at operating in secrecy . In any case , gathering followers is only one thing he ’s interested in , he ’s got other plans too , plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed , and he ’s concentrating on them at the moment . ”
35775	35784	35785	35785	Harry	156	“ What ’s he after apart from followers ? ”
35806	35815	35803	35803	Sirius	174	“ Stuff he can only get by stealth . ”
35826	35839	35823	35823	Sirius	174	“ Like a weapon . Something he did n’t have last time . ”
35840	35847	35823	35823	Sirius	174	“ When he was powerful before ? ”
35848	35851	35823	35823	Sirius	174	“ Yes . ”
35852	35859	35861	35861	Harry	156	“ Like what kind of weapon ? ”
35863	35872	35861	35861	Harry	156	“ Something worse than the Avada Kedavra — ? ”
35873	35878	35823	35823	Sirius	174	“ That ’s enough . ”
35909	35922	35923	35923	she	242	“ I want you in bed , now . All of you , ”
35938	35945	35946	35946	Fred	244	“ You ca n’t boss us — ”
35949	35953	35955	35956	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Watch me , ”
35968	35992	35963	35963	she	242	“ You ’ve given Harry plenty of information . Any more and you might just as well induct him into the Order straightaway . ”
35993	35997	35999	35999	Harry	156	“ Why not ? ”
36002	36017	35999	35999	Harry	156	“ I ’ll join , I want to join , I want to fight — ”
36018	36021	35963	35963	she	242	“ No . ”
36035	36045	36046	36046	he	221	“ The Order is comprised only of overage wizards , ”
36049	36056	36057	36057	he	221	“ Wizards who have left school , ”
36068	36098	36063	36063	George	245	“ There are dangers involved of which you can have no idea , any of you ... I think Molly ’s right , Sirius . We ’ve said enough . ”
36141	36155	36156	36156	she	242	“ I want you all to go straight to bed , no talking , ”
36165	36180	36181	36181	she	242	“ We ’ve got a busy day tomorrow . I expect Ginny ’s asleep , ”
36186	36195	36181	36181	she	242	“ so try not to wake her up . ”
36196	36203	36205	36205	Fred	244	“ Asleep , yeah , right , ”
36225	36249	36211	36211	Hermione	172	“ If Ginny ’s not lying awake waiting for Hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs , then I ’m a flobberworm ... ”
36250	36258	36260	36261	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ All right , Ron , Harry , ”
36273	36280	36260	36261	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Off to bed with you . ”
36281	36285	36286	36286	Harry	156	“ ’ Night , ”
36294	36298	36300	36300	Fred	244	“ Sleep tight , ”
36400	36412	36413	36413	Ron	333	“ We ca n’t let them out to hunt every night , ”
36423	36448	36416	36416	he	333	“ Dumbledore does n’t want too many owls swooping around the square , thinks it ’ll look suspicious . Oh yeah ... I forgot ... ”
36458	36466	36449	36449	He	333	“ What ’re you doing that for ? ”
36467	36470	36472	36472	Ron	333	“ Kreacher , ”
36480	36516	36474	36474	he	333	“ First night I was here he came wandering in at three in the morning . Trust me , you do n’t want to wake up and find him prowling around your room . Anyway ... ”
36554	36559	36542	36542	his	156	“ What d’you reckon ? ”
36570	36588	36589	36589	he	333	“ Well , they did n’t tell us much we could n’t have guessed , did they ? ”
36601	36622	36589	36589	he	333	“ I mean , all they ’ve really said is that the Order ’s trying to stop people joining Vol — ”
36633	36637	36639	36639	Harry	156	“ — demort , ”
36642	36658	36639	36639	Harry	156	“ When are you going to start using his name ? Sirius and Lupin do . ”
36665	36672	36673	36673	he	333	“ Yeah , you ’re right , ”
36676	36698	36673	36673	he	333	“ We already knew nearly everything they told us , from using the Extendable Ears . The only new bit was — ”
36701	36716	36699	36699	Crack	279	“ Keep your voice down , Ron , or Mum’ll be back up here . ”
36717	36726	36699	36699	Crack	279	“ You two just Apparated on my knees ! ”
36727	36739	36699	36699	Crack	279	“ Yeah , well , it ’s harder in the dark — ”
36778	36785	36787	36787	George	245	“ So , got there yet ? ”
36790	36796	36798	36798	Harry	156	“ The weapon Sirius mentioned ? ”
36800	36807	36809	36809	Fred	244	“ Let slip , more like , ”
36819	36834	36809	36809	Fred	244	“ We did n’t hear about that on the old Extendables , did we ? ”
36835	36842	36844	36844	Harry	156	“ What d’you reckon it is ? ”
36846	36851	36853	36853	Fred	244	“ Could be anything , ”
36855	36872	36874	36874	Ron	333	“ But there ca n’t be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse , can there ? ”
36876	36883	36874	36874	Ron	333	“ What ’s worse than death ? ”
36884	36898	36900	36900	George	245	“ Maybe it ’s something that can kill loads of people at once , ”
36902	36914	36916	36916	Ron	333	“ Maybe it ’s some particularly painful way of killing people , ”
36919	36930	36932	36932	Harry	156	“ He ’s got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain , ”
36934	36945	36932	36932	Harry	156	“ He does n’t need anything more efficient than that . ”
36969	36979	36981	36981	George	245	“ So who d’you think ’s got it now ? ”
36983	36991	36993	36993	Ron	333	“ I hope it ’s our side , ”
36999	37010	37012	37012	Fred	244	“ If it is , Dumbledore ’s probably keeping it , ”
37014	37017	37019	37019	Ron	333	“ Where ? ”
37022	37025	37019	37019	Ron	333	“ Hogwarts ? ”
37026	37031	37033	37033	George	245	“ Bet it is ! ”
37035	37046	37033	37033	George	245	“ That ’s where he hid the Sorcerer ’s Stone ! ”
37047	37063	37065	37065	Ron	333	“ A weapon ’s going to be a lot bigger than the Stone , though ! ”
37067	37071	37073	37073	Fred	244	“ Not necessarily , ”
37075	37085	37087	37087	George	245	“ Yeah , size is no guarantee of power , ”
37089	37094	37087	37087	George	245	“ Look at Ginny . ”
37095	37100	37102	37102	Harry	156	“ What d’you mean ? ”
37104	37125	37087	37087	George	245	“ You ’ve never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat - Bogey Hexes , have you ? ”
37126	37129	37131	37131	Fred	244	“ Shhh ! ”
37140	37143	37131	37131	Fred	244	“ Listen ! ”
37156	37159	37161	37161	George	245	“ Mum , ”
37236	37248	37250	37250	Ron	333	“ She does n’t trust us at all , you know , ”
37353	37373	37341	37341	Hagrid	281	“ Beauties , aren ’ they , eh , Harry ? We ’ll be studyin ’ weapons this term ... ”
37421	37464	37412	37412	George	245	“ Mum says get up , your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs you in the drawing room , there are loads more doxies than she thought and she ’s found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa . ”
37594	37603	37604	37605	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Cover your faces and take a spray , ”
37633	37661	37613	37613	she	242	“ It ’s Doxycide . I ’ve never seen an infestation this bad — what that house - elf ’s been doing for the last ten years — ”
37688	37700	37676	37676	her	172	“ Kreacher ’s really old , he probably could n’t manage — ”
37701	37717	37719	37719	Sirius	174	“ You ’d be surprised what Kreacher can manage when he wants to , Hermione , ”
37739	37747	37748	37748	he	174	“ I ’ve just been feeding Buckbeak , ”
37759	37776	37748	37748	he	174	“ I keep him upstairs in my mother ’s bedroom . Anyway ... this writing desk ... ”
37809	37823	37825	37825	Sirius	174	“ Well , Molly , I ’m pretty sure this is a boggart , ”
37832	37863	37825	37825	Sirius	174	“ but perhaps we ought to let Mad - Eye have a shifty at it before we let it out — knowing my mother it could be something much worse . ”
37864	37871	37873	37874	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Right you are , Sirius , ”
37936	37947	37949	37949	Sirius	174	“ I keep telling them not to ring the doorbell ! ”
37979	37996	37967	37968	Mrs. Black	272	“ Stains of dishonor , filthy half - breeds , blood traitors , children of filth ... ”
37997	38006	38008	38009	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Close the door , please , Harry , ”
38088	38113	38083	38084	Kingsley Shacklebolt	226	“ Hestia ’s just relieved me , so she ’s got Moody ’s cloak now , thought I ’d leave a report for Dumbledore ... ”
38167	38205	38206	38206	She	242	“ Right , you lot , you need to be careful , because doxies bite and their teeth are poisonous . I ’ve got a bottle of antidote here , but I ’d rather nobody needed it . ”
38225	38236	38237	38237	she	242	“ When I say the word , start spraying immediately , ”
38240	38277	38237	38237	she	242	“ They ’ll come flying out at us , I expect , but it says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyze them . When they ’re immobilized , just throw them in this bucket . ”
38293	38299	38278	38278	She	242	“ All right — squirt ! ”
38395	38403	38405	38406	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Fred , what are you doing ? ”
38409	38419	38405	38406	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Spray that at once and throw it away ! ”
38436	38441	38442	38442	Fred	244	“ Right - o , ”
38474	38487	38488	38488	George	245	“ We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snackboxes , ”
38524	38530	38521	38521	his	156	“ What are Skiving Snackboxes ? ”
38531	38540	38541	38541	George	245	“ Range of sweets to make you ill , ”
38554	38633	38541	38541	George	245	“ Not seriously ill , mind , just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it . Fred and I have been developing them this summer . They ’re double - ended , color - coded chews . If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles , you throw up . Moment you ’ve been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing , you swallow the purple half — ”
38634	38681	38683	38683	Fred	244	“ ‘ — which restores you to full fitness , enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom . ’ That ’s what we ’re putting in the adverts , anyway , ”
38715	38746	38683	38683	Fred	244	“ But they still need a bit of work . At the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping puking long enough to swallow the purple end . ”
38747	38750	38683	38683	Fred	244	“ Testers ? ”
38751	38754	38756	38756	Fred	244	“ Us , ”
38758	38778	38756	38756	Fred	244	“ We take it in turns . George did the Fainting Fancies — we both tried the Nosebleed Nougat — ”
38779	38787	38789	38789	George	245	“ Mum thought we ’d been dueling , ”
38791	38799	38800	38800	Harry	156	“ Joke shop still on , then ? ”
38813	38827	38829	38829	Fred	244	“ Well , we have n’t had a chance to get premises yet , ”
38851	38877	38837	38838	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ so we ’re running it as a mail - order service at the moment . We put advertisements in the Daily Prophet last week . ”
38878	38886	38888	38888	George	245	“ All thanks to you , mate , ”
38890	38922	38888	38888	George	245	“ But do n’t worry ... Mum has n’t got a clue . She wo n’t read the Daily Prophet anymore , ’cause of it telling lies about you and Dumbledore . ”
39101	39111	39095	39095	George	245	“ I think we ’ll tackle those after lunch . ”
39207	39211	39212	39212	she	242	“ Stay here , ”
39234	39242	39223	39224	Mrs. Black	272	“ I ’ll bring up some sandwiches . ”
39289	39292	39294	39294	Hermione	172	“ Mundungus ! ”
39296	39306	39294	39294	Hermione	172	“ What ’s he brought all those cauldrons for ? ”
39307	39318	39320	39320	Harry	156	“ Probably looking for a safe place to keep them , ”
39322	39345	39320	39320	Harry	156	“ Is n’t that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me ? Picking up dodgy cauldrons ? ”
39346	39353	39355	39355	Fred	244	“ Yeah , you ’re right ! ”
39374	39383	39365	39365	his	190	“ Blimey , Mum wo n’t like that ... ”
39407	39416	39417	39417	Fred	244	“ Mundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley , ”
39424	39439	39417	39417	Fred	244	“ Ca n’t hear properly ... d’you reckon we can risk the Extendable Ears ? ”
39440	39446	39448	39448	George	245	“ Might be worth it , ”
39450	39460	39448	39448	George	245	“ I could sneak upstairs and get a pair — ”
39499	39510	39496	39496	her	242	“ WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN GOODS ! ”
39511	39521	39523	39523	Fred	244	“ I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else , ”
39553	39561	39543	39544	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ It makes such a nice change . ”
39562	39585	39533	39533	he	244	“ — COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE , AS IF WE HAVEN’T GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE — ”
39586	39597	39599	39599	George	245	“ The idiots are letting her get into her stride , ”
39605	39664	39602	39602	his	244	“ You ’ve got to head her off early , otherwise she builds up a head of steam and goes on for hours . And she ’s been dying to have a go at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you , Harry — and there goes Sirius ’s mum again — ”
39845	39929	39954	39954	his	1103	“ ... Smells like a drain and a criminal to boot , but she ’s no better , nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my Mistress ’s house , oh my poor Mistress , if she knew , if she knew the scum they ’ve let in her house , what would she say to old Kreacher , oh the shame of it , Mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves , poor old Kreacher , what can he do ... ”
39930	39935	39937	39937	Fred	244	“ Hello , Kreacher , ”
39973	39981	39982	39982	he	1103	“ Kreacher did not see Young Master , ”
40003	40014	39997	39997	he	1103	“ Nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is . ”
40015	40018	40020	40020	George	245	“ Sorry ? ”
40022	40030	40020	40020	George	245	“ Did n’t catch that last bit . ”
40031	40036	40038	40039	the elf	1099	“ Kreacher said nothing , ”
40054	40067	40038	40039	the elf	1099	“ and there ’s its twin , unnatural little beasts they are . ”
40104	40155	40078	40079	The elf	1099	“ ... and there ’s the Mudblood , standing there bold as brass , oh if my Mistress knew , oh how she ’d cry , and there ’s a new boy , Kreacher does n’t know his name , what is he doing here , Kreacher does n’t know ... ”
40156	40163	40165	40165	Hermione	172	“ This is Harry , Kreacher , ”
40168	40172	40165	40165	Hermione	172	“ Harry Potter . ”
40188	40218	40179	40179	he	259	“ The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend , if Kreacher ’s Mistress saw him in such company , oh what would she say — ”
40219	40227	40229	40229	Ron	333	“ Do n’t call her a Mudblood ! ”
40237	40243	40244	40244	Hermione	172	“ It does n’t matter , ”
40247	40264	40244	40244	Hermione	172	“ he ’s not in his right mind , he does n’t know what he ’s — ”
40265	40281	40283	40283	Fred	244	“ Do n’t kid yourself , Hermione , he knows exactly what he ’s saying , ”
40301	40339	40296	40296	his	259	“ Is it true ? Is it Harry Potter ? Kreacher can see the scar , it must be true , that ’s that boy who stopped the Dark Lord , Kreacher wonders how he did it — ”
40340	40348	40350	40350	Fred	244	“ Do n’t we all , Kreacher ? ”
40352	40359	40360	40360	George	245	“ What do you want anyway ? ”
40371	40376	40377	40377	he	259	“ Kreacher is cleaning , ”
40381	40386	40391	40391	Harry	156	“ A likely story , ”
40453	40458	40460	40460	Sirius	174	“ Stand up straight , ”
40463	40472	40460	40460	Sirius	174	“ Now , what are you up to ? ”
40473	40478	40479	40480	the elf	1099	“ Kreacher is cleaning , ”
40483	40494	40479	40480	the elf	1099	“ Kreacher lives to serve the noble house of Black — ”
40495	40509	40511	40511	Sirius	174	“ — and it ’s getting blacker every day , it ’s filthy , ”
40513	40521	40523	40523	Kreacher	259	“ Master always liked his little joke , ”
40534	40548	40523	40523	Kreacher	259	“ Master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his mother ’s heart — ”
40549	40560	40561	40561	Sirius	174	“ My mother did n’t have a heart , Kreacher , ”
40564	40574	40561	40561	Sirius	174	“ She kept herself alive out of pure spite . ”
40581	40586	40575	40575	Kreacher	259	“ Whatever Master says , ”
40591	40632	40575	40575	Kreacher	259	“ Master is not fit to wipe slime from his mother ’s boots , oh my poor Mistress , what would she say if she saw Kreacher serving him , how she hated him , what a disappointment he was — ”
40633	40643	40645	40645	Sirius	174	“ I asked you what you were up to , ”
40648	40674	40645	40645	Sirius	174	“ Every time you show up pretending to be cleaning , you sneak something off to your room so we ca n’t throw it out . ”
40675	40690	40692	40693	the elf	1099	“ Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in Master ’s house , ”
40700	40742	40692	40693	the elf	1099	“ Mistress would never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out , seven centuries it ’s been in the family , Kreacher must save it , Kreacher will not let Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it — ”
40743	40751	40753	40753	Sirius	174	“ I thought it might be that , ”
40764	40802	40753	40753	Sirius	174	“ She ’ll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of it , I do n’t doubt , but if I can get rid of it I certainly will . Now go away , Kreacher . ”
40844	40901	40834	40834	he	259	“ — comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher around , oh my poor Mistress , what would she say if she saw the house now , scum living in it , her treasures thrown out , she swore he was no son of hers and he ’s back , they say he ’s a murderer too — ”
40902	40912	40914	40914	Sirius	174	“ Keep muttering and I will be a murderer ! ”
40927	40938	40940	40940	Hermione	172	“ Sirius , he ’s not right in the head , ”
40943	40955	40940	40940	Hermione	172	“ I do n’t think he realizes we can hear him . ”
40956	40964	40966	40966	Sirius	174	“ He ’s been alone too long , ”
40968	40990	40966	40966	Sirius	174	“ taking mad orders from my mother ’s portrait and talking to himself , but he was always a foul little — ”
40991	40999	41001	41001	Hermione	172	“ If you just set him free , ”
41004	41007	41001	41001	Hermione	172	“ maybe — ”
41008	41024	41026	41026	Sirius	174	“ We ca n’t set him free , he knows too much about the Order , ”
41029	41055	41026	41026	Sirius	174	“ And anyway , the shock would kill him . You suggest to him that he leaves this house , see how he takes it . ”
41132	41139	41141	41141	Harry	156	“ You ’re not on here ! ”
41151	41158	41160	41160	Sirius	174	“ I used to be there , ”
41181	41208	41160	41160	Sirius	174	“ My sweet old mother blasted me off after I ran away from home — Kreacher ’s quite fond of muttering the story under his breath . ”
41209	41216	41160	41160	Sirius	174	“ You ran away from home ? ”
41217	41224	41226	41226	Sirius	174	“ When I was about sixteen , ”
41228	41234	41226	41226	Sirius	174	“ I ’d had enough . ”
41235	41241	41243	41243	Harry	156	“ Where did you go ? ”
41249	41255	41257	41257	Sirius	174	“ Your dad ’s place , ”
41259	41356	41257	41257	Sirius	174	“ Your grandparents were really good about it ; they sort of adopted me as a second son . Yeah , I camped out at your dad ’s during the school holidays , and then when I was seventeen I got a place of my own , my Uncle Alphard had left me a decent bit of gold — he ’s been wiped off here too , that ’s probably why — anyway , after that I looked after myself . I was always welcome at Mr. and Mrs. Potter ’s for Sunday lunch , though . ”
41357	41365	41430	41430	Sirius	174	“ But ... why did you ... ? ”
41366	41369	41370	41370	Sirius	174	“ Leave ? ”
41384	41429	41370	41370	Sirius	174	“ Because I hated the whole lot of them : my parents , with their pure - blood mania , convinced that to be a Black made you practically royal ... my idiot brother , soft enough to believe them ... that ’s him . ”
41464	41471	41473	41473	Sirius	174	“ He was younger than me , ”
41475	41488	41473	41473	Sirius	174	“ and a much better son , as I was constantly reminded . ”
41489	41494	41496	41496	Harry	156	“ But he died , ”
41498	41501	41503	41503	Sirius	174	“ Yeah , ”
41505	41515	41503	41503	Sirius	174	“ Stupid idiot ... he joined the Death Eaters . ”
41516	41521	41473	41473	Sirius	174	“ You ’re kidding ! ”
41522	41546	41548	41548	Sirius	174	“ Come on , Harry , have n’t you seen enough of this house to tell what kind of wizards my family were ? ”
41551	41562	41473	41473	Sirius	174	“ Were — were your parents Death Eaters as well ? ”
41563	41670	41473	41473	Sirius	174	“ No , no , but believe me , they thought Voldemort had the right idea , they were all for the purification of the Wizarding race , getting rid of Muggle - borns and having purebloods in charge . They were n’t alone either , there were quite a few people , before Voldemort showed his true colors , who thought he had the right idea about things ... They got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power , though . But I bet my parents thought Regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first . ”
41671	41679	41680	41680	Harry	156	“ Was he killed by an Auror ? ”
41684	41688	41690	41690	Sirius	174	“ Oh no , ”
41692	41778	41690	41690	Sirius	174	“ No , he was murdered by Voldemort . Or on Voldemort ’s orders , more likely , I doubt Regulus was ever important enough to be killed by Voldemort in person . From what I found out after he died , he got in so far , then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out . Well , you do n’t just hand in your resignation to Voldemort . It ’s a lifetime of service or death . ”
41779	41782	41784	41785	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Lunch , ”
41851	41978	41841	41841	Sirius	174	“ I have n’t looked at this for years . There ’s Phineas Nigellus ... my great - great - grandfather , see ? Least popular headmaster Hogwarts ever had ... and Araminta Meliflua ... cousin of my mother ’s ... tried to force through a Ministry Bill to make Muggle - hunting legal ... and dear Aunt Elladora ... she started the family tradition of beheading house - elves when they got too old to carry tea trays ... of course , anytime the family produced someone halfway decent they were disowned . I see Tonks is n’t on here . Maybe that ’s why Kreacher wo n’t take orders from her — he ’s supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him ... ”
41979	41986	41987	41987	Harry	156	“ You and Tonks are related ? ”
41992	42006	42008	42008	Sirius	174	“ Oh yeah , her mother , Andromeda , was my favorite cousin , ”
42015	42027	42008	42008	Sirius	174	“ No , Andromeda ’s not on here either , look — ”
42044	42075	42028	42028	He	174	“ Andromeda ’s sisters are still here because they made lovely , respectable pure - blood marriages , but Andromeda married a Muggle - born , Ted Tonks , so — ”
42141	42149	42249	42249	Andromeda	294	“ You ’re related to the Malfoys ! ”
42150	42160	42162	42162	Sirius	174	“ The pure - blood families are all interrelated , ”
42164	42236	42162	42162	Sirius	174	“ If you ’re only going to let your sons and daughters marry purebloods your choice is very limited , there are hardly any of us left . Molly and I are cousins by marriage and Arthur ’s something like my second cousin once removed . But there ’s no point looking for them on here — if ever a family was a bunch of blood traitors it ’s the Weasleys . ”
42267	42270	42271	42271	Harry	156	“ Lestrange ... ”
42316	42322	42324	42324	Sirius	174	“ They ’re in Azkaban , ”
42333	42347	42349	42349	Sirius	174	“ Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch , Junior , ”
42356	42368	42349	42349	Sirius	174	“ Rodolphus ’s brother , Rabastan , was with them too . ”
42446	42454	42433	42433	her	1121	“ You never said she was your — ”
42455	42465	42467	42467	Sirius	174	“ Does it matter if she ’s my cousin ? ”
42469	42524	42467	42467	Sirius	174	“ As far as I ’m concerned , they ’re not my family . She ’s certainly not my family . I have n’t seen her since I was your age , unless you count a glimpse of her coming in to Azkaban . D’you think I ’m proud of having relatives like her ? ”
42525	42528	42530	42530	Harry	156	“ Sorry , ”
42533	42548	42530	42530	Harry	156	“ I did n’t mean — I was just surprised , that ’s all — ”
42549	42559	42560	42560	Sirius	174	“ It does n’t matter , do n’t apologize , ”
42579	42588	42589	42589	he	174	“ I do n’t like being back here , ”
42598	42611	42589	42589	he	174	“ I never thought I ’d be stuck in this house again . ”
42651	42661	42662	42662	Sirius	174	“ It ’s ideal for headquarters , of course , ”
42665	42762	42662	42662	Sirius	174	“ My father put every security measure known to Wizard - kind on it when he lived here . It ’s Unplottable , so Muggles could never come and call — as if they ’d have wanted to — and now Dumbledore ’s added his protection , you ’d be hard put to find a safer house anywhere . Dumbledore ’s Secret - Keeper for the Order , you know — nobody can find headquarters unless he tells them personally where it is — that note Moody showed you last night , that was from Dumbledore ... ”
42771	42798	42763	42763	Sirius	174	“ If my parents could see the use it was being put to now ... well , my mother ’s portrait should give you some idea ... ”
42808	42858	42799	42799	He	174	“ I would n’t mind if I could just get out occasionally and do something useful . I ’ve asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you to your hearing — as Snuffles , obviously — so I can give you a bit of moral support , what d’you think ? ”
42959	42964	42965	42965	Sirius	174	“ Do n’t worry , ”
42980	43013	42974	42974	Sirius	174	“ I ’m sure they ’re going to clear you , there ’s definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life . ”
43014	43022	43024	43024	Harry	156	“ But if they do expel me , ”
43028	43039	43024	43024	Harry	156	“ can I come back here and live with you ? ”
43044	43049	43040	43040	Sirius	174	“ We ’ll see . ”
43050	43074	43075	43075	Harry	156	“ I ’d feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I did n’t have to go back to the Dursleys , ”
43079	43090	43092	43092	Sirius	174	“ They must be bad if you prefer this place , ”
43095	43111	43112	43113	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Hurry up , you two , or there wo n’t be any food left , ”
43218	43223	43224	43224	he	156	“ It ’s okay , ”
43246	43254	43224	43224	he	156	“ must be Wartcap powder in there . ”
43435	43441	43385	43385	Ginny	247	“ Services to the Ministry . ”
43442	43453	43455	43455	Sirius	174	“ It means he gave them a load of gold , ”
43533	43540	43542	43542	Sirius	174	“ It was my father ’s , ”
43551	43582	43542	43542	Sirius	174	“ Kreacher was n’t quite as devoted to him as to my mother , but I still caught him snogging a pair of my father ’s old trousers last week . ”
43765	43768	43758	43758	Snape	249	“ cleaning , ”
43851	43859	43841	43841	Kreacher	259	“ Master must do as Master wishes , ”
43868	43909	43841	43841	Kreacher	259	“ but Master will not turn Kreacher away , no , because Kreacher knows what they are up to , oh yes , he is plotting against the Dark Lord , yes , with these Mudbloods and traitors and scum ... ”
44395	44427	44381	44382	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ I ’ve ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning , Harry , and I want you to wash your hair tonight too . A good first impression can work wonders . ”
44469	44476	44477	44477	he	156	“ How am I getting there ? ”
44487	44497	44499	44500	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Arthur ’s taking you to work with him , ”
44513	44528	44529	44529	he	199	“ You can wait in my office until it ’s time for the hearing , ”
44552	44576	44546	44547	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Professor Dumbledore does n’t think it ’s a good idea for Sirius to go with you , and I must say I — ”
44577	44585	44587	44587	Sirius	174	“ — think he ’s quite right , ”
44598	44606	44607	44607	Harry	156	“ When did Dumbledore tell you that ? ”
44614	44626	44628	44629	Mr. Weasley	199	“ He came last night , when you were in bed , ”
44950	44953	44954	44954	she	242	“ Breakfast , ”
44969	44978	44980	44980	Tonks	225	“ M - m - morning , Harry , ”
44991	44996	44982	44982	Her	242	“ Sleep all right ? ”
44997	45000	45002	45002	Harry	156	“ Yeah , ”
45004	45016	45017	45017	she	242	“ I ’ve b - b - been up all night , ”
45025	45031	45017	45017	she	242	“ Come and sit down ... ”

51717	51722	51689	51689	Harry	156	“ Yes , but — ”
51723	51735	51616	51616	Fudge	256	“ Knowing that you were in an area full of Muggles ? ”
51736	51741	51689	51689	Harry	156	“ Yes , but — ”
51742	51758	51616	51616	Fudge	256	“ Fully aware that you were in close proximity to a Muggle at the time ? ”
51759	51762	51764	51764	Harry	156	“ Yes , ”
51767	51777	51764	51764	Harry	156	“ but I only used it because we were — ”
51795	51803	51616	51616	Fudge	256	“ You produced a fully fledged Patronus ? ”
51804	51807	51809	51809	Harry	156	“ Yes , ”
51811	51814	51809	51809	Harry	156	“ because — ”
51815	51820	51616	51616	Fudge	256	“ A corporeal Patronus ? ”
51821	51826	51828	51828	Harry	156	“ A — what ? ”
51830	51852	51616	51616	Fudge	256	“ Your Patronus had a clearly defined form ? I mean to say , it was more than vapor or smoke ? ”
51853	51856	51858	51858	Harry	156	“ Yes , ”
51867	51879	51858	51858	Harry	156	“ it ’s a stag , it ’s always a stag . ”
51880	51883	51885	51886	Madam Bones	318	“ Always ? ”
51888	51897	51885	51886	Madam Bones	318	“ You have produced a Patronus before now ? ”
51898	51901	51903	51903	Harry	156	“ Yes , ”
51905	51916	51903	51903	Harry	156	“ I ’ve been doing it for over a year — ”
51917	51925	51885	51886	Madam Bones	318	“ And you are fifteen years old ? ”
51926	51931	51903	51903	Harry	156	“ Yes , and — ”
51932	51939	51885	51886	Madam Bones	318	“ You learned this at school ? ”
51940	51956	51903	51903	Harry	156	“ Yes , Professor Lupin taught me in my third year , because of the — ”
51957	51960	51962	51963	Madam Bones	318	“ Impressive , ”
51970	51982	51962	51963	Madam Bones	318	“ a true Patronus at that age ... very impressive indeed . ”
52008	52021	52023	52023	Fudge	256	“ It ’s not a question of how impressive the magic was , ”
52029	52059	52023	52023	Fudge	256	“ In fact , the more impressive the worse it is , I would have thought , given that the boy did it in plain view of a Muggle ! ”
52087	52096	52097	52097	he	156	“ I did it because of the dementors ! ”
52127	52130	52132	52133	Madam Bones	318	“ Dementors ? ”
52153	52161	52139	52139	her	318	“ What do you mean , boy ? ”
52162	52181	52193	52193	he	256	“ I mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they went for me and my cousin ! ”
52182	52185	52187	52187	Fudge	256	“ Ah , ”
52209	52224	52193	52193	he	256	“ Yes . Yes , I thought we ’d be hearing something like this . ”
52225	52231	52232	52233	Madam Bones	318	“ Dementors in Little Whinging ? ”
52241	52247	52232	52233	Madam Bones	318	“ I do n’t understand — ”
52248	52255	52257	52257	Fudge	256	“ Do n’t you , Amelia ? ”
52262	52316	52257	52257	Fudge	256	“ Let me explain . He ’s been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a very nice little cover story , very nice indeed . Muggles ca n’t see dementors , can they , boy ? Highly convenient , highly convenient ... so it ’s just your word and no witnesses ... ”
52317	52323	52325	52325	Harry	156	“ I ’m not lying ! ”
52337	52367	52325	52325	Harry	156	“ There were two of them , coming from opposite ends of the alley , everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it — ”
52368	52373	52375	52375	Fudge	256	“ Enough , enough ! ”
52385	52405	52375	52375	Fudge	256	“ I ’m sorry to interrupt what I ’m sure would have been a very well - rehearsed story — ”
52417	52436	52437	52437	he	256	“ We do , in fact , have a witness to the presence of dementors in that alleyway , ”
52440	52449	52437	52437	he	256	“ other than Dudley Dursley , I mean . ”
52494	52519	52485	52486	a man	727	“ We have n’t got time to listen to more taradiddles , I ’m afraid , Dumbledore . I want this dealt with quickly — ”
52520	52526	52528	52528	Dumbledore	176	“ I may be wrong , ”
52531	52574	52575	52575	he	176	“ but I am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights , the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case ? Is n’t that the policy of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement , Madam Bones ? ”
52585	52588	52590	52591	Madam Bones	318	“ True , ”
52593	52597	52590	52591	Madam Bones	318	“ Perfectly true . ”
52598	52607	52609	52609	Fudge	256	“ Oh , very well , very well , ”
52611	52617	52609	52609	Fudge	256	“ Where is this person ? ”
52618	52625	52627	52627	Dumbledore	176	“ I brought her with me , ”
52629	52641	52627	52627	Dumbledore	176	“ She ’s just outside the door . Should I — ? ”
52642	52650	52651	52651	Fudge	256	“ No — Weasley , you go , ”
52735	52739	52741	52741	Fudge	256	“ Full name ? ”
52759	52764	52766	52767	Mrs. Figg	163	“ Arabella Doreen Figg , ”
52773	52780	52782	52782	Fudge	256	“ And who exactly are you ? ”
52791	52807	52809	52810	Mrs. Figg	163	“ I ’m a resident of Little Whinging , close to where Harry Potter lives , ”
52812	52831	52833	52834	Madam Bones	318	“ We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging other than Harry Potter , ”
52838	52853	52833	52834	Madam Bones	318	“ That situation has always been closely monitored , given ... given past events . ”
52854	52860	52862	52863	Mrs. Figg	163	“ I ’m a Squib , ”
52865	52877	52862	52863	Mrs. Figg	163	“ So you would n’t have me registered , would you ? ”
52878	52884	52886	52886	Fudge	256	“ A Squib , eh ? ”
52892	52919	52920	52920	he	256	“ We ’ll be checking that . You ’ll leave details of your parentage with my assistant , Weasley . Incidentally , can Squibs see dementors ? ”
52934	52940	52942	52943	Mrs. Figg	163	“ Yes , we can ! ”
52957	52961	52962	52962	he	256	“ Very well , ”
52966	52972	52962	52962	he	256	“ What is your story ? ”
52973	53005	53007	53008	Mrs. Figg	163	“ I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of Wisteria Walk , shortly after nine on the evening of the second of August , ”
53024	53052	53014	53014	she	163	“ when I heard a disturbance down the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk . On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I saw dementors running — ”
53053	53056	53058	53059	Madam Bones	318	“ Running ? ”
53062	53071	53058	53059	Madam Bones	318	“ Dementors do n’t run , they glide . ”
53072	53081	53083	53084	Mrs. Figg	163	“ That ’s what I meant to say , ”
53096	53108	53083	53084	Mrs. Figg	163	“ Gliding along the alley toward what looked like two boys . ”
53109	53116	53118	53119	Madam Bones	318	“ What did they look like ? ”
53135	53149	53083	53084	Mrs. Figg	163	“ Well , one was very large and the other one rather skinny — ”
53150	53155	53157	53158	Madam Bones	318	“ No , no , ”
53161	53168	53157	53158	Madam Bones	318	“ the dementors ... describe them . ”
53169	53172	53174	53175	Mrs. Figg	163	“ Oh , ”
53186	53196	53174	53175	Mrs. Figg	163	“ They were big . Big and wearing cloaks . ”
53322	53328	53330	53331	Madam Bones	318	“ Big and wearing cloaks , ”
53339	53346	53335	53335	Fudge	256	“ I see . Anything else ? ”
53347	53350	53352	53353	Mrs. Figg	163	“ Yes , ”
53355	53398	53352	53353	Mrs. Figg	163	“ I felt them . Everything went cold , and this was a very warm summer ’s night , mark you . And I felt ... as though all happiness had gone from the world ... and I remembered ... dreadful things ... ”
53428	53435	53436	53436	she	163	“ What did the dementors do ? ”
53447	53454	53456	53457	Mrs. Figg	163	“ They went for the boys , ”
53476	53546	53459	53459	her	163	“ One of them had fallen . The other was backing away , trying to repel the dementor . That was Harry . He tried twice and produced silver vapor . On the third attempt , he produced a Patronus , which charged down the first dementor and then , with his encouragement , chased away the second from his cousin . And that ... that was what happened , ”
53590	53600	53580	53580	he	256	“ That ’s what you saw , is it ? ”
53601	53607	53608	53609	Mrs. Figg	163	“ That was what happened , ”
53612	53616	53618	53618	Fudge	256	“ Very well , ”
53620	53625	53618	53618	Fudge	256	“ You may go . ”
53656	53663	53665	53665	Fudge	256	“ Not a very convincing witness , ”
53668	53676	53678	53679	Madam Bones	318	“ Oh , I do n’t know , ”
53685	53715	53681	53681	her	318	“ She certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately . And I ca n’t imagine why she would say they were there if they were n’t — ”
53716	53733	53735	53735	Fudge	256	“ But dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard ? ”
53737	53756	53735	53735	Fudge	256	“ The odds on that must be very , very long , even Bagman would n’t have bet — ”
53757	53775	53777	53777	Dumbledore	176	“ Oh , I do n’t think any of us believe the dementors were there by coincidence , ”
53805	53814	53816	53816	Fudge	256	“ And what is that supposed to mean ? ”
53819	53830	53832	53832	Dumbledore	176	“ It means that I think they were ordered there , ”
53834	53859	53861	53861	Fudge	256	“ I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging ! ”
53863	53882	53884	53884	Dumbledore	176	“ Not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the Ministry of Magic these days , ”
53887	53901	53884	53884	Dumbledore	176	“ I have already given you my views on this matter , Cornelius . ”
53902	53908	53910	53910	Fudge	256	“ Yes , you have , ”
53913	53948	53910	53910	Fudge	256	“ and I have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge , Dumbledore . The dementors remain in place in Azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to . ”
53949	53952	53954	53954	Dumbledore	176	“ Then , ”
53960	53984	53954	53954	Dumbledore	176	“ we must ask ourselves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on the second of August . ”
54095	54109	54111	54111	Fudge	256	“ The Chair recognizes Dolores Jane Umbridge , Senior Undersecretary to the Minister , ”
54138	54151	54152	54152	she	1216	“ I ’m sure I must have misunderstood you , Professor Dumbledore , ”
54169	54200	54152	54152	she	1216	“ So silly of me . But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy ! ”
54246	54296	54298	54298	Dumbledore	176	“ If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic , and it is also true that two dementors attacked Harry and his cousin a week ago , then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks , ”
54301	54315	54298	54298	Dumbledore	176	“ Of course , these particular dementors may have been outside Ministry control — ”
54316	54325	54327	54327	Fudge	256	“ There are no dementors outside Ministry control ! ”
54344	54372	54337	54337	his	176	“ Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they attacked without authorization . ”
54373	54394	54396	54396	Fudge	256	“ It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does not do , Dumbledore ! ”
54412	54419	54421	54421	Dumbledore	176	“ Of course it is n’t , ”
54424	54439	54421	54421	Dumbledore	176	“ I was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated . ”
54459	54491	54493	54493	Fudge	256	“ I would remind everybody that the behavior of these dementors , if indeed they are not figments of this boy ’s imagination , is not the subject of this hearing ! ”
54495	54516	54493	54493	Fudge	256	“ We are here to examine Harry Potter ’s offenses under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery ! ”
54517	54523	54525	54525	Dumbledore	176	“ Of course we are , ”
54527	54589	54525	54525	Dumbledore	176	“ but the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant . Clause seven of the Decree states that magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circumstances , and as those exceptional circumstances include situations that threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself , or witches , wizards , or Muggles present at the time of the — ”
54590	54603	54605	54605	Fudge	256	“ We are familiar with clause seven , thank you very much ! ”
54607	54613	54615	54615	Dumbledore	176	“ Of course you are , ”
54618	54646	54615	54615	Dumbledore	176	“ Then we are in agreement that Harry ’s use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances it describes ? ”
54647	54657	54525	54525	Dumbledore	176	“ If there were dementors , which I doubt — ”
54658	54666	54667	54667	Dumbledore	176	“ You have heard from an eyewitness , ”
54670	54694	54667	54667	Dumbledore	176	“ If you still doubt her truthfulness , call her back , question her again . I am sure she would not object . ”
54695	54702	54704	54704	Fudge	256	“ I — that — not — ”
54713	54726	54704	54704	Fudge	256	“ It ’s — I want this over with today , Dumbledore ! ”
54727	54754	54756	54756	Dumbledore	176	“ But naturally , you would not care how many times you heard from a witness , if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice , ”
54758	54765	54767	54767	Fudge	256	“ Serious miscarriage , my hat ! ”
54775	54829	54767	54767	Fudge	256	“ Have you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock - and - bull stories this boy has come out with , Dumbledore , while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of magic out of school ? I suppose you ’ve forgotten the Hover Charm he used three years ago — ”
54830	54843	54845	54845	Harry	156	“ That was n’t me , it was a house - elf ! ”
54847	54851	54853	54853	Fudge	256	“ YOU SEE ? ”
54862	54877	54853	54853	Fudge	256	“ A house - elf ! In a Muggle house ! I ask you — ”
54878	54894	54896	54896	Dumbledore	176	“ The house - elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School , ”
54898	54914	54896	54896	Dumbledore	176	“ I can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wish . ”
54915	54951	54952	54952	Fudge	256	“ I — not — I have n’t got time to listen to house - elves ! Anyway , that ’s not the only — he blew up his aunt , for God ’s sake ! ”
54970	55000	55002	55002	Dumbledore	176	“ And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion , accepting , I presume , that even the best wizards can not always control their emotions , ”
55016	55032	55078	55078	his	256	“ And I have n’t even started on what he gets up to at school — ”
55033	55062	55064	55064	Dumbledore	176	“ — but as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for misdemeanors at school , Harry ’s behavior there is not relevant to this inquiry , ”
55081	55084	55086	55086	Fudge	256	“ Oho ! ”
55088	55104	55086	55086	Fudge	256	“ Not our business what he does at school , eh ? You think so ? ”
55105	55133	55135	55135	Dumbledore	176	“ The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students , Cornelius , as I reminded you on the night of the second of August , ”
55137	55197	55135	55135	Dumbledore	176	“ Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven , again , as I reminded you on the night of the second of August . In your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld , you appear , inadvertently I am sure , to have overlooked a few laws yourself . ”
55198	55204	55206	55206	Fudge	256	“ Laws can be changed , ”
55209	55215	55217	55217	Dumbledore	176	“ Of course they can , ”
55223	55274	55220	55220	his	176	“ And you certainly seem to be making many changes , Cornelius . Why , in the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot , it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic ! ”
55316	55326	55327	55327	Dumbledore	176	“ As far as I am aware , however , ”
55330	55386	55327	55327	Dumbledore	176	“ there is no law yet in place that says this court ’s job is to punish Harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed . He has been charged with a specific offense and he has presented his defense . All he and I can do now is to await your verdict . ”
55636	55648	55650	55651	Madam Bones	318	“ Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges ? ”
55696	55704	55691	55692	Madam Bones	318	“ And those in favor of conviction ? ”
55781	55793	55764	55764	He	256	“ Very well , very well ... cleared of all charges . ”
55794	55797	55799	55799	Dumbledore	176	“ Excellent , ”
55821	55836	55799	55799	Dumbledore	176	“ Well , I must be getting along . Good day to you all . ”
56039	56045	56025	56026	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Dumbledore did n’t say — ”
56046	56049	56050	56050	Harry	156	“ Cleared , ”
56060	56065	56050	56050	Harry	156	“ of all charges ! ”
56076	56113	56068	56069	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Harry , that ’s wonderful ! Well , of course , they could n’t have found you guilty , not on the evidence , but even so , I ca n’t pretend I was n’t — ”
56135	56140	56142	56143	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Merlin ’s beard , ”
56155	56164	56142	56143	Mr. Weasley	199	“ you were tried by the full court ? ”
56165	56170	56172	56172	Harry	156	“ I think so , ”
56198	56203	56193	56194	Madam Bones	318	“ Morning , Arthur , ”
56328	56347	56348	56348	he	253	“ I ’m going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news , ”
56367	56386	56348	56348	he	253	“ I ’ll drop you off on the way to that toilet in Bethnal Green . Come on ... ”
56387	56399	56400	56400	Harry	156	“ So what will you have to do about the toilet ? ”
56432	56444	56446	56447	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Oh , it ’s a simple enough anti - jinx , ”
56454	56505	56446	56447	Mr. Weasley	199	“ but it ’s not so much having to repair the damage , it ’s more the attitude behind the vandalism , Harry . Muggle - baiting might strike some wizards as funny , but it ’s an expression of something much deeper and nastier , and I for one — ”
56586	56596	56598	56599	Lucius Malfoy	297	“ Well , well , well ... Patronus Potter , ”
56704	56718	56720	56721	Mr. Malfoy	325	“ The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape , Potter , ”
56723	56744	56720	56721	Mr. Malfoy	325	“ Quite astonishing , the way you continue to wriggle out of very tight holes ... Snakelike , in fact ... ”
56754	56757	56759	56759	Harry	156	“ Yeah , ”
56761	56770	56759	56759	Harry	156	“ yeah , I ’m good at escaping ... ”
56782	56796	56774	56774	his	297	“ And Arthur Weasley too ! What are you doing here , Arthur ? ”
56797	56802	56804	56805	Mr. Weasley	199	“ I work here , ”
56808	56814	56816	56817	Mr. Malfoy	325	“ Not here , surely ? ”
56833	56859	56820	56820	his	325	“ I thought you were up on the second floor ... Do n’t you do something that involves sneaking Muggle artifacts home and bewitching them ? ”
56860	56863	56865	56866	Mr. Weasley	199	“ No , ”
56878	56886	56887	56887	Harry	156	“ What are you doing here anyway ? ”
56892	56912	56914	56914	Malfoy	297	“ I do n’t think private matters between myself and the Minister are any concern of yours , Potter , ”
56939	56976	57010	57011	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Really , just because you are Dumbledore ’s favorite boy , you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us ... Shall we go up to your office , then , Minister ? ”
56977	56980	56982	56982	Fudge	256	“ Certainly , ”
56993	56999	56990	56991	Mr. Weasley	199	“ This way , Lucius . ”
57028	57047	57048	57048	Harry	156	“ Why was n’t he waiting outside Fudge ’s office if they ’ve got business to do together ? ”
57053	57061	57048	57048	Harry	156	“ What was he doing down here ? ”
57062	57076	57078	57079	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Trying to sneak down to the courtroom , if you ask me , ”
57100	57138	57085	57085	he	199	“ Trying to find out whether you ’d been expelled or not . I ’ll leave a note for Dumbledore when I drop you off , he ought to know Malfoy ’s been talking to Fudge again . ”
57139	57149	57085	57085	he	199	“ What private business have they got together anyway ? ”
57150	57156	57158	57159	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Gold , I expect , ”
57162	57209	57158	57159	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Malfoy ’s been giving generously to all sorts of things for years ... Gets him in with the right people ... then he can ask favors ... delay laws he does n’t want passed ... Oh , he ’s very well connected , Lucius Malfoy ... ”
57250	57254	57256	57256	Harry	156	“ Mr. Weasley , ”
57259	57290	57256	57256	Harry	156	“ if Fudge is meeting Death Eaters like Malfoy , if he ’s seeing them alone , how do we know they have n’t put the Imperius Curse on him ? ”
57291	57304	57306	57307	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Do n’t think it had n’t occurred to us , Harry , ”
57309	57348	57306	57307	Mr. Weasley	199	“ But Dumbledore thinks Fudge is acting of his own accord at the moment — which , as Dumbledore says , is not a lot of comfort ... Best not talk about it anymore just now , Harry ... ”
57388	57391	57392	57392	he	156	“ Wait ... ”
57535	57540	57542	57542	Ron	333	“ I knew it ! ”
57548	57556	57542	57542	Ron	333	“ You always get away with stuff ! ”
57557	57565	57567	57567	Hermione	172	“ They were bound to clear you , ”
57593	57605	57577	57577	Harry	156	“ There was no case against you , none at all ... ”
57606	57623	57625	57625	Harry	156	“ Everyone seems quite relieved , though , considering they all knew I ’d get off , ”
57658	57671	57686	57686	he	199	“ He got off , he got off , he got off — ”
57672	57680	57686	57686	he	199	“ That ’s enough , settle down ! ”
57691	57703	57686	57686	he	199	“ Listen , Sirius , Lucius Malfoy was at the Ministry — ”
57704	57707	57709	57709	Sirius	174	“ What ? ”
57712	57725	57686	57686	he	199	“ He got off , he got off , he got off — ”
57726	57760	57686	57686	he	199	“ Be quiet , you three ! Yes , we saw him talking to Fudge on level nine , then they went up to Fudge ’s office together . Dumbledore ought to know . ”
57761	57764	57766	57766	Sirius	174	“ Absolutely , ”
57768	57778	57766	57766	Sirius	174	“ We ’ll tell him , do n’t worry . ”
57779	57822	57686	57686	he	199	“ Well , I ’d better get going , there ’s a vomiting toilet in Bethnal Green waiting for me . Molly , I ’ll be late , I ’m covering for Tonks , but Kingsley might be dropping in for dinner — ”
57823	57836	57766	57766	Sirius	174	“ He got off , he got off , he got off — ”
57837	57848	57850	57851	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ That ’s enough — Fred — George — Ginny ! ”
57860	57878	57854	57855	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Harry dear , come and sit down , have some lunch , you hardly ate breakfast ... ”
57964	57987	57989	57989	Ron	333	“ ’ Course , once Dumbledore turned up on your side , there was no way they were going to convict you , ”
58004	58013	58015	58015	Harry	156	“ Yeah , he swung it for me , ”
58034	58051	58017	58017	He	156	“ I wish he ’d talked to me , though . Or even looked at me . ”
58074	58079	58081	58081	Hermione	172	“ What ’s up ? ”
58086	58089	58090	58090	Harry	156	“ Scar , ”
58093	58106	58090	58090	Harry	156	“ But it ’s nothing ... It happens all the time now ... ”
58159	58175	58155	58155	Ron	333	“ I bet Dumbledore turns up this evening to celebrate with us , you know . ”
58176	58189	58191	58192	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ I do n’t think he ’ll be able to , Ron , ”
58207	58217	58191	58192	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ He ’s really very busy at the moment . ”
58218	58231	58155	58155	Ron	333	“ HE GOT OFF , HE GOT OFF , HE GOT OFF — ”
58232	58236	58238	58239	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ SHUT UP ! ”
58342	58350	58352	58352	Hermione	172	“ Do n’t you go feeling guilty ! ”
58383	58402	58366	58366	Ron	333	“ You belong at Hogwarts and Sirius knows it . Personally , I think he ’s being selfish . ”
58403	58412	58414	58414	Ron	333	“ That ’s a bit harsh , Hermione , ”
58436	58450	58418	58418	he	333	“ you would n’t want to be stuck inside this house without company . ”
58451	58457	58459	58459	Hermione	172	“ He ’ll have company ! ”
58461	58493	58459	58459	Hermione	172	“ It ’s headquarters to the Order of the Phoenix , is n’t it ? He just got his hopes up that Harry would be coming to live here with him . ”
58494	58503	58505	58505	Harry	156	“ I do n’t think that ’s true , ”
58512	58529	58505	58505	Harry	156	“ He would n’t give me a straight answer when I asked him if I could . ”
58530	58545	58547	58547	Hermione	172	“ He just did n’t want to get his own hopes up even more , ”
58550	58583	58547	58547	Hermione	172	“ And he probably felt a bit guilty himself , because I think a part of him was really hoping you ’d be expelled . Then you ’d both be outcasts together . ”
58584	58589	58591	58591	Harry	156	“ Come off it ! ”
58601	58630	58547	58547	Hermione	172	“ Suit yourselves . But I sometimes think Ron ’s mum ’s right , and Sirius gets confused about whether you ’re you or your father , Harry . ”
58631	58642	58644	58644	Harry	156	“ So you think he ’s touched in the head ? ”
58647	58663	58665	58665	Hermione	172	“ No , I just think he ’s been very lonely for a long time , ”
58679	58684	58685	58685	she	242	“ Still not finished ? ”
58695	58710	58712	58712	Ron	333	“ I thought you might be here to tell us to have a break ! ”
58715	58731	58712	58712	Ron	333	“ D’you know how much mold we ’ve got rid of since we arrived here ? ”
58732	58742	58744	58745	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ You were so keen to help the Order , ”
58747	58761	58744	58745	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ you can do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in . ”
58762	58771	58773	58773	Ron	333	“ I feel like a house - elf , ”
58775	58799	58801	58801	Hermione	172	“ Well , now that you understand what dreadful lives they lead , perhaps you ’ll be a bit more active in S.P.E.W. ! ”
58813	58864	58805	58806	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ You know , maybe it would n’t be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the time — we could do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room , all proceeds to S.P.E.W. , it would raise awareness as well as funds — ”
58865	58876	58877	58877	Ron	333	“ I ’ll sponsor you to shut up about spew , ”
59123	59128	59129	59129	he	333	“ Booklists have arrived , ”
59148	59166	59129	59129	he	333	“ About time , I thought they ’d forgotten , they usually come much earlier than this ... ”
59241	59247	59248	59248	he	156	“ Only two new ones , ”
59255	59277	59248	59248	he	156	“ The Standard Book of Spells , Grade 5 , by Miranda Goshawk and Defensive Magical Theory , by Wilbert Slinkhard . ”
59308	59319	59321	59321	Fred	244	“ We were just wondering who assigned the Slinkhard book , ”
59324	59340	59342	59342	George	245	“ Because it means Dumbledore ’s found a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher , ”
59344	59350	59352	59352	Fred	244	“ And about time too , ”
59354	59359	59360	59360	Harry	156	“ What d’you mean ? ”
59368	59386	59387	59387	Fred	244	“ Well , we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears a few weeks back , ”
59391	59413	59387	59387	Fred	244	“ and from what they were saying , Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year . ”
59414	59433	59435	59435	George	245	“ Not surprising , is it , when you look at what ’s happened to the last four ? ”
59437	59459	59461	59461	Harry	156	“ One sacked , one dead , one ’s memory removed , and one locked in a trunk for nine months , ”
59470	59479	59461	59461	Harry	156	“ Yeah , I see what you mean . ”
59480	59489	59491	59491	Fred	244	“ What ’s up with you , Ron ? ”
59520	59526	59528	59528	Fred	244	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
59550	59553	59554	59554	he	244	“ Prefect ? ”
59563	59566	59554	59554	he	244	“ Prefect ? ”
59598	59602	59604	59604	George	245	“ No way , ”
59610	59617	59619	59619	Fred	244	“ There ’s been a mistake , ”
59643	59656	59619	59619	Fred	244	“ No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect ... ”
59672	59680	59682	59682	Fred	244	“ We thought you were a cert ! ”
59696	59706	59708	59708	George	245	“ We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you ! ”
59711	59718	59720	59720	Fred	244	“ Winning the Triwizard and everything ! ”
59722	59735	59737	59737	George	245	“ I suppose all the mad stuff must ’ve counted against him , ”
59741	59744	59746	59746	Fred	244	“ Yeah , ”
59749	59774	59746	59746	Fred	244	“ Yeah , you ’ve caused too much trouble , mate . Well , at least one of you ’s got their priorities right . ”
59793	59801	59775	59775	He	156	“ Prefect ... ickle Ronnie the prefect ... ”
59802	59812	59814	59814	George	245	“ Oh , Mum ’s going to be revolting , ”
59931	59940	59928	59928	her	172	“ Did you — did you get — ? ”
59955	59960	59961	59961	she	172	“ I knew it ! ”
59969	59978	59961	59961	she	172	“ Me too , Harry , me too ! ”
59979	59982	59984	59984	Harry	156	“ No , ”
59996	60004	59984	59984	Harry	156	“ It ’s Ron , not me . ”
60005	60010	59961	59961	she	172	“ It — what ? ”
60011	60019	60020	60020	Harry	156	“ Ron ’s prefect , not me , ”
60023	60026	60030	60030	her	172	“ Ron ? ”
60034	60044	60030	60030	her	172	“ But ... are you sure ? I mean — ”
60062	60071	60072	60072	he	333	“ It ’s my name on the letter , ”
60075	60078	60080	60080	Hermione	172	“ I ... ”
60086	60102	60080	60080	Hermione	172	“ I ... well ... wow ! Well done , Ron ! That ’s really — ”
60103	60106	60108	60108	George	245	“ Unexpected , ”
60112	60115	60117	60117	Hermione	172	“ No , ”
60124	60141	60117	60117	Hermione	172	“ no , it ’s not ... Ron ’s done loads of ... he ’s really ... ”
60165	60175	60176	60176	she	172	“ Ginny said the booklists had come at last , ”
60203	60265	60176	60176	she	172	“ If you give them to me I ’ll take them over to Diagon Alley this afternoon and get your books while you ’re packing . Ron , I ’ll have to get you more pajamas , these are at least six inches too short , I ca n’t believe how fast you ’re growing ... what color would you like ? ”
60266	60277	60279	60279	George	245	“ Get him red and gold to match his badge , ”
60283	60288	60290	60291	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Match his what ? ”
60309	60313	60315	60315	Fred	244	“ His badge , ”
60327	60336	60315	60315	Fred	244	“ His lovely shiny new prefect ’s badge . ”
60352	60364	60365	60365	Ron	333	“ His ... but ... Ron , you ’re not ... ? ”
60382	60412	60365	60365	Ron	333	“ I do n’t believe it ! I do n’t believe it ! Oh , Ron , how wonderful ! A prefect ! That ’s everyone in the family ! ”
60413	60425	60427	60427	George	245	“ What are Fred and I , next - door neighbors ? ”
60445	60506	60507	60507	Fred	244	“ Wait until your father hears ! Ron , I ’m so proud of you , what wonderful news , you could end up Head Boy just like Bill and Percy , it ’s the first step ! Oh , what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry , I ’m just thrilled , oh Ronnie — ”
60552	60564	60565	60565	he	333	“ Mum ... do n’t ... Mum , get a grip ... ”
60583	60607	60574	60574	She	750	“ Well , what will it be ? We gave Percy an owl , but you ’ve already got one , of course . ”
60608	60616	60618	60618	Ron	333	“ W - what do you mean ? ”
60631	60642	60644	60645	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ You ’ve got to have a reward for this ! ”
60648	60659	60644	60645	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ How about a nice new set of dress robes ? ”
60660	60668	60670	60670	Fred	244	“ We ’ve already bought him some , ”
60683	60707	60644	60645	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Or a new cauldron , Charlie ’s old one ’s rusting through , or a new rat , you always liked Scabbers — ”
60708	60711	60713	60713	Ron	333	“ Mum , ”
60716	60724	60713	60713	Ron	333	“ can I have a new broom ? ”
60736	60743	60744	60744	Ron	333	“ Not a really good one ! ”
60749	60760	60744	60744	Ron	333	“ Just — just a new one for a change ... ”
60768	60825	60761	60762	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Of course you can ... Well , I ’d better get going if I ’ve got a broom to buy too . I ’ll see you all later ... Little Ronnie , a prefect ! And do n’t forget to pack your trunks ... A prefect ... Oh , I ’m all of a dither ! ”
60851	60868	60870	60870	Fred	244	“ You do n’t mind if we do n’t kiss you , do you , Ron ? ”
60877	60886	60888	60888	George	245	“ We could curtsy , if you like , ”
60890	60896	60898	60898	Ron	333	“ Oh , shut up , ”
60904	60908	60910	60910	Fred	244	“ Or what ? ”
60920	60928	60910	60910	Fred	244	“ Going to put us in detention ? ”
60929	60938	60940	60940	George	245	“ I ’d love to see him try , ”
60942	60952	60954	60954	Hermione	172	“ He could if you do n’t watch out ! ”
60969	60975	60966	60966	Ron	333	“ Drop it , Hermione . ”
60976	60989	60991	60991	Fred	244	“ We ’re going to have to watch our step , George , ”
60997	61005	60991	60991	Fred	244	“ with these two on our case ... ”
61006	61021	61023	61023	George	245	“ Yeah , it looks like our law - breaking days are finally over , ”
61039	61043	61045	61045	Hermione	172	“ Those two ! ”
61071	61087	61062	61062	George	245	“ Do n’t pay any attention to them , Ron , they ’re only jealous ! ”
61088	61096	61098	61098	Ron	333	“ I do n’t think they are , ”
61108	61120	61121	61121	he	333	“ They ’ve always said only prats become prefects ... Still , ”
61128	61189	61121	61121	he	333	“ they ’ve never had new brooms ! I wish I could go with Mum and choose ... She ’ll never be able to afford a Nimbus , but there ’s the new Cleansweep out , that ’d be great ... Yeah , I think I ’ll go and tell her I like the Cleansweep , just so she knows ... ”
61246	61249	61251	61251	Hermione	172	“ Harry ? ”
61254	61258	61260	61260	Harry	156	“ Well done , ”
61281	61288	61260	61260	Harry	156	“ Brilliant . Prefect . Great . ”
61289	61292	61294	61294	Hermione	172	“ Thanks , ”
61296	61329	61294	61294	Hermione	172	“ Erm — Harry — could I borrow Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad ? They ’ll be really pleased — I mean , prefect is something they can understand — ”
61330	61336	61338	61338	Harry	156	“ Yeah , no problem , ”
61353	61357	61338	61338	Harry	156	“ Take her ! ”
61890	61903	61886	61886	Fred	244	“ No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect ... ”
62027	62032	62033	62033	he	156	“ Just caught her ! ”
62037	62049	62033	62033	he	156	“ She says she ’ll get the Cleansweep if she can . ”
62050	62053	62054	62054	Harry	156	“ Cool , ”
62071	62081	62064	62064	his	156	“ Listen — Ron — well done , mate . ”
62090	62099	62100	62100	he	156	“ I never thought it would be me ! ”
62107	62115	62100	62100	he	156	“ I thought it would be you ! ”
62116	62126	62127	62127	Harry	156	“ Nah , I ’ve caused too much trouble , ”
62133	62136	62138	62138	Ron	333	“ Yeah , ”
62140	62160	62138	62138	Ron	333	“ yeah , I suppose ... Well , we ’d better get our trunks packed , had n’t we ? ”
62328	62347	62348	62348	she	242	“ Never mind unwrapping it now , people are arriving for dinner , I want you all downstairs , ”
62425	62442	62443	62443	she	242	“ I thought we ’d have a little party , not a sit - down dinner , ”
62463	62486	62487	62487	she	242	“ Your father and Bill are on their way , Ron , I ’ve sent them both owls and they ’re thrilled , ”
62525	62537	62539	62540	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Oh , Alastor , I am glad you ’re here , ”
62553	62601	62544	62546	Mad - Eye	218	“ We ’ve been wanting to ask you for ages — could you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell us what ’s inside it ? We have n’t wanted to open it just in case it ’s something really nasty . ”
62602	62608	62609	62609	Moody	218	“ No problem , Molly ... ”
62627	62631	62632	62632	he	218	“ Drawing room ... ”
62640	62672	62632	62632	he	218	“ Desk in the corner ? Yeah , I see it ... Yeah , it ’s a boggart ... Want me to go up and get rid of it , Molly ? ”
62673	62685	62687	62688	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ No , no , I ’ll do it myself later , ”
62690	62708	62709	62709	She	242	“ You have your drink . We ’re having a little bit of a celebration , actually ... ”
62716	62723	62724	62724	she	242	“ Fourth prefect in the family ! ”
62733	62738	62740	62740	Moody	218	“ Prefect , eh ? ”
62781	62786	62788	62788	Moody	218	“ Well , congratulations , ”
62799	62825	62788	62788	Moody	218	“ authority figures always attract trouble , but I suppose Dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he would n’t have appointed you ... ”
62904	62915	62917	62918	Mr. Weasley	199	“ Well , I think a toast is in order , ”
62931	62942	62926	62926	He	199	“ To Ron and Hermione , the new Gryffindor prefects ! ”
62956	62964	62966	62966	Tonks	225	“ I was never a prefect myself , ”
63002	63014	62994	62994	she	1501	“ My Head of House said I lacked certain necessary qualities . ”
63015	63019	63021	63021	Ginny	247	“ Like what ? ”
63030	63038	63040	63040	Tonks	225	“ Like the ability to behave myself , ”
63073	63080	63081	63081	Ginny	247	“ What about you , Sirius ? ”
63105	63136	63100	63100	his	174	“ No one would have made me a prefect , I spent too much time in detention with James . Lupin was the good boy , he got the badge . ”
63137	63158	63160	63160	Lupin	221	“ I think Dumbledore might have hoped that I would be able to exercise some control over my best friends , ”
63162	63172	63160	63160	Lupin	221	“ I need scarcely say that I failed dismally . ”
63226	63265	63213	63213	Ron	333	“ ... naught to seventy in ten seconds , not bad , is it ? When you think the Comet Two Ninety ’s only naught to sixty and that ’s with a decent tailwind according to Which Broomstick ? ”
63280	63317	63266	63266	Hermione	172	“ I mean , it ’s the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation , is n’t it ? It all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking they ’re superior to other creatures ... ”
63332	63361	63324	63324	their	1507	“ ... getting really out of hand , and you ’re so good - looking , it would look much better shorter , would n’t it , Harry ? ”
63362	63368	63370	63370	Harry	156	“ Oh — I dunno — ”
63418	63423	63424	63424	he	244	“ It ’s okay , ”
63428	63440	63424	63424	he	244	“ we can trust Harry , he ’s our financial backer . ”
63441	63449	63451	63451	George	245	“ Look what Dung ’s gotten us , ”
63487	63492	63494	63494	George	245	“ Venomous Tentacula seeds , ”
63496	63528	63494	63494	George	245	“ We need them for the Skiving Snackboxes but they ’re a Class C Non - Tradeable Substance so we ’ve been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them . ”
63529	63539	63541	63541	Fred	244	“ Ten Galleons the lot , then , Dung ? ”
63543	63555	63557	63557	Mundungus	190	“ Wiv all the trouble I went to to get ’em ? ”
63568	63585	63557	63557	Mundungus	190	“ I ’m sorry , lads , but I ’m not taking a Knut under twenty . ”
63586	63593	63594	63594	Fred	244	“ Dung likes his little joke , ”
63599	63618	63620	63620	George	245	“ Yeah , his best one so far has been six Sickles for a bag of knarl quills , ”
63622	63626	63627	63627	Harry	156	“ Be careful , ”
63632	63635	63637	63637	Fred	244	“ What ? ”
63639	63652	63637	63637	Fred	244	“ Mum ’s busy cooing over Prefect Ron , we ’re okay . ”
63653	63663	63664	63664	Harry	156	“ But Moody could have his eye on you , ”
63675	63681	63682	63682	he	190	“ Good point , that , ”
63685	63702	63682	63682	he	190	“ All right , lads , ten it is , if you ’ll take ’em quick . ”
63703	63708	63710	63710	Fred	244	“ Cheers , Harry ! ”
63732	63740	63717	63717	his	190	“ We ’d better get these upstairs ... ”
63900	63911	63913	63913	Kingsley	226	“ ... why Dumbledore did n’t make Potter a prefect ? ”
63915	63923	63925	63925	Lupin	221	“ He ’ll have had his reasons , ”
63927	63945	63947	63947	Kingsley	226	“ But it would ’ve shown confidence in him . It ’s what I ’d ’ve done , ”
63949	63965	63947	63947	Kingsley	226	“ ’ specially with the Daily Prophet having a go at him every few days ... ”
64059	64080	64081	64081	Ron	333	“ ... the handle ’s made of Spanish oak with anti - jinx varnish and in - built vibration control — ”
64092	64130	64087	64088	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Well , I think I ’ll sort out that boggart before I turn in ... Arthur , I do n’t want this lot up too late , all right ? ’ Night , Harry , dear . ”
64152	64159	64161	64161	Moody	218	“ You all right , Potter ? ”
64163	64168	64170	64170	Harry	156	“ Yeah , fine , ”
64190	64203	64204	64204	he	218	“ Come here , I ’ve got something that might interest you , ”
64223	64230	64232	64232	Moody	218	“ Original Order of the Phoenix , ”
64234	64271	64232	64232	Moody	218	“ Found it last night when I was looking for my spare Invisibility Cloak , seeing as Podmore has n’t had the manners to return my best one ... Thought people might like to see it . ”
64299	64304	64306	64306	Moody	218	“ There ’s me , ”
64334	64377	64322	64322	his	218	“ And there ’s Dumbledore beside me , Dedalus Diggle on the other side ... That ’s Marlene McKinnon , she was killed two weeks after this was taken , they got her whole family . That ’s Frank and Alice Longbottom — ”
64422	64426	64428	64428	Moody	218	“ Poor devils , ”
64430	64478	64479	64479	he	218	“ Better dead than what happened to them ... and that ’s Emmeline Vance , you ’ve met her , and that there ’s Lupin , obviously ... Benjy Fenwick , he copped it too , we only ever found bits of him ... shift aside there , ”
64507	64614	64479	64479	he	218	“ That ’s Edgar Bones ... brother of Amelia Bones , they got him and his family too , he was a great wizard ... Sturgis Podmore , blimey , he looks young ... Caradoc Dearborn , vanished six months after this , we never found his body ... Hagrid , of course , looks exactly the same as ever ... Elphias Doge , you ’ve met him , I ’d forgotten he used to wear that stupid hat ... Gideon Prewett , it took five Death Eaters to kill him and his brother Fabian , they fought like heroes ... budge along , budge along ... ”
64640	64690	64691	64691	Harry	156	“ That ’s Dumbledore ’s brother , Aberforth , only time I ever met him , strange bloke ... That ’s Dorcas Meadowes , Voldemort killed her personally ... Sirius , when he still had short hair ... and ... there you go , thought that would interest you ! ”
64745	64748	64750	64750	Moody	218	“ Eh ? ”
64781	64784	64786	64786	Harry	156	“ Yeah , ”
64793	64809	64786	64786	Harry	156	“ Er ... listen , I ’ve just remembered , I have n’t packed my ... ”
64829	64842	64824	64824	Sirius	174	“ What ’s that you ’ve got there , Mad - Eye ? ”
65046	65049	65050	65050	Harry	156	“ Hello ? ”
65176	65180	65181	65181	Harry	156	“ Mrs. Weasley ? ”
65184	65191	65197	65197	her	242	“ R - r - riddikulus ! ”
65236	65241	65242	65242	she	242	“ R - riddikulus ! ”
65269	65272	65273	65274	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ No ! ”
65277	65286	65273	65274	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ No ... riddikulus ! Riddikulus ! RIDDIKULUS ! ”
65287	65297	65299	65299	Harry	156	“ Mrs. Weasley , just get out of here ! ”
65312	65317	65299	65299	Harry	156	“ Let someone else — ”
65318	65324	65325	65325	Lupin	221	“ What ’s going on ? ”
65378	65381	65370	65370	he	221	“ Riddikulus ! ”
65418	65425	65431	65431	she	242	“ Oh — oh — oh ! ”
65445	65448	65450	65450	Lupin	221	“ Molly , ”
65458	65464	65450	65450	Lupin	221	“ Molly , do n’t ... ”
65478	65487	65488	65488	he	221	“ Molly , it was just a boggart , ”
65498	65504	65488	65488	he	221	“ Just a stupid boggart ... ”
65505	65518	65519	65520	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ I see them d - d - dead all the time ! ”
65526	65544	65519	65520	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ All the t - t - time ! I d - d - dream about it ... ”
65598	65607	65608	65609	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ D - d - don’t tell Arthur , ”
65622	65637	65608	65609	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ I d - d - don’t want him to know ... Being silly ... ”
65649	65664	65665	65665	she	242	“ Harry , I ’m so sorry , what must you think of me ? ”
65669	65680	65665	65665	she	242	“ Not even able to get rid of a boggart ... ”
65681	65687	65689	65689	Harry	156	“ Do n’t be stupid , ”
65695	65706	65707	65707	she	242	“ I ’m just s - s - so worried , ”
65718	65806	65707	65707	she	242	“ Half the f - f - family ’s in the Order , it ’ll b - b - be a miracle if we all come through this ... and P - P - Percy ’s not talking to us ... What if something d - d - dreadful happens and we had never m - m - made up ? And what ’s going to happen if Arthur and I get killed , who ’s g - g - going to look after Ron and Ginny ? ”
65807	65814	65816	65816	Lupin	221	“ Molly , that ’s enough , ”
65819	65848	65816	65816	Lupin	221	“ This is n’t like last time . The Order is better prepared , we ’ve got a head start , we know what Voldemort ’s up to — ”
65864	65949	65849	65850	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Oh , Molly , come on , it ’s about time you got used to hearing it — look , I ca n’t promise no one ’s going to get hurt , nobody can promise that , but we ’re much better off than we were last time , you were n’t in the Order then , you do n’t understand , last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the Death Eaters and they were picking us off one by one ... ”
65972	65979	65981	65981	Sirius	174	“ Do n’t worry about Percy , ”
65984	66032	66033	66033	he	174	“ He ’ll come round . It ’s a matter of time before Voldemort moves into the open ; once he does , the whole Ministry ’s going to be begging us to forgive them . And I ’m not sure I ’ll be accepting their apology , ”
66037	66056	66058	66058	Lupin	221	“ And as for who ’s going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and Arthur died , ”
66063	66076	66058	66058	Lupin	221	“ what do you think we ’d do , let them starve ? ”
66082	66086	66087	66087	she	242	“ Being silly , ”
66194	66199	66200	66200	he	156	“ Cut it out , ”
66213	66225	66200	66200	he	156	“ First sign of madness , talking to your own head , ”
66355	66376	66347	66347	Ron	333	“ ... better hurry up , Mum ’s going ballistic , she says we ’re going to miss the train ... ”
66491	66499	66481	66481	she	172	“ Mum and Dad just sent Hedwig back ”
66514	66520	66481	66481	she	172	“ are you ready yet ? ”
66521	66528	66529	66529	Harry	156	“ Nearly — Ginny all right ? ”
66537	66545	66547	66547	Hermione	172	“ Mrs. Weasley ’s patched her up , ”
66549	66576	66547	66547	Hermione	172	“ But now Mad - Eye ’s complaining that we ca n’t leave unless Sturgis Podmore ’s here , otherwise the guard will be one short . ”
66577	66580	66582	66582	Harry	156	“ Guard ? ”
66584	66597	66582	66582	Harry	156	“ We have to go to King ’s Cross with a guard ? ”
66598	66611	66612	66612	Hermione	172	“ You have to go to King ’s Cross with a guard , ”
66616	66619	66621	66621	Harry	156	“ Why ? ”
66624	66657	66621	66621	Harry	156	“ I thought Voldemort was supposed to be lying low , or are you telling me he ’s going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do me in ? ”
66658	66673	66675	66675	Hermione	172	“ I do n’t know , it ’s just what Mad - Eye says , ”
66683	66700	66675	66675	Hermione	172	“ But if we do n’t leave soon we ’re definitely going to miss the train ... ”
66701	66712	66713	66714	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ WILL YOU LOT GET DOWN HERE NOW , PLEASE ! ”
66784	66796	66798	66799	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Harry , you ’re to come with me and Tonks , ”
66805	66814	66798	66799	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ MUDBLOODS ! SCUM ! CREATURES OF DIRT ! ”
66815	66845	66798	66799	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Leave your trunk and your owl , Alastor ’s going to deal with the luggage ... Oh , for heaven ’s sake , Sirius , Dumbledore said no ! ”
66872	66876	66878	66879	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Oh honestly ... ”
66882	66892	66878	66879	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ well , on your own head be it ! ”
66930	66935	66936	66936	Harry	156	“ Where ’s Tonks ? ”
66961	66971	66973	66974	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ She ’s waiting for us just up here , ”
67013	67018	67019	67019	she	1573	“ Wotcher , Harry , ”
67024	67035	67036	67036	she	1573	“ Better hurry up , had n’t we , Molly ? ”
67043	67050	67056	67056	her	242	“ I know , I know , ”
67059	67108	67052	67053	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ but Mad - Eye wanted to wait for Sturgis ... If only Arthur could have got us cars from the Ministry again ... but Fudge would n’t let him borrow so much as an empty ink bottle these days ... How Muggles can stand traveling without magic ... ”
67273	67283	67285	67286	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ I hope the others make it in time , ”
67309	67315	67317	67321	a tall boy with dreadlocks	1586	“ Nice dog , Harry ! ”
67323	67328	67330	67330	Harry	156	“ Thanks , Lee , ”
67341	67345	67347	67348	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ Oh good , ”
67353	67363	67347	67348	Mrs. Weasley	242	“ here ’s Alastor with the luggage , look ... ”
67389	67393	67394	67394	he	224	“ All okay , ”
67402	67410	67394	67394	he	224	“ Do n’t think we were followed ... ”
67445	67449	67451	67451	Moody	224	“ No trouble ? ”
67453	67456	67458	67458	Lupin	221	“ Nothing , ”
67460	67470	67472	67472	Moody	224	“ I ’ll still be reporting Sturgis to Dumbledore , ”
67474	67495	67472	67472	Moody	224	“ That ’s the second time he ’s not turned up in a week . Getting as unreliable as Mundungus . ”
67496	67503	67505	67505	Lupin	221	“ Well , look after yourselves , ”
67525	67534	67512	67512	He	221	“ You too , Harry . Be careful . ”

74290	74297	74299	74299	Harry	156	“ Of course he has n’t , ”
74302	74318	74320	74320	Hermione	172	“ You do n’t think he ’s ... hurt , or anything , do you ? ”
74323	74326	74328	74328	Harry	156	“ No , ”
74332	74340	74328	74328	Harry	156	“ But where is he , then ? ”
74364	74390	74347	74347	Harry	156	“ Maybe he ’s not back yet . You know — from his mission — the thing he was doing over the summer for Dumbledore . ”
74391	74401	74403	74403	Ron	333	“ Yeah ... yeah , that ’ll be it , ”
74433	74438	74439	74439	she	172	“ Who ’s that ? ”
74598	74605	74562	74562	she	1736	“ It ’s that Umbridge woman ! ”
74606	74609	74611	74611	Hermione	172	“ Who ? ”
74613	74625	74562	74562	she	1736	“ She was at my hearing , she works for Fudge ! ”
74626	74630	74632	74632	Ron	333	“ Nice cardigan , ”
74636	74642	74643	74643	Hermione	172	“ She works for Fudge ? ”
74648	74659	74643	74643	Hermione	172	“ What on earth ’s she doing here , then ? ”
74660	74663	74664	74664	Hermione	172	“ Dunno ... ”
74674	74677	74678	74678	she	1736	“ No , ”
74681	74687	74678	74678	she	1736	“ no , surely not ... ”
74981	74993	74995	74995	Ron	333	“ Branched out a bit this year , has n’t it ? ”
75001	75007	75009	75009	Harry	156	“ Too right it has , ”
75053	75064	75066	75066	Hermione	172	“ I wonder if it ’s ever given warnings before ? ”
75072	75077	75079	75081	Nearly Headless Nick	381	“ Yes , indeed , ”
75106	75124	75079	75081	Nearly Headless Nick	381	“ The hat feels itself honor - bound to give the school due warning whenever it feels — ”
75208	75213	75196	75196	her	306	“ Abercrombie , Euan . ”
75268	75271	75272	75272	Harry	156	“ GRYFFINDOR ! ”
75345	75349	75382	75382	Dumbledore	176	“ Zeller , Rose ”
75466	75471	75473	75473	Dumbledore	176	“ To our newcomers , ”
75491	75519	75479	75479	his	176	“ welcome ! To our old hands — welcome back ! There is a time for speech making , but this is not it . Tuck in ! ”
75591	75594	75596	75596	Ron	333	“ Excellent , ”
75629	75638	75639	75639	Hermione	172	“ What were you saying before the Sorting ? ”
75644	75651	75641	75642	the ghost	1766	“ About the hat giving warnings ? ”
75652	75656	75658	75658	Nick	381	“ Oh yes , ”
75683	75730	75670	75670	Ron	333	“ Yes , I have heard the hat give several warnings before , always at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school . And always , of course , its advice is the same : Stand together , be strong from within . ”
75731	75739	75741	75741	Ron	333	“ Ow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat ? ”
75764	75770	75772	75774	Nearly Headless Nick	381	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
75790	75807	75782	75782	Ron	333	“ How can it know if the school ’s in danger if it ’s a hat ? ”
75808	75814	75816	75818	Nearly Headless Nick	381	“ I have no idea , ”
75820	75840	75816	75818	Nearly Headless Nick	381	“ Of course , it lives in Dumbledore ’s office , so I daresay it picks things up there . ”
75841	75852	75854	75854	Harry	156	“ And it wants all the Houses to be friends ? ”
75870	75874	75864	75865	Draco Malfoy	298	“ Fat chance . ”
75875	75887	75889	75889	Nick	381	“ Well , now , you should n’t take that attitude , ”
75892	75939	75889	75889	Nick	381	“ Peaceful cooperation , that ’s the key . We ghosts , though we belong to separate Houses , maintain links of friendship . In spite of the competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin , I would never dream of seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron . ”
75940	75949	75951	75951	Ron	333	“ Only because you ’re terrified of him , ”
75960	75993	75889	75889	Nick	381	“ Terrified ? I hope I , Sir Nicholas de Mimsy - Porpington , have never been guilty of cowardice in my life ! The noble blood that runs in my veins — ”
75994	75998	76000	76000	Ron	333	“ What blood ? ”
76002	76011	76000	76000	Ron	333	“ Surely you have n’t still got — ? ”
76012	76020	76022	76024	Nearly Headless Nick	381	“ It ’s a figure of speech ! ”
76040	76086	76029	76029	his	381	“ I assume I am still allowed to enjoy the use of whichever words I like , even if the pleasures of eating and drinking are denied me ! But I am quite used to students poking fun at my death , I assure you ! ”
76087	76098	76100	76100	Hermione	172	“ Nick , he was n’t really laughing at you ! ”
76126	76132	76122	76122	he	333	“ node iddum eentup sechew , ”
76180	76186	76188	76188	Hermione	172	“ Well done , Ron , ”
76190	76193	76195	76195	Ron	333	“ What ? ”
76208	76219	76195	76195	Ron	333	“ I ’m not allowed to ask a simple question ? ”
76220	76225	76227	76227	Hermione	172	“ Oh forget it , ”
76355	76386	76388	76388	Dumbledore	176	“ Well , now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast , I beg a few moments of your attention for the usual start - of - term notices , ”
76390	76423	76388	76388	Dumbledore	176	“ First years ought to know that the forest in the grounds is out of bounds to students — and a few of our older students ought to know by now too . ”
76435	76552	76590	76590	Dumbledore	176	“ Mr. Filch , the caretaker , has asked me , for what he tells me is the four hundred and sixty - second time , to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes , nor are a number of other things , all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr. Filch ’s office door . We have had two changes in staffing this year . We are very pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly - Plank , who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures lessons ; we are also delighted to introduce Professor Umbridge , our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher . ”
76593	76606	76590	76590	Dumbledore	176	“ Tryouts for the House Quidditch teams will take place on the — ”
76646	76651	76642	76643	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Hem , hem , ”
76773	76779	76780	76781	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Thank you , Headmaster , ”
76784	76792	76780	76781	Professor Umbridge	390	“ for those kind words of welcome . ”
76854	76858	76845	76845	She	1779	“ Hem , hem ”
76863	76879	76845	76845	She	1779	“ Well , it is lovely to be back at Hogwarts , I must say ! ”
76888	76901	76880	76880	She	1779	“ And to see such happy little faces looking back at me ! ”
76937	76962	76920	76920	they	1781	“ I am very much looking forward to getting to know you all , and I ’m sure we ’ll be very good friends ! ”
76977	76995	76996	76996	Parvati	379	“ I ’ll be her friend as long as I do n’t have to borrow that cardigan , ”
77017	77021	77013	77013	her	390	“ Hem , hem ”
77060	77154	77026	77026	she	390	“ The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance . The rare gifts with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and honed by careful instruction . The ancient skills unique to the Wizarding community must be passed down through the generations lest we lose them forever . The treasure trove of magical knowledge amassed by our ancestors must be guarded , replenished , and polished by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching . ”
77207	77211	77203	77203	Umbridge	390	“ Hem , hem ”
77219	77301	77194	77194	her	306	“ Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school , and that is as it should be , for without progress there will be stagnation and decay . There again , progress for progress ’s sake must be discouraged , for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering . A balance , then , between old and new , between permanence and change , between tradition and innovation ... ”
77506	77607	77608	77608	She	172	“ ... because some changes will be for the better , while others will come , in the fullness of time , to be recognized as errors of judgment . Meanwhile , some old habits will be retained , and rightly so , whereas others , outmoded and outworn , must be abandoned . Let us move forward , then , into a new era of openness , effectiveness , and accountability , intent on preserving what ought to be preserved , perfecting what needs to be perfected , and pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited . ”
77684	77698	77699	77699	he	176	“ Thank you very much , Professor Umbridge , that was most illuminating , ”
77706	77720	77699	77699	he	176	“ Now — as I was saying , Quidditch tryouts will be held ... ”
77721	77729	77731	77731	Hermione	172	“ Yes , it certainly was illuminating , ”
77737	77747	77748	77748	Ron	333	“ You ’re not telling me you enjoyed it ? ”
77759	77778	77748	77748	Ron	333	“ That was about the dullest speech I ’ve ever heard , and I grew up with Percy . ”
77779	77787	77789	77789	Hermione	172	“ I said illuminating , not enjoyable , ”
77791	77797	77789	77789	Hermione	172	“ It explained a lot . ”
77798	77802	77804	77804	Harry	156	“ Did it ? ”
77808	77818	77804	77804	Harry	156	“ Sounded like a load of waffle to me . ”
77819	77830	77832	77832	Hermione	172	“ There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle , ”
77835	77839	77841	77841	Ron	333	“ Was there ? ”
77844	77873	77841	77841	Ron	333	“ How about ‘ progress for progress ’s sake must be discouraged ’ ? How about ‘ pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited ’ ? ”
77874	77882	77884	77884	Ron	333	“ Well , what does that mean ? ”
77887	77896	77898	77898	Hermione	172	“ I ’ll tell you what it means , ”
77901	77911	77898	77898	Hermione	172	“ It means the Ministry ’s interfering at Hogwarts . ”
77949	77964	77942	77942	Hermione	172	“ Ron , we ’re supposed to show the first years where to go ! ”
77965	77969	77971	77971	Ron	333	“ Oh yeah , ”
77978	77987	77971	77971	Ron	333	“ Hey — hey you lot ! Midgets ! ”
77988	77991	78019	78019	Hermione	172	“ Ron ! ”
77992	78002	77971	77971	Ron	333	“ Well , they are , they ’re titchy ... ”
78003	78018	78019	78019	Hermione	172	“ I know , but you ca n’t call them midgets ... First years ! ”
78026	78032	78019	78019	Hermione	172	“ This way , please ! ”
78132	78137	78138	78138	he	156	“ See you later , ”
78353	78356	78357	78357	he	156	“ Er ... ”
78384	78391	78392	78392	she	1818	“ No password , no entrance , ”
78396	78403	78404	78404	someone	571	“ Harry , I know it ! ”
78420	78439	78440	78440	He	156	“ Guess what it is ? I ’m actually going to be able to remember it for once — ”
78454	78458	78446	78446	he	156	“ Mimbulus mimbletonia ! ”
78459	78462	78464	78466	the Fat Lady	391	“ Correct , ”
78663	78666	78667	78667	he	156	“ Hi , ”
78680	78685	78687	78687	Dean	392	“ Hey , Harry , ”
78703	78707	78687	78687	Dean	392	“ Good holiday ? ”
78708	78712	78714	78714	Harry	156	“ Not bad , ”
78739	78742	78714	78714	Harry	156	“ You ? ”
78743	78750	78752	78752	Dean	392	“ Yeah , it was okay , ”
78754	78767	78752	78752	Dean	392	“ Better than Seamus ’s anyway , he was just telling me . ”
78768	78776	78777	78777	Neville	342	“ Why , what happened , Seamus ? ”
78830	78841	78819	78819	he	393	“ Me mam did n’t want me to come back . ”
78842	78845	78847	78847	Harry	156	“ What ? ”
78859	78871	78819	78819	he	393	“ She did n’t want me to come back to Hogwarts . ”
78894	78899	78901	78901	Harry	156	“ But — why ? ”
78944	78947	78948	78948	he	393	“ Well , ”
78955	78963	78948	78948	he	393	“ I suppose ... because of you . ”
78964	78969	78971	78971	Harry	156	“ What d’you mean ? ”
78993	78996	78998	78998	Seamus	393	“ Well , ”
79007	79025	78998	78998	Seamus	393	“ she ... er ... well , it ’s not just you , it ’s Dumbledore too ... ”
79026	79033	79035	79035	Harry	156	“ She believes the Daily Prophet ? ”
79037	79051	79035	79035	Harry	156	“ She thinks I ’m a liar and Dumbledore ’s an old fool ? ”
79058	79065	79052	79052	Seamus	393	“ Yeah , something like that . ”
79187	79208	79184	79184	Seamus	393	“ Look ... what did happen that night when ... you know , when ... with Cedric Diggory and all ? ”
79246	79254	79255	79255	Harry	156	“ What are you asking me for ? ”
79258	79283	79255	79255	Harry	156	“ Just read the Daily Prophet like your mother , why do n’t you ? That ’ll tell you all you need to know . ”
79284	79295	79297	79297	Seamus	393	“ Do n’t you have a go at my mother , ”
79299	79313	79315	79315	Harry	156	“ I ’ll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar , ”
79317	79326	79255	79255	Harry	156	“ Do n’t talk to me like that ! ”
79327	79337	79339	79339	Harry	156	“ I ’ll talk to you how I want , ”
79356	79384	79346	79346	he	156	“ If you ’ve got a problem sharing a dormitory with me , go and ask McGonagall if you can be moved , stop your mummy worrying — ”
79385	79395	79403	79403	Ron	333	“ Leave my mother out of this , Potter ! ”
79396	79402	79346	79346	he	156	“ What ’s going on ? ”
79442	79452	79453	79453	Seamus	393	“ He ’s having a go at my mother ! ”
79456	79459	79461	79461	Ron	333	“ What ? ”
79463	79479	79461	79461	Ron	333	“ Harry would n’t do that — we met your mother , we liked her ... ”
79480	79497	79499	79499	Harry	156	“ That ’s before she started believing every word the stinking Daily Prophet writes about me ! ”
79507	79510	79512	79512	Ron	333	“ Oh , ”
79521	79526	79512	79512	Ron	333	“ Oh ... right . ”
79527	79532	79534	79534	Seamus	393	“ You know what ? ”
79543	79565	79538	79538	Harry	156	“ He ’s right , I do n’t want to share a dormitory with him anymore , he ’s a madman . ”
79566	79575	79577	79577	Ron	333	“ That ’s out of order , Seamus , ”
79592	79600	79602	79602	Seamus	393	“ Out of order , am I ? ”
79613	79642	79602	79602	Seamus	393	“ You believe all the rubbish he ’s come out with about You - Know - Who , do you , you reckon he ’s telling the truth ? ”
79643	79649	79651	79651	Ron	333	“ Yeah , I do ! ”
79654	79661	79663	79663	Seamus	393	“ Then you ’re mad too , ”
79667	79683	79685	79685	Ron	333	“ Yeah ? Well unfortunately for you , pal , I ’m also a prefect ! ”
79696	79707	79685	79685	Ron	333	“ So unless you want detention , watch your mouth ! ”
79786	79797	79798	79798	he	333	“ Anyone else ’s parents got a problem with Harry ? ”
79802	79810	79812	79812	Dean	392	“ My parents are Muggles , mate , ”
79816	79838	79812	79812	Dean	392	“ They do n’t know nothing about no deaths at Hogwarts , because I ’m not stupid enough to tell them . ”
79839	79855	79856	79856	Seamus	393	“ You do n’t know my mother , she ’ll weasel anything out of anyone ! ”
79861	79898	79856	79856	Seamus	393	“ Anyway , your parents do n’t get the Daily Prophet , they do n’t know our headmaster ’s been sacked from the Wizengamot and the International Confederation of Wizards because he ’s losing his marbles — ”
79899	79907	79910	79910	Neville	342	“ My gran says that ’s rubbish , ”
79912	79938	79939	79939	he	342	“ She says it ’s the Daily Prophet that ’s going downhill , not Dumbledore . She ’s canceled our subscription . We believe Harry , ”
79963	79993	79943	79943	He	342	“ My gran ’s always said You - Know - Who would come back one day . She says if Dumbledore says he ’s back , he ’s back . ”
80276	80297	80299	80299	Harry	156	“ Does he think he ’ll turn into a nutter if he stays in a room with me too long ? ”
80314	80323	80324	80324	Dean	392	“ Do n’t worry about it , Harry , ”
80334	80339	80324	80324	Dean	392	“ He ’s just ... ”
80402	80408	80410	80410	Hermione	172	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
80433	80444	80420	80420	Ron	333	“ You look absolutely — oh for heaven ’s sake . ”
80522	80528	80530	80530	Hermione	172	“ They are the limit , ”
80559	80570	80539	80539	Fred	244	“ We ’ll have to talk to them , Ron . ”
80576	80579	80571	80571	Ron	333	“ Why ? ”
80580	80586	80588	80588	Hermione	172	“ Because we ’re prefects ! ”
80599	80612	80588	80588	Hermione	172	“ It ’s up to us to stop this kind of thing ! ”
80645	80654	80655	80655	Hermione	172	“ Anyway , what ’s up , Harry ? ”
80688	80696	80675	80677	all of whom	1858	“ You look really angry about something . ”
80697	80710	80712	80712	Ron	333	“ Seamus reckons Harry ’s lying about You - Know - Who , ”
80736	80744	80745	80745	she	172	“ Yes , Lavender thinks so too , ”
80749	80775	80776	80776	Harry	156	“ Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I ’m a lying , attention - seeking prat , have you ? ”
80780	80783	80785	80785	Hermione	172	“ No , ”
80788	80836	80785	80785	Hermione	172	“ I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you , actually . And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down Ron ’s and my throats , Harry , because if you have n’t noticed , we ’re on your side . ”
80843	80846	80848	80848	Harry	156	“ Sorry , ”
80854	80861	80863	80863	Hermione	172	“ That ’s quite all right , ”
80873	80892	80868	80868	she	172	“ Do n’t you remember what Dumbledore said at the end - of - term feast last year ? ”
80907	80947	80903	80903	Hermione	172	“ About You - Know - Who . He said , ‘ His gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great . We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust — ’ ”
80948	80957	80959	80959	Ron	333	“ How do you remember stuff like that ? ”
80967	80973	80975	80975	Hermione	172	“ I listen , Ron , ”
80982	80997	80903	80903	Hermione	172	“ So do I , but I still could n’t tell you exactly what — ”
80998	81002	81003	81003	Hermione	172	“ The point , ”
81008	81059	81003	81003	Hermione	172	“ is that this sort of thing is exactly what Dumbledore was talking about . You - Know - Who ’s only been back two months , and we ’ve started fighting among ourselves . And the Sorting Hat ’s warning was the same — stand together , be united — ”
81060	81068	81070	81070	Ron	333	“ And Harry said it last night , ”
81072	81089	81070	81070	Ron	333	“ if that means we ’re supposed to get matey with the Slytherins , fat chance . ”
81090	81112	81114	81114	Hermione	172	“ Well , I think it ’s a pity we ’re not trying for a bit of inter - House unity , ”
81161	81178	81180	81180	Harry	156	“ Yeah , we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like that , ”
81246	81262	81263	81263	he	156	“ Dumbledore did n’t even mention how long that Grubbly - Plank woman ’s staying , ”
81277	81280	81282	81282	Hermione	172	“ Maybe ... ”
81285	81288	81291	81291	Harry	156	“ What ? ”
81296	81313	81340	81340	Hermione	172	“ Well ... maybe he did n’t want to draw attention to Hagrid not being here . ”
81314	81324	81326	81326	Ron	333	“ What d’you mean , draw attention to it ? ”
81331	81338	81326	81326	Ron	333	“ How could we not notice ? ”
81359	81364	81344	81352	a tall black girl with long , braided hair	1866	“ Hi , Angelina . ”
81365	81368	81369	81369	she	1866	“ Hi , ”
81373	81377	81369	81369	she	1866	“ good summer ? ”
81385	81396	81369	81369	she	1866	“ Listen , I ’ve been made Gryffindor Quidditch Captain . ”
81397	81401	81403	81403	Harry	156	“ Nice one , ”
81436	81480	81409	81409	he	156	“ Yeah , well , we need a new Keeper now Oliver ’s left . Tryouts are on Friday at five o’clock and I want the whole team there , all right ? Then we can see how the new person’ll fit in . ”
81481	81484	81486	81486	Harry	156	“ Okay , ”
81496	81504	81506	81506	Hermione	172	“ I ’d forgotten Wood had left , ”
81522	81535	81506	81506	Hermione	172	“ I suppose that will make quite a difference to the team ? ”
81536	81540	81542	81542	Harry	156	“ I s’pose , ”
81549	81556	81542	81542	Harry	156	“ He was a good Keeper ... ”
81557	81573	81575	81575	Ron	333	“ Still , it wo n’t hurt to have some new blood , will it ? ”
81693	81702	81704	81704	Harry	156	“ What are you still getting that for ? ”
81731	81741	81712	81712	Hermione	172	“ I ’m not bothering ... load of rubbish . ”
81742	81754	81756	81756	Hermione	172	“ It ’s best to know what the enemy are saying , ”
81779	81782	81783	81783	she	172	“ Nothing , ”
81799	81808	81783	81783	she	172	“ Nothing about you or Dumbledore or anything . ”
81821	81826	81828	81828	Ron	333	“ Look at today ! ”
81830	81877	81828	81828	Ron	333	“ History of Magic , double Potions , Divination , and double Defense Against the Dark Arts ... Binns , Snape , Trelawney , and that Umbridge woman all in one day ! I wish Fred and George’d hurry up and get those Skiving Snackboxes sorted ... ”
81878	81885	81887	81887	Fred	244	“ Do mine ears deceive me ? ”
81900	81912	81887	81887	Fred	244	“ Hogwarts prefects surely do n’t wish to skive off lessons ? ”
81913	81921	81923	81923	Ron	333	“ Look what we ’ve got today , ”
81934	81945	81923	81923	Ron	333	“ That ’s the worst Monday I ’ve ever seen . ”
81946	81953	81955	81955	Fred	244	“ Fair point , little bro , ”
81961	81975	81955	81955	Fred	244	“ You can have a bit of Nosebleed Nougat cheap if you like . ”
81976	81982	81984	81984	Ron	333	“ Why ’s it cheap ? ”
81987	82006	82008	82008	George	245	“ Because you ’ll keep bleeding till you shrivel up , we have n’t got an antidote yet , ”
82016	82019	82021	82021	Ron	333	“ Cheers , ”
82028	82038	82021	82021	Ron	333	“ but I think I ’ll take the lessons . ”
82039	82047	82049	82049	Hermione	172	“ And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes , ”
82057	82070	82054	82054	George	245	“ you ca n’t advertise for testers on the Gryffindor notice board . ”
82071	82075	82077	82077	George	245	“ Says who ? ”
82082	82086	82088	82088	Hermione	172	“ Says me , ”
82090	82094	82088	82088	Hermione	172	“ And Ron . ”
82095	82102	82104	82104	Ron	333	“ Leave me out of it , ”
82117	82130	82132	82132	Fred	244	“ You ’ll be singing a different tune soon enough , Hermione , ”
82139	82158	82132	82132	Fred	244	“ You ’re starting your fifth year , you ’ll be begging us for a Snackbox before long . ”
82159	82173	82175	82175	Hermione	172	“ And why would starting fifth year mean I want a Skiving Snackbox ? ”
82177	82184	82186	82186	George	245	“ Fifth year ’s O.W.L. year , ”
82188	82191	82132	82132	Fred	244	“ So ? ”
82192	82223	82225	82225	Fred	244	“ So you ’ve got your exams coming up , have n’t you ? They ’ll be keeping your noses so hard to that grindstone they ’ll be rubbed raw , ”
82229	82241	82243	82243	George	245	“ Half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to O.W.L.s , ”
82246	82258	82243	82243	George	245	“ Tears and tantrums ... Patricia Stimpson kept coming over faint ... ”
82259	82270	82272	82272	Fred	244	“ Kenneth Towler came out in boils , d’you remember ? ”
82275	82287	82289	82289	George	245	“ That ’s ’cause you put Bulbadox Powder in his pajamas , ”
82291	82295	82297	82297	Fred	244	“ Oh yeah , ”
82301	82316	82297	82297	Fred	244	“ I ’d forgotten ... Hard to keep track sometimes , is n’t it ? ”
82317	82331	82333	82333	George	245	“ Anyway , it ’s a nightmare of a year , the fifth , ”
82335	82355	82333	82333	George	245	“ If you care about exam results anyway . Fred and I managed to keep our spirits up somehow . ”
82356	82370	82372	82372	Ron	333	“ Yeah ... you got , what was it , three O.W.L.s each ? ”
82374	82377	82379	82379	Fred	244	“ Yep , ”
82382	82396	82379	82379	Fred	244	“ But we feel our futures lie outside the world of academic achievement . ”
82397	82414	82416	82416	George	245	“ We seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for our seventh year , ”
82419	82426	82416	82416	George	245	“ now that we ’ve got — ”
82453	82463	82464	82464	George	245	“ — now that we ’ve got our O.W.L.s , ”
82468	82506	82464	82464	George	245	“ I mean , do we really need N.E.W.T.s ? But we did n’t think Mum could take us leaving school early , not on top of Percy turning out to be the world ’s biggest prat . ”
82507	82521	82523	82523	Fred	244	“ We ’re not going to waste our last year here , though , ”
82533	82580	82523	82523	Fred	244	“ We ’re going to use it to do a bit of market research , find out exactly what the average Hogwarts student requires from his joke shop , carefully evaluate the results of our research , and then produce the products to fit the demand . ”
82581	82597	82599	82599	Hermione	172	“ But where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop ? ”
82602	82621	82599	82599	Hermione	172	“ You ’re going to need all the ingredients and materials — and premises too , I suppose ... ”
82653	82691	82649	82649	Fred	244	“ Ask us no questions and we ’ll tell you no lies , Hermione . C’m on , George , if we get there early we might be able to sell a few Extendable Ears before Herbology . ”
82713	82719	82721	82721	Hermione	172	“ What did that mean ? ”
82729	82752	82721	82721	Hermione	172	“ ‘ Ask us no questions ... ’ Does that mean they ’ve already got some gold to start a joke shop ? ”
82753	82764	82766	82766	Ron	333	“ You know , I ’ve been wondering about that , ”
82772	82796	82768	82768	his	333	“ They bought me a new set of dress robes this summer , and I could n’t understand where they got the Galleons ... ”
82812	82832	82721	82721	Hermione	172	“ D’you reckon it ’s true this year ’s going to be really tough ? Because of the exams ? ”
82833	82837	82839	82839	Ron	333	“ Oh yeah , ”
82841	82892	82839	82839	Ron	333	“ Bound to be , is n’t it ? O.W.L.s are really important , affect the jobs you can apply for and everything . We get career advice too , later this year , Bill told me . So you can choose what N.E.W.T.s you want to do next year . ”
82893	82904	82905	82905	Harry	156	“ D’you know what you want to do after Hogwarts ? ”
82929	82933	82935	82935	Ron	333	“ Not really , ”
82938	82943	82935	82935	Ron	333	“ Except ... well ... ”
82949	82952	82953	82953	Harry	156	“ What ? ”
82957	82969	82971	82971	Ron	333	“ Well , it ’d be cool to be an Auror , ”
82977	82983	82985	82985	Harry	156	“ Yeah , it would , ”
82988	82998	83000	83000	Ron	333	“ But they ’re , like , the elite , ”
83002	83017	83000	83000	Ron	333	“ You ’ve got to be really good . What about you , Hermione ? ”
83018	83024	83026	83026	Hermione	172	“ I do n’t know , ”
83028	83040	83026	83026	Hermione	172	“ I think I ’d really like to do something worthwhile . ”
83041	83047	83049	83049	Harry	156	“ An Auror ’s worthwhile ! ”
83051	83066	83068	83068	Hermione	172	“ Yes , it is , but it ’s not the only worthwhile thing , ”
83071	83082	83068	83068	Hermione	172	“ I mean , if I could take S.P.E.W. further ... ”
83288	83294	83295	83295	she	172	“ How would it be , ”
83315	83327	83295	83295	she	172	“ if I refused to lend you my notes this year ? ”
83328	83335	83337	83337	Ron	333	“ We ’d fail our O.W.L.s , ”
83339	83350	83337	83337	Ron	333	“ If you want that on your conscience , Hermione ... ”
83351	83359	83360	83360	she	172	“ Well , you ’d deserve it , ”
83363	83377	83360	83360	she	172	“ You do n’t even try to listen to him , do you ? ”
83378	83383	83385	83385	Ron	333	“ We do try , ”
83387	83418	83385	83385	Ron	333	“ We just have n’t got your brains or your memory or your concentration — you ’re just cleverer than we are — is it nice to rub it in ? ”
83419	83429	83434	83434	she	172	“ Oh , do n’t give me that rubbish , ”
83557	83562	83549	83549	someone	571	“ Hello , Harry ! ”
83615	83618	83620	83620	Harry	156	“ Hi , ”
83653	83662	83643	83643	Cho	359	“ You got that stuff off , then ? ”
83663	83666	83668	83668	Harry	156	“ Yeah , ”
83688	83700	83668	83668	Harry	156	“ So did you ... er ... have a good summer ? ”
83752	83763	83749	83749	she	359	“ Oh , it was all right , you know ... ”
83764	83771	83772	83772	Ron	333	“ Is that a Tornados badge ? ”
83801	83811	83772	83772	Ron	333	“ You do n’t support them , do you ? ”
83812	83818	83820	83820	Cho	359	“ Yeah , I do , ”
83822	83838	83840	83840	Ron	333	“ Have you always supported them , or just since they started winning the league ? ”
83853	83863	83865	83865	Cho	359	“ I ’ve supported them since I was six , ”
83868	83876	83865	83865	Cho	359	“ Anyway ... see you , Harry . ”
83895	83901	83893	83893	Ron	333	“ You are so tactless ! ”
83902	83911	83881	83881	Hermione	172	“ What ? I only asked her if — ”
83912	83927	83893	83893	Ron	333	“ Could n’t you tell she wanted to talk to Harry on her own ? ”
83928	83941	83881	83881	Hermione	172	“ So ? She could ’ve done , I was n’t stopping — ”
83942	83956	83893	83893	Ron	333	“ What on earth were you attacking her about her Quidditch team for ? ”
83957	83970	83881	83881	Hermione	172	“ Attacking ? I was n’t attacking her , I was only — ”
83971	83980	83893	83893	Ron	333	“ Who cares if she supports the Tornados ? ”
83981	84001	83881	83881	Hermione	172	“ Oh , come on , half the people you see wearing those badges only bought them last season — ”
84002	84009	83893	83893	Ron	333	“ But what does it matter ? ”
84010	84027	83881	83881	Hermione	172	“ It means they ’re not real fans , they ’re just jumping on the bandwagon — ”
84028	84034	84036	84036	Harry	156	“ That ’s the bell , ”
84292	84296	84298	84298	Snape	249	“ Settle down , ”
84350	84358	84360	84360	Snape	249	“ Before we begin today ’s lesson , ”
84374	84440	84360	84360	Snape	249	“ I think it appropriate to remind you that next June you will be sitting an important examination , during which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition and use of magical potions . Moronic though some of this class undoubtedly are , I expect you to scrape an ‘ Acceptable ’ in your O.W.L. , or suffer my ... displeasure . ”
84452	84469	84470	84470	Snape	249	“ After this year , of course , many of you will cease studying with me , ”
84474	84501	84470	84470	Snape	249	“ I take only the very best into my N.E.W.T. Potions class , which means that some of us will certainly be saying good - bye . ”
84536	84551	84553	84553	Snape	249	“ But we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell , ”
84556	84664	84553	84553	Snape	249	“ so whether you are intending to attempt N.E.W.T. or not , I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon maintaining the high - pass level I have come to expect from my O.W.L. students . Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary Wizarding Level : the Draught of Peace , a potion to calm anxiety and soothe agitation . Be warned : If you are too heavy - handed with the ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irreversible sleep , so you will need to pay close attention to what you are doing . ”
84685	84690	84677	84677	her	172	“ The ingredients and method ”
84697	84702	84694	84694	his	249	“ are on the blackboard ”
84710	84717	84719	84719	he	249	“ you will find everything you need ”
84725	84730	84719	84719	he	249	“ in the store cupboard ”
84743	84754	84719	84719	he	249	“ you have an hour and a half ... Start . ”
84850	84863	84865	84865	Snape	249	“ A light silver vapor should now be rising from your potion , ”
84996	85006	84993	84993	his	249	“ Potter , what is this supposed to be ? ”
85027	85033	85035	85035	Harry	156	“ The Draught of Peace , ”
85038	85044	85046	85046	Snape	249	“ Tell me , Potter , ”
85049	85054	85046	85046	Snape	249	“ can you read ? ”
85059	85065	85067	85067	Harry	156	“ Yes , I can , ”
85077	85090	85046	85046	Snape	249	“ Read the third line of the instructions for me , Potter . ”
85117	85145	85146	85146	His	156	“ ‘ Add powdered moonstone , stir three times counterclockwise , allow to simmer for seven minutes , then add two drops of syrup of hellebore . ’ ”
85179	85191	85304	85304	Snape	249	“ Did you do everything on the third line , Potter ? ”
85192	85195	85197	85197	Harry	156	“ No , ”
85201	85207	85304	85304	Snape	249	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
85208	85211	85213	85213	Harry	156	“ No , ”
85218	85224	85213	85213	Harry	156	“ I forgot the hellebore ... ”
85225	85244	85304	85304	Snape	249	“ I know you did , Potter , which means that this mess is utterly worthless . Evanesco . ”
85263	85302	85304	85304	Snape	249	“ Those of you who have managed to read the instructions , fill one flagon with a sample of your potion , label it clearly with your name , and bring it up to my desk for testing , ”
85306	85333	85304	85304	Snape	249	“ Homework : twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion - making , to be handed in on Thursday . ”
85501	85507	85509	85509	Hermione	172	“ That was really unfair , ”
85525	85555	85519	85519	herself	172	“ Your potion was n’t nearly as bad as Goyle ’s , when he put it in his flagon the whole thing shattered and set his robes on fire . ”
85556	85561	85563	85563	Harry	156	“ Yeah , well , ”
85570	85581	85563	85563	Harry	156	“ since when has Snape ever been fair to me ? ”
85613	85626	85628	85628	Hermione	172	“ I did think he might be a bit better this year , ”
85634	85641	85628	85628	Hermione	172	“ I mean ... you know ... ”
85666	85677	85660	85660	nobody	526	“ ... Now he ’s in the Order and everything . ”
85678	85687	85689	85689	Ron	333	“ Poisonous toadstools do n’t change their spots , ”
85692	85721	85689	85689	Ron	333	“ Anyway , I ’ve always thought Dumbledore was cracked trusting Snape , where ’s the evidence he ever really stopped working for You - Know - Who ? ”
85722	85745	85747	85747	Hermione	172	“ I think Dumbledore ’s probably got plenty of evidence , even if he does n’t share it with you , Ron , ”
85749	85760	85762	85762	Harry	156	“ Oh , shut up , the pair of you , ”
85785	85794	85795	85795	he	333	“ Ca n’t you give it a rest ? ”
85798	85815	85795	85795	he	333	“ You ’re always having a go at each other , it ’s driving me mad . ”
85950	85963	85965	85966	Sir Cadogan	405	“ Come back , you scurvy dog , stand fast and fight ! ”
86237	86245	86246	86246	he	333	“ Hermione and me have stopped arguing , ”
86254	86257	86259	86259	Harry	156	“ Good , ”
86261	86281	86283	86283	Ron	333	“ But Hermione says she thinks it would be nice if you stopped taking out your temper on us , ”
86285	86290	86342	86343	Professor Trelawney	407	“ I ’m not — ”
86291	86300	86302	86302	Ron	333	“ I ’m just passing on the message , ”
86308	86328	86302	86302	Ron	333	“ But I reckon she ’s right . It ’s not our fault how Seamus and Snape treat you . ”
86329	86335	86342	86343	Professor Trelawney	407	“ I never said it — ”
86336	86340	86345	86345	her	407	“ Good day , ”
86367	86508	86364	86364	himself	156	“ And welcome back to Divination . I have , of course , been following your fortunes most carefully over the holidays , and am delighted to see that you have all returned to Hogwarts safely — as , of course , I knew you would . You will find on the tables before you copies of The Dream Oracle , by Inigo Imago . Dream interpretation is a most important means of divining the future and one that may very probably be tested in your O.W.L. Not , of course , that I believe examination passes or failures are of the remotest importance when it comes to the sacred art of divination . If you have the Seeing Eye , certificates and grades matter very little . However , the headmaster likes you to sit the examination , so ... ”
86534	86577	86509	86509	Her	407	“ Turn , please , to the introduction and read what Imago has to say on the matter of dream interpretation . Then divide into pairs . Use The Dream Oracle to interpret each other ’s most recent dreams . Carry on . ”
86672	86679	86681	86681	Ron	333	“ I never remember my dreams , ”
86683	86688	86681	86681	Ron	333	“ You say one . ”
86689	86697	86699	86699	Harry	156	“ You must remember one of them , ”
86744	86759	86761	86761	Ron	333	“ Well , I had one that I was playing Quidditch the other night , ”
86773	86780	86761	86761	Ron	333	“ What d’you reckon that means ? ”
86781	86797	86799	86799	Harry	156	“ Probably that you ’re going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or something , ”
86868	86943	86864	86864	Ron	333	“ D’you realize how much homework we ’ve got already ? Binns set us a foot - and - a - half - long essay on giant wars , Snape wants a foot on the use of moonstones , and now we ’ve got a month ’s dream diary from Trelawney ! Fred and George were n’t wrong about O.W.L. year , were they ? That Umbridge woman had better not give us any ... ”
87039	87045	87046	87046	she	390	“ Well , good afternoon ! ”
87061	87065	87057	87059	A few people	3412	“ Good afternoon , ”
87069	87074	87076	87077	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Tut , tut , ”
87079	87118	87076	87077	Professor Umbridge	390	“ That wo n’t do , now , will it ? I should like you , please , to reply ‘ Good afternoon , Professor Umbridge . ’ One more time , please . Good afternoon , class ! ”
87119	87126	87127	87127	they	3412	“ Good afternoon , Professor Umbridge , ”
87133	87138	87140	87141	Professor Umbridge	390	“ There , now , ”
87144	87162	87140	87141	Professor Umbridge	390	“ That was n’t too difficult , was it ? Wands away and quills out , please . ”
87173	87176	87208	87209	Professor Umbridge	390	“ wands away ”
87242	87262	87264	87265	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Well now , your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented , has n’t it ? ”
87282	87371	87273	87273	her	390	“ The constant changing of teachers , many of whom do not seem to have followed any Ministry - approved curriculum , has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your O.W.L. year . You will be pleased to know , however , that these problems are now to be rectified . We will be following a carefully structured , theory - centered , Ministry - approved course of defensive magic this year . Copy down the following , please . ”
87418	87432	87415	87415	she	390	“ Has everybody got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard ? ”
87444	87453	87455	87456	Professor Umbridge	390	“ I think we ’ll try that again , ”
87458	87502	87455	87456	Professor Umbridge	390	“ When I ask you a question , I should like you to reply ‘ Yes , Professor Umbridge , ’ or ‘ No , Professor Umbridge . ’ So , has everyone got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard ? ”
87503	87509	87441	87442	the class	1903	“ Yes , Professor Umbridge , ”
87515	87518	87520	87521	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Good , ”
87523	87552	87520	87521	Professor Umbridge	390	“ I should like you to turn to page five and read chapter one , ‘ Basics for Beginners . ’ There will be no need to talk . ”
87836	87841	87864	87864	she	390	“ Basics for Beginners . ”
87872	87885	87886	87886	she	390	“ Did you want to ask something about the chapter , dear ? ”
87899	87907	87909	87909	Hermione	172	“ Not about the chapter , no , ”
87911	87920	87922	87923	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Well , we ’re reading just now , ”
87932	87949	87926	87926	her	390	“ If you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class . ”
87950	87961	87963	87963	Hermione	172	“ I ’ve got a query about your course aims , ”
87971	87978	87968	87968	her	390	“ And your name is — ? ”
87979	87983	87985	87985	Hermione	172	“ Hermione Granger , ”
87987	88008	88010	88011	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Well , Miss Granger , I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully , ”
88019	88026	88028	88028	Hermione	172	“ Well , I do n’t , ”
88031	88043	88028	88028	Hermione	172	“ There ’s nothing written up there about using defensive spells . ”
88072	88077	88078	88079	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Using defensive spells ? ”
88086	88123	88078	88079	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Why , I ca n’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to use a defensive spell , Miss Granger . You surely are n’t expecting to be attacked during class ? ”
88124	88133	88134	88134	Ron	333	“ We ’re not going to use magic ? ”
88138	88155	88134	88134	Ron	333	“ Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class , Mr. — ? ”
88156	88159	88161	88161	Ron	333	“ Weasley , ”
88209	88222	88205	88205	she	390	“ Yes , Miss Granger ? You wanted to ask something else ? ”
88223	88226	88228	88228	Hermione	172	“ Yes , ”
88230	88247	88228	88228	Hermione	172	“ Surely the whole point of Defense Against the Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells ? ”
88248	88261	88263	88264	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Are you a Ministry - trained educational expert , Miss Granger ? ”
88271	88276	88205	88205	she	390	“ No , but — ”
88277	88332	88266	88266	her	390	“ Well then , I ’m afraid you are not qualified to decide what the ‘ whole point ’ of any class is . Wizards much older and cleverer than you have devised our new program of study . You will be learning about defensive spells in a secure , risk - free way — ”
88333	88339	88341	88341	Harry	156	“ What use is that ? ”
88344	88359	88341	88341	Harry	156	“ If we ’re going to be attacked it wo n’t be in a — ”
88360	88366	88368	88369	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Hand , Mr. Potter ! ”
88399	88405	88406	88407	Professor Umbridge	390	“ And your name is ? ”
88412	88416	88406	88407	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Dean Thomas . ”
88417	88423	88410	88410	Dean	392	“ Well , Mr. Thomas ? ”
88424	88437	88439	88439	Dean	392	“ Well , it ’s like Harry said , is n’t it ? ”
88441	88458	88439	88439	Dean	392	“ If we ’re going to be attacked , it wo n’t be risk - free — ”
88459	88463	88465	88466	Professor Umbridge	390	“ I repeat , ”
88477	88488	88465	88466	Professor Umbridge	390	“ do you expect to be attacked during my classes ? ”
88489	88494	88439	88439	Dean	392	“ No , but — ”
88501	88518	88519	88519	she	390	“ I do not wish to criticize the way things have been run in this school , ”
88530	88553	88554	88554	she	390	“ but you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class , very irresponsible indeed — not to mention , ”
88561	88568	88554	88554	she	390	“ extremely dangerous half - breeds . ”
88569	88576	88579	88580	Dean Thomas	392	“ If you mean Professor Lupin , ”
88583	88591	88579	88580	Dean Thomas	392	“ he was the best we ever — ”
88592	88642	88554	88554	she	390	“ Hand , Mr. Thomas ! As I was saying — you have been introduced to spells that have been complex , inappropriate to your age group , and potentially lethal . You have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet Dark attacks every other day — ”
88643	88649	88650	88650	Hermione	172	“ No we have n’t , ”
88653	88657	88650	88650	Hermione	172	“ we just — ”
88658	88668	88554	88554	she	390	“ Your hand is not up , Miss Granger ! ”
88682	88707	88554	88554	she	390	“ It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you , he actually performed them on you — ”
88708	88723	88725	88726	Dean Thomas	392	“ Well , he turned out to be a maniac , did n’t he ? ”
88729	88738	88725	88726	Dean Thomas	392	“ Mind you , we still learned loads — ”
88739	88749	88751	88752	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Your hand is not up , Mr. Thomas ! ”
88754	88797	88798	88798	she	1967	“ Now , it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination , which , after all , is what school is all about . And your name is ? ”
88812	88848	88803	88803	Parvati	379	“ Parvati Patil , and is n’t there a practical bit in our Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. ? Are n’t we supposed to show that we can actually do the countercurses and things ? ”
88849	88881	88883	88884	Professor Umbridge	390	“ As long as you have studied the theory hard enough , there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions , ”
88887	88894	88896	88896	Parvati	379	“ Without ever practicing them before ? ”
88899	88921	88896	88896	Parvati	379	“ Are you telling us that the first time we ’ll get to do the spells will be during our exam ? ”
88922	88937	88803	88803	Parvati	379	“ I repeat , as long as you have studied the theory hard enough — ”
88938	88952	88954	88954	Harry	156	“ And what good ’s theory going to be in the real world ? ”
88969	88982	88983	88983	she	379	“ This is school , Mr. Potter , not the real world , ”
88987	89003	88803	88803	Parvati	379	“ So we ’re not supposed to be prepared for what ’s waiting out there ? ”
89004	89015	88964	88965	Professor Umbridge	390	“ There is nothing waiting out there , Mr. Potter . ”
89016	89020	89022	89022	Harry	156	“ Oh yeah ? ”
89045	89057	89059	89060	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves ? ”
89067	89074	89076	89076	Harry	156	“ Hmm , let ’s think ... ”
89083	89088	89076	89076	Harry	156	“ maybe Lord Voldemort ? ”
89129	89138	89115	89115	She	379	“ Ten points from Gryffindor , Mr. Potter . ”
89155	89167	89146	89146	Everyone	779	“ Now , let me make a few things quite plain . ”
89187	89203	89168	89169	Professor Umbridge	390	“ You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead — ”
89204	89210	89212	89212	Harry	156	“ He was n’t dead , ”
89215	89223	89212	89212	Harry	156	“ but yeah , he ’s returned ! ”
89224	89257	89259	89260	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Mr.-Potter - you - have - already - lost - your - House - ten - points - do - not - make - matters - worse - for - yourself , ”
89269	89295	89259	89260	Professor Umbridge	390	“ As I was saying , you have been informed that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again . This is a lie . ”
89296	89303	89305	89305	Harry	156	“ It is NOT a lie ! ”
89307	89316	89305	89305	Harry	156	“ I saw him , I fought him ! ”
89317	89323	89325	89326	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Detention , Mr. Potter ! ”
89329	89430	89325	89326	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Tomorrow evening . Five o’clock . My office . I repeat , this is a lie . The Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark wizard . If you are still worried , by all means come and see me outside class hours . If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards , I would like to hear about it . I am here to help . I am your friend . And now , you will kindly continue your reading . Page five , ‘ Basics for Beginners . ’ ”
89463	89468	89469	89469	Hermione	172	“ Harry , no ! ”
89491	89510	89511	89511	Harry	156	“ So , according to you , Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord , did he ? ”
89587	89597	89598	89598	she	390	“ Cedric Diggory ’s death was a tragic accident , ”
89602	89607	89609	89609	Harry	156	“ It was murder , ”
89634	89644	89617	89617	He	156	“ Voldemort killed him , and you know it . ”
89679	89688	89667	89667	she	390	“ Come here , Mr. Potter , dear . ”
89811	89820	89822	89823	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Take this to Professor McGonagall , dear , ”
89910	89919	89921	89921	Peeves	413	“ Why , it ’s Potty Wee Potter ! ”
89954	89962	89943	89943	Harry	156	“ Get out of it , Peeves . ”
89963	89971	89973	89973	Peeves	413	“ Oooh , Crackpot ’s feeling cranky , ”
89989	90009	90011	90011	Peeves	413	“ What is it this time , my fine Potty friend ? Hearing voices ? Seeing visions ? Speaking in ”
90017	90020	90011	90011	Peeves	413	“ tongues ? ”
90021	90029	90030	90030	Harry	156	“ I said , leave me ALONE ! ”
90054	90091	90042	90042	Peeves	413	“ Oh , most think he ’s barking , the Potty wee lad , But some are more kindly and think he ’s just sad , But Peevesy knows better and says that he ’s mad — ”
90092	90096	90049	90049	his	413	“ SHUT UP ! ”
90117	90128	90129	90129	she	306	“ What on earth are you shouting about , Potter ? ”
90142	90150	90129	90129	she	306	“ Why are n’t you in class ? ”
90151	90160	90162	90162	Harry	156	“ I ’ve been sent to see you , ”
90165	90175	90176	90176	He	156	“ Sent ? What do you mean , sent ? ”
90240	90247	90225	90225	she	306	“ Come in here , Potter . ”
90262	90265	90267	90268	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Well ? ”
90274	90279	90267	90268	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Is this true ? ”
90280	90285	90286	90286	Harry	156	“ Is what true ? ”
90297	90300	90301	90301	he	156	“ Professor ? ”
90311	90322	90267	90268	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge ? ”
90323	90326	90328	90328	Harry	156	“ Yes , ”
90330	90337	90378	90378	she	306	“ You called her a liar ? ”
90338	90341	90378	90378	she	306	“ Yes . ”
90342	90360	90378	90378	she	306	“ You told her He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named is back ? ”
90361	90364	90378	90378	she	306	“ Yes . ”
90381	90388	90378	90378	she	306	“ Have a biscuit , Potter . ”
90389	90394	90378	90378	she	306	“ Have — what ? ”
90395	90400	90401	90401	she	306	“ Have a biscuit , ”
90425	90430	90401	90401	she	306	“ And sit down . ”
90506	90515	90491	90492	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Potter , you need to be careful . ”
90565	90584	90528	90528	Her	306	“ Misbehavior in Dolores Umbridge ’s class could cost you much more than House points and a detention . ”
90585	90591	90528	90528	Her	306	“ What do you — ? ”
90592	90600	90610	90610	her	306	“ Potter , use your common sense , ”
90614	90631	90610	90610	her	306	“ You know where she comes from , you must know to whom she is reporting . ”
90658	90675	90676	90677	Professor McGonagall	306	“ It says here she ’s given you detention every evening this week , starting tomorrow , ”
90688	90694	90695	90695	Harry	156	“ Every evening this week ! ”
90700	90710	90695	90695	Harry	156	“ But , Professor , could n’t you — ? ”
90711	90718	90720	90721	Professor McGonagall	306	“ No , I could n’t , ”
90724	90727	90695	90695	Harry	156	“ But — ”
90728	90766	90695	90695	Harry	156	“ She is your teacher and has every right to give you detention . You will go to her room at five o’clock tomorrow for the first one . Just remember : Tread carefully around Dolores Umbridge . ”
90767	90775	90777	90777	Harry	156	“ But I was telling the truth ! ”
90781	90797	90777	90777	Harry	156	“ Voldemort ’s back , you know he is , Professor Dumbledore knows he is — ”
90798	90806	90808	90809	Professor McGonagall	306	“ For heaven ’s sake , Potter ! ”
90829	90854	90821	90821	he	156	“ Do you really think this is about truth or lies ? It ’s about keeping your head down and your temper under control ! ”
90871	90876	90877	90877	she	306	“ Have another biscuit , ”
90887	90892	90894	90894	Harry	156	“ No , thanks , ”
90897	90903	90904	90904	she	306	“ Do n’t be ridiculous , ”
90911	90914	90915	90915	he	156	“ Thanks , ”
90919	90940	90979	90980	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Did n’t you listen to Dolores Umbridge ’s speech at the start - of - term feast , Potter ? ”
90941	90944	90946	90946	Harry	156	“ Yeah , ”
90948	90978	90946	90946	Harry	156	“ Yeah ... she said ... progress will be prohibited or ... well , it meant that ... that the Ministry of Magic is trying to interfere at Hogwarts . ”
91003	91018	91019	91019	she	306	“ Well , I ’m glad you listen to Hermione Granger at any rate , ”
91128	91137	91107	91107	they	1992	“ He says he saw Cedric Diggory murdered ... ”
91138	91150	91093	91093	they	1992	“ He reckons he dueled with You - Know - Who ... ”
91151	91156	91107	91107	they	1992	“ Come off it ... ”
91157	91166	91093	91093	they	1992	“ Who does he think he ’s kidding ? ”
91167	91172	91107	91107	they	1992	“ Pur - lease ... ”
91173	91180	91182	91182	Harry	156	“ What I do n’t get , ”
91207	91223	91182	91182	Harry	156	“ is why they all believed the story two months ago when Dumbledore told them ... ”
91224	91238	91240	91240	Hermione	172	“ The thing is , Harry , I ’m not sure they did , ”
91243	91253	91240	91240	Hermione	172	“ Oh , let ’s get out of here . ”
91289	91302	91303	91303	Harry	156	“ What d’you mean , you ’re not sure they believed Dumbledore ? ”
91315	91330	91332	91332	Hermione	172	“ Look , you do n’t understand what it was like after it happened , ”
91335	91385	91332	91332	Hermione	172	“ You arrived back in the middle of the lawn clutching Cedric ’s dead body ... None of us saw what happened in the maze ... We just had Dumbledore ’s word for it that You - Know - Who had come back and killed Cedric and fought you . ”
91386	91392	91394	91394	Harry	156	“ Which is the truth ! ”
91397	91415	91417	91417	Hermione	172	“ I know it is , Harry , so will you please stop biting my head off ? ”
91420	91457	91417	91417	Hermione	172	“ It ’s just that before the truth could sink in , everyone went home for the summer , where they spent two months reading about how you ’re a nutcase and Dumbledore ’s going senile ! ”
91544	91548	91550	91550	Hermione	172	“ Mimbulus mimbletonia , ”
91652	91661	91662	91662	Hermione	172	“ How can Dumbledore have let this happen ? ”
91701	91719	91680	91680	She	172	“ How can he let that terrible woman teach us ? And in our O.W.L. year too ! ”
91720	91738	91740	91740	Harry	156	“ Well , we ’ve never had great Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers , have we ? ”
91742	91765	91740	91740	Harry	156	“ You know what it ’s like , Hagrid told us , nobody wants the job , they say it ’s jinxed . ”
91766	91789	91680	91680	She	172	“ Yes , but to employ someone who ’s actually refusing to let us do magic ! What ’s Dumbledore playing at ? ”
91790	91803	91805	91805	Ron	333	“ And she ’s trying to get people to spy for her , ”
91808	91834	91805	91805	Ron	333	“ Remember when she said she wanted us to come and tell her if we hear anyone saying You - Know - Who ’s back ? ”
91835	91861	91863	91863	Hermione	172	“ Of course she ’s here to spy on us all , that ’s obvious , why else would Fudge have wanted her to come ? ”
91865	91872	91874	91874	Harry	156	“ Do n’t start arguing again , ”
91885	91905	91878	91878	Ron	333	“ Ca n’t we just ... Let ’s just do that homework , get it out of the way ... ”
91950	91959	91961	91961	Ron	333	“ Shall we do Snape ’s stuff first ? ”
91970	91988	91989	91989	he	333	“ ‘ The properties ... of moonstone ... and its uses ... in potion - making ... ’ ”
92006	92009	91989	91989	he	333	“ There . ”
92022	92038	92010	92010	He	333	“ So what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potion - making ? ”
92103	92116	92117	92117	she	172	“ No , I ’m sorry , they ’ve gone too far , ”
92127	92133	92117	92117	she	172	“ Come on , Ron . ”
92134	92139	92141	92141	Ron	333	“ I — what ? ”
92148	92167	92141	92141	Ron	333	“ No — come on , Hermione — we ca n’t tell them off for giving out sweets ... ”
92168	92187	92117	92117	she	172	“ You know perfectly well that those are bits of Nosebleed Nougat or — or Puking Pastilles or — ”
92188	92192	92193	92193	Harry	156	“ Fainting Fancies ? ”
92300	92308	92279	92279	Ron	333	“ She ’s got it under control , ”
92322	92327	92328	92328	Hermione	172	“ That ’s enough ! ”
92345	92352	92354	92354	George	245	“ Yeah , you ’re right , ”
92358	92369	92354	92354	George	245	“ this dosage looks strong enough , does n’t it ? ”
92370	92386	92328	92328	Hermione	172	“ I told you this morning , you ca n’t test your rubbish on students ! ”
92387	92393	92395	92395	Fred	244	“ We ’re paying them ! ”
92398	92409	92328	92328	Hermione	172	“ I do n’t care , it could be dangerous ! ”
92410	92413	92415	92415	Fred	244	“ Rubbish , ”
92417	92427	92429	92429	Lee	353	“ Calm down , Hermione , they ’re fine ! ”
92449	92460	92462	92462	George	245	“ Yeah , look , they ’re coming round now , ”
92511	92516	92518	92518	George	245	“ Feel all right ? ”
92532	92539	92540	92540	she	2020	“ I - I think so , ”
92544	92547	92549	92549	Fred	244	“ Excellent , ”
92573	92579	92556	92556	Hermione	172	“ It is NOT excellent ! ”
92580	92594	92596	92596	Fred	244	“ ’ Course it is , they ’re alive , are n’t they ? ”
92599	92616	92556	92556	Hermione	172	“ You ca n’t do this , what if you made one of them really ill ? ”
92617	92647	92556	92556	Hermione	172	“ We ’re not going to make them ill , we ’ve already tested them all on ourselves , this is just to see if everyone reacts the same — ”
92648	92662	92556	92556	Hermione	172	“ If you do n’t stop doing it , I ’m going to — ”
92663	92669	92671	92671	Fred	244	“ Put us in detention ? ”
92689	92695	92697	92697	George	245	“ Make us write lines ? ”
92732	92735	92736	92736	she	172	“ No , ”
92745	92754	92736	92736	she	172	“ but I will write to your mother . ”
92755	92760	92762	92762	George	245	“ You would n’t , ”
92773	92781	92783	92783	Hermione	172	“ Oh , yes , I would , ”
92786	92808	92783	92783	Hermione	172	“ I ca n’t stop you eating the stupid things yourselves , but you ’re not giving them to first years . ”
92885	92894	92895	92895	Hermione	172	“ Thank you for your support , Ron , ”
92899	92907	92908	92908	Ron	333	“ You handled it fine by yourself , ”
92929	92949	92911	92911	Hermione	172	“ Oh , it ’s no good , I ca n’t concentrate now . I ’m going to bed . ”
93011	93022	93024	93024	Ron	333	“ What in the name of Merlin are you doing ? ”
93035	93044	93045	93045	she	172	“ They ’re hats for house - elves , ”
93058	93091	93045	93045	she	172	“ I did them over the summer . I ’m a really slow knitter without magic , but now I ’m back at school I should be able to make lots more . ”
93092	93104	93106	93106	Ron	333	“ You ’re leaving out hats for the house - elves ? ”
93109	93120	93106	93106	Ron	333	“ And you ’re covering them up with rubbish first ? ”
93121	93124	93126	93126	Hermione	172	“ Yes , ”
93136	93142	93144	93144	Ron	333	“ That ’s not on , ”
93147	93174	93144	93144	Ron	333	“ You ’re trying to trick them into picking up the hats . You ’re setting them free when they might not want to be free . ”
93175	93184	93186	93186	Hermione	172	“ Of course they want to be free ! ”
93197	93208	93186	93186	Hermione	172	“ Do n’t you dare touch those hats , Ron ! ”
93236	93248	93249	93249	he	333	“ They should at least see what they ’re picking up , ”
93253	93256	93257	93257	He	333	“ Anyway ... ”
93274	93311	93264	93264	he	333	“ There ’s no point trying to finish this now , I ca n’t do it without Hermione , I have n’t got a clue what you ’re supposed to do with moonstones , have you ? ”
93376	93384	93385	93385	He	156	“ I ’m going to bed too . ”
93467	93478	93480	93480	Ron	333	“ But on the plus side , no Snape today , ”
93517	93534	93513	93513	she	172	“ The hats have gone . Seems the house - elves do want freedom after all . ”
93535	93543	93544	93544	Ron	333	“ I would n’t bet on it , ”
93549	93572	93544	93544	Ron	333	“ They might not count as clothes . They did n’t look anything like hats to me , more like woolly bladders . ”
93613	93619	93621	93623	little Professor Flitwick	418	“ What you must remember , ”
93646	93706	93636	93636	he	418	“ is that these examinations may influence your futures for many years to come ! If you have not already given serious thought to your careers , now is the time to do so . And in the meantime , I ’m afraid , we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice ! ”
93761	93769	93771	93772	Professor McGonagall	306	“ You can not pass an O.W.L. , ”
93775	93810	93811	93811	Neville	342	“ without serious application , practice , and study . I see no reason why everybody in this class should not achieve an O.W.L. in Transfiguration as long as they put in the work . ”
93819	93827	93829	93830	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Yes , you too , Longbottom , ”
93832	93888	93829	93830	Professor McGonagall	306	“ There ’s nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence . So ... today we are starting Vanishing Spells . These are easier than Conjuring Spells , which you would not usually attempt until N.E.W.T. level , but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your O.W.L. ”
94237	94241	94243	94246	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ Everyone here ? ”
94257	94274	94243	94246	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ Let ’s crack on then — who can tell me what these things are called ? ”
94396	94399	94401	94401	Parvati	379	“ Oooooh ! ”
94451	94460	94462	94465	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ Kindly keep your voices down , girls ! ”
94490	94504	94462	94465	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ So — anyone know the names of these creatures ? Miss Granger ? ”
94505	94508	94510	94510	Hermione	172	“ Bowtruckles , ”
94512	94526	94510	94510	Hermione	172	“ They ’re tree - guardians , usually live in wand - trees . ”
94527	94533	94535	94538	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ Five points for Gryffindor , ”
94540	94572	94535	94538	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ Yes , these are bowtruckles and , as Miss Granger rightly says , they generally live in trees whose wood is of wand quality . Anybody know what they eat ? ”
94573	94577	94579	94579	Hermione	172	“ Wood lice , ”
94597	94607	94579	94579	Hermione	172	“ But fairy eggs if they can get them . ”
94608	94742	94535	94538	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ Good girl , take another five points . So whenever you need leaves or wood from a tree in which a bowtruckle lodges , it is wise to have a gift of wood lice ready to distract or placate it . They may not look dangerous , but if angered they will gouge out human eyes with their fingers , which , as you can see , are very sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeballs . So if you ’d like to gather closer , take a few wood lice and a bowtruckle — I have enough here for one between three — you can study them more closely . I want a sketch from each of you with all body parts labeled by the end of the lesson . ”
94771	94776	94777	94777	he	156	“ Where ’s Hagrid ? ”
94788	94793	94795	94798	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ Never you mind , ”
94837	94840	94842	94842	Malfoy	298	“ Maybe , ”
94855	94866	94842	94842	Malfoy	298	“ the stupid great oaf ’s got himself badly injured . ”
94867	94878	94880	94880	Harry	156	“ Maybe you will if you do n’t shut up , ”
94889	94910	94886	94886	his	156	“ Maybe he ’s been messing with stuff that ’s too big for him , if you get my drift . ”
95020	95031	95033	95033	Hermione	172	“ Dumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid , ”
95037	95089	95033	95033	Hermione	172	“ It ’s just playing into Malfoy ’s hands to look worried , it tells him we do n’t know exactly what ’s going on . We ’ve got to ignore him , Harry . Here , hold the bowtruckle for a moment , just so I can draw its face ... ”
95090	95093	95095	95095	Malfoy	298	“ Yes , ”
95105	95162	95095	95095	Malfoy	298	“ Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago , you know , and it sounds as though the Ministry ’s really determined to crack down on substandard teaching in this place . So even if that overgrown moron does show up again , he ’ll probably be sent packing straight away . ”
95163	95166	95095	95095	Malfoy	298	“ OUCH ! ”
95293	95304	95306	95306	Harry	156	“ If he calls Hagrid a moron one more time ... ”
95308	95338	95306	95306	Harry	156	“ Harry , do n’t go picking a row with Malfoy , do n’t forget , he ’s a prefect now , he could make life difficult for you ... ”
95339	95355	95357	95357	Harry	156	“ Wow , I wonder what it ’d be like to have a difficult life ? ”
95393	95409	95411	95411	Harry	156	“ I just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back , that ’s all , ”
95423	95438	95439	95439	he	156	“ And do n’t say that Grubbly - Plank woman ’s a better teacher ! ”
95443	95450	95452	95452	Hermione	172	“ I was n’t going to , ”
95455	95466	95468	95468	Harry	156	“ Because she ’ll never be as good as Hagrid , ”
95511	95514	95515	95515	she	247	“ Hi , ”
95607	95635	95590	95590	Luna	356	“ I believe He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named is back , and I believe you fought him and escaped from him . ”
95636	95641	95643	95643	Harry	156	“ Er — right , ”
95682	95687	95688	95688	Luna	356	“ You can laugh ! ”
95717	95739	95707	95707	she	356	“ But people used to believe there were no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple - Horned Snorkack ! ”
95740	95751	95753	95753	Hermione	172	“ Well , they were right , were n’t they ? ”
95756	95774	95753	95753	Hermione	172	“ There were n’t any such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple - Horned Snorkack . ”
95802	95814	95815	95815	Harry	156	“ D’you mind not offending the only people who believe me ? ”
95826	95843	95845	95845	Hermione	172	“ Oh , for heaven ’s sake , Harry , you can do better than her , ”
95847	95889	95845	95845	Hermione	172	“ Ginny ’s told me all about her , apparently she ’ll only believe in things as long as there ’s no proof at all . Well , I would n’t expect anything else from someone whose father runs The Quibbler . ”
95947	95956	95957	95957	he	363	“ I want you to know , Potter , ”
95966	95998	95957	95957	he	363	“ that it ’s not only weirdos who support you . I personally believe you one hundred percent . My family have always stood firm behind Dumbledore , and so do I. ”
95999	96008	96010	96010	Harry	156	“ Er — thanks very much , Ernie , ”
96268	96273	96293	96293	she	398	“ Oy , Potter ! ”
96274	96278	96279	96279	he	156	“ What now ? ”
96300	96308	96309	96309	she	398	“ I ’ll tell you what now , ”
96328	96343	96309	96309	she	398	“ How come you ’ve landed yourself in detention for five o’clock on Friday ? ”
96344	96347	96349	96349	Harry	156	“ What ? ”
96351	96360	96349	96349	Harry	156	“ Why ... oh yeah , Keeper tryouts ! ”
96361	96366	96368	96368	Angelina	398	“ Now he remembers ! ”
96370	96422	96368	96368	Angelina	398	“ Did n’t I tell you I wanted to do a tryout with the whole team , and find someone who fitted in with everyone ? Did n’t I tell you I ’d booked the Quidditch pitch specially ? And now you ’ve decided you ’re not going to be there ! ”
96423	96433	96435	96435	Harry	156	“ I did n’t decide not to be there ! ”
96445	96468	96435	96435	Harry	156	“ I got detention from that Umbridge woman , just because I told her the truth about You - Know - Who — ”
96469	96489	96491	96491	Angelina	398	“ Well , you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off on Friday , ”
96494	96529	96491	96491	Angelina	398	“ and I do n’t care how you do it , tell her You - Know - Who ’s a figment of your imagination if you like , just make sure you ’re there ! ”
96534	96539	96540	96540	Harry	156	“ You know what ? ”
96553	96583	96540	96540	Harry	156	“ I think we ’d better check with Puddlemere United whether Oliver Wood ’s been killed during a training session , because she seems to be channeling his spirit . ”
96584	96599	96601	96601	Ron	333	“ What d’you reckon are the odds of Umbridge letting you off on Friday ? ”
96613	96618	96620	96620	Harry	156	“ Less than zero , ”
96634	96658	96659	96659	He	156	“ Better try , though , had n’t I ? I ’ll offer to do two more detentions or something , I dunno ... ”
96668	96718	96659	96659	He	156	“ I hope she does n’t keep me too long this evening . You realize we ’ve got to write three essays , practice Vanishing Spells for McGonagall , work out a countercharm for Flitwick , finish the bowtruckle drawing , and start that stupid dream diary for Trelawney ? ”
96731	96742	96719	96719	Ron	333	“ And it looks like it ’s going to rain . ”
96743	96754	96758	96758	her	172	“ What ’s that got to do with our homework ? ”
96762	96765	96767	96767	Ron	333	“ Nothing , ”
96808	96812	96805	96805	she	390	“ Come in , ”
96990	96997	96985	96986	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Good evening , Mr. Potter . ”
97035	97038	97039	97039	Harry	156	“ Evening , ”
97043	97049	97050	97050	she	390	“ Well , sit down , ”
97088	97091	97093	97093	Harry	156	“ Er , ”
97098	97120	97093	97093	Harry	156	“ Professor Umbridge ? Er — before we start , I - I wanted to ask you a ... a favor . ”
97126	97130	97121	97121	Her	390	“ Oh yes ? ”
97131	97186	97121	97121	Her	390	“ Well I ’m ... I ’m on the Gryffindor Quidditch team . And I was supposed to be at the tryouts for the new Keeper at five o’clock on Friday and I was — was wondering whether I could skip detention that night and do it — do it another night ... instead ... ”
97204	97208	97210	97210	Umbridge	390	“ Oh no , ”
97229	97331	97220	97220	she	390	“ Oh no , no , no . This is your punishment for spreading evil , nasty , attention - seeking stories , Mr. Potter , and punishments certainly can not be adjusted to suit the guilty one ’s convenience . No , you will come here at five o’clock tomorrow , and the next day , and on Friday too , and you will do your detentions as planned . I think it rather a good thing that you are missing something you really want to do . It ought to reinforce the lesson I am trying to teach you . ”
97425	97428	97430	97430	Umbridge	390	“ There , ”
97433	97471	97472	97472	she	390	“ we ’re getting better at controlling our temper already , are n’t we ? Now , you are going to be doing some lines for me , Mr. Potter . No , not with your quill , ”
97484	97502	97472	97472	she	390	“ You ’re going to be using a rather special one of mine . Here you are . ”
97518	97532	97533	97533	she	390	“ I want you to write ‘ I must not tell lies , ’ ”
97538	97543	97544	97544	Harry	156	“ How many times ? ”
97554	97569	97571	97571	Umbridge	390	“ Oh , as long as it takes for the message to sink in , ”
97574	97579	97571	97571	Umbridge	390	“ Off you go . ”
97617	97626	97627	97627	he	156	“ You have n’t given me any ink , ”
97630	97639	97651	97651	her	390	“ Oh , you wo n’t need ink , ”
97779	97782	97769	97769	her	390	“ Yes ? ”
97783	97786	97788	97788	Harry	156	“ Nothing , ”
97974	97978	97979	97979	she	390	“ Come here , ”
98020	98023	98024	98024	she	390	“ Hand , ”
98063	98081	98082	98082	she	390	“ Tut , tut , I do n’t seem to have made much of an impression yet , ”
98087	98108	98082	98082	she	390	“ Well , we ’ll just have to try again tomorrow evening , wo n’t we ? You may go . ”
98230	98241	98242	98242	Harry	156	“ How come you did n’t do it last night ? ”
98274	98279	98283	98283	his	333	“ doing other stuff , ”
98292	98299	98300	98300	he	156	“ That ’ll have to do , ”
98308	98336	98300	98300	he	156	“ I ’ve said I dreamed I was buying a new pair of shoes , she ca n’t make anything weird out of that , can she ? ”
98345	98361	98337	98337	They	2085	“ How was detention with Umbridge , anyway ? What did she make you do ? ”
98374	98377	98362	98362	Harry	156	“ Lines . ”
98378	98389	98391	98391	Ron	333	“ That ’s not too bad , then , eh ? ”
98393	98396	98398	98398	Harry	156	“ Nope , ”
98400	98414	98362	98362	Harry	156	“ Hey — I forgot — did she let you off for Friday ? ”
98415	98418	98420	98420	Harry	156	“ No , ”
98563	98569	98570	98570	Harry	156	“ I ’m in detention ! ”
98579	98598	98570	98570	Harry	156	“ D’you think I ’d rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing Quidditch ? ”
98599	98607	98609	98609	Hermione	172	“ At least it ’s only lines , ”
98639	98653	98613	98613	Harry	156	“ It ’s not as if it ’s a dreadful punishment , really ... ”
98755	98767	98769	98769	Ron	333	“ I ca n’t believe how much homework we ’ve got , ”
98772	98784	98785	98785	Hermione	172	“ Well , why did n’t you do any last night ? ”
98789	98795	98785	98785	Hermione	172	“ Where were you anyway ? ”
98796	98805	98807	98807	Ron	333	“ I was ... I fancied a walk , ”
98922	98925	98918	98918	he	156	“ Good evening ”
98927	98931	98918	98918	he	156	“ Good night . ”
99116	99122	99168	99168	her	390	“ I must not tell lies ”
99158	99161	99162	99162	she	390	“ Ah , ”
99176	99199	99162	99162	she	390	“ Good . That ought to serve as a reminder to you , ought n’t it ? You may leave for tonight . ”
99200	99210	99212	99212	Harry	156	“ Do I still have to come back tomorrow ? ”
99228	99232	99234	99235	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Oh yes , ”
99242	99261	99234	99235	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Yes , I think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evening ’s work . ”
99330	99333	99319	99319	she	2096	“ Ron ? ”
99390	99396	99375	99375	he	156	“ What are you doing ? ”
99397	99407	99375	99375	he	156	“ Er — nothing . What are you doing ? ”
99413	99429	99375	99375	he	156	“ Come on , you can tell me ! What are you hiding here for ? ”
99430	99447	99449	99449	Ron	333	“ I ’m — I ’m hiding from Fred and George , if you must know , ”
99451	99495	99449	99449	Ron	333	“ They just went past with a bunch of first years , I bet they ’re testing stuff on them again , I mean , they ca n’t do it in the common room now , can they , not with Hermione there . ”
99507	99526	99527	99527	Harry	156	“ But what have you got your broom for , you have n’t been flying , have you ? ”
99530	99552	99553	99553	Ron	333	“ I — well — well , okay , I ’ll tell you , but do n’t laugh , all right ? ”
99563	99590	99553	99553	Ron	333	“ I - I thought I ’d try out for Gryffindor Keeper now I ’ve got a decent broom . There . Go on . Laugh . ”
99591	99597	99599	99599	Harry	156	“ I ’m not laughing , ”
99604	99635	99601	99601	Ron	333	“ It ’s a brilliant idea ! It ’d be really cool if you got on the team ! I ’ve never seen you play Keeper , are you good ? ”
99636	99642	99644	99644	Ron	333	“ I ’m not bad , ”
99655	99676	99644	99644	Ron	333	“ Charlie , Fred , and George always made me Keep for them when they were training during the holidays . ”
99677	99685	99601	99601	Ron	333	“ So you ’ve been practicing tonight ? ”
99686	99729	99730	99730	Ron	333	“ Every evening since Tuesday ... just on my own , though , I ’ve been trying to bewitch Quaffles to fly at me , but it has n’t been easy and I do n’t know how much use it ’ll be . ”
99736	99771	99730	99730	Ron	333	“ Fred and George are going to laugh themselves stupid when I turn up for the tryouts . They have n’t stopped taking the mickey out of me since I got made a prefect . ”
99772	99782	99784	99784	Harry	156	“ I wish I was going to be there , ”
99797	99815	99730	99730	Ron	333	“ Yeah , so do — Harry , what ’s that on the back of your hand ? ”
99846	99860	99889	99889	he	333	“ It ’s just a cut — it ’s nothing — it ’s — ”
99907	99918	99900	99900	he	333	“ I thought you said she was giving you lines ? ”
99951	99956	99957	99957	Ron	333	“ The old hag ! ”
99987	99999	99981	99981	her	1818	“ She ’s sick ! Go to McGonagall , say something ! ”
100000	100003	100005	100005	Harry	156	“ No , ”
100009	100025	100005	100005	Harry	156	“ I ’m not giving her the satisfaction of knowing she ’s got to me . ”
100026	100041	99981	99981	her	1818	“ Got to you ? You ca n’t let her get away with this ! ”
100042	100056	100058	100058	Harry	156	“ I do n’t know how much power McGonagall ’s got over her , ”
100060	100068	99981	99981	her	1818	“ Dumbledore , then , tell Dumbledore ! ”
100069	100072	100074	100074	Harry	156	“ No , ”
100077	100081	99981	99981	her	1818	“ Why not ? ”
100082	100091	100093	100093	Harry	156	“ He ’s got enough on his mind , ”
100125	100133	100134	100134	Ron	333	“ Well , I reckon you should — ”
100157	100183	100138	100138	he	333	“ Are you going to give me the password or will I have to stay awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation ? ”
100406	100416	100418	100418	Umbridge	390	“ You know what to do , Mr. Potter , ”
100772	100787	100789	100789	Umbridge	390	“ Let ’s see if you ’ve gotten the message yet , shall we ? ”
100902	100912	100913	100913	she	390	“ Yes , it hurts , does n’t it ? ”
100950	100968	100932	100932	she	390	“ Well , I think I ’ve made my point , Mr. Potter . You may go . ”
101011	101015	101016	101016	he	156	“ Mimbulus mimbletonia ! ”
101060	101075	101036	101036	Ron	333	“ Harry , I did it , I ’m in , I ’m Keeper ! ”
101076	101083	101085	101085	Harry	156	“ What ? Oh — brilliant ! ”
101105	101110	101111	101111	Ron	333	“ Have a butterbeer . ”
101118	101130	101111	101111	Ron	333	“ I ca n’t believe it — where ’s Hermione gone ? ”
101131	101136	101138	101138	Fred	244	“ She ’s there , ”
101169	101182	101184	101184	Ron	333	“ Well , she said she was pleased when I told her , ”
101191	101196	101198	101198	George	245	“ Let her sleep , ”
101225	101241	101243	101244	Katie Bell	385	“ Come here , Ron , and see if Oliver ’s old robes fit you , ”
101246	101259	101243	101244	Katie Bell	385	“ We can take off his name and put yours on instead ... ”
101272	101285	101286	101286	she	398	“ Sorry I was a bit short with you earlier , Potter , ”
101290	101316	101286	101286	she	398	“ It ’s stressful , this managing lark , you know , I ’m starting to think I was a bit hard on Wood sometimes . ”
101335	101352	101353	101353	she	398	“ Look , I know he ’s your best mate , but he ’s not fabulous , ”
101357	101498	101353	101353	she	398	“ I think with a bit of training he ’ll be all right , though . He comes from a family of good Quidditch players . I ’m banking on him turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today , to be honest . Vicky Frobisher and Geoffrey Hooper both flew better this evening , but Hooper ’s a real whiner , he ’s always moaning about something or other , and Vicky ’s involved in all sorts of societies , she admitted herself that if training clashed with her Charm Club she ’d put Charms first . Anyway , we ’re having a practice session at two o’clock tomorrow , so just make sure you ’re there this time . And do me a favor and help Ron as much as you can , okay ? ”
101530	101547	101548	101548	she	172	“ Oh , Harry , it ’s you ... Good about Ron , is n’t it ? ”
101552	101563	101564	101564	she	172	“ I ’m just so — so — so tired , ”
101567	101584	101564	101564	she	172	“ I was up until one o’clock making more hats . They ’re disappearing like mad ! ”
101615	101618	101620	101620	Harry	156	“ Great , ”
101635	101654	101631	101631	he	156	“ Listen , Hermione , I was just up in Umbridge ’s office and she touched my arm ... ”
101667	101685	101663	101663	she	172	“ You ’re worried that You - Know - Who ’s controlling her like he controlled Quirrell ? ”
101686	101689	101691	101691	Harry	156	“ Well , ”
101697	101707	101691	101691	Harry	156	“ it ’s a possibility , is n’t it ? ”
101708	101713	101718	101718	she	172	“ I suppose so , ”
101722	101782	101718	101718	she	172	“ But I do n’t think he can be possessing her the way he possessed Quirrell , I mean , he ’s properly alive again now , is n’t he , he ’s got his own body , he would n’t need to share someone else ’s . He could have her under the Imperius Curse , I suppose ... ”
101804	101868	101801	101801	Hermione	172	“ But last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you , and did n’t Dumbledore say it had to do with what You - Know - Who was feeling at the time ? I mean , maybe this has n’t got anything to do with Umbridge at all , maybe it ’s just coincidence it happened while you were with her ? ”
101869	101874	101876	101876	Harry	156	“ She ’s evil , ”
101879	101882	101876	101876	Harry	156	“ Twisted . ”
101883	101905	101801	101801	Hermione	172	“ She ’s horrible , yes , but ... Harry , I think you ought to tell Dumbledore your scar hurt . ”
101937	101980	101801	101801	Hermione	172	“ I ’m not bothering him with this . Like you just said , it ’s not a big deal . It ’s been hurting on and off all summer — it was just a bit worse tonight , that ’s all — ”
101981	101996	101801	101801	Hermione	172	“ Harry , I ’m sure Dumbledore would want to be bothered by this — ”
101997	102000	102002	102002	Harry	156	“ Yeah , ”
102010	102029	102002	102002	Harry	156	“ that ’s the only bit of me Dumbledore cares about , is n’t it , my scar ? ”
102030	102041	101801	101801	Hermione	172	“ Do n’t say that , it ’s not true ! ”
102042	102059	102002	102002	Harry	156	“ I think I ’ll write and tell Sirius about it , see what he thinks — ”
102060	102074	102076	102076	Hermione	172	“ Harry , you ca n’t put something like that in a letter ! ”
102081	102111	102076	102076	Hermione	172	“ Do n’t you remember , Moody told us to be careful what we put in writing ! We just ca n’t guarantee owls are n’t being intercepted anymore ! ”
102112	102127	102129	102129	Harry	156	“ All right , all right , I wo n’t tell him , then ! ”
102138	102153	102132	102132	He	156	“ I ’m going to bed . Tell Ron for me , will you ? ”
102154	102158	102160	102160	Hermione	172	“ Oh no , ”
102165	102227	102160	102160	Hermione	172	“ if you ’re going that means I can go without being rude too , I ’m absolutely exhausted and I want to make some more hats tomorrow . Listen , you can help me if you like , it ’s quite fun , I ’m getting better , I can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now . ”
102254	102268	102269	102269	he	156	“ Er ... no , I do n’t think I will , thanks , ”
102272	102287	102269	102269	he	156	“ Er — not tomorrow . I ’ve got loads of homework to do ... ”
102859	102871	102873	102875	Nearly Headless Nick	381	“ I would not go that way if I were you , ”
102893	102915	102887	102887	he	156	“ Peeves is planning an amusing joke on the next person to pass the bust of Paracelsus halfway down the corridor . ”
102916	102930	102932	102932	Harry	156	“ Does it involve Paracelsus falling on top of the person ’s head ? ”
102934	102941	102943	102945	Nearly Headless Nick	381	“ Funnily enough , it does , ”
102951	102988	102943	102945	Nearly Headless Nick	381	“ Subtlety has never been Peeves ’s strong point . I ’m off to try and find the Bloody Baron ... He might be able to put a stop to it ... See you , Harry ... ”
102989	102995	102997	102997	Harry	156	“ Yeah , ’ bye , ”
103094	103102	103103	103103	Harry	156	“ I ’m not doing anything wrong , ”
103227	103232	103233	103233	he	156	“ There you are , ”
103248	103261	103233	103233	he	156	“ Get down here , I ’ve got a letter for you . ”
103279	103293	103294	103294	he	156	“ Right , I know this says ‘ Snuffles ’ on the outside , ”
103316	103325	103294	103294	he	156	“ but it ’s for Sirius , okay ? ”
103342	103348	103350	103350	Harry	156	“ Safe flight , then , ”

103865	103908	103858	103858	she	359	“ Putting you in detention just because you told the truth about how — how — how he died . Everyone heard about it , it was all over the school . You were really brave standing up to her like that . ”
104071	104074	104076	104076	Filch	389	“ Aha ! ”

104712	104718	104720	104720	Harry	156	“ Erm ... Quidditch later , ”
104734	104739	104741	104741	Ron	333	“ Oh ... yeah ... ”
104766	104810	104763	104763	he	156	“ Listen ... you do n’t fancy going out a bit earlier with me , do you ? Just to — er — give me some practice before training ? So I can , you know , get my eye in a bit ... ”
104811	104816	104818	104818	Harry	156	“ Yeah , okay , ”

104835	104846	104832	104832	Hermione	172	“ you ’re both really behind on homework as it — ”
104917	104921	104923	104923	Ron	333	“ Anything interesting ? ”
104942	104945	104946	104946	she	172	“ No , ”
104949	104964	104946	104946	she	172	“ just some guff about the bass player in the Weird Sisters getting married ... ”
104998	105003	105005	105005	Hermione	172	“ Wait a moment , ”
105008	105014	105005	105005	Hermione	172	“ Oh no ... Sirius ! ”
105015	105020	105022	105022	Harry	156	“ What ’s happened ? ”
105048	105083	105087	105087	her	172	“ ‘ The Ministry of Magic has received a tip - off from a reliable source that Sirius Black , notorious mass murderer ... blah blah blah ... is currently hiding in London ! ’ ”
105094	105103	105105	105105	Harry	156	“ Lucius Malfoy , I ’ll bet anything , ”
105113	105122	105105	105105	Harry	156	“ He did recognize Sirius on the platform ... ”
105123	105126	105128	105128	Ron	333	“ What ? ”
105133	105139	105128	105128	Ron	333	“ You did n’t say — ”
105140	105143	105145	105147	the other two	1874	“ Shh ! ”
105149	105176	105177	105177	Hermione	172	“ ... ‘ Ministry warns Wizarding community that Black is very dangerous ... killed thirteen people ... broke out of Azkaban ... ’ the usual rubbish , ”
105195	105214	105215	105215	she	172	“ Well , he just wo n’t be able to leave the house again , that ’s all , ”
105218	105226	105215	105215	she	172	“ Dumbledore did warn him not to . ”
105267	105270	105271	105271	he	156	“ Hey ! ”
105286	105291	105271	105271	he	156	“ Look at this ! ”
105292	105302	105304	105304	Ron	333	“ I ’ve got all the robes I want , ”
105306	105309	105311	105311	Harry	156	“ No , ”
105313	105321	105311	105311	Harry	156	“ look ... this little piece here ... ”
105348	105352	105354	105354	Ron	333	“ Sturgis Podmore ? ”
105357	105383	105354	105354	Ron	333	“ but he ’s that bloke who looks like his head ’s been thatched , is n’t he ? He ’s one of the Ord — ”
105384	105389	105391	105391	Hermione	172	“ Ron , shh ! ”
105400	105406	105408	105408	Harry	156	“ Six months in Azkaban ! ”
105412	105422	105408	105408	Harry	156	“ Just for trying to get through a door ! ”
105423	105459	105461	105461	Hermione	172	“ Do n’t be silly , it was n’t just for trying to get through a door — what on earth was he doing at the Ministry of Magic at one o’clock in the morning ? ”
105463	105474	105475	105475	Ron	333	“ D’you reckon he was doing something for the Order ? ”
105478	105483	105485	105485	Harry	156	“ Wait a moment ... ”
105488	105501	105485	105485	Harry	156	“ Sturgis was supposed to come and see us off , remember ? ”
105509	105561	105502	105504	The other two	1874	“ Yeah , he was supposed to be part of our guard going to King ’s Cross , remember ? And Moody was all annoyed because he did n’t turn up , so that does n’t seem like he was supposed to be on a job for them , does it ? ”
105562	105575	105577	105577	Hermione	172	“ Well , maybe they did n’t expect him to get caught , ”
105579	105588	105589	105589	Ron	333	“ It could be a frame - up ! ”
105593	105598	105599	105599	he	333	“ No — listen ! ”
105616	105663	105599	105599	he	333	“ The Ministry suspects he ’s one of Dumbledore ’s lot so — I dunno — they lured him to the Ministry , and he was n’t trying to get through a door at all ! Maybe they ’ve just made something up to get him ! ”
105696	105713	105683	105683	Hermione	172	“ Do you know , I would n’t be at all surprised if that were true . ”
105741	105780	105732	105732	she	172	“ Right , well , I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on Self - Fertilizing Shrubs first , and if we ’re lucky we ’ll be able to start McGonagall ’s Inanimatus Conjurus before lunch ... ”
105821	105831	105833	105833	Ron	333	“ I mean , we can do it tonight , ”
105872	105892	105898	105898	he	156	“ And we ’ve got tomorrow . She gets too worked up about work , that ’s her trouble ... ”
105908	105924	105898	105898	he	156	“ D’you think she meant it when she said we were n’t copying from her ? ”
105925	105931	105933	105933	Harry	156	“ Yeah , I do , ”
105935	105958	105933	105933	Harry	156	“ Still , this is important too , we ’ve got to practice if we want to stay on the Quidditch team ... ”
105959	105966	105968	105968	Ron	333	“ Yeah , that ’s right , ”
105974	105987	105968	105968	Ron	333	“ And we have got plenty of time to do it all ... ”
106180	106186	106188	106188	George	245	“ All right , Ron ? ”
106194	106197	106199	106199	Ron	333	“ Yeah , ”
106215	106226	106228	106228	Fred	244	“ Ready to show us all up , Ickle Prefect ? ”
106250	106254	106256	106256	Ron	333	“ Shut up , ”
106293	106297	106299	106299	Angelina	398	“ Okay everyone , ”
106311	106358	106299	106299	Angelina	398	“ Let ’s get to it ; Alicia and Fred , if you can just bring the ball crate out for us . Oh , and there are a couple of people out there watching but I want you to just ignore them , all right ? ”
106433	106441	106445	106445	his	297	“ What ’s that Weasley ’s riding ? ”
106449	106465	106445	106445	his	297	“ Why would anyone put a Flying Charm on a moldy old log like that ? ”
106502	106506	106507	106507	he	156	“ Ignore them , ”
106517	106529	106507	106507	he	156	“ We ’ll see who ’s laughing after we play them ... ”
106530	106539	106541	106541	Angelina	398	“ Exactly the attitude I want , Harry , ”
106567	106589	106551	106551	her	398	“ Okay everyone , we ’re going to start with some passes just to warm up , the whole team please — ”
106590	106602	106604	106605	Pansy Parkinson	362	“ Hey , Johnson , what ’s with that hairstyle anyway ? ”
106609	106627	106604	106605	Pansy Parkinson	362	“ Why would anyone want to look like they ’ve got worms coming out of their head ? ”
106642	106657	106628	106628	Angelina	398	“ Spread out , then , and let ’s see what we can do ... ”
106788	106795	106797	106797	Angelina	398	“ Pass it on , Ron , ”
106823	106834	106836	106836	Malfoy	297	“ Hey , Potter , how ’s your scar feeling ? ”
106838	106877	106836	106836	Malfoy	297	“ Sure you do n’t need a lie - down ? It must be , what , a whole week since you were in the hospital wing , that ’s a record for you , is n’t it ? ”
106922	106929	106931	106931	Angelina	398	“ Come on now , Ron , ”
106946	106950	106935	106935	Ron	333	“ Pay attention . ”
107027	107030	107031	107031	Ron	333	“ Sorry ! ”

107059	107090	107057	107057	Angelina	398	“ But as you ’re passing to a teammate , do try not to knock her off her broom , wo n’t you ? We ’ve got Bludgers for that ! ”

107138	107148	107122	107122	Fred	244	“ It ’ll clear it up in no time . ”
107149	107153	107155	107155	Angelina	398	“ All right , ”
107157	107201	107155	107155	Angelina	398	“ Fred , George , go and get your bats and a Bludger ; Ron , get up to the goalposts , Harry , release the Snitch when I say so . We ’re going to aim for Ron ’s goal , obviously . ”
107213	107229	107231	107231	George	245	“ Ron ’s making a right pig ’s ear of things , is n’t he ? ”
107258	107264	107266	107266	Harry	156	“ He ’s just nervous , ”
107268	107281	107266	107266	Harry	156	“ He was fine when I was practicing with him this morning . ”
107282	107296	107298	107298	Fred	244	“ Yeah , well , I hope he has n’t peaked too soon , ”

107493	107536	107491	107491	Angelina	398	“ Either stay in center position until you have to move to defend a hoop , or else circle the hoops , but do n’t drift vaguely off to one side , that ’s how you let in the last three goals ! ”
107537	107540	107541	107541	Ron	333	“ Sorry ... ”
107557	107570	107544	107544	his	333	“ And Katie , ca n’t you do something about that nosebleed ? ”

107801	107807	107809	107809	Fred	244	“ We ’ll take her , ”
107811	107825	107809	107809	Fred	244	“ She — er — might have swallowed a Blood Blisterpod by mistake — ”
107826	107842	107844	107844	Angelina	398	“ Well , there ’s no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser gone , ”
107861	107872	107857	107857	Katie	385	“ Come on , let ’s go and get changed . ”

107996	108000	108002	108002	Hermione	172	“ No one , ”
108008	108012	108002	108002	Hermione	172	“ I thought — ”

108171	108175	108147	108147	Ron	333	“ Gryffindor are losers ”
108261	108278	108279	108279	Harry	156	“ You know , we probably should try and get more homework done during the week , ”
108316	108319	108321	108321	Ron	333	“ Yeah , ”
108341	108361	108321	108321	Ron	333	“ Listen ... shall we just ask Hermione if we can have a look at what she ’s done ? ”
108404	108407	108408	108408	he	156	“ No , ”
108412	108421	108408	108408	he	156	“ you know she wo n’t let us . ”
108464	108468	108456	108456	Hermione	172	“ Nearly done ? ”
108469	108472	108474	108474	Ron	333	“ No , ”
108477	108488	108489	108489	she	172	“ Jupiter ’s biggest moon is Ganymede , not Callisto , ”
108505	108516	108489	108489	she	172	“ and it ’s Io that ’s got the volcanos . ”
108517	108520	108522	108522	Ron	333	“ Thanks , ”
108530	108536	108489	108489	she	172	“ Sorry , I only — ”
108537	108552	108489	108489	she	172	“ Yeah , well , if you ’ve just come over here to criticize — ”
108553	108556	108489	108489	she	172	“ Ron — ”
108557	108584	108489	108489	she	172	“ I have n’t got time to listen to a sermon , all right , Hermione , I ’m up to my neck in it here — ”
108585	108590	108489	108489	she	172	“ No — look ! ”
108623	108629	108631	108631	Hermione	172	“ Is n’t that Hermes ? ”
108636	108642	108644	108644	Ron	333	“ Blimey , it is ! ”
108657	108666	108644	108644	Ron	333	“ What ’s Percy writing to me for ? ”
108721	108729	108731	108731	Ron	333	“ That ’s definitely Percy ’s handwriting , ”
108767	108772	108759	108759	He	333	“ What d’you reckon ? ”
108773	108777	108779	108779	Hermione	172	“ Open it ! ”
108845	108848	108849	108849	he	156	“ Well , ”
108865	108877	108849	108849	he	156	“ if you want to — er — what is it ? ”
108886	108905	108849	108849	he	156	“ Oh yeah — ‘ sever ties ’ with me , I swear I wo n’t get violent . ”
108906	108911	108913	108913	Ron	333	“ Give it back , ”
108920	108924	108925	108925	Ron	333	“ He is — ”
108936	108940	108925	108925	Ron	333	“ the world ’s ”
108948	108950	108952	108952	he	333	“ biggest ”
108958	108961	108962	108962	He	333	“ git . ”
108970	108986	108987	108987	he	333	“ Come on , we ’ve got to get this finished some time before dawn , ”
109015	109022	109023	109023	she	172	“ Oh , give them here , ”
109027	109030	109032	109032	Ron	333	“ What ? ”
109034	109049	109050	109050	she	172	“ Give them to me , I ’ll look through them and correct them , ”
109053	109067	109069	109069	Ron	333	“ Are you serious ? Ah , Hermione , you ’re a lifesaver , ”
109071	109077	109069	109069	Ron	333	“ what can I — ? ”
109078	109099	109100	109100	she	172	“ What you can say is , ‘ We promise we ’ll never leave our homework this late again , ’ ”
109120	109127	109129	109129	Harry	156	“ Thanks a million , Hermione , ”
109498	109505	109506	109506	Hermione	172	“ Okay , write that down , ”
109526	109540	109519	109519	her	172	“ and then copy out this conclusion that I ’ve written for you . ”
109541	109556	109558	109558	Ron	333	“ Hermione , you are honestly the most wonderful person I ’ve ever met , ”
109561	109572	109558	109558	Ron	333	“ and if I ’m ever rude to you again — ”
109573	109584	109586	109586	Hermione	172	“ — I ’ll know you ’re back to normal , ”
109588	109622	109586	109586	Hermione	172	“ Harry , yours is okay except for this bit at the end , I think you must have misheard Professor Sinistra , Europa ’s covered in ice , not mice — Harry ? ”
109648	109653	109655	109655	Ron	333	“ Er — Harry ? ”
109658	109665	109655	109655	Ron	333	“ Why are you down there ? ”
109666	109679	109681	109681	Harry	156	“ Because I ’ve just seen Sirius ’s head in the fire , ”
109732	109737	109738	109738	Hermione	172	“ Sirius ’s head ? ”
109741	109772	109738	109738	Hermione	172	“ You mean like when he wanted to talk to you during the Triwizard Tournament ? But he would n’t do that now , it would be too — Sirius ! ”
109808	109825	109826	109826	he	156	“ I was starting to think you ’d go to bed before everyone else had disappeared , ”
109829	109837	109826	109826	he	156	“ I ’ve been checking every hour . ”
109838	109849	109850	109850	Harry	156	“ You ’ve been popping into the fire every hour ? ”
109856	109871	109826	109826	he	156	“ Just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear yet . ”
109872	109881	109883	109883	Hermione	172	“ But what if you ’d been seen ? ”
109886	109916	109917	109917	Sirius	174	“ Well , I think a girl — first year by the look of her — might ’ve got a glimpse of me earlier , but do n’t worry , ”
109930	109957	109917	109917	Sirius	174	“ I was gone the moment she looked back at me and I ’ll bet she just thought I was an oddly shaped log or something . ”
109958	109969	109970	109970	Hermione	172	“ But Sirius , this is taking an awful risk — ”
109973	109979	109981	109981	Sirius	174	“ You sound like Molly , ”
109983	110010	109981	109981	Sirius	174	“ This was the only way I could come up with of answering Harry ’s letter without resorting to a code — and codes are breakable . ”
110030	110041	110043	110043	Hermione	172	“ You did n’t say you ’d written to Sirius ! ”
110046	110050	110052	110052	Harry	156	“ I forgot , ”
110076	110106	110062	110062	Cho	359	“ Do n’t look at me like that , Hermione , there was no way anyone would have got secret information out of it , was there , Sirius ? ”
110107	110115	110117	110117	Sirius	174	“ No , it was very good , ”
110121	110140	110117	110117	Sirius	174	“ Anyway , we ’d better be quick , just in case we ’re disturbed — your scar . ”
110141	110146	110147	110147	Ron	333	“ What about — ? ”
110155	110167	110151	110151	Hermione	172	“ We ’ll tell you afterward , go on , Sirius . ”
110168	110206	110117	110117	Sirius	174	“ Well , I know it ca n’t be fun when it hurts , but we do n’t think it ’s anything to really worry about . It kept aching all last year , did n’t it ? ”
110207	110223	110225	110225	Harry	156	“ Yeah , and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion , ”
110238	110259	110225	110225	Harry	156	“ So maybe he was just , I dunno , really angry or something the night I had that detention . ”
110260	110275	110277	110277	Sirius	174	“ Well , now he ’s back it ’s bound to hurt more often , ”
110279	110302	110303	110303	Harry	156	“ So you do n’t think it had anything to do with Umbridge touching me when I was in detention with her ? ”
110306	110311	110313	110313	Sirius	174	“ I doubt it , ”
110315	110331	110313	110313	Sirius	174	“ I know her by reputation and I ’m sure she ’s no Death Eater — ”
110332	110341	110343	110343	Harry	156	“ She ’s foul enough to be one , ”
110354	110370	110372	110372	Sirius	174	“ Yes , but the world is n’t split into good people and Death Eaters , ”
110378	110399	110372	110372	Sirius	174	“ I know she ’s a nasty piece of work , though — you should hear Remus talk about her . ”
110400	110406	110408	110408	Harry	156	“ Does Lupin know her ? ”
110425	110428	110430	110430	Sirius	174	“ No , ”
110432	110458	110430	110430	Sirius	174	“ but she drafted a bit of anti - werewolf legislation two years ago that makes it almost impossible for him to get a job . ”
110477	110485	110487	110487	Hermione	172	“ What ’s she got against werewolves ? ”
110490	110498	110500	110500	Sirius	174	“ Scared of them , I expect , ”
110507	110547	110500	110500	Sirius	174	“ Apparently she loathes part - humans ; she campaigned to have merpeople rounded up and tagged last year too . Imagine wasting your time and energy persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags like Kreacher on the loose — ”
110555	110558	110559	110559	she	172	“ Sirius ! ”
110563	110604	110559	110559	she	172	“ Honestly , if you made a bit of an effort with Kreacher I ’m sure he ’d respond , after all , you are the only member of his family he ’s got left , and Professor Dumbledore said — ”
110605	110614	110615	110615	Sirius	174	“ So what are Umbridge ’s lessons like ? ”
110618	110630	110615	110615	Sirius	174	“ Is she training you all to kill half - breeds ? ”
110631	110634	110636	110636	Harry	156	“ No , ”
110653	110664	110651	110651	Kreacher	259	“ She ’s not letting us use magic at all ! ”
110665	110675	110677	110677	Ron	333	“ All we do is read the stupid textbook , ”
110679	110687	110689	110689	Sirius	174	“ Ah , well , that figures , ”
110691	110709	110689	110689	Sirius	174	“ Our information from inside the Ministry is that Fudge does n’t want you trained in combat . ”
110710	110715	110717	110717	Harry	156	“ Trained in combat ? ”
110720	110737	110717	110717	Harry	156	“ What does he think we ’re doing here , forming some sort of wizard army ? ”
110738	110749	110751	110751	Sirius	174	“ That ’s exactly what he thinks you ’re doing , ”
110753	110788	110751	110751	Sirius	174	“ or rather , that ’s exactly what he ’s afraid Dumbledore ’s doing — forming his own private army , with which he will be able to take on the Ministry of Magic . ”
110800	110822	110797	110797	Ron	333	“ That ’s the stupidest thing I ’ve ever heard , including all the stuff that Luna Lovegood comes out with . ”
110823	110848	110850	110850	Hermione	172	“ So we ’re being prevented from learning Defense Against the Dark Arts because Fudge is scared we ’ll use spells against the Ministry ? ”
110855	110858	110860	110860	Sirius	174	“ Yep , ”
110862	110903	110860	110860	Sirius	174	“ Fudge thinks Dumbledore will stop at nothing to seize power . He ’s getting more paranoid about Dumbledore by the day . It ’s a matter of time before he has Dumbledore arrested on some trumped - up charge . ”
110912	110940	110908	110908	Percy	253	“ D’you know if there ’s going to be anything about Dumbledore in the Daily Prophet tomorrow ? Only Ron ’s brother Percy reckons there will be — ”
110941	110947	110949	110949	Sirius	174	“ I do n’t know , ”
110951	110977	110949	110949	Sirius	174	“ I have n’t seen anyone from the Order all weekend , they ’re all busy . It ’s just been Kreacher and me here ... ”
110990	111003	110986	110986	Sirius	174	“ So you have n’t had any news about Hagrid , either ? ”
111004	111007	111009	111009	Sirius	174	“ Ah ... ”
111011	111033	111009	111009	Sirius	174	“ well , he was supposed to be back by now , no one ’s sure what ’s happened to him . ”
111045	111070	111041	111041	he	174	“ But Dumbledore ’s not worried , so do n’t you three get yourselves in a state ; I ’m sure Hagrid ’s fine . ”
111071	111083	111085	111085	Hermione	172	“ But if he was supposed to be back by now ... ”
111093	111140	111041	111041	he	174	“ Madame Maxime was with him , we ’ve been in touch with her and she says they got separated on the journey home — but there ’s nothing to suggest he ’s hurt or — well , nothing to suggest he ’s not perfectly okay . ”
111153	111166	111168	111168	Sirius	174	“ Listen , do n’t go asking too many questions about Hagrid , ”
111171	111206	111168	111168	Sirius	174	“ it ’ll just draw even more attention to the fact that he ’s not back , and I know Dumbledore does n’t want that . Hagrid ’s tough , he ’ll be okay . ”
111220	111253	111217	111217	Sirius	174	“ When ’s your next Hogsmeade weekend anyway ? I was thinking , we got away with the dog disguise at the station , did n’t we ? I thought I could — ”
111254	111257	111259	111259	Harry	156	“ NO ! ”
111267	111278	111280	111280	Hermione	172	“ Sirius , did n’t you see the Daily Prophet ? ”
111283	111287	111289	111289	Sirius	174	“ Oh that , ”
111293	111310	111289	111289	Sirius	174	“ they ’re always guessing where I am , they have n’t really got a clue — ”
111311	111322	111324	111324	Harry	156	“ Yeah , but we think this time they have , ”
111326	111375	111324	111324	Harry	156	“ Something Malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you , and his father was on the platform , Sirius — you know , Lucius Malfoy — so do n’t come up here , whatever you do , if Malfoy recognizes you again — ”
111376	111389	111391	111391	Sirius	174	“ All right , all right , I ’ve got the point , ”
111398	111411	111393	111393	He	174	“ Just an idea , thought you might like to get together — ”
111412	111427	111429	111429	Harry	156	“ I would , I just do n’t want you chucked back in Azkaban ! ”
111453	111464	111465	111465	he	174	“ You ’re less like your father than I thought , ”
111476	111489	111473	111473	his	174	“ The risk would ’ve been what made it fun for James . ”
111490	111493	111473	111473	his	174	“ Look — ”
111494	111512	111514	111514	Sirius	174	“ Well , I ’d better get going , I can hear Kreacher coming down the stairs , ”
111524	111555	111520	111520	he	174	“ I ’ll write to tell you a time I can make it back into the fire , then , shall I ? If you can stand to risk it ? ”
111649	111655	111657	111657	Harry	156	“ ‘ High Inquisitor ’ ? ”
111672	111678	111657	111657	Harry	156	“ What does that mean ? ”
111683	111690	111692	111692	Harry	156	“ She ’s been a WHAT ? ”
111695	111702	111704	111704	Hermione	172	“ Wait , there ’s more , ”
111720	111758	111759	111759	Hermione	172	“ So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge ! Fudge passed this ‘ Educational Decree ’ and forced her on us ! And now he ’s given her the power to inspect other teachers ! ”
111770	111781	111764	111764	her	172	“ I ca n’t believe this . It ’s outrageous ... ”
111782	111788	111790	111790	Harry	156	“ I know it is , ”
111834	111837	111839	111839	Harry	156	“ What ? ”
111848	111860	111862	111862	Ron	333	“ Oh , I ca n’t wait to see McGonagall inspected , ”
111865	111875	111862	111862	Ron	333	“ Umbridge wo n’t know what ’s hit her . ”
111876	111882	111884	111884	Hermione	172	“ Well , come on , ”
111889	111911	111884	111884	Hermione	172	“ we ’d better get going , if she ’s inspecting Binns ’s class we do n’t want to be late ... ”
111971	111991	111993	111993	Snape	249	“ I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O.W.L. , ”
112009	112025	111999	111999	he	249	“ This should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in your examination . ”
112039	112100	112026	112026	Snape	249	“ The general standard of this homework was abysmal . Most of you would have failed had this been your examination . I expect to see a great deal more effort for this week ’s essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes , or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get D ’s . ”
112113	112122	112101	112101	He	156	“ Some people got D ’s ? Ha ! ”
112249	112264	112266	112266	Hermione	172	“ Well , that was n’t as bad as last week , was it ? ”
112288	112302	112266	112266	Hermione	172	“ And the homework did n’t go too badly either , did it ? ”
112314	112353	112310	112310	she	172	“ I mean , all right , I did n’t expect the top grade , not if he ’s marking to O.W.L. standard , but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage , would n’t you say ? ”
112363	112409	112310	112310	she	172	“ Of course , a lot can happen between now and the exam , we ’ve got plenty of time to improve , but the grades we ’re getting now are a sort of baseline , are n’t they ? Something we can build on ... ”
112419	112434	112410	112410	They	2239	“ Obviously , I ’d have been thrilled if I ’d gotten an O — ”
112435	112438	112440	112440	Ron	333	“ Hermione , ”
112443	112456	112440	112440	Ron	333	“ if you want to know what grades we got , ask . ”
112457	112476	112410	112410	They	2239	“ I do n’t — I did n’t mean — well , if you want to tell me — ”
112477	112483	112485	112485	Ron	333	“ I got a P , ”
112493	112496	112485	112485	Ron	333	“ Happy ? ”
112497	112508	112510	112510	Fred	244	“ Well , that ’s nothing to be ashamed of , ”
112533	112541	112510	112510	Fred	244	“ Nothing wrong with a good healthy P. ”
112542	112545	112547	112547	Hermione	172	“ But , ”
112549	112556	112547	112547	Hermione	172	“ does n’t P stand for ... ”
112557	112564	112566	112567	Lee Jordan	353	“ ‘ Poor , ’ yeah , ”
112569	112584	112566	112567	Lee Jordan	353	“ Still , better than D , is n’t it ? ‘ Dreadful ’ ? ”
112622	112633	112634	112634	she	172	“ So top grade ’s O for ‘ Outstanding , ’ ”
112638	112645	112634	112634	she	172	“ and then there ’s A — ”
112646	112651	112652	112652	George	245	“ No , E , ”
112656	112691	112652	112652	George	245	“ E for ‘ Exceeds Expectations . ’ And I ’ve always thought Fred and I should ’ve got E in everything , because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams . ”
112702	112727	112696	112696	Hermione	172	“ So after E , it ’s A for ‘ Acceptable , ’ and that ’s the last pass grade , is n’t it ? ”
112728	112731	112733	112733	Fred	244	“ Yep , ”
112754	112763	112765	112765	Ron	333	“ Then you get P for ‘ Poor ’ ”
112774	112782	112765	112765	Ron	333	“ and D for ‘ Dreadful . ’ ”
112783	112788	112789	112789	George	245	“ And then T , ”
112793	112796	112798	112798	Hermione	172	“ T ? ”
112803	112818	112798	112798	Hermione	172	“ Even lower than a D ? What on earth does that stand for ? ”
112819	112824	112826	112826	George	245	“ ‘ Troll , ’ ”
112872	112881	112882	112882	Fred	244	“ You lot had an inspected lesson yet ? ”
112886	112889	112891	112891	Hermione	172	“ No , ”
112895	112899	112891	112891	Hermione	172	“ have you ? ”
112900	112907	112909	112909	George	245	“ Just now , before lunch , ”
112911	112914	112909	112909	George	245	“ Charms . ”
112915	112921	112922	112922	Harry	156	“ What was it like ? ”
112931	113003	112928	112928	Fred	244	“ Not that bad . Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on a clipboard . You know what Flitwick ’s like , he treated her like a guest , did n’t seem to bother him at all . She did n’t say much . Asked Alicia a couple of questions about what the classes are normally like , Alicia told her they were really good , that was it . ”
113004	113015	113017	113017	George	245	“ I ca n’t see old Flitwick getting marked down , ”
113019	113030	113017	113017	George	245	“ he usually gets everyone through their exams all right . ”
113031	113039	113040	113040	Fred	244	“ Who ’ve you got this afternoon ? ”
113044	113047	112928	112928	Fred	244	“ Trelawney — ”
113048	113057	112928	112928	Fred	244	“ A T if ever I saw one — ”
113058	113064	112928	112928	Fred	244	“ — and Umbridge herself . ”
113065	113080	113082	113082	George	245	“ Well , be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today , ”
113084	113097	113082	113082	George	245	“ Angelina’ll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch practices . ”
113197	113204	113209	113209	her	390	“ Good afternoon , Professor Trelawney , ”
113213	113231	113209	113209	her	390	“ You received my note , I trust ? Giving the time and date of your inspection ? ”
113336	113348	113349	113349	she	390	“ We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today , ”
113367	113389	113349	113349	she	390	“ Divide into pairs , please , and interpret each other ’s latest nighttime visions with the aid of the Oracle . ”
113495	113503	113504	113504	he	156	“ Think of a dream , quick , ”
113508	113518	113504	113504	he	156	“ in case the old toad comes our way . ”
113519	113526	113527	113527	Ron	333	“ I did it last time , ”
113530	113541	113527	113527	Ron	333	“ it ’s your turn , you tell me one . ”
113542	113548	113550	113550	Harry	156	“ Oh , I dunno ... ”
113567	113588	113550	113550	Harry	156	“ Let ’s say I dreamed I was ... drowning Snape in my cauldron . Yeah , that ’ll do ... ”
113598	113639	113592	113592	he	333	“ Okay , we ’ve got to add your age to the date you had the dream , the number of letters in the subject ... would that be ‘ drowning ’ or ‘ cauldron ’ or ‘ Snape ’ ? ”
113640	113651	113653	113653	Harry	156	“ It does n’t matter , pick any of them , ”
113684	113693	113694	113694	Ron	333	“ What night did you dream this again ? ”
113701	113712	113713	113713	Harry	156	“ I dunno , last night , whenever you like , ”
113759	113762	113764	113764	Umbridge	390	“ Now , ”
113771	113783	113764	113764	Umbridge	390	“ you ’ve been in this post how long , exactly ? ”
113844	113849	113836	113836	she	390	“ Nearly sixteen years . ”
113850	113855	113857	113858	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Quite a period , ”
113867	113877	113857	113858	Professor Umbridge	390	“ So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you ? ”
113878	113883	113885	113886	Professor Trelawney	407	“ That ’s right , ”
113895	113912	113857	113858	Professor Umbridge	390	“ And you are a great - great - granddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney ? ”
113913	113916	113918	113919	Professor Trelawney	407	“ Yes , ”
113934	113963	113857	113858	Professor Umbridge	390	“ But I think — correct me if I am mistaken — that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of second sight ? ”
113964	113975	113977	113978	Professor Trelawney	407	“ These things often skip — er — three generations , ”
113987	113991	113992	113992	she	390	“ Of course , ”
114001	114015	113992	113992	she	390	“ Well , if you could just predict something for me , then ? ”
114036	114043	114045	114046	Professor Trelawney	407	“ I do n’t understand you , ”
114058	114070	114072	114073	Professor Umbridge	390	“ I ’d like you to make a prediction for me , ”
114121	114131	114132	114132	she	407	“ The Inner Eye does not See upon command ! ”
114138	114142	114144	114145	Professor Umbridge	390	“ I see , ”
114156	114165	114167	114168	Professor Trelawney	407	“ I — but — but ... wait ! ”
114196	114224	114175	114175	her	407	“ I ... I think I do see something ... something that concerns you ... Why , I sense something ... something dark ... some grave peril ... ”
114245	114260	114261	114262	Professor Trelawney	407	“ I am afraid ... I am afraid that you are in grave danger ! ”
114279	114282	114283	114283	she	390	“ Right , ”
114294	114307	114283	114283	she	390	“ Well , if that ’s really the best you can do ... ”
114389	114392	114393	114393	she	390	“ Well ? ”
114408	114424	114393	114393	she	390	“ Let me see the start you ’ve made on your dream diary , please . ”
114585	114589	114590	114590	she	390	“ Wands away , ”
114615	114657	114590	114590	she	390	“ As we finished chapter one last lesson , I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two , ‘ Common Defensive Theories and Their Derivation . ’ There will be no need to talk . ”
114811	114821	114794	114794	she	390	“ What is it this time , Miss Granger ? ”
114822	114830	114832	114832	Hermione	172	“ I ’ve already read chapter two , ”
114834	114843	114794	114794	she	390	“ Well then , proceed to chapter three . ”
114844	114858	114794	114794	she	390	“ I ’ve read that too . I ’ve read the whole book . ”
114869	114890	114794	114794	she	390	“ Well , then , you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says about counterjinxes in chapter fifteen . ”
114891	114900	114902	114902	Hermione	172	“ He says that counterjinxes are improperly named , ”
114905	114929	114902	114902	Hermione	172	“ He says ‘ counterjinx ’ is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable . ”
114946	114951	114952	114952	Hermione	172	“ But I disagree , ”
114970	114974	114964	114964	her	390	“ You disagree ? ”
114975	114981	114983	114983	Hermione	172	“ Yes , I do , ”
115015	115040	114983	114983	Hermione	172	“ Mr. Slinkhard does n’t like jinxes , does he ? But I think they can be very useful when they ’re used defensively . ”
115041	115050	115052	115053	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Oh , you do , do you ? ”
115062	115088	115052	115053	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Well , I ’m afraid it is Mr. Slinkhard ’s opinion , and not yours , that matters within this classroom , Miss Granger . ”
115089	115092	115093	115093	Hermione	172	“ But — ”
115096	115101	115103	115104	Professor Umbridge	390	“ That is enough , ”
115134	115149	115106	115106	She	390	“ Miss Granger , I am going to take five points from Gryffindor House . ”
115159	115163	115165	115165	Harry	156	“ What for ? ”
115168	115175	115176	115176	Hermione	172	“ Do n’t you get involved ! ”
115182	115191	115193	115194	Professor Umbridge	390	“ For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions , ”
115197	115278	115193	115194	Professor Umbridge	390	“ I am here to teach you using a Ministry - approved method that does not include inviting students to give their opinions on matters about which they understand very little . Your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more license , but as none of them — with the possible exception of Professor Quirrell , who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age - appropriate subjects — would have passed a Ministry inspection — ”
115279	115288	115290	115290	Harry	156	“ Yeah , Quirrell was a great teacher , ”
115293	115314	115290	115290	Harry	156	“ there was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head . ”
115332	115348	115350	115350	Umbridge	390	“ I think another week ’s detentions would do you some good , Mr. Potter , ”
115482	115503	115447	115447	She	398	“ Miss Johnson , how dare you make such a racket in the Great Hall ! Five points from Gryffindor ! ”
115504	115518	115571	115571	she	398	“ But Professor — he ’s gone and landed himself in detention again — ”
115519	115526	115528	115529	Professor McGonagall	306	“ What ’s this , Potter ? ”
115536	115542	115528	115529	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Detention ? From whom ? ”
115543	115548	115550	115550	Harry	156	“ From Professor Umbridge , ”
115564	115570	115571	115571	she	398	“ Are you telling me , ”
115590	115611	115571	115571	she	398	“ that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor Umbridge ’s class again ? ”
115612	115615	115616	115616	Harry	156	“ Yes , ”
115624	115648	115575	115575	her	398	“ Potter , you must get a grip on yourself ! You are heading for serious trouble ! Another five points from Gryffindor ! ”
115649	115658	115659	115659	Harry	156	“ But — what ? Professor , no ! ”
115667	115686	115659	115659	Harry	156	“ I ’m already being punished by her , why do you have to take points as well ? ”
115687	115701	115703	115704	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you whatsoever ! ”
115707	115745	115703	115704	Professor McGonagall	306	“ No , not another word of complaint , Potter ! And as for you , Miss Johnson , you will confine your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team Captaincy ! ”
115779	115804	115770	115770	himself	156	“ She ’s taken points off Gryffindor because I ’m having my hand sliced open every night ! How is that fair , how ? ”
115805	115811	115813	115813	Ron	333	“ I know , mate , ”
115823	115831	115813	115813	Ron	333	“ she ’s bang out of order . ”
115848	115858	115860	115860	Harry	156	“ You think McGonagall was right , do you ? ”
115873	115901	115903	115903	Hermione	172	“ I wish she had n’t taken points from you , but I think she ’s right to warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge , ”
115969	115972	115974	115974	Ron	333	“ Excellent , ”
115985	115995	115974	115974	Ron	333	“ Let ’s see Umbridge get what she deserves . ”
116015	116020	116021	116021	she	306	“ That will do , ”
116028	116071	116021	116021	she	306	“ Mr. Finnigan , kindly come here and hand back the homework — Miss Brown , please take this box of mice — do n’t be silly , girl , they wo n’t hurt you — and hand one to each student — ”
116072	116077	116079	116080	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Hem , hem , ”
116133	116193	116106	116106	Seamus	393	“ Right then , everyone , listen closely — Dean Thomas , if you do that to the mouse again I shall put you in detention — most of you have now successfully vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have the gist of the spell . Today we shall be — ”
116194	116199	116201	116202	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Hem , hem , ”
116204	116207	116209	116210	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Yes ? ”
116230	116254	116106	116106	Seamus	393	“ I was just wondering , Professor , whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec — ”
116255	116275	116277	116278	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Obviously I received it , or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom , ”
116297	116322	116288	116291	Many of the students	1777	“ As I was saying , today we shall be practicing the altogether more difficult vanishment of mice . Now , the Vanishing Spell — ”
116323	116328	116343	116344	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Hem , hem . ”
116329	116333	116335	116336	Professor McGonagall	306	“ I wonder , ”
116346	116382	116335	116336	Professor McGonagall	306	“ how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me ? You see , I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking . ”
116426	116508	116418	116419	Professor McGonagall	306	“ As I was saying , the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished . The snail , as an invertebrate , does not present much of a challenge ; the mouse , as a mammal , offers a much greater one . This is not , therefore , magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner . So — you know the incantation , let me see what you can do ... ”
116509	116523	116524	116524	Harry	156	“ How she can lecture me about not losing my temper with Umbridge ! ”
116611	116619	116621	116621	Ron	333	“ Well , it ’s a start , ”
116682	116692	116693	116694	Professor Umbridge	390	“ How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts ? ”
116697	116705	116707	116708	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Thirty - nine years this December , ”
116722	116726	116727	116727	she	390	“ Very well , ”
116730	116745	116727	116727	she	390	“ you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days ’ time . ”
116746	116752	116754	116755	Professor McGonagall	306	“ I can hardly wait , ”
116770	116777	116778	116778	she	390	“ Hurry up , you three , ”
116864	116877	116880	116880	her	390	“ You do not usually take this class , is that correct ? ”
116907	116911	116913	116916	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ Quite correct , ”
116931	116943	116928	116928	her	390	“ I am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor Hagrid . ”
116979	116982	116984	116985	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Hmm , ”
117000	117034	116996	116996	her	390	“ I wonder — the headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter — can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid ’s very extended leave of absence ? ”
117042	117049	117051	117054	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ ’ Fraid I ca n’t , ”
117057	117103	117051	117054	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ Do n’t know anything more about it than you do . Got an owl from Dumbledore , would I like a couple of weeks teaching work , accepted — that ’s as much as I know . Well ... shall I get started then ? ”
117104	117110	117112	117113	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Yes , please do , ”
117164	117167	117169	117170	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Overall , ”
117188	117228	117169	117170	Professor Umbridge	390	“ how do you , as a temporary member of staff — an objective outsider , I suppose you might say — how do you find Hogwarts ? Do you feel you receive enough support from the school management ? ”
117229	117238	117240	117243	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ Oh , yes , Dumbledore ’s excellent , ”
117246	117264	117240	117243	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ No , I ’m very happy with the way things are run , very happy indeed . ”
117281	117307	117269	117269	Umbridge	390	“ And what are you planning to cover with this class this year — assuming , of course , that Professor Hagrid does not return ? ”
117308	117326	117328	117331	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ Oh , I ’ll take them through the creatures that most often come up in O.W.L. , ”
117333	117368	117328	117331	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ Not much left to do — they ’ve studied unicorns and nifflers , I thought we ’d cover porlocks and kneazles , make sure they can recognize crups and knarls , you know ... ”
117369	117385	117387	117388	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Well , you seem to know what you ’re doing , at any rate , ”
117408	117410	117405	117405	she	390	“ you ”
117425	117438	117417	117417	she	390	“ Now , I hear there have been injuries in this class ? ”
117452	117457	117458	117458	he	297	“ That was me , ”
117461	117469	117458	117458	he	297	“ I was slashed by a hippogriff . ”
117470	117474	117476	117477	Professor Umbridge	390	“ A hippogriff ? ”
117483	117500	117502	117502	Harry	156	“ Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do , ”
117522	117531	117532	117532	she	390	“ Another night ’s detention , I think , ”
117536	117571	117532	117532	she	390	“ Well , thank you very much , Professor Grubbly - Plank , I think that ’s all I need here . You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days . ”
117572	117576	117578	117581	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ Jolly good , ”
117669	117672	117673	117673	she	172	“ Here , ”
117687	117709	117673	117673	she	172	“ soak your hand in that , it ’s a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles , it should help . ”
117747	117750	117751	117751	he	156	“ Thanks , ”
117765	117775	117777	117777	Ron	333	“ I still reckon you should complain about this , ”
117783	117786	117788	117788	Harry	156	“ No , ”
117791	117800	117761	117761	his	156	“ McGonagall would go nuts if she knew — ”
117801	117808	117810	117810	Harry	156	“ Yeah , she probably would , ”
117812	117838	117810	117810	Harry	156	“ And how long d’you reckon it ’d take Umbridge to pass another Decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately ? ”
117864	117871	117873	117873	Hermione	172	“ She ’s an awful woman , ”
117879	117905	117873	117873	Hermione	172	“ Awful . You know , I was just saying to Ron when you came in ... we ’ve got to do something about her . ”
117906	117911	117913	117913	Ron	333	“ I suggested poison , ”
117916	117946	117948	117948	Hermione	172	“ No ... I mean , something about what a dreadful teacher she is , and how we ’re not going to learn any defense from her at all , ”
117950	117960	117962	117962	Ron	333	“ Well , what can we do about that ? ”
117966	117992	117962	117962	Ron	333	“ ’S too late , is n’t it ? She got the job , she ’s here to stay , Fudge’ll make sure of that . ”
117993	117996	117998	117998	Hermione	172	“ Well , ”
118001	118010	118011	118011	She	172	“ You know , I was thinking today ... ”
118024	118045	118011	118011	She	172	“ I was thinking that — maybe the time ’s come when we should just — just do it ourselves . ”
118046	118051	118053	118053	Harry	156	“ Do what ourselves ? ”
118067	118078	118080	118080	Hermione	172	“ Well — learn Defense Against the Dark Arts ourselves , ”
118082	118087	118089	118089	Ron	333	“ Come off it , ”
118091	118118	118089	118089	Ron	333	“ You want us to do extra work ? D’you realize Harry and I are behind on homework again and it ’s only the second week ? ”
118119	118129	118131	118131	Hermione	172	“ But this is much more important than homework ! ”
118140	118156	118158	118158	Ron	333	“ I did n’t think there was anything in the universe more important than homework , ”
118160	118171	118173	118173	Hermione	172	“ Do n’t be silly , of course there is ! ”
118202	118247	118196	118196	S.P.E.W.	468	“ It ’s about preparing ourselves , like Harry said in Umbridge ’s first lesson , for what ’s waiting out there . It ’s about making sure we really can defend ourselves . If we do n’t learn anything for a whole year — ”
118248	118257	118259	118259	Ron	333	“ We ca n’t do much by ourselves , ”
118265	118291	118259	118259	Ron	333	“ I mean , all right , we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practice them , I suppose — ”
118292	118314	118316	118316	Hermione	172	“ No , I agree , we ’ve gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books , ”
118318	118346	118316	118316	Hermione	172	“ We need a teacher , a proper one , who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we ’re going wrong . ”
118347	118355	118356	118356	Harry	156	“ If you ’re talking about Lupin ... ”
118359	118371	118373	118373	Hermione	172	“ No , no , I ’m not talking about Lupin , ”
118375	118404	118373	118373	Hermione	172	“ He ’s too busy with the Order and anyway , the most we could see him is during Hogsmeade weekends and that ’s not nearly often enough . ”
118405	118410	118412	118412	Harry	156	“ Who , then ? ”
118425	118431	118432	118432	she	172	“ Is n’t it obvious ? ”
118435	118444	118432	118432	she	172	“ I ’m talking about you , Harry . ”
118466	118471	118473	118473	Harry	156	“ About me what ? ”
118475	118489	118493	118493	her	172	“ I ’m talking about you teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts . ”
118545	118551	118542	118542	he	333	“ That ’s an idea . ”
118552	118558	118560	118560	Harry	156	“ What ’s an idea ? ”
118562	118565	118567	118567	Ron	333	“ You , ”
118569	118576	118567	118567	Ron	333	“ Teaching us to do it . ”
118577	118580	118542	118542	he	333	“ But ... ”
118596	118608	118590	118590	them	2290	“ But I ’m not a teacher , I ca n’t — ”
118609	118626	118628	118628	Hermione	172	“ Harry , you ’re the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts , ”
118630	118633	118635	118635	Harry	156	“ Me ? ”
118644	118658	118635	118635	Harry	156	“ No I ’m not , you ’ve beaten me in every test — ”
118659	118666	118668	118668	Hermione	172	“ Actually , I have n’t , ”
118671	118715	118668	118668	Hermione	172	“ You beat me in our third year — the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject . But I ’m not talking about test results , Harry . Look what you ’ve done ! ”
118716	118721	118635	118635	Harry	156	“ How d’you mean ? ”
118722	118739	118740	118740	Ron	333	“ You know what , I ’m not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me , ”
118753	118758	118759	118759	he	333	“ Let ’s think , ”
118769	118786	118759	118759	he	333	“ Uh ... first year — you saved the Stone from You - Know - Who . ”
118787	118793	118795	118795	Harry	156	“ But that was luck , ”
118797	118803	118795	118795	Harry	156	“ that was n’t skill — ”
118804	118808	118809	118809	Ron	333	“ Second year , ”
118812	118821	118809	118809	Ron	333	“ you killed the basilisk and destroyed Riddle . ”
118822	118834	118795	118795	Harry	156	“ Yeah , but if Fawkes had n’t turned up I — ”
118835	118839	118841	118841	Ron	333	“ Third year , ”
118846	118857	118841	118841	Ron	333	“ you fought off about a hundred dementors at once — ”
118858	118874	118795	118795	Harry	156	“ You know that was a fluke , if the Time - Turner had n’t — ”
118875	118879	118880	118880	Ron	333	“ Last year , ”
118887	118898	118880	118880	Ron	333	“ you fought off You - Know - Who again — ”
118899	118904	118906	118906	Harry	156	“ Listen to me ! ”
118920	118982	118912	118912	Ron	333	“ Just listen to me , all right ? It sounds great when you say it like that , but all that stuff was luck — I did n’t know what I was doing half the time , I did n’t plan any of it , I just did whatever I could think of , and I nearly always had help — ”
119008	119030	119031	119031	he	156	“ Do n’t sit there grinning like you know better than I do , I was there , was n’t I ? ”
119035	119108	119031	119031	he	156	“ I know what went on , all right ? And I did n’t get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defense Against the Dark Arts , I got through it all because — because help came at the right time , or because I guessed right — but I just blundered through it all , I did n’t have a clue what I was doing — STOP LAUGHING ! ”
119154	119333	119376	119376	He	333	“ You do n’t know what it ’s like ! You — neither of you — you ’ve never had to face him , have you ? You think it ’s just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing them at him , like you ’re in class or something ? The whole time you know there ’s nothing between you and dying except your own — your own brain or guts or whatever — like you can think straight when you know you ’re about a second from being murdered , or tortured , or watching your friends die — they ’ve never taught us that in their classes , what it ’s like to deal with things like that — and you two sit there acting like I ’m a clever little boy to be standing here , alive , like Diggory was stupid , like he messed up — you just do n’t get it , that could just as easily have been me , it would have been if Voldemort had n’t needed me — ”
119334	119345	119347	119347	Ron	333	“ We were n’t saying anything like that , mate , ”
119352	119375	119347	119347	Ron	333	“ We were n’t having a go at Diggory , we did n’t — you ’ve got the wrong end of the — ”
119387	119390	119391	119391	she	172	“ Harry , ”
119395	119431	119391	119391	she	172	“ do n’t you see ? This ... this is exactly why we need you ... We need to know what it ’s r - really like ... facing him ... facing V - Voldemort . ”
119496	119503	119505	119505	Hermione	172	“ Well ... think about it , ”
119508	119511	119505	119505	Hermione	172	“ Please ? ”
119546	119555	119556	119556	she	172	“ Well , I ’m off to bed , ”
119572	119578	119556	119556	she	172	“ Erm ... ’ night . ”
119587	119590	119591	119591	he	333	“ Coming ? ”
119597	119600	119602	119602	Harry	156	“ Yeah , ”
119604	119618	119602	119602	Harry	156	“ In ... in a minute . I ’ll just clear this up . ”
119633	119636	119637	119637	Harry	156	“ Reparo , ”
119856	119861	119862	119862	Hermione	172	“ I was wondering , ”
119866	119882	119862	119862	Hermione	172	“ whether you ’d thought any more about Defense Against the Dark Arts , Harry . ”
119883	119889	119891	119891	Harry	156	“ ’ Course I have , ”
119894	119909	119891	119891	Harry	156	“ Ca n’t forget it , can we , with that hag teaching us — ”
119910	119919	119921	119921	Ron	333	“ I meant the idea Ron and I had ”
119937	119955	119932	119932	she	172	“ oh , all right , the idea I had , then — about you teaching us . ”
120065	120068	120069	120069	he	156	“ Well , ”
120088	120101	120069	120069	he	156	“ yeah , I — I ’ve thought about it a bit . ”
120102	120105	120107	120107	Hermione	172	“ And ? ”
120110	120114	120116	120116	Harry	156	“ I dunno , ”
120128	120140	120142	120142	Ron	333	“ I thought it was a good idea from the start , ”
120174	120194	120154	120154	he	333	“ You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck , did n’t you ? ”
120195	120200	120202	120202	Hermione	172	“ Yes , Harry , ”
120205	120273	120202	120202	Hermione	172	“ but all the same , there ’s no point pretending that you ’re not good at Defense Against the Dark Arts , because you are . You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely , you can produce a Patronus , you can do all sorts of stuff that full - grown wizards ca n’t , Viktor always said — ”
120294	120302	120291	120291	he	333	“ Yeah ? What did Vicky say ? ”
120303	120307	120309	120309	Hermione	172	“ Ho ho , ”
120315	120339	120309	120309	Hermione	172	“ He said Harry knew how to do stuff even he did n’t , and he was in the final year at Durmstrang . ”
120347	120360	120340	120340	Ron	333	“ You ’re not still in contact with him , are you ? ”
120361	120368	120370	120370	Hermione	172	“ So what if I am ? ”
120381	120391	120370	120370	Hermione	172	“ I can have a pen pal if I — ”
120392	120404	120406	120406	Ron	333	“ He did n’t only want to be your pen pal , ”
120430	120443	120417	120417	Ron	333	“ Well , what do you think ? Will you teach us ? ”
120444	120452	120370	120370	Hermione	172	“ Just you and Ron , yeah ? ”
120453	120456	120458	120458	Hermione	172	“ Well , ”
120467	120537	120458	120458	Hermione	172	“ Well ... now , do n’t fly off the handle again , Harry , please ... But I really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn . I mean , we ’re talking about defending ourselves against V - Voldemort — oh , do n’t be pathetic , Ron — it does n’t seem fair if we do n’t offer the chance to other people . ”
120548	120573	120538	120538	Harry	156	“ Yeah , but I doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me . I ’m a nutter , remember ? ”
120574	120598	120600	120600	Hermione	172	“ Well , I think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what you ’ve got to say , ”
120603	120606	120607	120607	she	172	“ Look , ”
120632	120669	120612	120612	Ron	333	“ you know the first weekend in October ’s a Hogsmeade weekend ? How would it be if we tell anyone who ’s interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it over ? ”
120670	120681	120683	120683	Ron	333	“ Why do we have to do it outside school ? ”
120685	120688	120690	120690	Hermione	172	“ Because , ”
120705	120725	120701	120701	she	172	“ I do n’t think Umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to . ”
120833	120849	120851	120851	Ron	333	“ Well , you ca n’t blame him for wanting to get out and about , ”
120863	120919	120851	120851	Ron	333	“ I mean , he ’s been on the run for over two years , has n’t he , and I know that ca n’t have been a laugh , but at least he was free , was n’t he ? And now he ’s just shut up all the time with that lunatic elf . ”
120933	120938	120939	120939	she	172	“ The trouble is , ”
120944	121039	120939	120939	she	172	“ until V - Voldemort — oh for heaven ’s sake , Ron — comes out into the open , Sirius is going to have to stay hidden , is n’t he ? I mean , the stupid Ministry is n’t going to realize Sirius is innocent until they accept that Dumbledore ’s been telling the truth about him all along . And once the fools start catching real Death Eaters again it ’ll be obvious Sirius is n’t one ... I mean , he has n’t got the Mark , for one thing . ”
121040	121054	121056	121056	Ron	333	“ I do n’t reckon he ’d be stupid enough to turn up , ”
121059	121081	121056	121056	Ron	333	“ Dumbledore’d go mad if he did and Sirius listens to Dumbledore even if he does n’t like what he hears . ”
121092	121137	121089	121089	Hermione	172	“ Listen , Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defense Against the Dark Arts , and there are a couple who seem interested . We ’ve told them to meet us in Hogsmeade . ”
121138	121141	121143	121143	Harry	156	“ Right , ”
121152	121159	121160	121160	Hermione	172	“ Do n’t worry , Harry , ”
121164	121176	121160	121160	Hermione	172	“ You ’ve got enough on your plate without Sirius too . ”
121420	121429	121434	121434	he	333	“ Er — why was Filch sniffing you ? ”
121454	121466	121468	121468	Harry	156	“ I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs , ”
121474	121481	121468	121468	Harry	156	“ I forgot to tell you ... ”
121528	121547	121483	121483	he	333	“ He said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs ? But who had tipped him off ? ”
121548	121552	121554	121554	Harry	156	“ I dunno , ”
121558	121570	121554	121554	Harry	156	“ Maybe Malfoy , he ’d think it was a laugh . ”
121601	121604	121606	121606	Hermione	172	“ Malfoy ? ”
121611	121618	121606	121606	Hermione	172	“ Well ... yes ... maybe ... ”
121634	121641	121642	121642	Harry	156	“ Where are we going anyway ? ”
121645	121650	121642	121642	Harry	156	“ The Three Broomsticks ? ”
121651	121656	121658	121658	Hermione	172	“ Oh — no , ”
121666	121739	121658	121658	Hermione	172	“ no , it ’s always packed and really noisy . I ’ve told the others to meet us in the Hog ’s Head , that other pub , you know the one , it ’s not on the main road . I think it ’s a bit ... you know ... dodgy ... but students do n’t normally go in there , so I do n’t think we ’ll be overheard . ”
121848	121854	121856	121856	Hermione	172	“ Well , come on , ”
121990	122005	122006	122006	he	281	“ Yeh get a lot o ’ funny folk in the Hog ’s Head , ”
122179	122189	122190	122190	Harry	156	“ I do n’t know about this , Hermione , ”
122210	122222	122200	122200	He	156	“ Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that ? ”
122233	122241	122242	122242	she	172	“ Umbridge is shorter than that woman , ”
122246	122363	122242	122242	she	172	“ And anyway , even if Umbridge does come in here there ’s nothing she can do to stop us , Harry , because I ’ve double- and triple - checked the school rules . We ’re not out - of - bounds ; I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hog ’s Head , and he said yes , but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses . And I ’ve looked up everything I can think of about study groups and homework groups and they ’re definitely allowed . I just do n’t think it ’s a good idea if we parade what we ’re doing . ”
122364	122367	122369	122369	Harry	156	“ No , ”
122372	122389	122369	122369	Harry	156	“ especially as it ’s not exactly a homework group you ’re planning , is it ? ”
122432	122435	122436	122436	he	2335	“ What ? ”
122439	122445	122447	122447	Hermione	172	“ Three butterbeers , please , ”
122473	122477	122478	122478	he	989	“ Six Sickles , ”
122481	122487	122489	122489	Harry	156	“ I ’ll get them , ”
122583	122588	122589	122589	Ron	333	“ You know what ? ”
122600	122632	122589	122589	Ron	333	“ We could order anything we liked in here , I bet that bloke would sell us anything , he would n’t care . I ’ve always wanted to try firewhisky — ”
122633	122642	122644	122644	Hermione	172	“ You — are — a — prefect , ”
122646	122649	122651	122651	Ron	333	“ Oh , ”
122660	122663	122651	122651	Ron	333	“ Yeah ... ”
122664	122677	122678	122678	Harry	156	“ So who did you say is supposed to be meeting us ? ”
122694	122701	122702	122702	Hermione	172	“ Just a couple of people , ”
122716	122745	122702	122702	Hermione	172	“ I told them to be here about now and I ’m sure they all know where it is — oh look , this might be them now — ”
122936	122942	122944	122944	Harry	156	“ A couple of people ? ”
122949	122955	122944	122944	Harry	156	“ A couple of people ? ”
122956	122967	122969	122969	Hermione	172	“ Yes , well , the idea seemed quite popular , ”
122972	122985	122969	122969	Hermione	172	“ Ron , do you want to pull up some more chairs ? ”
123023	123026	123028	123028	Fred	244	“ Hi , ”
123040	123052	123028	123028	Fred	244	“ Could we have ... twenty - five butterbeers , please ? ”
123091	123094	123096	123096	Fred	244	“ Cheers , ”
123102	123119	123096	123096	Fred	244	“ Cough up , everyone , I have n’t got enough gold for all of these ... ”
123178	123186	123187	123187	he	156	“ What have you been telling people ? ”
123194	123200	123187	123187	he	156	“ What are they expecting ? ”
123201	123219	123221	123221	Hermione	172	“ I ’ve told you , they just want to hear what you ’ve got to say , ”
123238	123255	123234	123234	she	172	“ You do n’t have to do anything yet , I ’ll speak to them first . ”
123256	123261	123263	123263	Neville	342	“ Hi , Harry , ”
123394	123397	123401	123401	her	172	“ Er , ”
123411	123418	123401	123401	her	172	“ Well — er — hi . ”
123438	123464	123466	123466	Harry	156	“ Well ... erm ... well , you know why you ’re here . Erm ... well , Harry here had the idea — I mean ”
123474	123517	123466	123466	Harry	156	“ I had the idea — that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defense Against the Dark Arts — and I mean , really study it , you know , not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us ”
123532	123543	123466	123466	Harry	156	“ because nobody could call that Defense Against the Dark Arts ”
123545	123550	123552	123553	Anthony Goldstein	365	“ Hear , hear , ”
123560	123581	123556	123556	Hermione	172	“ well , I thought it would be good if we , well , took matters into our own hands . ”
123594	123615	123582	123582	She	172	“ And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves properly , not just theory but the real spells — ”
123616	123634	123636	123637	Michael Corner	476	“ You want to pass your Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. too though , I bet ? ”
123639	123645	123647	123647	Hermione	172	“ Of course I do , ”
123651	123671	123672	123672	She	172	“ But I want more than that , I want to be properly trained in Defense because ... because ... ”
123680	123687	123672	123672	She	172	“ Because Lord Voldemort ’s back . ”
123748	123757	123759	123759	Hermione	172	“ Well ... that ’s the plan anyway , ”
123761	123779	123759	123759	Hermione	172	“ If you want to join us , we need to decide how we ’re going to — ”
123780	123793	123795	123803	the blond Hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice	2369	“ Where ’s the proof You - Know - Who ’s back ? ”
123805	123812	123813	123813	Hermione	172	“ Well , Dumbledore believes it — ”
123816	123824	123826	123828	the blond boy	2370	“ You mean , Dumbledore believes him , ”
123834	123839	123841	123841	Ron	333	“ Who are you ? ”
123845	123849	123851	123852	the boy	2800	“ Zacharias Smith , ”
123854	123878	123851	123852	the boy	2800	“ and I think we ’ve got the right to know exactly what makes him say You - Know - Who ’s back . ”
123879	123882	123884	123884	Hermione	172	“ Look , ”
123889	123903	123884	123884	Hermione	172	“ that ’s really not what this meeting was supposed to be about — ”
123904	123911	123913	123913	Harry	156	“ It ’s okay , Hermione , ”
123963	123976	123977	123977	he	156	“ What makes me say You - Know - Who ’s back ? ”
123987	124029	123977	123977	he	156	“ I saw him . But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year , and if you did n’t believe him , you do n’t believe me , and I ’m not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone . ”
124076	124133	124072	124072	Zacharias	479	“ All Dumbledore told us last year was that Cedric Diggory got killed by You - Know - Who and that you brought Diggory ’s body back to Hogwarts . He did n’t give us details , he did n’t tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered , I think we ’d all like to know — ”
124134	124156	124157	124157	Harry	156	“ If you ’ve come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort murders someone I ca n’t help you , ”
124196	124227	124194	124194	Cho	359	“ I do n’t want to talk about Cedric Diggory , all right ? So if that ’s what you ’re here for , you might as well clear out . ”
124298	124301	124305	124305	her	172	“ So , ”
124313	124358	124305	124305	her	172	“ So ... like I was saying ... if you want to learn some defense , then we need to work out how we ’re going to do it , how often we ’re going to meet , and where we ’re going to — ”
124359	124364	124373	124373	her	2379	“ Is it true , ”
124380	124388	124373	124373	her	2379	“ that you can produce a Patronus ? ”
124401	124404	124406	124406	Harry	156	“ Yeah , ”
124410	124415	124442	124443	The girl	1618	“ A corporeal Patronus ? ”
124425	124438	124439	124439	he	156	“ Er — you do n’t know Madam Bones , do you ? ”
124446	124452	124453	124453	she	1618	“ She ’s my auntie , ”
124456	124482	124453	124453	she	1618	“ I ’m Susan Bones . She told me about your hearing . So — is it really true ? You make a stag Patronus ? ”
124483	124486	124488	124488	Harry	156	“ Yes , ”
124490	124495	124497	124497	Lee	353	“ Blimey , Harry ! ”
124503	124509	124497	124497	Lee	353	“ I never knew that ! ”
124510	124520	124522	124522	Fred	244	“ Mum told Ron not to spread it around , ”
124528	124539	124522	124522	Fred	244	“ She said you got enough attention as it was . ”
124540	124546	124548	124548	Harry	156	“ She ’s not wrong , ”
124568	124583	124585	124586	Terry Boot	477	“ And did you kill a basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore ’s office ? ”
124588	124609	124585	124586	Terry Boot	477	“ That ’s what one of the portraits on the wall told me when I was in there last year ... ”
124610	124620	124622	124622	Harry	156	“ Er — yeah , I did , yeah , ”
124641	124643	124638	124639	Lavender Brown	380	“ wow ”
124665	124672	124674	124674	Neville	342	“ And in our first year , ”
124681	124688	124674	124674	Neville	342	“ he saved that Sorcerous Stone — ”
124689	124693	124695	124695	Hermione	172	“ Sorcerer ’s , ”
124697	124709	124711	124711	Neville	342	“ Yes , that , from You - Know - Who , ”
124723	124731	124733	124733	Cho	359	“ And that ’s not to mention , ”
124757	124783	124733	124733	Cho	359	“ all the tasks he had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last year — getting past dragons and merpeople and acromantulas and things ... ”
124849	124852	124853	124853	he	156	“ Look , ”
124862	124894	124853	124853	he	156	“ I ... I do n’t want to sound like I ’m trying to be modest or anything , but ... I had a lot of help with all that stuff ... ”
124895	124905	124907	124908	Michael Corner	476	“ Not with the dragon , you did n’t , ”
124912	124922	124907	124908	Michael Corner	476	“ That was a seriously cool bit of flying ... ”
124923	124928	124930	124930	Harry	156	“ Yeah , well — ”
124940	124953	124955	124956	Susan Bones	308	“ And nobody helped you get rid of those dementors this summer , ”
124958	124961	124963	124963	Harry	156	“ No , ”
124965	124990	124963	124963	Harry	156	“ no , okay , I know I did bits of it without help , but the point I ’m trying to make is — ”
124991	125006	125008	125009	Zacharias Smith	479	“ Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff ? ”
125011	125017	125019	125019	Ron	333	“ Here ’s an idea , ”
125027	125036	125019	125019	Ron	333	“ why do n’t you shut your mouth ? ”
125040	125042	125045	125045	Ron	333	“ weasel ”
125074	125102	125103	125103	he	333	“ Well , we ’ve all turned up to learn from him , and now he ’s telling us he ca n’t really do any of it , ”
125106	125114	125116	125117	Fred Weasley	244	“ That ’s not what he said , ”
125119	125132	125134	125134	George	245	“ Would you like us to clean out your ears for you ? ”
125154	125173	125175	125175	Fred	244	“ Or any part of your body , really , we ’re not fussy where we stick this , ”
125177	125182	125184	125184	Hermione	172	“ Yes , well , ”
125187	125206	125184	125184	Hermione	172	“ moving on ... the point is , are we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry ? ”
125243	125246	125248	125248	Hermione	172	“ Right , ”
125260	125292	125248	125248	Hermione	172	“ Well , then , the next question is how often we do it . I really do n’t think there ’s any point in meeting less than once a week — ”
125293	125297	125299	125299	Angelina	398	“ Hang on , ”
125301	125316	125299	125299	Angelina	398	“ we need to make sure this does n’t clash with our Quidditch practice . ”
125317	125320	125322	125322	Cho	359	“ No , ”
125324	125329	125322	125322	Cho	359	“ nor with ours . ”
125330	125334	125336	125337	Zacharias Smith	479	“ Nor ours , ”
125339	125352	125354	125354	Hermione	172	“ I ’m sure we can find a night that suits everyone , ”
125359	125385	125354	125354	Hermione	172	“ but you know , this is rather important , we ’re talking about learning to defend ourselves against V - Voldemort ’s Death Eaters — ”
125386	125390	125392	125393	Ernie Macmillan	363	“ Well said ! ”
125406	125434	125392	125393	Ernie Macmillan	363	“ Personally I think this is really important , possibly more important than anything else we ’ll do this year , even with our O.W.L.s coming up ! ”
125448	125452	125435	125435	He	363	“ Surely not ! ”
125461	125521	125457	125457	he	363	“ I , personally , am at a loss to see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher upon us at this critical period . Obviously they are in denial about the return of You - Know - Who , but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells — ”
125522	125540	125542	125542	Hermione	172	“ We think the reason Umbridge does n’t want us trained in Defense Against the Dark Arts , ”
125544	125581	125542	125542	Hermione	172	“ is that she ’s got some ... some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army . She thinks he ’d mobilize us against the Ministry . ”
125599	125618	125592	125593	Luna Lovegood	356	“ Well , that makes sense . After all , Cornelius Fudge has got his own private army . ”
125619	125622	125624	125624	Harry	156	“ What ? ”
125635	125646	125648	125648	Luna	356	“ Yes , he ’s got an army of heliopaths , ”
125651	125658	125660	125660	Hermione	172	“ No , he has n’t , ”
125662	125668	125670	125670	Luna	356	“ Yes , he has , ”
125672	125677	125679	125679	Neville	342	“ What are heliopaths ? ”
125684	125691	125693	125693	Luna	356	“ They ’re spirits of fire , ”
125707	125723	125701	125701	she	356	“ Great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of — ”
125724	125732	125734	125734	Hermione	172	“ They do n’t exist , Neville , ”
125737	125743	125745	125745	Luna	356	“ Oh yes they do ! ”
125748	125761	125763	125763	Hermione	172	“ I ’m sorry , but where ’s the proof of that ? ”
125765	125793	125763	125763	Hermione	172	“ There are plenty of eyewitness accounts , just because you ’re so narrow - minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you — ”
125794	125799	125801	125801	Ginny	247	“ Hem , hem , ”
125821	125840	125811	125812	several people	2391	“ Were n’t we trying to decide how often we ’re going to meet and get Defense lessons ? ”
125841	125844	125846	125846	Hermione	172	“ Yes , ”
125850	125860	125846	125846	Hermione	172	“ yes , we were , you ’re right ... ”
125861	125870	125872	125873	Lee Jordan	353	“ Well , once a week sounds cool , ”
125875	125880	125882	125882	Angelina	398	“ As long as — ”
125884	125895	125897	125897	Hermione	172	“ Yes , yes , we know about the Quidditch , ”
125903	125919	125897	125897	Hermione	172	“ Well , the other thing to decide is where we ’re going to meet ... ”
125932	125935	125937	125938	Katie Bell	385	“ Library ? ”
125944	125962	125964	125964	Harry	156	“ I ca n’t see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library , ”
125966	125972	125974	125974	Dean	392	“ Maybe an unused classroom ? ”
125976	125979	125981	125981	Ron	333	“ Yeah , ”
125983	126001	125981	125981	Ron	333	“ McGonagall might let us have hers , she did when Harry was practicing for the Triwizard ... ”
126046	126058	126060	126060	Hermione	172	“ Right , well , we ’ll try to find somewhere , ”
126062	126085	126060	126060	Hermione	172	“ We ’ll send a message round to everybody when we ’ve got a time and a place for the first meeting . ”
126112	126137	126138	126138	she	172	“ I - I think everybody should write their name down , just so we know who was here . But I also think , ”
126144	126183	126138	126138	she	172	“ that we all ought to agree not to shout about what we ’re doing . So if you sign , you ’re agreeing not to tell Umbridge — or anybody else — what we ’re up to . ”
126220	126223	126225	126225	Zacharias	479	“ Er ... ”
126240	126255	126225	126225	Zacharias	479	“ Well ... I ’m sure Ernie will tell me when the meeting is . ”
126273	126282	126283	126283	Ernie	363	“ I — well , we are prefects , ”
126287	126311	126283	126283	Ernie	363	“ And if this list was found ... well , I mean to say ... you said yourself , if Umbridge finds out ... ”
126312	126329	126330	126330	Harry	156	“ You just said this group was the most important thing you ’d do this year , ”
126334	126339	126341	126341	Ernie	363	“ I — yes , ”
126343	126355	126341	126341	Ernie	363	“ yes , I do believe that , it ’s just ... ”
126356	126371	126373	126373	Hermione	172	“ Ernie , do you really think I ’d leave that list lying around ? ”
126376	126385	126387	126387	Ernie	363	“ No . No , of course not , ”
126394	126405	126387	126387	Ernie	363	“ I — yes , of course I ’ll sign . ”
126475	126483	126485	126485	Fred	244	“ Well , time ’s ticking on , ”
126493	126518	126485	126485	Fred	244	“ George , Lee , and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase , we ’ll be seeing you all later . ”
126604	126614	126620	126620	she	172	“ Well , I think that went quite well , ”
126652	126660	126662	126662	Ron	333	“ That Zacharias bloke ’s a wart , ”
126678	126687	126689	126689	Hermione	172	“ I do n’t like him much either , ”
126691	126749	126689	126689	Hermione	172	“ but he overheard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming , so what could I say ? But the more people the better really — I mean , Michael Corner and his friends would n’t have come if he had n’t been going out with Ginny — ”
126773	126778	126780	126780	Ron	333	“ He ’s WHAT ? ”
126793	126812	126780	126780	Ron	333	“ She ’s going out with — my sister ’s going — what d’you mean , Michael Corner ? ”
126813	126850	126882	126882	Hermione	172	“ Well , that ’s why he and his friends came , I think — well , they ’re obviously interested in learning Defense , but if Ginny had n’t told Michael what was going on — ”
126851	126861	126780	126780	Ron	333	“ When did this — when did she — ? ”
126862	126880	126882	126882	Hermione	172	“ They met at the Yule Ball and they got together at the end of last year , ”
126916	126927	126893	126893	she	172	“ Hmm ... I could do with a new quill . ”
126940	126947	126948	126948	Ron	333	“ Which one was Michael Corner ? ”
126952	126957	126959	126959	Hermione	172	“ The dark one , ”
126961	126968	126970	126970	Ron	333	“ I did n’t like him , ”
126974	126978	126982	126982	her	172	“ Big surprise , ”
126985	126988	126990	126990	Ron	333	“ But , ”
127003	127010	126990	126990	Ron	333	“ I thought Ginny fancied Harry ! ”
127022	127049	127050	127050	she	172	“ Ginny used to fancy Harry , but she gave up on him months ago . Not that she does n’t like you , of course , ”
127115	127124	127125	127125	he	333	“ So that ’s why she talks now ? ”
127129	127140	127125	127125	he	333	“ She never used to talk in front of me . ”
127141	127144	127146	127146	Hermione	172	“ Exactly , ”
127148	127159	127146	127146	Hermione	172	“ Yes , I think I ’ll have this one ... ”
127182	127185	127186	127186	she	172	“ Ron , ”
127198	127234	127186	127186	she	172	“ this is exactly why Ginny has n’t told you she ’s seeing Michael , she knew you ’d take it badly . So do n’t harp on about it , for heaven ’s sake . ”
127235	127256	127190	127190	she	172	“ What d’you mean , who ’s taking anything badly ? I ’m not going to harp on about anything ... ”
127293	127307	127273	127273	her	172	“ And talking about Michael and Ginny ... what about Cho and you ? ”
127308	127313	127315	127315	Harry	156	“ What d’you mean ? ”
127350	127353	127355	127355	Hermione	172	“ Well , ”
127360	127374	127355	127355	Hermione	172	“ she just could n’t keep her eyes off you , could she ? ”
127976	127990	127993	127993	them	2436	“ Does this mean they ’re going to shut down the Gobstones Club ? ”
127998	128008	128009	128009	Ron	333	“ I reckon you ’ll be okay with Gobstones , ”
128019	128037	128038	128038	he	333	“ I do n’t think we ’re going to be as lucky , though , do you ? ”
128074	128081	128082	128082	he	156	“ This is n’t a coincidence , ”
128090	128094	128082	128082	he	156	“ She knows . ”
128095	128100	128102	128102	Ron	333	“ She ca n’t , ”
128106	128148	128082	128082	he	156	“ There were people listening in that pub . And let ’s face it , we do n’t know how many of the people who turned up we can trust ... Any of them could have run off and told Umbridge ... ”
128163	128167	128169	128169	Ron	333	“ Zacharias Smith ! ”
128180	128195	128169	128169	Ron	333	“ Or — I thought that Michael Corner had a really shifty look too — ”
128196	128206	128207	128207	Harry	156	“ I wonder if Hermione ’s seen this yet ? ”
128221	128229	128231	128231	Ron	333	“ Let ’s go and tell her , ”
128325	128341	128343	128343	Harry	156	“ Er — I do n’t think we ’re allowed in the girls ’ dormitories , ”
128369	128378	128379	128379	they	2446	“ Oooh , who tried to get upstairs ? ”
128393	128396	128398	128398	Ron	333	“ Me , ”
128406	128420	128421	128421	he	333	“ I did n’t realize that would happen . It ’s not fair ! ”
128440	128456	128421	128421	he	333	“ Hermione ’s allowed in our dormitory , how come we ’re not allowed — ? ”
128457	128468	128470	128470	Hermione	172	“ Well , it ’s an old - fashioned rule , ”
128492	128523	128470	128470	Hermione	172	“ but it says in Hogwarts : A History that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls . Anyway , why were you trying to get in there ? ”
128524	128533	128535	128535	Ron	333	“ To see you — look at this ! ”
128559	128567	128568	128568	Ron	333	“ Someone must have blabbed to her ! ”
128572	128579	128581	128581	Hermione	172	“ They ca n’t have done , ”
128587	128593	128595	128595	Ron	333	“ You ’re so naive , ”
128597	128609	128595	128595	Ron	333	“ you think just because you ’re all honorable and trustworthy — ”
128610	128632	128634	128634	Hermione	172	“ No , they ca n’t have done because I put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed , ”
128637	128664	128634	128634	Hermione	172	“ Believe me , if anyone ’s run off and told Umbridge , we ’ll know exactly who they are and they will really regret it . ”
128665	128672	128674	128674	Ron	333	“ What ’ll happen to them ? ”
128677	128685	128687	128687	Hermione	172	“ Well , put it this way , ”
128689	128734	128687	128687	Hermione	172	“ it ’ll make Eloise Midgen ’s acne look like a couple of cute freckles . Come on , let ’s get down to breakfast and see what the others think ... I wonder whether this has been put up in all the Houses ? ”
128814	128820	128800	128800	Neville	342	“ Did you see it ? ”
128821	128827	128837	128837	They	2994	“ D’you reckon she knows ? ”
128828	128836	128800	128800	Neville	342	“ What are we going to do ? ”
128857	128869	128870	128870	he	156	“ We ’re going to do it anyway , of course , ”
128874	128881	128883	128883	George	245	“ Knew you ’d say that , ”
128893	128899	128901	128901	Fred	244	“ The prefects as well ? ”
128910	128914	128916	128916	Hermione	172	“ Of course , ”
128919	128927	128929	128929	Ron	333	“ Here comes Ernie and Hannah Abbott , ”
128936	128951	128929	128929	Ron	333	“ And those Ravenclaw blokes and Smith ... and no one looks very spotty . ”
128956	128979	128980	128980	she	172	“ Never mind spots , the idiots ca n’t come over here now , it ’ll look really suspicious — sit down ! ”
128997	129011	128980	128980	she	172	“ Later ! We ’ll — talk — to — you — later ! ”
129012	129018	129020	129020	Ginny	247	“ I ’ll tell Michael , ”
129029	129035	129024	129024	herself	247	“ The fool , honestly ... ”
129106	129111	129116	129116	she	398	“ Harry ! Ron ! ”
129125	129130	129132	129132	Harry	156	“ It ’s okay , ”
129144	129151	129132	129132	Harry	156	“ We ’re still going to — ”
129152	129162	129163	129163	Angelina	398	“ You realize she ’s including Quidditch in this ? ”
129168	129184	129163	129163	Angelina	398	“ We have to go and ask permission to re - form the Gryffindor team ! ”
129185	129188	129190	129190	Harry	156	“ What ? ”
129192	129196	129198	129198	Ron	333	“ No way , ”
129202	129247	129163	129163	Angelina	398	“ You read the sign , it mentions teams too ! So listen , Harry ... I am saying this for the last time ... Please , please do n’t lose your temper with Umbridge again or she might not let us play anymore ! ”
129248	129253	129255	129255	Harry	156	“ Okay , okay , ”
129270	129280	129262	129262	she	398	“ Do n’t worry , I ’ll behave myself ... ”
129281	129290	129292	129292	Ron	333	“ Bet Umbridge is in History of Magic , ”
129304	129319	129292	129292	Ron	333	“ She has n’t inspected Binns yet ... Bet you anything she ’s there ... ”
129398	129401	129402	129402	She	172	“ What ? ”
129475	129490	129493	129493	Lavender	380	“ Oh , I ’ve always loved that owl , she ’s so beautiful , ”
129682	129687	129688	129688	Harry	156	“ She ’s hurt ! ”
129712	129723	129700	129700	Ron	333	“ Look — there ’s something wrong with her wing — ”
129759	129763	129765	129765	Harry	156	“ Professor Binns , ”
129779	129786	129765	129765	Harry	156	“ I ’m not feeling well . ”
129814	129819	129820	129820	he	404	“ Not feeling well ? ”
129824	129830	129832	129832	Harry	156	“ Not at all well , ”
129846	129860	129841	129841	Hedwig	213	“ So I think I ’ll need to go to the hospital wing . ”
129861	129864	129866	129867	Professor Binns	404	“ Yes , ”
129876	129894	129866	129867	Professor Binns	404	“ Yes ... yes , hospital wing ... well , off you go , then , Perkins ... ”
130040	130050	130035	130037	one of them	614	“ You should be in class , sunny Jim . ”
130051	130056	130058	130058	Harry	156	“ This is urgent , ”
130061	130069	130071	130073	the other gargoyle	2475	“ Ooooh , urgent , is it ? ”
130081	130096	130071	130073	the other gargoyle	2475	“ Well , that ’s put us in our place , has n’t it ? ”
130121	130130	130131	130131	she	306	“ You have n’t been given another detention ! ”
130142	130147	130149	130149	Harry	156	“ No , Professor ! ”
130152	130163	130173	130175	the second gargoyle	2476	“ Well then , why are you out of class ? ”
130164	130171	130173	130175	the second gargoyle	2476	“ It ’s urgent , apparently , ”
130178	130188	130189	130189	Harry	156	“ I ’m looking for Professor Grubbly - Plank , ”
130192	130202	130189	130189	Harry	156	“ It ’s my owl , she ’s injured . ”
130203	130211	130212	130215	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ Injured owl , did you say ? ”
130235	130238	130240	130240	Harry	156	“ Yes , ”
130249	130267	130243	130243	Hedwig	213	“ she turned up after the other post owls and her wing ’s all funny , look — ”
130289	130292	130294	130297	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ Hmm , ”
130307	130350	130304	130304	she	377	“ Looks like something ’s attacked her . Ca n’t think what would have done it , though ... Thestrals will sometimes go for birds , of course , but Hagrid ’s got the Hogwarts thestrals well trained not to touch owls ... ”
130386	130399	130374	130375	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Do you know how far this owl ’s traveled , Potter ? ”
130400	130403	130405	130405	Harry	156	“ Er , ”
130407	130414	130405	130405	Harry	156	“ From London , I think . ”
130425	130427	130423	130423	she	377	“ London ”
130430	130436	130423	130423	she	377	“ number twelve , Grimmauld Place ”
130475	130493	130494	130494	she	377	“ I should be able to sort this out if you leave her with me , Potter , ”
130497	130514	130494	130494	she	377	“ She should n’t be flying long distances for a few days , in any case . ”
130515	130522	130524	130524	Harry	156	“ Er — right — thanks , ”
130534	130538	130540	130543	Professor Grubbly - Plank	377	“ No problem , ”
130552	130559	130561	130562	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Just a moment , Wilhelmina ! ”
130564	130569	130561	130562	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Potter ’s letter ! ”
130570	130574	130576	130576	Harry	156	“ Oh yeah ! ”
130640	130643	130634	130635	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Potter ! ”
130644	130649	130650	130650	She	213	“ Yes , Professor ? ”
130666	130671	130672	130672	she	213	“ Bear in mind , ”
130687	130706	130672	130672	she	213	“ that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts may be being watched , wo n’t you ? ”
130707	130710	130712	130712	Harry	156	“ I — ”
130803	130808	130810	130810	Hermione	172	“ Is Hedwig okay ? ”
130820	130827	130829	130829	Ron	333	“ Where did you take her ? ”
130831	130837	130839	130839	Harry	156	“ To Grubbly - Plank , ”
130841	130849	130839	130839	Harry	156	“ And I met McGonagall ... Listen ... ”
130880	130883	130885	130885	Harry	156	“ What ? ”
130896	130931	130885	130885	Harry	156	“ Well , I was just saying to Ron ... what if someone had tried to intercept Hedwig ? I mean , she ’s never been hurt on a flight before , has she ? ”
130932	130940	130942	130942	Ron	333	“ Who ’s the letter from anyway ? ”
130950	130953	130955	130955	Harry	156	“ Snuffles , ”
130958	130977	130885	130885	Harry	156	“ ‘ Same time , same place ’ ? Does he mean the fire in the common room ? ”
130978	130981	130983	130983	Hermione	172	“ Obviously , ”
130994	131004	130990	130990	She	172	“ I just hope nobody else has read this ... ”
131005	131014	131016	131016	Harry	156	“ But it was still sealed and everything , ”
131027	131051	131016	131016	Harry	156	“ And nobody would understand what it meant if they did n’t know where we ’d spoken to him before , would they ? ”
131052	131058	131060	131060	Hermione	172	“ I do n’t know , ”
131076	131119	131060	131060	Hermione	172	“ It would n’t be exactly difficult to reseal the scroll by magic ... And if anyone ’s watching the Floo Network ... but I do n’t really see how we can warn him not to come without that being intercepted too ! ”
131195	131267	131311	131311	his	298	“ Yeah , Umbridge gave the Slytherin Quidditch team permission to continue playing straightaway , I went to ask her first thing this morning . Well , it was pretty much automatic , I mean , she knows my father really well , he ’s always popping in and out of the Ministry ... It ’ll be interesting to see whether Gryffindor are allowed to keep playing , wo n’t it ? ”
131268	131273	131274	131274	Hermione	172	“ Do n’t rise , ”
131294	131301	131280	131280	Ron	333	“ It ’s what he wants ... ”
131302	131306	131308	131308	Malfoy	298	“ I mean , ”
131329	131414	131317	131317	his	298	“ if it ’s a question of influence with the Ministry , I do n’t think they ’ve got much chance ... From what my father says , they ’ve been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years ... And as for Potter ... My father says it ’s a matter of time before the Ministry has him carted off to St. Mungo ’s ... apparently they ’ve got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic ... ”
131477	131482	131465	131465	Neville	342	“ Neville , no ! ”
131519	131523	131524	131524	Harry	156	“ Help me ! ”
131619	131634	131644	131644	His	249	“ Not ... funny ... do n’t ... Mungo ’s ... show ... him ... ”
131664	131673	131674	131674	Snape	249	“ Fighting , Potter , Weasley , Longbottom ? ”
131683	131706	131677	131677	his	249	“ Ten points from Gryffindor . Release Longbottom , Potter , or it will be detention . Inside , all of you . ”
131721	131728	131729	131729	Harry	156	“ I had to stop you , ”
131737	131747	131729	131729	Harry	156	“ Crabbe and Goyle would ’ve torn you apart . ”
131766	131774	131776	131776	Ron	333	“ What in the name of Merlin , ”
131784	131789	131776	131776	Ron	333	“ was that about ? ”
131910	131915	131917	131917	Snape	249	“ You will notice , ”
131925	131935	131917	131917	Snape	249	“ that we have a guest with us today . ”
131996	132031	132033	132033	he	156	“ We are continuing with our Strengthening Solutions today , you will find your mixtures as you left them last lesson , if correctly made they should have matured well over the weekend — instructions ”
132039	132047	132033	132033	he	156	“ on the board . Carry on . ”
132087	132093	132094	132094	Hermione	172	“ Salamander blood , Harry ! ”
132112	132117	132094	132094	Hermione	172	“ Not pomegranate juice ! ”
132118	132121	132123	132123	Harry	156	“ Right , ”
132145	132148	132149	132149	he	156	“ Ha , ”
132173	132185	132186	132186	she	390	“ Well , the class seems fairly advanced for their level , ”
132194	132228	132186	132186	she	390	“ Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the Strengthening Solution . I think the Ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus . ”
132240	132252	132253	132253	she	390	“ Now ... how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts ? ”
132263	132267	132268	132268	Snape	249	“ Fourteen years , ”
132300	132316	132317	132318	Professor Umbridge	390	“ You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post , I believe ? ”
132322	132325	132327	132327	Snape	249	“ Yes , ”
132330	132336	132327	132327	Snape	249	“ But you were unsuccessful ? ”
132342	132345	132337	132337	Snape	249	“ Obviously . ”
132353	132377	132346	132347	Professor Umbridge	390	“ And you have applied regularly for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post since you first joined the school , I believe ? ”
132378	132381	132383	132383	Snape	249	“ Yes , ”
132396	132411	132413	132413	Umbridge	390	“ Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused to appoint you ? ”
132415	132422	132424	132424	Snape	249	“ I suggest you ask him , ”
132427	132432	132434	132435	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Oh I shall , ”
132441	132448	132449	132449	Snape	249	“ I suppose this is relevant ? ”
132457	132461	132463	132464	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Oh yes , ”
132466	132483	132463	132464	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Yes , the Ministry wants a thorough understanding of teachers ’ — er — backgrounds ... ”
132538	132547	132549	132549	Snape	249	“ No marks again , then , Potter , ”
132563	132597	132560	132560	his	249	“ You will write me an essay on the correct composition of this potion , indicating how and why you went wrong , to be handed in next lesson , do you understand ? ”
132598	132601	132603	132603	Harry	156	“ Yes , ”
132663	132671	132672	132672	he	249	“ Maybe I ’ll skive off Divination , ”
132698	132724	132672	132672	he	249	“ I ’ll pretend to be ill and do Snape ’s essay instead , then I wo n’t have to stay up half the night ... ”
132725	132733	132735	132735	Hermione	172	“ You ca n’t skive off Divination , ”
132738	132754	132756	132756	Ron	333	“ Hark who ’s talking , you walked out of Divination , you hate Trelawney ! ”
132759	132766	132768	132768	Hermione	172	“ I do n’t hate her , ”
132771	132808	132768	132768	Hermione	172	“ I just think she ’s an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud ... But Harry ’s already missed History of Magic and I do n’t think he ought to miss anything else today ! ”
132968	132974	132980	132980	her	407	“ Well , carry on ! ”
132988	133013	132980	132980	her	407	“ You know what to do ! Or am I such a substandard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book ? ”
133071	133084	133060	133060	he	156	“ I think she ’s got the results of her inspection back . ”
133085	133088	133090	133091	Parvati Patil	379	“ Professor ? ”
133108	133119	133090	133091	Parvati Patil	379	“ Professor , is there anything — er — wrong ? ”
133120	133123	133125	133126	Professor Trelawney	407	“ Wrong ! ”
133134	133167	133125	133126	Professor Trelawney	407	“ Certainly not ! I have been insulted , certainly ... Insinuations have been made against me ... Unfounded accusations levelled ... but no , there is nothing wrong , certainly not ... ”
133188	133193	133194	133194	she	407	“ I say nothing , ”
133197	133226	133194	133194	she	407	“ of sixteen years ’ devoted service ... It has passed , apparently , unnoticed ... But I shall not be insulted , no , I shall not ! ”
133227	133236	133238	133238	Parvati	379	“ But Professor , who ’s insulting you ? ”
133241	133245	133247	133248	Professor Trelawney	407	“ The establishment ! ”
133258	133302	133247	133248	Professor Trelawney	407	“ Yes , those with eyes too clouded by the Mundane to See as I See , to Know as I Know ... Of course , we Seers have always been feared , always persecuted ... It is — alas — our fate ... ”
133357	133360	133362	133362	Parvati	379	“ Professor , ”
133364	133376	133362	133362	Parvati	379	“ do you mean ... is it something Professor Umbridge ... ? ”
133377	133387	133389	133390	Professor Trelawney	407	“ Do not speak to me about that woman ! ”
133405	133412	133389	133390	Professor Trelawney	407	“ Kindly continue with your work ! ”
133442	133466	133439	133439	her	407	“ ... may well choose to leave ... the indignity of it ... on probation ... we shall see ... how she dares ... ”
133467	133477	133478	133478	Harry	156	“ You and Umbridge have got something in common , ”
133493	133513	133478	133478	Harry	156	“ She obviously reckons Trelawney ’s an old fraud too ... Looks like she ’s put her on probation . ”
133534	133540	133519	133519	he	156	“ Good afternoon , class . ”
133541	133548	133549	133549	they	2510	“ Good afternoon , Professor Umbridge , ”
133553	133559	133519	133519	he	156	“ Wands away , please ... ”
133580	133616	133519	133519	he	156	“ Please turn to page thirty - four of Defensive Magical Theory and read the third chapter , entitled ‘ The Case for Non - Offensive Responses to Magical Attack . ’ There will be — ”
133617	133624	133625	133625	Harry	156	“ — no need to talk , ”
133637	133642	133644	133644	Angelina	398	“ No Quidditch practice , ”
133664	133671	133673	133673	Harry	156	“ But I kept my temper ! ”
133677	133693	133673	133673	Harry	156	“ I did n’t say anything to her , Angelina , I swear , I — ”
133694	133701	133703	133703	Angelina	398	“ I know , I know , ”
133706	133719	133703	133703	Angelina	398	“ She just said she needed a bit of time to consider . ”
133720	133724	133726	133726	Ron	333	“ Consider what ? ”
133729	133741	133726	133726	Ron	333	“ She ’s given the Slytherins permission , why not us ? ”
133780	133783	133785	133785	Hermione	172	“ Well , ”
133787	133807	133785	133785	Hermione	172	“ look on the bright side — at least now you ’ll have time to do Snape ’s essay ! ”
133808	133818	133820	133820	Harry	156	“ That ’s a bright side , is it ? ”
133829	133837	133823	133823	Ron	333	“ No Quidditch practice and extra Potions ? ”
134094	134103	134104	134104	he	156	“ Just go and stop them , then ! ”
134123	134136	134138	134138	Hermione	172	“ I ca n’t , they ’re not technically doing anything wrong , ”
134143	134198	134138	134138	Hermione	172	“ They ’re quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves , and I ca n’t find a rule that says the other idiots are n’t entitled to buy them , not unless they ’re proven to be dangerous in some way , and it does n’t look as though they are ... ”
134235	134253	134255	134255	Harry	156	“ You know , I do n’t get why Fred and George only got three O.W.L.s each , ”
134272	134279	134264	134264	Lee	353	“ They really know their stuff ... ”
134280	134296	134298	134298	Hermione	172	“ Oh , they only know flashy stuff that ’s no real use to anyone , ”
134301	134306	134308	134308	Ron	333	“ No real use ? ”
134314	134327	134308	134308	Ron	333	“ Hermione , they ’ve got about twenty - six Galleons already ... ”
134461	134464	134436	134436	Ron	333	“ Sirius ! ”
134481	134484	134485	134485	he	156	“ Hi , ”
134490	134493	134495	134495	Harry	156	“ Hi , ”
134533	134538	134540	134540	Sirius	174	“ How ’re things ? ”
134542	134547	134549	134549	Harry	156	“ Not that good , ”
134563	134583	134552	134552	Hermione	172	“ The Ministry ’s forced through another decree , which means we ’re not allowed to have Quidditch teams — ”
134584	134595	134597	134597	Sirius	174	“ — or secret Defense Against the Dark Arts groups ? ”
134605	134613	134614	134614	Harry	156	“ How did you know about that ? ”
134617	134628	134630	134630	Sirius	174	“ You want to choose your meeting places more carefully , ”
134637	134647	134630	134630	Sirius	174	“ The Hog ’s Head , I ask you ... ”
134648	134659	134661	134661	Hermione	172	“ Well , it was better than the Three Broomsticks ! ”
134664	134672	134661	134661	Hermione	172	“ That ’s always packed with people — ”
134673	134685	134687	134687	Sirius	174	“ — which means you ’d have been harder to overhear , ”
134689	134700	134687	134687	Sirius	174	“ You ’ve got a lot to learn , Hermione . ”
134701	134706	134707	134707	Harry	156	“ Who overheard us ? ”
134710	134716	134718	134718	Sirius	174	“ Mundungus , of course , ”
134729	134738	134726	134726	he	174	“ He was the witch under the veil . ”
134739	134744	134745	134745	Harry	156	“ That was Mundungus ? ”
134750	134761	134745	134745	Harry	156	“ What was he doing in the Hog ’s Head ? ”
134762	134771	134773	134773	Sirius	174	“ What do you think he was doing ? ”
134776	134786	134773	134773	Sirius	174	“ Keeping an eye on you , of course . ”
134787	134794	134796	134796	Harry	156	“ I ’m still being followed ? ”
134799	134805	134807	134807	Sirius	174	“ Yeah , you are , ”
134809	134839	134807	134807	Sirius	174	“ and just as well , is n’t it , if the first thing you ’re going to do on your weekend off is organize an illegal defense group . ”
134861	134869	134871	134871	Ron	333	“ Why was Dung hiding from us ? ”
134876	134885	134871	134871	Ron	333	“ We ’d ’ve liked to’ve seen him . ”
134886	134899	134901	134901	Sirius	174	“ He was banned from the Hog ’s Head twenty years ago , ”
134903	134957	134901	134901	Sirius	174	“ and that barman ’s got a long memory . We lost Moody ’s spare Invisibility Cloak when Sturgis was arrested , so Dung ’s been dressing as a witch a lot lately ... Anyway ... First of all , Ron — I ’ve sworn to pass on a message from your mother . ”
134958	134962	134964	134964	Ron	333	“ Oh yeah ? ”
134969	135038	135040	135040	Sirius	174	“ She says on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an illegal secret Defense Against the Dark Arts group . She says you ’ll be expelled for sure and your future will be ruined . She says there will be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be worrying about that right now . She also ”
135049	135128	135040	135040	Sirius	174	“ advises Harry and Hermione not to proceed with the group , though she accepts that she has no authority over either of them and simply begs them to remember that she has their best interests at heart . She would have written all this to you , but if the owl had been intercepted you ’d all have been in real trouble , and she ca n’t say it for herself because she ’s on duty tonight . ”
135129	135135	135137	135137	Ron	333	“ On duty doing what ? ”
135140	135151	135153	135153	Sirius	174	“ Never you mind , just stuff for the Order , ”
135155	135188	135153	135153	Sirius	174	“ So it ’s fallen to me to be the messenger and make sure you tell her I passed it all on , because I do n’t think she trusts me to . ”
135216	135235	135236	135236	he	333	“ So you want me to say I ’m not going to take part in the defense group ? ”
135240	135246	135248	135248	Sirius	174	“ Me ? Certainly not ! ”
135253	135262	135248	135248	Sirius	174	“ I think it ’s an excellent idea ! ”
135263	135267	135269	135269	Harry	156	“ You do ? ”
135275	135281	135283	135283	Sirius	174	“ Of course I do ! ”
135285	135306	135283	135283	Sirius	174	“ D’you think your father and I would ’ve lain down and taken orders from an old hag like Umbridge ? ”
135307	135326	135248	135248	Sirius	174	“ But — last term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take risks — ”
135327	135346	135348	135348	Sirius	174	“ Last year all the evidence was that someone inside Hogwarts was trying to kill you , Harry ! ”
135351	135384	135348	135348	Sirius	174	“ This year we know that there ’s someone outside Hogwarts who ’d like to kill us all , so I think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea ! ”
135385	135393	135394	135394	Hermione	172	“ And if we do get expelled ? ”
135404	135414	135416	135416	Harry	156	“ Hermione , this whole thing was your idea ! ”
135422	135435	135436	135436	she	172	“ I know it was ... I just wondered what Sirius thought , ”
135441	135460	135462	135462	Sirius	174	“ Well , better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue , ”
135464	135469	135471	135471	Harry	156	“ Hear , hear , ”
135476	135479	135481	135481	Sirius	174	“ So , ”
135483	135496	135481	135481	Sirius	174	“ how are you organizing this group ? Where are you meeting ? ”
135497	135509	135511	135511	Harry	156	“ Well , that ’s a bit of a problem now , ”
135513	135525	135511	135511	Harry	156	“ Dunno where we ’re going to be able to go ... ”
135526	135533	135535	135535	Sirius	174	“ How about the Shrieking Shack ? ”
135537	135545	135547	135547	Ron	333	“ Hey , that ’s an idea ! ”
135573	135599	135601	135601	Hermione	172	“ Well , Sirius , it ’s just that there were only four of you meeting in the Shrieking Shack when you were at school , ”
135603	135662	135601	135601	Hermione	172	“ and all of you could transform into animals and I suppose you could all have squeezed under a single Invisibility Cloak if you ’d wanted to . But there are twenty - eight of us and none of us is an Animagus , so we would n’t need so much an Invisibility Cloak as an Invisibility Marquee — ”
135663	135667	135669	135669	Sirius	174	“ Fair point , ”
135675	135717	135669	135669	Sirius	174	“ Well , I ’m sure you ’ll come up with somewhere ... There used to be a pretty roomy secret passageway behind that big mirror on the fourth floor , you might have enough space to practice jinxes in there — ”
135718	135728	135730	135730	Harry	156	“ Fred and George told me it ’s blocked , ”
135736	135742	135730	135730	Harry	156	“ Caved in or something . ”
135743	135746	135748	135748	Sirius	174	“ Oh ... ”
135752	135765	135748	135748	Sirius	174	“ Well , I ’ll have a think and get back to — ”
135793	135796	135798	135798	Harry	156	“ Sirius ? ”
135824	135830	135820	135820	Ron	333	“ Why did he — ? ”
135932	135948	135914	135914	she	172	“ Umbridge has been reading your mail , Harry . There ’s no other explanation . ”
135949	135956	135957	135957	he	156	“ You think Umbridge attacked Hedwig ? ”
135962	135970	135972	135972	Hermione	172	“ I ’m almost certain of it , ”
135975	135984	135972	135972	Hermione	172	“ Watch your frog , it ’s escaping . ”
136005	136008	135987	135987	his	156	“ Accio ! ”
136101	136124	136125	136125	Hermione	172	“ I ’ve been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering Dungbombs , because it seemed such a stupid lie , ”
136128	136267	136125	136125	Hermione	172	“ I mean , once your letter had been read , it would have been quite clear you were n’t ordering them , so you would n’t have been in trouble at all — it ’s a bit of a feeble joke , is n’t it ? But then I thought , what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail ? Well then , it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it — tip off Filch , let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter , then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it — I do n’t think Filch would object , when ’s he ever stuck up for a student ’s rights ? Harry , you ’re squashing your frog . ”
136293	136305	136307	136307	Hermione	172	“ It was a very , very close call last night , ”
136309	136323	136307	136307	Hermione	172	“ I just wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was . Silencio ! ”
136346	136353	136307	136307	Hermione	172	“ If she ’d caught Snuffles ... ”
136361	136372	136373	136373	He	156	“ He ’d probably be back in Azkaban this morning . ”
136396	136399	136405	136405	her	172	“ Silencio ! ”
136418	136454	136405	136405	her	172	“ Well , he must n’t do it again , that ’s all . I just do n’t know how we ’re going to let him know . We ca n’t send him an owl . ”
136455	136466	136468	136468	Ron	333	“ I do n’t reckon he ’ll risk it again , ”
136470	136485	136468	136468	Ron	333	“ He ’s not stupid , he knows she nearly got him . Silencio ! ”
136501	136506	136507	136508	The raven	2533	“ Silencio ! SILENCIO ! ”
136513	136524	136526	136526	Hermione	172	“ It ’s the way you ’re moving your wand , ”
136532	136548	136526	136526	Hermione	172	“ You do n’t want to wave it , it ’s more a sharp jab . ”
136549	136556	136558	136558	Ron	333	“ Ravens are harder than frogs , ”
136561	136568	136570	136570	Hermione	172	“ Fine , let ’s swap , ”
136585	136588	136580	136580	her	172	“ Silencio ! ”
136606	136613	136615	136616	Professor Flitwick	418	“ Very good , Miss Granger ! ”
136631	136643	136627	136627	Hermione	172	“ Now , let me see you try , Mr. Weasley ! ”
136644	136654	136656	136656	Ron	333	“ Wha — ? Oh — oh , right , ”
136661	136666	136656	136656	Ron	333	“ Er — Silencio ! ”
136787	136793	136794	136794	she	398	“ I ’ve got permission ! ”
136797	136806	136794	136794	she	398	“ To re - form the Quidditch team ! ”
136807	136810	136812	136812	Ron	333	“ Excellent ! ”
136817	136820	136822	136822	Angelina	398	“ Yeah , ”
136826	136889	136822	136822	Angelina	398	“ I went to McGonagall and I think she might have appealed to Dumbledore — anyway , Umbridge had to give in . Ha ! So I want you down at the pitch at seven o’clock tonight , all right , because we ’ve got to make up time , you realize we ’re only three weeks away from our first match ? ”
136938	136952	136923	136923	he	333	“ Hope this clears up ... What ’s up with you , Hermione ? ”
136983	136987	136988	136988	she	398	“ Just thinking ... ”
137000	137006	137008	137008	Harry	156	“ About Siri ... Snuffles ? ”
137010	137016	137018	137018	Hermione	172	“ No ... not exactly ... ”
137021	137042	137018	137018	Hermione	172	“ More ... wondering ... I suppose we ’re doing the right thing ... I think ... are n’t we ? ”
137051	137059	137061	137061	Ron	333	“ Well , that clears that up , ”
137063	137078	137061	137061	Ron	333	“ It would ’ve been really annoying if you had n’t explained yourself properly . ”
137094	137100	137101	137101	she	398	“ I was just wondering , ”
137109	137127	137101	137101	she	398	“ whether we ’re doing the right thing , starting this Defense Against the Dark Arts group . ”
137128	137131	137133	137133	Harry	156	“ What ! ”
137138	137150	137152	137152	Ron	333	“ Hermione , it was your idea in the first place ! ”
137155	137159	137161	137161	Hermione	172	“ I know , ”
137168	137175	137161	137161	Hermione	172	“ But after talking to Snuffles ... ”
137176	137184	137186	137186	Harry	156	“ But he ’s all for it ! ”
137188	137191	137193	137193	Hermione	172	“ Yes , ”
137201	137220	137193	137193	Hermione	172	“ Yes , that ’s what made me think maybe it was n’t a good idea after all ... ”
137251	137258	137260	137260	Harry	156	“ Let ’s get this straight , ”
137273	137290	137260	137260	Harry	156	“ Sirius agrees with us , so you do n’t think we should do it anymore ? ”
137307	137315	137304	137304	she	172	“ Do you honestly trust his judgment ? ”
137316	137322	137324	137324	Harry	156	“ Yes , I do ! ”
137328	137337	137324	137324	Harry	156	“ He ’s always given us great advice ! ”
137389	137427	137381	137381	she	172	“ You do n’t think he has become ... sort of ... reckless ... since he ’s been cooped up in Grimmauld Place ? You do n’t think he ’s ... kind of ... living through us ? ”
137428	137439	137440	137440	Harry	156	“ What d’you mean , ‘ living through us ’ ? ”
137443	137500	137381	137381	she	172	“ I mean ... well , I think he ’d love to be forming secret defense societies right under the nose of someone from the Ministry ... I think he ’s really frustrated at how little he can do where he is ... so I think he ’s keen to kind of ... egg us on . ”
137506	137511	137512	137512	he	333	“ Sirius is right , ”
137515	137524	137512	137512	he	333	“ you do sound just like my mother . ”
137658	137671	137672	137672	Fred	244	“ — but I bet she ’d know what we ’d done , ”
137682	137697	137672	137672	Fred	244	“ If only I had n’t offered to sell her some Puking Pastilles yesterday — ”
137698	137706	137707	137707	George	245	“ We could try the Fever Fudge , ”
137710	137718	137707	137707	George	245	“ no one ’s seen that yet — ”
137719	137724	137726	137726	Ron	333	“ Does it work ? ”
137745	137750	137752	137752	Fred	244	“ Well , yeah , ”
137754	137761	137752	137752	Fred	244	“ your temperature’ll go right up — ”
137762	137775	137777	137777	George	245	“ — but you get these massive pus - filled boils too , ”
137779	137794	137777	137777	George	245	“ and we have n’t worked out how to get rid of them yet . ”
137795	137803	137805	137805	Ron	333	“ I ca n’t see any boils , ”
137812	137821	137823	137823	Fred	244	“ No , well , you would n’t , ”
137826	137840	137823	137823	Fred	244	“ they ’re not in a place we generally display to the public — ”
137841	137856	137777	137777	George	245	“ — but they make sitting on a broom a right pain in the — ”
137857	137866	137868	137868	Angelina	398	“ All right , everyone , listen up , ”
137878	137945	137868	137868	Angelina	398	“ I know it ’s not ideal weather , but there ’s a good chance we ’ll be playing Slytherin in conditions like this so it ’s a good idea to work out how we ’re going to cope with them . Harry , did n’t you do something to your glasses to stop the rain fogging them up when we played Hufflepuff in that storm ? ”
137946	137951	137953	137953	Harry	156	“ Hermione did it , ”
137967	137970	137955	137955	He	156	“ Impervius ! ”
137971	137981	137983	137983	Angelina	398	“ I think we all ought to try that , ”
137985	138016	137983	137983	Angelina	398	“ If we could just keep the rain off our faces it would really help visibility — all together , come on — Impervius ! Okay . Let ’s go . ”
138081	138089	138091	138091	Angelina	398	“ All right , on my whistle , ”
138313	138323	138325	138325	Fred	244	“ I think a few of mine have ruptured , ”
138331	138336	138338	138338	George	245	“ Mine have n’t , ”
138342	138354	138338	138338	George	245	“ They ’re throbbing like mad ... feel bigger if anything ... ”
138355	138358	138360	138360	Harry	156	“ OUCH ! ”
138392	138397	138399	138400	several voices	2562	“ What ’s up ? ”
138436	138439	138440	138440	he	156	“ Nothing , ”
138443	138456	138440	138440	he	156	“ I — poked myself in the eye , that ’s all ... ”
138494	138498	138500	138500	Ron	333	“ What happened ? ”
138512	138518	138500	138500	Ron	333	“ Was it your scar ? ”
138522	138525	138519	138519	Harry	156	“ But ... ”
138542	138556	138529	138529	Ron	333	“ He — he ca n’t be near us now , can he ? ”
138557	138560	138561	138561	Harry	156	“ No , ”
138573	138589	138561	138561	Harry	156	“ He ’s probably miles away . It hurt because ... he ’s ... angry . ”
138652	138658	138660	138660	Ron	333	“ Did you see him ? ”
138665	138676	138660	138660	Ron	333	“ Did you ... get a vision , or something ? ”
138714	138728	138729	138729	he	156	“ He wants something done , and it ’s not happening fast enough , ”
138756	138764	138766	138766	Ron	333	“ But ... how do you know ? ”
138812	138822	138824	138824	Ron	333	“ Is this what it was about last time ? ”
138830	138848	138824	138824	Ron	333	“ When your scar hurt in Umbridge ’s office ? You - Know - Who was angry ? ”
138854	138861	138851	138851	his	156	“ What is it , then ? ”
138927	138938	138939	138939	he	156	“ Last time , it was because he was pleased , ”
138942	138966	138939	138939	he	156	“ Really pleased . He thought ... something good was going to happen . And the night before we came back to Hogwarts ... ”
138990	138995	138996	138996	He	156	“ He was furious ... ”
139008	139018	139019	139019	he	333	“ You could take over from Trelawney , mate , ”
139026	139033	139035	139035	Harry	156	“ I ’m not making prophecies , ”
139037	139047	139048	139048	Ron	333	“ No , you know what you ’re doing ? ”
139057	139071	139048	139048	Ron	333	“ Harry , you ’re reading You - Know - Who ’s mind ... ”
139072	139075	139077	139077	Harry	156	“ No , ”
139083	139150	139080	139080	his	156	“ It ’s more like ... his mood , I suppose . I ’m just getting flashes of what mood he ’s in ... Dumbledore said something like this was happening last year ... He said that when Voldemort was near me , or when he was feeling hatred , I could tell . Well , now I ’m feeling it when he ’s pleased too ... ”
139165	139173	139175	139175	Ron	333	“ You ’ve got to tell someone , ”
139177	139184	139271	139271	Ron	333	“ I told Sirius last time . ”
139185	139194	139175	139175	Ron	333	“ Well , tell him about this time ! ”
139195	139202	139204	139204	Harry	156	“ Ca n’t , can I ? ”
139207	139219	139204	139204	Harry	156	“ Umbridge is watching the owls and the fires , remember ? ”
139220	139226	139175	139175	Ron	333	“ Well then , Dumbledore — ”
139227	139238	139240	139240	Harry	156	“ I ’ve just told you , he already knows , ”
139261	139270	139240	139240	Harry	156	“ There ’s no point telling him again . ”
139285	139291	139292	139292	he	333	“ Dumbledore’d want to know , ”
139298	139311	139295	139295	Harry	156	“ C’m on ... we ’ve still got Silencing Charms to practice ... ”
139350	139387	139431	139431	they	2573	“ He ’s got other plans ... plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed ... stuff he can only get by stealth ... like a weapon . Something he did n’t have last time . ”
139484	139488	139490	139490	Ron	333	“ Mimbulus mimbletonia , ”
139921	139927	139908	139908	He	1231	“ Harry Potter , sir ! ”
139953	139956	139958	139958	Harry	156	“ Whozair ? ”
139977	139985	140010	140010	Dobby	169	“ Dobby has your owl , sir ! ”
139991	139994	139996	139996	Harry	156	“ Dobby ? ”
140092	140102	140104	140105	the elf	1099	“ Dobby volunteered to return Harry Potter ’s owl ! ”
140118	140132	140115	140115	his	1099	“ Professor Grubbly - Plank says she is all well now , sir ! ”
140169	140174	140176	140176	Harry	156	“ Thanks , Dobby ! ”
140237	140253	140214	140215	the elf	1099	“ Er ... have you been taking all the clothes Hermione ’s been leaving out ? ”
140254	140260	140262	140262	Dobby	169	“ Oh no , sir , ”
140265	140277	140262	140262	Dobby	169	“ Dobby has been taking some for Winky too , sir . ”
140278	140285	140287	140287	Harry	156	“ Yeah , how is Winky ? ”
140295	140304	140305	140305	he	169	“ Winky is still drinking lots , sir , ”
140322	140402	140305	140305	he	169	“ She still does not care for clothes , Harry Potter . Nor do the other house - elves . None of them will clean Gryffindor Tower anymore , not with the hats and socks hidden everywhere , they finds them insulting , sir . Dobby does it all himself , sir , but Dobby does not mind , sir , for he always hopes to meet Harry Potter and tonight , sir , he has got his wish ! ”
140411	140420	140421	140421	Dobby	169	“ But Harry Potter does not seem happy , ”
140434	140450	140421	140421	Dobby	169	“ Dobby heard him muttering in his sleep . Was Harry Potter having bad dreams ? ”
140451	140456	140458	140458	Harry	156	“ Not really bad , ”
140466	140472	140458	140458	Harry	156	“ I ’ve had worse . ”
140495	140519	140486	140486	he	1099	“ Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter , for Harry Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much , much happier now ... ”
140523	140538	140520	140520	Harry	156	“ You ca n’t help me , Dobby , but thanks for the offer ... ”
140590	140606	140608	140608	Harry	156	“ Wait a moment — there is something you can do for me , Dobby , ”
140618	140627	140611	140612	The elf	1099	“ Name it , Harry Potter , sir ! ”
140628	140658	140659	140659	Harry	156	“ I need to find a place where twenty - eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without being discovered by any of the teachers . Especially , ”
140675	140679	140659	140659	Harry	156	“ Professor Umbridge . ”
140743	140752	140753	140753	he	156	“ Dobby knows the perfect place , sir ! ”
140757	140799	140753	140753	he	156	“ Dobby heard tell of it from the other house - elves when he came to Hogwarts , sir . It is known by us as the Come and Go Room , sir , or else as the Room of Requirement ! ”
140800	140803	140805	140805	Harry	156	“ Why ? ”
140808	140821	140823	140823	Dobby	169	“ Because it is a room that a person can only enter , ”
140826	140868	140870	140871	the elf	1099	“ when they have real need of it . Sometimes it is there , and sometimes it is not , but when it appears , it is always equipped for the seeker ’s needs . Dobby has used it , sir , ”
140880	140946	140874	140874	his	1099	“ when Winky has been very drunk . He has hidden her in the Room of Requirement and he has found antidotes to butterbeer there , and a nice elf - sized bed to settle her on while she sleeps it off , sir ... And Dobby knows Mr. Filch has found extra cleaning materials there when he has run short , sir , and — ”
140947	140957	140959	140959	Harry	156	“ — and if you really needed a bathroom , ”
140975	140984	140964	140964	Dumbledore	176	“ would it fill itself with chamber pots ? ”
140985	140992	140994	140994	Dobby	169	“ Dobby expects so , sir , ”
140999	141009	140994	140994	Dobby	169	“ It is a most amazing room , sir . ”
141010	141018	141020	141020	Harry	156	“ How many people know about it ? ”
141029	141074	140994	140994	Dobby	169	“ Very few , sir . Mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it , sir , but often they never finds it again , for they do not know that it is always there waiting to be called into service , sir . ”
141075	141080	141082	141082	Harry	156	“ It sounds brilliant , ”
141088	141104	141082	141082	Harry	156	“ It sounds perfect , Dobby . When can you show me where it is ? ”
141105	141113	141115	141115	Dobby	169	“ Anytime , Harry Potter , sir , ”
141124	141134	141115	141115	Dobby	169	“ We could go now , if you like ! ”
141197	141203	141205	141205	Harry	156	“ Not tonight , Dobby , ”
141214	141255	141205	141205	Harry	156	“ This is really important ... I do n’t want to blow it , it ’ll need proper planning ... Listen , can you just tell me exactly where this Room of Requirement is and how to get in there ? ”
141347	141350	141352	141352	Harry	156	“ Good , ”
141360	141400	141352	141352	Harry	156	“ because we ’ve found somewhere to have our first Defense meeting . Tonight , eight o’clock , seventh floor opposite that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy being clubbed by those trolls . Can you tell Katie and Alicia ? ”
141440	141443	141444	141444	he	156	“ What ? ”
141448	141479	141510	141510	Hermione	172	“ Well ... it ’s just that Dobby ’s plans are n’t always that safe . Do n’t you remember when he lost you all the bones in your arm ? ”
141480	141509	141510	141510	Hermione	172	“ This room is n’t just some mad idea of Dobby ’s ; Dumbledore knows about it too , he mentioned it to me at the Yule Ball . ”
141515	141522	141510	141510	Hermione	172	“ Dumbledore told you about it ? ”
141523	141528	141530	141530	Harry	156	“ Just in passing , ”
141534	141544	141546	141546	Hermione	172	“ Oh well , that ’s all right then , ”
141709	141713	141715	141715	Harry	156	“ Hold it , ”
141740	141752	141734	141734	his	156	“ I solemnly swear that I am up to no good . ”
141781	141789	141791	141791	Harry	156	“ Filch is on the second floor , ”
141805	141814	141791	141791	Harry	156	“ and Mrs. Norris is on the fourth . ”
141815	141819	141821	141821	Hermione	172	“ And Umbridge ? ”
141824	141829	141831	141831	Harry	156	“ In her office , ”
141835	141842	141831	141831	Harry	156	“ Okay , let ’s go . ”
141880	141883	141885	141885	Harry	156	“ Okay , ”
141909	141929	141896	141896	his	2613	“ Dobby said to walk past this bit of wall three times , concentrating hard on what we need . ”
142014	142017	142019	142019	Hermione	172	“ Harry , ”
142158	142169	142171	142171	Ron	333	“ These will be good when we ’re practicing Stunning , ”
142183	142191	142193	142193	Hermione	172	“ And just look at these books ! ”
142210	142234	142235	142235	She	172	“ A Compendium of Common Curses and Their Counter - Actions ... The Dark Arts Outsmarted ... Self - Defensive Spellwork ... wow ... ”
142267	142281	142258	142258	Hermione	172	“ Harry , this is wonderful , there ’s everything we need here ! ”
142333	142336	142338	142338	Dean	392	“ Whoa , ”
142345	142351	142338	142338	Dean	392	“ What is this place ? ”
142435	142438	142440	142440	Harry	156	“ Well , ”
142445	142467	142440	142440	Harry	156	“ This is the place we ’ve found for practices , and you ’ve — er — obviously found it okay — ”
142468	142473	142475	142475	Cho	359	“ It ’s fantastic ! ”
142484	142489	142491	142491	Fred	244	“ It ’s bizarre , ”
142498	142520	142491	142491	Fred	244	“ We once hid from Filch in here , remember , George ? But it was just a broom cupboard then ... ”
142521	142531	142533	142533	Dean	392	“ Hey , Harry , what ’s this stuff ? ”
142550	142554	142556	142556	Harry	156	“ Dark Detectors , ”
142566	142596	142556	142556	Harry	156	“ Basically they all show when Dark wizards or enemies are around , but you do n’t want to rely on them too much , they can be fooled ... ”
142629	142650	142651	142651	He	156	“ Well , I ’ve been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first and — er — ”
142657	142662	142651	142651	He	156	“ What , Hermione ? ”
142663	142673	142675	142675	Hermione	172	“ I think we ought to elect a leader , ”
142677	142682	142684	142684	Cho	359	“ Harry ’s leader , ”
142707	142721	142723	142723	Hermione	172	“ Yes , but I think we ought to vote on it properly , ”
142727	142750	142723	142723	Hermione	172	“ It makes it formal and it gives him authority . So — everyone who thinks Harry ought to be our leader ? ”
142768	142775	142777	142777	Harry	156	“ Er — right , thanks , ”
142786	142793	142777	142777	Harry	156	“ And — what , Hermione ? ”
142794	142805	142806	142806	she	172	“ I also think we ought to have a name , ”
142817	142834	142806	142806	she	172	“ It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity , do n’t you think ? ”
142835	142845	142847	142847	Angelina	398	“ Can we be the Anti - Umbridge League ? ”
142850	142860	142862	142862	Fred	244	“ Or the Ministry of Magic Are Morons Group ? ”
142864	142869	142871	142871	Hermione	172	“ I was thinking , ”
142877	142903	142871	142871	Hermione	172	“ more of a name that did n’t tell everyone what we were up to , so we can refer to it safely outside meetings . ”
142904	142909	142911	142911	Cho	359	“ The Defense Association ? ”
142913	142928	142911	142911	Cho	359	“ The D.A. for short , so nobody knows what we ’re talking about ? ”
142929	142937	142939	142939	Ginny	247	“ Yeah , the D.A. ’s good , ”
142941	142965	142939	142939	Ginny	247	“ Only let ’s make it stand for Dumbledore ’s Army because that ’s the Ministry ’s worst fear , is n’t it ? ”
142979	142987	142989	142989	Hermione	172	“ All in favor of the D.A. ? ”
143000	143009	142989	142989	Hermione	172	“ That ’s a majority — motion passed ! ”
143038	143041	143043	143043	Harry	156	“ Right , ”
143052	143093	143043	143043	Harry	156	“ shall we get practicing then ? I was thinking , the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus , you know , the Disarming Charm . I know it ’s pretty basic but I ’ve found it really useful — ”
143094	143098	143100	143101	Zacharias Smith	479	“ Oh please , ”
143111	143133	143104	143104	his	479	“ I do n’t think Expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against You - Know - Who , do you ? ”
143134	143142	143144	143144	Harry	156	“ I ’ve used it against him , ”
143147	143155	143144	143144	Harry	156	“ It saved my life last June . ”
143171	143185	143186	143186	Harry	156	“ But if you think it ’s beneath you , you can leave , ”
143199	143202	143204	143204	Harry	156	“ Okay , ”
143219	143231	143204	143204	Harry	156	“ I reckon we should all divide into pairs and practice . ”
143269	143276	143277	143277	Harry	156	“ You can practice with me , ”
143281	143298	143277	143277	Harry	156	“ Right — on the count of three , then — one , two , three — ”
143307	143310	143332	143332	Harry	156	“ Expelliarmus ! ”
143437	143440	143442	143442	Neville	342	“ Expelliarmus ! ”
143459	143464	143466	143466	Neville	342	“ I DID IT ! ”
143469	143481	143466	143466	Neville	342	“ I ’ve never done it before — I DID IT ! ”
143482	143486	143488	143488	Harry	156	“ Good one ! ”
143523	143558	143515	143515	his	2635	“ Listen , Neville , can you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing ? ”
143647	143652	143654	143654	George	245	“ Sorry , Harry , ”
143663	143668	143654	143654	George	245	“ Could n’t resist ... ”
143784	143789	143790	143790	Harry	156	“ Okay , stop ! ”
143793	143798	143790	143790	Harry	156	“ Stop ! STOP ! ”
143834	143840	143842	143842	Harry	156	“ That was n’t bad , ”
143844	143853	143842	143842	Harry	156	“ but there ’s definite room for improvement . ”
143860	143866	143854	143855	Zacharias Smith	479	“ Let ’s try again ... ”
143921	143925	143927	143927	Cho	359	“ Oh no , ”
143934	143950	143927	143927	Cho	359	“ Expelliarmious ! I mean , Expellimellius ! I — oh , sorry , Marietta ! ”
143980	143994	143995	143995	Cho	359	“ You made me nervous , I was doing all right before then ! ”
144000	144006	144007	144007	Harry	156	“ That was quite good , ”
144019	144044	144016	144016	he	156	“ Well , no , it was lousy , but I know you can do it properly , I was watching from over there ... ”
144060	144066	144067	144067	Cho	359	“ Do n’t mind her , ”
144070	144110	144067	144067	Cho	359	“ She does n’t really want to be here but I made her come with me . Her parents have forbidden her to do anything that might upset Umbridge , you see — her mum works for the Ministry . ”
144111	144117	144119	144119	Harry	156	“ What about your parents ? ”
144121	144138	144140	144140	Cho	359	“ Well , they ’ve forbidden me to get on the wrong side of Umbridge too , ”
144147	144169	144140	144140	Cho	359	“ But if they think I ’m not going to fight You - Know - Who after what happened to Cedric — ”
144205	144220	144222	144223	Luna Lovegood	356	“ Well , my father is very supportive of any anti - Ministry action ! ”
144258	144315	144239	144242	Justin Finch - Fletchley	475	“ He ’s always saying he ’d believe anything of Fudge , I mean , the number of goblins Fudge has had assassinated ! And of course he uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible poisons , which he feeds secretly to anybody who disagrees with him . And then there ’s his Umgubular Slashkilter — ”
144316	144321	144322	144322	Harry	156	“ Do n’t ask , ”
144338	144343	144344	144344	Hermione	172	“ Hey , Harry , ”
144354	144361	144344	144344	Hermione	172	“ have you checked the time ? ”
144417	144420	144410	144410	his	156	“ Expelliarmus ! ”
144432	144440	144442	144442	Harry	156	“ Well , that was pretty good , ”
144444	144465	144442	144442	Harry	156	“ but we ’ve overrun , we ’d better leave it here . Same time , same place next week ? ”
144466	144469	144471	144472	Dean Thomas	392	“ Sooner ! ”
144488	144503	144481	144481	Angelina	398	“ The Quidditch season ’s about to start , we need team practices too ! ”
144504	144514	144516	144516	Harry	156	“ Let ’s say next Wednesday night , then , ”
144518	144537	144516	144516	Harry	156	“ and we can decide on additional meetings then ... Come on , we ’d better get going ... ”
144627	144637	144639	144639	Hermione	172	“ That was really , really good , Harry , ”
144654	144660	144662	144662	Ron	333	“ Yeah , it was ! ”
144682	144692	144662	144662	Ron	333	“ Did you see me disarm Hermione , Harry ? ”
144693	144697	144699	144699	Hermione	172	“ Only once , ”
144703	144714	144699	144699	Hermione	172	“ I got you loads more than you got me — ”
144715	144732	144662	144662	Ron	333	“ I did not only get you once , I got you at least three times — ”
144733	144758	144699	144699	Hermione	172	“ Well , if you ’re counting the one where you tripped over your own feet and knocked the wand out of my hand — ”
145123	145135	145136	145136	Hermione	172	“ You see the numerals around the edge of the coins ? ”
145165	145276	145136	145136	Hermione	172	“ On real Galleons that ’s just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast the coin . On these fake coins , though , the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting . The coins will grow hot when the date changes , so if you ’re carrying them in a pocket you ’ll be able to feel them . We take one each , and when Harry sets the date of the next meeting he ’ll change the numbers on his coin , and because I ’ve put a Protean Charm on them , they ’ll all change to mimic his . ”
145299	145310	145311	145311	she	172	“ Well — I thought it was a good idea , ”
145315	145355	145311	145311	she	172	“ I mean , even if Umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets , there ’s nothing fishy about carrying a Galleon , is there ? But ... well , if you do n’t want to use them ... ”
145356	145364	145366	145367	Terry Boot	477	“ You can do a Protean Charm ? ”
145369	145372	145374	145374	Hermione	172	“ Yes , ”
145376	145389	145390	145390	he	2677	“ But that ’s ... that ’s N.E.W.T. standard , that is , ”
145394	145397	145399	145399	Hermione	172	“ Oh , ”
145406	145418	145399	145399	Hermione	172	“ Oh ... well ... yes , I suppose it is ... ”
145419	145428	145429	145429	he	2677	“ How come you ’re not in Ravenclaw ? ”
145441	145447	145429	145429	he	2677	“ With brains like yours ? ”
145448	145465	145467	145467	Hermione	172	“ Well , the Sorting Hat did seriously consider putting me in Ravenclaw during my Sorting , ”
145470	145490	145467	145467	Hermione	172	“ but it decided on Gryffindor in the end . So does that mean we ’re using the Galleons ? ”
145514	145523	145508	145508	Harry	156	“ You know what these remind me of ? ”
145524	145531	145429	145429	he	2677	“ No , what ’s that ? ”
145532	145561	145508	145508	Harry	156	“ The Death Eaters ’ scars . Voldemort touches one of them , and all their scars burn , and they know they ’ve got to join him . ”
145562	145567	145569	145569	Hermione	172	“ Well ... yes , ”
145572	145603	145569	145569	Hermione	172	“ That is where I got the idea ... but you ’ll notice I decided to engrave the date on bits of metal rather than on our members ’ skin ... ”
145604	145612	145614	145614	Harry	156	“ Yeah ... I prefer your way , ”
145627	145643	145619	145619	he	156	“ I suppose the only danger with these is that we might accidentally spend them . ”
145644	145648	145650	145650	Ron	333	“ Fat chance , ”
145665	145678	145650	145650	Ron	333	“ I have n’t got any real Galleons to confuse it with . ”
145822	145838	145839	145839	she	306	“ I think you ’ve got enough to be getting on with at the moment , ”
145861	145905	145850	145850	she	306	“ I ’ve become accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study , boys , and I really do n’t want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape , so use the extra time to practice , wo n’t you ? ”
146292	146311	146279	146279	their	2693	“ Hey , Potty , I heard Warrington ’s sworn to knock you off your broom on Saturday , ”
146322	146345	146346	146346	he	333	“ Warrington ’s aim ’s so pathetic I ’d be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me , ”
146404	146416	146417	146417	he	333	“ Got your bed booked in the hospital wing , Weasley ? ”
146601	146606	146608	146608	Harry	156	“ You all right ? ”
146660	146667	146668	146668	Harry	156	“ You just need some breakfast , ”
146672	146676	146668	146668	Harry	156	“ C’m on . ”
146850	146860	146861	146861	he	333	“ I must ’ve been mental to do this , ”
146868	146871	146861	146861	he	333	“ Mental . ”
146872	146878	146880	146880	Harry	156	“ Do n’t be thick , ”
146890	146905	146880	146880	Harry	156	“ You ’re going to be fine . It ’s normal to be nervous . ”
146906	146911	146913	146913	Ron	333	“ I ’m rubbish , ”
146915	146934	146913	146913	Ron	333	“ I ’m lousy . I ca n’t play to save my life . What was I thinking ? ”
146935	146940	146942	146942	Harry	156	“ Get a grip , ”
146945	146968	146942	146942	Harry	156	“ Look at that save you made with your foot the other day , even Fred and George said it was brilliant — ”
146977	146983	146984	146984	he	333	“ That was an accident , ”
146988	147024	146984	146984	he	333	“ I did n’t mean to do it — I slipped off my broom when none of you were looking and I was trying to get back on and I kicked the Quaffle by accident . ”
147025	147028	147030	147030	Harry	156	“ Well , ”
147039	147058	147030	147030	Harry	156	“ a few more accidents like that and the game ’s in the bag , is n’t it ? ”
147079	147085	147086	147086	Ginny	247	“ How ’re you feeling ? ”
147118	147124	147126	147126	Harry	156	“ He ’s just nervous , ”
147128	147154	147156	147156	Hermione	172	“ Well , that ’s a good sign , I never feel you perform as well in exams if you ’re not a bit nervous , ”
147159	147162	147194	147195	a few	1354	“ Hello , ”
147226	147232	147234	147234	Luna	356	“ I ’m supporting Gryffindor , ”
147242	147248	147234	147234	Luna	356	“ Look what it does ... ”
147279	147288	147290	147290	Luna	356	“ It ’s good , is n’t it ? ”
147293	147323	147290	147290	Luna	356	“ I wanted to have it chewing up a serpent to represent Slytherin , you know , but there was n’t time . Anyway ... good luck , Ronald ! ”
147365	147371	147372	147372	she	356	“ When you ’re ready , ”
147375	147393	147372	147372	she	356	“ we ’re going to go straight down to the pitch , check out conditions and change . ”
147394	147403	147404	147404	Harry	156	“ We ’ll be there in a bit , ”
147408	147418	147404	147404	Harry	156	“ Ron ’s just got to have some breakfast . ”
147476	147490	147491	147491	she	356	“ Do n’t let Ron see what ’s on those Slytherins ’ badges , ”
147521	147527	147529	147529	Hermione	172	“ Good luck , Ron , ”
147541	147547	147529	147529	Hermione	172	“ And you , Harry — ”
147820	147835	147837	147837	Angelina	398	“ Okay , I ’ve only just found out the final lineup for Slytherin , ”
147845	147899	147837	147837	Angelina	398	“ Last year ’s Beaters , Derrick and Bole , have left now , but it looks as though Montague ’s replaced them with the usual gorillas , rather than anyone who can fly particularly well . They ’re two blokes called Crabbe and Goyle , I do n’t know much about them — ”
147900	147904	147906	147906	Harry	156	“ We do , ”
147911	147930	147932	147932	Angelina	398	“ Well , they do n’t look bright enough to tell one end of a broom from another , ”
147938	147959	147932	147932	Angelina	398	“ but then I was always surprised Derrick and Bole managed to find their way onto the pitch without signposts . ”
147960	147970	147971	147971	Harry	156	“ Crabbe and Goyle are in the same mold , ”
148045	148050	148052	148052	Angelina	398	“ It ’s time , ”
148063	148071	148052	148052	Angelina	398	“ C’m on everyone ... good luck . ”
148217	148222	148224	148225	the umpire	2728	“ Captains shake hands , ”
148257	148262	148252	148252	she	398	“ Mount your brooms ... ”
148345	148380	148337	148338	Draco Malfoy	298	“ And it ’s Johnson , Johnson with the Quaffle , what a player that girl is , I ’ve been saying it for years but she still wo n’t go out with me — ”
148381	148384	148386	148387	Professor McGonagall	306	“ JORDAN ! ”
148389	148481	148337	148338	Draco Malfoy	298	“ Just a fun fact , Professor , adds a bit of interest — and she ’s ducked Warrington , she ’s passed Montague , she ’s — ouch — been hit from behind by a Bludger from Crabbe ... Montague catches the Quaffle , Montague heading back up the pitch and — nice Bludger there from George Weasley , that ’s a Bludger to the head for Montague , he drops the Quaffle , caught by Katie Bell , Katie Bell reverse passes to Alicia Spinnet and Spinnet ’s away — ”
148519	148552	148509	148510	the crowd	1241	“ — dodges Warrington , avoids a Bludger — close call , Alicia — and the crowd are loving this , just listen to them , what ’s that they ’re singing ? ”
148580	148589	148590	148590	Lee	353	“ — and Alicia passes back to Angelina ! ”
148622	148648	148610	148610	Lee	353	“ Come on now , Angelina — looks like she ’s got just the Keeper to beat ! — SHE SHOOTS — SHE — aaaah ... ”
148740	148767	148733	148735	the massive Warrington	502	“ — and it ’s Warrington with the Quaffle , Warrington heading for goal , he ’s out of Bludger range with just the Keeper ahead — ”
148780	148817	148859	148859	Lee	353	“ — so it ’s the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper , Weasley , brother of Beaters , Fred and George , and a promising new talent on the team — come on , Ron ! ”
148853	148857	148859	148859	Lee	353	“ Slytherin score ! ”
148872	148887	148859	148859	Lee	353	“ So that ’s ten - nil to Slytherin — bad luck , Ron ... ”
148894	148911	148913	148913	Lee	353	“ — and Gryffindor back in possession and it ’s Katie Bell tanking up the pitch — ”
148933	148941	148943	148943	Angelina	398	“ Harry , WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? ”
148954	148958	148943	148943	Angelina	398	“ GET GOING ! ”
149057	149065	149067	149067	Lee	353	“ — and it ’s Warrington again , ”
149069	149165	149067	149067	Lee	353	“ who passes to Pucey , Pucey ’s off past Spinnet , come on now Angelina , you can take him — turns out you ca n’t — but nice Bludger from Fred Weasley , I mean , George Weasley , oh who cares , one of them anyway , and Warrington drops the Quaffle and Katie Bell — er — drops it too — so that ’s Montague with the Quaffle , Slytherin Captain Montague takes the Quaffle , and he ’s off up the pitch , come on now Gryffindor , block him ! ”
149213	149235	149209	149211	the crowd below	2754	“ — and Pucey ’s dodged Alicia again , and he ’s heading straight for goal , stop it , Ron ! ”
149399	149463	149464	149464	Harry	156	“ — and Katie Bell dodges Pucey , ducks Montague , nice swerve , Katie , and she throws to Johnson , Angelina Johnson takes the Quaffle , she ’s past Warrington , she ’s heading for goal , come on now Angelina — GRYFFINDOR SCORE ! It ’s forty – ten , forty – ten to Slytherin and Pucey has the Quaffle ... ”
149553	149605	149537	149537	Malfoy	298	“ — Pucey throws to Warrington , Warrington to Montague , Montague back to Pucey — Johnson intervenes , Johnson takes the Quaffle , Johnson to Bell , this looks good — I mean bad — Bell ’s hit by a Bludger from Goyle and it ’s Pucey in possession again ... ”
149922	149928	149917	149917	Angelina	398	“ Are you all right ? ”
149929	149935	149937	149937	Harry	156	“ ’ Course I am , ”
149978	149986	149988	149988	Angelina	398	“ It was that thug , Crabbe , ”
149991	150017	149988	149988	Angelina	398	“ He whacked the Bludger at you the moment he saw you ’d got the Snitch — but we won , Harry , we won ! ”
150058	150068	150069	150069	he	156	“ Saved Weasley ’s neck , have n’t you ? ”
150074	150100	150069	150069	he	156	“ I ’ve never seen a worse Keeper ... but then he was born in a bin ... Did you like my lyrics , Potter ? ”
150159	150169	150170	150170	Malfoy	298	“ We wanted to write another couple of verses ! ”
150180	150202	150176	150176	Alicia	434	“ But we could n’t find rhymes for fat and ugly — we wanted to sing about his mother , see — ”
150203	150209	150211	150211	Angelina	398	“ Talk about sour grapes , ”
150219	150237	150176	150176	Alicia	434	“ — we could n’t fit in useless loser either — for his father , you know — ”
150263	150267	150269	150269	Angelina	398	“ Leave it , ”
150279	150302	150269	150269	Angelina	398	“ Leave it , Fred , let him yell , he ’s just sore he lost , the jumped - up little — ”
150303	150317	150319	150319	Malfoy	298	“ — but you like the Weasleys , do n’t you , Potter ? ”
150323	150362	150319	150319	Malfoy	298	“ Spend holidays there and everything , do n’t you ? Ca n’t see how you stand the stink , but I suppose when you ’ve been dragged up by Muggles even the Weasleys ’ hovel smells okay — ”
150414	150418	150420	150420	Malfoy	298	“ Or perhaps , ”
150428	150451	150420	150420	Malfoy	298	“ you can remember what your mother ’s house stank like , Potter , and Weasley ’s pigsty reminds you of it — ”
150534	150543	150527	150527	he	156	“ Harry ! HARRY ! GEORGE ! NO ! ”
150584	150587	150579	150582	somebody in the vicinity	2780	“ IMPEDIMENTA ! ”
150617	150626	150628	150629	Madam Hooch	506	“ What do you think you ’re doing ? ”
150716	150749	150709	150709	Crabbe	368	“ I ’ve never seen behavior like it — back up to the castle , both of you , and straight to your Head of House ’s office ! Go ! Now ! ”
150890	150893	150894	150894	she	2787	“ In ! ”
150932	150935	150936	150936	she	2787	“ Well ? ”
150939	150956	150936	150936	she	2787	“ I have never seen such a disgraceful exhibition . Two onto one ! Explain yourselves ! ”
150957	150962	150964	150964	Harry	156	“ Malfoy provoked us , ”
150967	150971	150973	150974	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Provoked you ? ”
151003	151035	151000	151001	Ginger Newts	509	“ He ’d just lost , had n’t he , of course he wanted to provoke you ! But what on earth he can have said that justified what you two — ”
151036	151042	151044	151044	George	245	“ He insulted my parents , ”
151046	151052	151044	151044	George	245	“ And Harry ’s mother . ”
151053	151080	151082	151083	Professor McGonagall	306	“ But instead of leaving it to Madam Hooch to sort out , you two decided to give an exhibition of Muggle dueling , did you ? ”
151085	151095	151082	151083	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Have you any idea what you ’ve — ? ”
151096	151101	151044	151044	George	245	“ Hem , hem . ”
151151	151159	151161	151162	Professor Umbridge	390	“ May I help , Professor McGonagall ? ”
151178	151181	151182	151182	she	390	“ Help ? ”
151189	151199	151182	151182	she	390	“ What do you mean , ‘ help ’ ? ”
151214	151229	151200	151201	Professor Umbridge	390	“ Why , I thought you might be grateful for a little extra authority . ”
151246	151251	151252	151252	she	390	“ You thought wrong , ”
151261	151333	151252	151252	she	390	“ Now , you two had better listen closely . I do not care what provocation Malfoy offered you , I do not care if he insulted every family member you possess , your behavior was disgusting and I am giving each of you a week ’s worth of detention ! Do not look at me like that , Potter , you deserve it ! And if either of you ever — ”
151334	151339	151376	151376	Umbridge	390	“ Hem , hem . ”
151360	151363	151351	151351	she	306	“ Yes ? ”
151364	151374	151376	151376	Umbridge	390	“ I think they deserve rather more than detentions , ”
151390	151394	151395	151395	she	306	“ But unfortunately , ”
151415	151433	151395	151395	she	306	“ it is what I think that counts , as they are in my House , Dolores . ”
151434	151441	151443	151443	Umbridge	390	“ Well , actually , Minerva , ”
151445	151472	151473	151473	she	306	“ I think you ’ll find that what I think does count . Now , where is it ? Cornelius just sent it ... I mean , ”
151486	151496	151480	151480	she	306	“ the Minister just sent it ... Ah yes ... ”
151522	151536	151497	151497	She	306	“ Hem , hem ... ‘ Educational Decree Number Twenty - five ... ’ ”
151537	151542	151544	151545	Professor McGonagall	306	“ Not another one ! ”
151548	151553	151555	151555	Umbridge	390	“ Well , yes , ”
151560	151792	151555	151555	Umbridge	390	“ As a matter of fact , Minerva , it was you who made me see that we needed a further amendment ... You remember how you overrode me , when I was unwilling to allow the Gryffindor Quidditch team to re - form ? How you took the case to Dumbledore , who insisted that the team be allowed to play ? Well , now , I could n’t have that . I contacted the Minister at once , and he quite agreed with me that the High Inquisitor has to have the power to strip pupils of privileges , or she — that is to say , I — would have less authority than common teachers ! And you see now , do n’t you , Minerva , how right I was in attempting to stop the Gryffindor team re - forming ? Dreadful tempers ... Anyway , I was reading out our amendment ... hem , hem ... ‘ The High Inquisitor will henceforth have supreme authority over all punishments , sanctions , and removal of privileges pertaining to the students of Hogwarts , and the power to alter such punishments , sanctions , and removals of privileges as may have been ordered by other staff members . Signed , Cornelius Fudge , Minister of Magic , Order of Merlin First Class , etc . , etc ... ’ ”
151809	151828	151829	151829	she	2790	“ So ... I really think I will have to ban these two from playing Quidditch ever again , ”
151851	151855	151856	151856	he	156	“ Ban us ? ”
151866	151873	151860	151860	his	156	“ From playing ... ever again ? ”
151874	151891	151893	151893	Umbridge	390	“ Yes , Mr. Potter , I think a lifelong ban ought to do the trick , ”
151912	151998	151999	151999	she	390	“ You and Mr. Weasley here . And I think , to be safe , this young man ’s twin ought to be stopped too — if his teammates had not restrained him , I feel sure he would have attacked young Mr. Malfoy as well . I will want their broomsticks confiscated , of course ; I shall keep them safely in my office , to make sure there is no infringement of my ban . But I am not unreasonable , Professor McGonagall , ”
152023	152051	151999	151999	she	390	“ The rest of the team can continue playing , I saw no signs of violence from any of them . Well ... good afternoon to you . ”
152073	152076	152078	152078	Angelina	398	“ Banned , ”
152092	152110	152078	152078	Angelina	398	“ Banned . No Seeker and no Beaters ... What on earth are we going to do ? ”
152161	152168	152170	152170	Alicia	434	“ It ’s just so unfair , ”
152173	152197	152170	152170	Alicia	434	“ I mean , what about Crabbe and that Bludger he hit after the whistle had been blown ? Has she banned him ? ”
152198	152201	152203	152203	Ginny	509	“ No , ”
152217	152232	152206	152206	she	509	“ He just got lines , I heard Montague laughing about it at dinner . ”
152233	152245	152247	152247	Alicia	434	“ And banning Fred when he did n’t even do anything ! ”
152257	152267	152269	152269	Fred	244	“ It ’s not my fault I did n’t , ”
152280	152301	152269	152269	Fred	244	“ I would ’ve pounded the little scumbag to a pulp if you three had n’t been holding me back . ”
152352	152359	152361	152361	Angelina	398	“ I ’m going to bed , ”
152369	152397	152361	152361	Angelina	398	“ Maybe this will all turn out to have been a bad dream ... Maybe I ’ll wake up tomorrow and find we have n’t played yet ... ”
152442	152448	152449	152449	Hermione	172	“ Have you seen Ron ? ”
152461	152469	152471	152471	Hermione	172	“ I think he ’s avoiding us , ”
152473	152481	152471	152471	Hermione	172	“ Where do you think he — ? ”
152536	152542	152544	152544	Hermione	172	“ Where have you been ? ”
152550	152553	152554	152554	Ron	333	“ Walking , ”
152565	152570	152572	152572	Hermione	172	“ You look frozen , ”
152574	152580	152572	152572	Hermione	172	“ Come and sit down ! ”
152609	152614	152615	152615	Ron	333	“ I ’m sorry , ”
152623	152627	152629	152629	Harry	156	“ What for ? ”
152631	152639	152641	152641	Ron	333	“ For thinking I can play Quidditch , ”
152643	152653	152641	152641	Ron	333	“ I ’m going to resign first thing tomorrow . ”
152654	152659	152661	152661	Harry	156	“ If you resign , ”
152664	152676	152661	152661	Harry	156	“ there ’ll only be three players left on the team . ”
152686	152700	152683	152683	he	333	“ I ’ve been given a lifetime ban . So’ve Fred and George . ”
152701	152704	152705	152705	Ron	333	“ What ? ”
152736	152743	152725	152725	she	172	“ This is all my fault — ”
152744	152753	152755	152755	Harry	156	“ You did n’t make me punch Malfoy , ”
152758	152769	152725	152725	she	172	“ — if I was n’t so lousy at Quidditch — ”
152770	152781	152725	152725	she	172	“ — it ’s got nothing to do with that — ”
152782	152793	152725	152725	she	172	“ — it was that song that wound me up — ”
152794	152803	152725	152725	she	172	“ — it would ’ve wound anyone up — ”
152827	152836	152837	152837	Harry	156	“ Look , drop it , will you ! ”
152841	152853	152837	152837	Harry	156	“ It ’s bad enough without you blaming yourself for everything ! ”
152879	152892	152872	152872	he	333	“ This is the worst I ’ve ever felt in my life . ”
152893	152898	152900	152900	Harry	156	“ Join the club , ”
152903	152906	152910	152910	her	172	“ Well , ”
152915	152929	152910	152910	her	172	“ I can think of one thing that might cheer you both up . ”
152930	152934	152936	152936	Harry	156	“ Oh yeah ? ”
152939	152942	152944	152944	Hermione	172	“ Yeah , ”
