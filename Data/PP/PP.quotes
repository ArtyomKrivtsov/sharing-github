76	82	84	85	his lady	223	" My dear Mr. Bennet , "
91	103	84	85	his lady	223	" have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? "
112	120	104	105	Mr. Bennet	74	" But it is , returned she ; "
143	155	157	158	his wife	225	" Do you not want to know who has taken it ? "
161	177	104	105	Mr. Bennet	74	" YOU want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . "
183	272	104	105	Mr. Bennet	74	" Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it , that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . "
273	279	104	105	Mr. Bennet	74	" What is his name ? "
280	283	104	105	Mr. Bennet	74	" Bingley . "
284	291	104	105	Mr. Bennet	74	" Is he married or single ? "
292	326	104	105	Mr. Bennet	74	" Oh ! Single , my dear , to be sure ! A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . What a fine thing for our girls ! "
327	337	104	105	Mr. Bennet	74	" How so ? How can it affect them ? "
338	344	346	347	his wife	225	" My dear Mr. Bennet , "
349	371	346	347	his wife	225	" how can you be so tiresome ! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . "
372	381	104	105	Mr. Bennet	74	" Is that his design in settling here ? "
382	421	346	347	his wife	225	" Design ! Nonsense , how can you talk so ! But it is very likely that he MAY fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . "
422	474	104	105	Mr. Bennet	74	" I see no occasion for that . You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party . "
475	524	346	347	his wife	225	" My dear , you flatter me . I certainly HAVE had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now . When a woman has five grown - up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . "
525	541	104	105	Mr. Bennet	74	" In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . "
542	563	346	347	his wife	225	" But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . "
564	577	104	105	Mr. Bennet	74	" It is more than I engage for , I assure you . "
578	644	346	347	his wife	225	" But consider your daughters . Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general , you know , they visit no newcomers . Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for US to visit him if you do not . "
645	706	104	105	Mr. Bennet	74	" You are over - scrupulous , surely . I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . "
707	758	346	347	his wife	225	" I desire you will do no such thing . Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good - humoured as Lydia . But you are always giving HER the preference . "
759	770	772	772	he	228	" They have none of them much to recommend them , "
774	796	772	772	he	228	" they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . "
797	829	346	347	his wife	225	" Mr. Bennet , how CAN you abuse your own children in such a way ? You take delight in vexing me . You have no compassion for my poor nerves . "
830	868	772	772	he	228	" You mistake me , my dear . I have a high respect for your nerves . They are my old friends . I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least . "
1038	1049	1032	1032	he	74	" I hope Mr. Bingley will like it , Lizzy . "
1050	1064	1066	1067	her mother	235	" We are not in a way to know WHAT Mr. Bingley likes , "
1070	1078	1066	1067	her mother	235	" since we are not to visit . "
1079	1086	1088	1088	Elizabeth	81	" But you forget , mamma , "
1090	1109	1088	1088	Elizabeth	81	" that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him . "
1110	1147	1177	1178	Mrs. Bennet	84	" I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing . She has two nieces of her own . She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . "
1148	1154	1156	1157	Mr. Bennet	74	" No more have I , "
1159	1176	1156	1157	Mr. Bennet	74	" and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . "
1200	1228	1177	1178	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Do n't keep coughing so , Kitty , for Heaven 's sake ! Have a little compassion on my nerves . You tear them to pieces . "
1229	1238	1240	1241	her father	238	" Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , "
1243	1249	1240	1241	her father	238	" she times them ill . "
1250	1260	1262	1262	Kitty	85	" I do not cough for my own amusement , "
1265	1276	1262	1262	Kitty	85	" When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? "
1277	1283	1177	1178	Mrs. Bennet	84	" To - morrow fortnight . "
1284	1291	1293	1294	her mother	235	" Aye , so it is , "
1296	1328	1293	1294	her mother	235	" and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before ; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . "
1329	1351	1177	1178	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to HER . "
1352	1376	1293	1294	her mother	235	" Impossible , Mr. Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teasing ? "
1377	1459	1177	1178	Mrs. Bennet	84	" I honour your circumspection . A fortnight 's acquaintance is certainly very little . One can not know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . But if WE do not venture somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their chance ; and , therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . "
1472	1477	1467	1468	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Nonsense , nonsense ! "
1478	1489	1491	1491	he	241	" What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? "
1493	1550	1491	1491	he	241	" Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? I can not quite agree with you THERE . What say you , Mary ? For you are a young lady of deep reflection , I know , and read great books and make extracts . "
1563	1571	1572	1572	he	241	" While Mary is adjusting her ideas , "
1575	1583	1572	1572	he	241	" let us return to Mr. Bingley . "
1584	1592	1594	1595	his wife	225	" I am sick of Mr. Bingley , "
1597	1654	1594	1595	his wife	225	" I am sorry to hear THAT ; but why did not you tell me that before ? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him . It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we can not escape the acquaintance now . "
1701	1773	1686	1686	she	225	" How good it was in you , my dear Mr. Bennet ! But I knew I should persuade you at last . I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . Well , how pleased I am ! and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now . "
1774	1788	1790	1791	Mr. Bennet	74	" Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , "
1821	1831	1832	1832	I	0	" said she , when the door was shut . "
1915	1915	1904	1905	Mr. Bingley	78	"
1916	1919	1921	1921	Lydia	83	" Oh ! "
1924	1942	1921	1921	Lydia	83	" I am not afraid ; for though I AM the youngest , I 'm the tallest . "
2132	2147	2149	2150	Mrs. Bennet	84	" If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , "
2155	2172	2149	2150	Mrs. Bennet	84	" and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . "
2921	2926	2928	2928	he	88	" Come , Darcy , "
2930	2957	2928	2928	he	88	" I must have you dance . I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . You had much better dance . "
2958	3019	2900	2901	Mr. Bingley	78	" I certainly shall not . You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable . Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . "
3020	3031	3033	3034	Mr. Bingley	78	" I would not be so fastidious as you are , "
3036	3073	3033	3034	Mr. Bingley	78	" for a kingdom ! Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . "
3074	3087	3089	3090	Mr. Darcy	88	" YOU are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , "
3099	3147	3158	3158	he	88	" Oh ! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say very agreeable . Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . "
3148	3154	3158	3158	he	88	" Which do you mean ? "
3179	3233	3171	3171	he	88	" She is tolerable , but not handsome enough to tempt ME ; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me . "
3496	3504	3506	3506	she	225	" Oh ! my dear Mr. Bennet , "
3511	3707	3506	3506	she	225	" we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . I wish you had been there . Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . Everybody said how well she looked ; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice ! Only think of THAT , my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ! But , however , he did not admire her at all ; indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . So he inquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . Then the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the BOULANGER — "
3708	3718	3720	3721	her husband	254	" If he had had any compassion for ME , "
3724	3758	3720	3721	her husband	254	" he would not have danced half so much ! For God 's sake , say no more of his partners . O that he had sprained his ankle in the first place ! "
3759	3809	3720	3721	her husband	254	" Oh ! my dear , I am quite delighted with him . He is so excessively handsome ! And his sisters are charming women . I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses . I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst 's gown — "
3856	3863	3864	3864	she	321	" But I can assure you , "
3867	3957	3864	3864	she	321	" that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting HIS fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him ! He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! Not handsome enough to dance with ! I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set - downs . I quite detest the man . "
3992	4004	4006	4006	she	323	" He is just what a young man ought to be , "
4008	4033	4006	4006	she	323	" sensible , good - humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners!—so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! "
4034	4040	4042	4042	Elizabeth	81	" He is also handsome , "
4044	4065	4042	4042	Elizabeth	81	" which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can . His character is thereby complete . "
4066	4090	4006	4006	she	323	" I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . I did not expect such a compliment . "
4091	4186	4042	4042	Elizabeth	81	" Did not you ? I did for you . But that is one great difference between us . Compliments always take YOU by surprise , and ME never . What could be more natural than his asking you again ? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . No thanks to his gallantry for that . Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . You have liked many a stupider person . "
4187	4191	4006	4006	she	323	" Dear Lizzy ! "
4192	4245	4042	4042	Elizabeth	81	" Oh ! you are a great deal too apt , you know , to like people in general . You never see a fault in anybody . All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life . "
4246	4266	4006	4006	she	323	" I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone ; but I always speak what I think . "
4267	4370	4042	4042	Elizabeth	81	" I know you do ; and it is THAT which makes the wonder . With YOUR good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! Affectation of candour is common enough — one meets with it everywhere . But to be candid without ostentation or design — to take the good of everybody 's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad — belongs to you alone . And so you like this man 's sisters , too , do you ? Their manners are not equal to his . "
4371	4421	4006	4006	she	323	" Certainly not — at first . But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . Miss Bingley is to live with her brother , and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . "
5470	5479	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	84	" YOU began the evening well , Charlotte , "
5492	5501	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	84	" YOU were Mr. Bingley 's first choice . "
5502	5514	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . "
5515	5568	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Oh ! you mean Jane , I suppose , because he danced with her twice . To be sure that DID seem as if he admired her — indeed I rather believe he DID — I heard something about it — but I hardly know what — something about Mr. Robinson . "
5569	5658	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson ; did not I mention it to you ? Mr. Robinson 's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and WHICH he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question : ' Oh ! the eldest Miss Bennet , beyond a doubt ; there can not be two opinions on that point . ' "
5659	5692	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Upon my word ! Well , that is very decided indeed — that does seem as if — but , however , it may all come to nothing , you know . "
5693	5706	5708	5708	Charlotte	99	" MY overhearings were more to the purpose than YOURS , Eliza , "
5710	5732	5708	5708	Charlotte	99	" Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he?—poor Eliza!—to be only just TOLERABLE . "
5733	5799	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	84	" I beg you would not put it into Lizzy 's head to be vexed by his ill - treatment , for he is such a disagreeable man , that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half - an - hour without once opening his lips . "
5800	5813	5815	5815	Jane	153	" Are you quite sure , ma'am?—is not there a little mistake ? "
5817	5827	5815	5815	Jane	153	" I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her . "
5828	5862	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Aye — because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to . "
5863	5869	5871	5871	Jane	153	" Miss Bingley told me , "
5873	5893	5871	5871	Jane	153	" that he never speaks much , unless among his intimate acquaintances . With THEM he is remarkably agreeable . "
5894	5969	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	84	" I do not believe a word of it , my dear . If he had been so very agreeable , he would have talked to Mrs. Long . But I can guess how it was ; everybody says that he is eat up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise . "
5970	5982	5984	5985	Miss Lucas	91	" I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long , "
5987	5997	5984	5985	Miss Lucas	91	" but I wish he had danced with Eliza . "
5998	6004	6006	6007	her mother	235	" Another time , Lizzy , "
6009	6022	6006	6007	her mother	235	" I would not dance with HIM , if I were you . "
6023	6040	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	84	" I believe , ma'am , I may safely promise you NEVER to dance with him . "
6041	6045	6047	6048	Miss Lucas	91	" His pride , "
6050	6113	6047	6048	Miss Lucas	91	" does not offend ME so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . One can not wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , everything in his favour , should think highly of himself . If I may so express it , he has a RIGHT to be proud . "
6114	6120	6122	6122	Elizabeth	81	" That is very true , "
6124	6140	6122	6122	Elizabeth	81	" and I could easily forgive HIS pride , if he had not mortified MINE . "
6141	6144	6146	6146	Mary	86	" Pride , "
6158	6270	6146	6146	Mary	86	" is a very common failing , I believe . By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed ; that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . Vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonymously . A person may be proud without being vain . Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . "
6271	6281	6283	6285	a young Lucas	383	" If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy , "
6293	6320	6283	6285	a young Lucas	383	" I should not care how proud I was . I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine a day . "
6321	6334	6336	6337	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , "
6339	6358	6336	6337	Mrs. Bennet	84	" and if I were to see you at it , I should take away your bottle directly . "
6627	6634	6636	6636	Charlotte	99	" It may perhaps be pleasant , "
6638	6803	6636	6636	Charlotte	99	" to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . We can all BEGIN freely — a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . In nine cases out of ten a women had better show MORE affection than she feels . Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . "
6804	6843	6624	6625	Miss Lucas	91	" But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton , indeed , not to discover it too . "
6844	6861	6636	6636	Charlotte	99	" Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane 's disposition as you do . "
6862	6887	6624	6625	Miss Lucas	91	" But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . "
6888	6985	6636	6636	Charlotte	99	" Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . But , though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and , as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . Jane should therefore make the most of every half - hour in which she can command his attention . When she is secure of him , there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses . "
6986	6994	6996	6996	Elizabeth	81	" Your plan is a good one , "
6998	7121	6996	6996	Elizabeth	81	" where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married , and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it . But these are not Jane 's feelings ; she is not acting by design . As yet , she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness . She has known him only a fortnight . She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined with him in company four times . This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . "
7122	7170	6636	6636	Charlotte	99	" Not as you represent it . Had she merely DINED with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together — and four evenings may do a great deal . "
7171	7212	6996	6996	Elizabeth	81	" Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt - un better than Commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . "
7213	7216	7218	7218	Charlotte	99	" Well , "
7220	7345	7218	7218	Charlotte	99	" I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . "
7346	7378	7412	7413	Mr. Darcy	88	" You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . "
7639	7646	7648	7648	she	324	" What does Mr. Darcy mean , "
7652	7662	7648	7648	she	324	" by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? "
7663	7675	7627	7629	Sir William Lucas	79	" That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer . "
7676	7724	7648	7648	she	324	" But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about . He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . "
7770	7802	7763	7763	she	91	" Did you not think , Mr. Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? "
7803	7820	7763	7763	she	91	" With great energy ; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic . "
7821	7828	7763	7763	she	91	" You are severe on us . "
7829	7840	7842	7843	Miss Lucas	91	" It will be HER turn soon to be teased , "
7845	7862	7842	7843	Miss Lucas	91	" I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . "
7863	7928	7937	7937	she	91	" You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody ! If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable ; but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . "
7940	7953	7937	7937	she	91	" Very well , if it must be so , it must . "
7961	7998	7937	7937	she	91	" There is a fine old saying , which everybody here is of course familiar with : ' Keep your breath to cool your porridge ' ; and I shall keep mine to swell my song . "
8240	8275	8235	8236	Sir William	79	" What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr. Darcy ! There is nothing like dancing after all . I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society . "
8276	8305	8306	8307	Sir William	79	" Certainly , sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world . Every savage can dance . "
8311	8317	8318	8318	he	79	" Your friend performs delightfully , "
8331	8349	8318	8318	he	79	" and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Mr. Darcy . "
8350	8363	8306	8307	Sir William	79	" You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , sir . "
8364	8387	8318	8318	he	79	" Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight . Do you often dance at St. James 's ? "
8388	8393	8306	8307	Sir William	79	" Never , sir . "
8394	8409	8318	8318	he	79	" Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? "
8410	8428	8306	8307	Sir William	79	" It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . "
8429	8440	8318	8318	he	79	" You have a house in town , I conclude ? "
8445	8484	8485	8485	He	88	" I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself — for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . "
8531	8581	8512	8512	he	88	" My dear Miss Eliza , why are you not dancing ? Mr. Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . You can not refuse to dance , I am sure when so much beauty is before you . "
8624	8657	8610	8610	she	81	" Indeed , sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . "
8698	8752	8610	8610	she	81	" You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half - hour . "
8753	8760	8762	8762	Elizabeth	81	" Mr. Darcy is all politeness , "
8766	8800	8610	8610	she	81	" He is , indeed ; but , considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we can not wonder at his complaisance — for who would object to such a partner ? "
8836	8846	8833	8834	Miss Bingley	90	" I can guess the subject of your reverie . "
8847	8853	8820	8820	he	282	" I should imagine not . "
8854	8923	8833	8834	Miss Bingley	90	" You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner — in such society ; and indeed I am quite of you opinion . I was never more annoyed ! The insipidity , and yet the noise — the nothingness , and yet the self - importance of all those people ! What would I give to hear your strictures on them ! "
8924	8967	8820	8820	he	282	" You conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . My mind was more agreeably engaged . I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . "
9001	9006	8994	8995	Mr. Darcy	88	" Miss Elizabeth Bennet . "
9007	9012	9014	9015	Miss Bingley	90	" Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! "
9017	9041	9014	9015	Miss Bingley	90	" I am all astonishment . How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray , when am I to wish you joy ? "
9042	9088	8994	8995	Mr. Darcy	88	" That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask . A lady 's imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony , in a moment . I knew you would be wishing me joy . "
9089	9136	9014	9015	Miss Bingley	90	" Nay , if you are serious about it , I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled . You will be having a charming mother - in - law , indeed ; and , of course , she will always be at Pemberley with you . "
9571	9609	9566	9567	Mr. Bennet	74	" From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country . I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . "
9658	9666	9668	9669	Mrs. Bennet	84	" I am astonished , my dear , "
9671	9706	9668	9669	Mrs. Bennet	84	" that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . If I wished to think slightingly of anybody 's children , it should not be of my own , however . "
9707	9724	9629	9629	her	83	" If my children are silly , I must hope to be always sensible of it . "
9725	9741	9668	9669	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Yes — but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . "
9742	9789	9629	9629	her	83	" This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . "
9790	9908	9668	9669	Mrs. Bennet	84	" My dear Mr. Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . When they get to our age , I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well — and , indeed , so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William 's in his regimentals . "
9909	9912	9914	9914	Lydia	83	" Mamma , "
9916	9955	9914	9914	Lydia	83	" my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson 's as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke 's library . "
10007	10043	9996	9996	she	84	" Well , Jane , who is it from ? What is it about ? What does he say ? Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . "
10044	10051	10053	10053	Jane	153	" It is from Miss Bingley , "
10061	10066	9996	9996	she	84	" MY DEAR FRIEND , —
10067	10144	9996	9996	she	84	" If you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day 's tete - a - tete between two women can never end without a quarrel . Come as soon as you can on receipt of this . My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.—Yours ever ,
10145	10148	9996	9996	she	84	" CAROLINE BINGLEY "
10149	10154	10156	10156	Lydia	83	" With the officers ! "
10158	10170	10156	10156	Lydia	83	" I wonder my aunt did not tell us of THAT . "
10171	10175	10177	10178	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Dining out , "
10180	10186	10177	10178	Mrs. Bennet	84	" that is very unlucky . "
10187	10194	10196	10196	Jane	153	" Can I have the carriage ? "
10198	10226	9996	9996	she	84	" No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . "
10227	10235	10237	10237	Elizabeth	81	" That would be a good scheme , "
10239	10254	10237	10237	Elizabeth	81	" if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . "
10255	10281	9996	9996	she	84	" Oh ! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley 's chaise to go to Meryton , and the Hursts have no horses to theirs . "
10282	10292	10237	10237	Elizabeth	81	" I had much rather go in the coach . "
10293	10325	9996	9996	she	84	" But , my dear , your father can not spare the horses , I am sure . They are wanted in the farm , Mr. Bennet , are they not ? "
10326	10341	10237	10237	Elizabeth	81	" They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . "
10342	10353	10355	10355	Elizabeth	81	" But if you have got them to - day , "
10357	10366	10355	10355	Elizabeth	81	" my mother 's purpose will be answered . "
10454	10465	10467	10468	Mrs. Bennet	84	" This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! "
10521	10526	10510	10513	a servant from Netherfield	463	" MY DEAREST LIZZY , —
10527	10611	10510	10513	a servant from Netherfield	463	" I find myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better . They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones — therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me — and , excepting a sore throat and headache , there is not much the matter with me.—Yours , etc . "
10612	10618	10620	10621	Mr. Bennet	74	" Well , my dear , "
10631	10670	10620	10621	Mr. Bennet	74	" if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness — if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley , and under your orders . "
10671	10725	10620	10621	Mr. Bennet	74	" Oh ! I am not afraid of her dying . People do not die of little trifling colds . She will be taken good care of . As long as she stays there , it is all very well . I would go an see her if I could have the carriage . "
10766	10774	10776	10777	her mother	235	" How can you be so silly , "
10779	10806	10761	10761	She	81	" as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . "
10807	10823	10776	10777	her mother	235	" I shall be very fit to see Jane — which is all I want . "
10824	10834	10836	10837	her father	238	" Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , "
10839	10846	10836	10837	her father	238	" to send for the horses ? "
10847	10882	10776	10777	her mother	235	" No , indeed , I do not wish to avoid the walk . The distance is nothing when one has a motive ; only three miles . I shall be back by dinner . "
10883	10892	10894	10894	Mary	86	" I admire the activity of your benevolence , "
10896	10925	10894	10894	Mary	86	" but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . "
10926	10937	10939	10939	Catherine	85	" We will go as far as Meryton with you , "
10957	10963	10965	10965	Lydia	83	" If we make haste , "
10972	10985	10965	10965	Lydia	83	" perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes . "
11895	11928	11886	11887	Mrs. Hurst	89	" She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . I shall never forget her appearance this morning . She really looked almost wild . "
11929	11976	11886	11887	Mrs. Hurst	89	" She did , indeed , Louisa . I could hardly keep my countenance . Very nonsensical to come at all ! Why must SHE be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? Her hair , so untidy , so blowsy ! "
11977	12018	11886	11887	Mrs. Hurst	89	" Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , I am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office . "
12019	12029	12031	12031	Bingley	90	" Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , "
12033	12067	12031	12031	Bingley	90	" but this was all lost upon me . I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning . Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . "
12068	12080	12082	12083	Miss Bingley	90	" YOU observed it , Mr. Darcy , I am sure , "
12085	12106	12082	12083	Miss Bingley	90	" and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see YOUR sister make such an exhibition . "
12107	12111	11886	11887	Mrs. Hurst	89	" Certainly not . "
12112	12172	12082	12083	Miss Bingley	90	" To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ankles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! What could she mean by it ? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country - town indifference to decorum . "
12173	12186	12188	12188	Bingley	90	" It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , "
12190	12198	12200	12201	Miss Bingley	90	" I am afraid , Mr. Darcy , "
12207	12221	12200	12201	Miss Bingley	90	" that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . "
12222	12227	12228	12228	he	503	" Not at all , "
12231	12239	12228	12228	he	503	" they were brightened by the exercise . "
12253	12307	12248	12249	Mrs. Hurst	89	" I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled . But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . "
12308	12325	12248	12249	Mrs. Hurst	89	" I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on Meryton . "
12326	12340	12248	12249	Mrs. Hurst	89	" Yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . "
12341	12346	12348	12349	her sister	324	" That is capital , "
12357	12368	12370	12370	Bingley	90	" If they had uncles enough to fill ALL Cheapside , "
12372	12383	12370	12370	Bingley	90	" it would not make them one jot less agreeable . "
12384	12403	12405	12405	Darcy	88	" But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , "
12585	12593	12595	12595	he	87	" Do you prefer reading to cards ? "
12597	12603	12595	12595	he	87	" that is rather singular . "
12604	12609	12611	12612	Miss Bingley	90	" Miss Eliza Bennet , "
12614	12632	12611	12612	Miss Bingley	90	" despises cards . She is a great reader , and has no pleasure in anything else . "
12633	12643	12645	12645	Elizabeth	81	" I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , "
12647	12663	12645	12645	Elizabeth	81	" I am NOT a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . "
12664	12676	12678	12678	Bingley	90	" In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , "
12680	12695	12678	12678	Bingley	90	" and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well . "
12730	12769	12716	12716	He	87	" And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever looked into . "
12785	12790	12792	12793	Miss Bingley	90	" I am astonished , "
12795	12821	12792	12793	Miss Bingley	90	" that my father should have left so small a collection of books . What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr. Darcy ! "
12822	12829	12830	12830	he	87	" It ought to be good , "
12833	12843	12830	12830	he	87	" it has been the work of many generations . "
12844	12862	12792	12793	Miss Bingley	90	" And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books . "
12863	12880	12830	12830	he	87	" I can not comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . "
12881	12920	12792	12793	Miss Bingley	90	" Neglect ! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . Charles , when you build YOUR house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . "
12921	12927	12830	12830	he	87	" I wish it may . "
12928	12963	12792	12793	Miss Bingley	90	" But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . "
12964	12981	12830	12830	he	87	" With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it . "
12982	12991	12792	12793	Miss Bingley	90	" I am talking of possibilities , Charles . "
12992	13014	12830	12830	he	87	" Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation . "
13066	13066	13042	13042	she	81	"
13067	13077	13079	13080	Miss Bingley	90	" Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? "
13082	13092	13079	13080	Miss Bingley	90	" will she be as tall as I am ? "
13093	13113	13042	13042	she	81	" I think she will . She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet 's height , or rather taller . "
13114	13157	13079	13080	Miss Bingley	90	" How I long to see her again ! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much . Such a countenance , such manners ! And so extremely accomplished for her age ! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite . "
13158	13165	13167	13167	Bingley	78	" It is amazing to me , "
13169	13186	13167	13167	Bingley	78	" how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are . "
13187	13202	13079	13080	Miss Bingley	90	" All young ladies accomplished ! My dear Charles , what do you mean ? "
13203	13262	13167	13167	Bingley	78	" Yes , all of them , I think . They all paint tables , cover screens , and net purses . I scarcely know anyone who can not do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . "
13263	13273	13275	13275	Darcy	115	" Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , "
13277	13350	13275	13275	Darcy	115	" has too much truth . The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen . But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . I can not boast of knowing more than half - a - dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . "
13351	13359	13361	13362	Miss Bingley	90	" Nor I , I am sure , "
13364	13367	13369	13369	Elizabeth	81	" Then , "
13371	13386	13369	13369	Elizabeth	81	" you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . "
13387	13399	13275	13275	Darcy	115	" Yes , I do comprehend a great deal in it . "
13400	13405	13407	13409	his faithful assistant	519	" Oh ! certainly , "
13411	13496	13407	13409	his faithful assistant	519	" no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with . A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half - deserved . "
13497	13504	13506	13506	Darcy	115	" All this she must possess , "
13508	13531	13506	13506	Darcy	115	" and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . "
13532	13555	13407	13409	his faithful assistant	519	" I am no longer surprised at your knowing ONLY six accomplished women . I rather wonder now at your knowing ANY . "
13556	13573	13506	13506	Darcy	115	" Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this ?
13574	13602	13407	13409	his faithful assistant	519	" I never saw such a woman . I never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe united . "
13669	13673	13675	13676	Miss Bingley	90	" Elizabeth Bennet , "
13686	13736	13675	13676	Miss Bingley	90	" is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it succeeds . But , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art . "
13737	13740	13742	13742	Darcy	115	" Undoubtedly , "
13752	13778	13742	13742	Darcy	115	" there is a meanness in ALL the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation . Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable . "
14210	14217	14219	14219	her	84	" Indeed I have , sir , "
14222	14255	14219	14219	her	84	" She is a great deal too ill to be moved . Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her . We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . "
14256	14259	14261	14261	Bingley	90	" Removed ! "
14263	14285	14261	14261	Bingley	90	" It must not be thought of . My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . "
14286	14295	14297	14298	Miss Bingley	90	" You may depend upon it , Madam , "
14304	14319	14297	14298	Miss Bingley	90	" that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us . "
14328	14333	14334	14334	she	84	" I am sure , "
14337	14470	14334	14334	she	84	" if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper I have ever met with . I often tell my other girls they are nothing to HER . You have a sweet room here , Mr. Bingley , and a charming prospect over the gravel walk . I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . You will not think of quitting it in a hurry , I hope , though you have but a short lease . "
14471	14481	14483	14483	he	549	" Whatever I do is done in a hurry , "
14485	14518	14483	14483	he	549	" and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes . At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . "
14519	14531	14533	14533	Elizabeth	81	" That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , "
14535	14545	14547	14547	he	549	" You begin to comprehend me , do you ? "
14553	14563	14483	14483	he	549	" Oh ! yes — I understand you perfectly . "
14564	14588	14483	14483	he	549	" I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful . "
14589	14618	14483	14483	he	549	" That is as it happens . It does not follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . "
14619	14622	14483	14483	he	549	" Lizzy , "
14627	14651	14483	14483	he	549	" remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . "
14652	14659	14661	14661	Bingley	78	" I did not know before , "
14664	14680	14661	14661	Bingley	78	" that your were a studier of character . It must be an amusing study . "
14681	14699	14483	14483	he	549	" Yes , but intricate characters are the MOST amusing . They have at least that advantage . "
14700	14704	14706	14706	Darcy	115	" The country , "
14708	14736	14706	14706	Darcy	115	" can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study . In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society . "
14737	14758	14483	14483	he	549	" But people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . "
14759	14764	14766	14767	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Yes , indeed , "
14779	14799	14766	14767	Mrs. Bennet	84	" I assure you there is quite as much of THAT going on in the country as in town . "
14837	14878	14834	14834	her	84	" I can not see that London has any great advantage over the country , for my part , except the shops and public places . The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is it not , Mr. Bingley ? "
14879	14887	14888	14888	he	78	" When I am in the country , "
14891	14927	14888	14888	he	78	" I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same . They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . "
14928	14944	14834	14834	her	84	" Aye — that is because you have the right disposition . But that gentleman , "
14949	14960	14834	14834	her	84	" seemed to think the country was nothing at all . "
14961	14970	14972	14972	Elizabeth	81	" Indeed , Mamma , you are mistaken , "
14979	15018	14972	14972	Elizabeth	81	" You quite mistook Mr. Darcy . He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town , which you must acknowledge to be true . "
15019	15062	14976	14977	her mother	235	" Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger . I know we dine with four - and - twenty families . "
15126	15200	15095	15095	Elizabeth	81	" Yes , she called yesterday with her father . What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr. Bingley , is not he ? So much the man of fashion ! So genteel and easy ! He had always something to say to everybody . THAT is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important , and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter . "
15201	15208	15095	15095	Elizabeth	81	" Did Charlotte dine with you ? "
15209	15303	15095	15095	Elizabeth	81	" No , she would go home . I fancy she was wanted about the mince - pies . For my part , Mr. Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ; MY daughters are brought up very differently . But everybody is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls , I assure you . It is a pity they are not handsome ! Not that I think Charlotte so VERY plain — but then she is our particular friend . "
15304	15313	15095	15095	Elizabeth	81	" She seems a very pleasant young woman . "
15314	15459	15095	15095	Elizabeth	81	" Oh ! dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain . Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane 's beauty . I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane — one does not often see anybody better looking . It is what everybody says . I do not trust my own partiality . When she was only fifteen , there was a man at my brother Gardiner 's in town so much in love with her that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . But , however , he did not . Perhaps he thought her too young . However , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were . "
15460	15467	15469	15469	Elizabeth	81	" And so ended his affection , "
15472	15503	15469	15469	Elizabeth	81	" There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way . I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! "
15504	15518	15520	15520	Darcy	115	" I have been used to consider poetry as the FOOD of love , "
15522	15567	15469	15469	Elizabeth	81	" Of a fine , stout , healthy love it may . Everything nourishes what is strong already . But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . "
15882	15932	15868	15868	His	78	" I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall , if you please , name the very day of the ball . But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill . "
15938	15977	15978	15978	she	83	" Oh ! yes — it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . And when you have given YOUR ball , "
15981	16007	15978	15978	she	83	" I shall insist on their giving one also . I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . "
16260	16273	16274	16274	He	88	" How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! "
16279	16285	16421	16421	He	580	" You write uncommonly fast . "
16286	16296	16421	16421	He	580	" You are mistaken . I write rather slowly . "
16297	16327	16421	16421	He	580	" How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year ! Letters of business , too ! How odious I should think them ! "
16328	16345	16421	16421	He	580	" It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of yours . "
16346	16358	16421	16421	He	580	" Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . "
16359	16372	16421	16421	He	580	" I have already told her so once , by your desire . "
16373	16397	16421	16421	He	580	" I am afraid you do not like your pen . Let me mend it for you . I mend pens remarkably well . "
16398	16409	16421	16421	He	580	" Thank you — but I always mend my own . "
16410	16420	16421	16421	He	580	" How can you contrive to write so even ? "
16425	16472	16421	16421	He	580	" Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp ; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley 's . "
16473	16499	16421	16421	He	580	" Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? At present I have not room to do them justice . "
16500	16531	16421	16421	He	580	" Oh ! it is of no consequence . I shall see her in January . But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr. Darcy ? "
16532	16550	16421	16421	He	580	" They are generally long ; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine . "
16551	16576	16421	16421	He	580	" It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter with ease , can not write ill . "
16577	16590	16421	16421	He	580	" That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , "
16595	16620	16421	16421	He	580	" because he does NOT write with ease . He studies too much for words of four syllables . Do not you , Darcy ? "
16621	16632	16421	16421	He	580	" My style of writing is very different from yours . "
16633	16636	16638	16639	Miss Bingley	90	" Oh ! "
16641	16663	16638	16639	Miss Bingley	90	" Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable . He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . "
16664	16694	16421	16421	He	580	" My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them — by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents . "
16695	16702	16704	16704	Elizabeth	81	" Your humility , Mr. Bingley , "
16706	16711	16704	16704	Elizabeth	81	" must disarm reproof . "
16712	16718	16720	16720	Darcy	88	" Nothing is more deceitful , "
16722	16743	16720	16720	Darcy	88	" than the appearance of humility . It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . "
16744	16760	16421	16421	He	580	" And which of the two do you call MY little recent piece of modesty ? "
16761	16903	16720	16720	Darcy	88	" The indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which , if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting . The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance . When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself — and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else ? "
16904	16907	16909	16909	Bingley	78	" Nay , "
16911	16980	16720	16720	Darcy	88	" this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . And yet , upon my honour , I believe what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies . "
16981	17072	16720	16720	Darcy	88	" I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity . Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , ' Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go — and at another word , might stay a month . "
17073	17081	17083	17083	Elizabeth	81	" You have only proved by this , "
17085	17111	17083	17083	Elizabeth	81	" that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition . You have shown him off now much more than he did himself . "
17112	17118	17120	17120	Bingley	78	" I am exceedingly gratified , "
17122	17190	17120	17120	Bingley	78	" by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I could . "
17191	17214	16720	16720	Darcy	88	" Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? "
17215	17234	16720	16720	Darcy	88	" Upon my word , I can not exactly explain the matter ; Darcy must speak for himself . "
17235	17315	16720	16720	Darcy	88	" You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged . Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . "
17316	17335	16720	16720	Darcy	88	" To yield readily — easily — to the PERSUASION of a friend is no merit with you . "
17336	17350	16720	16720	Darcy	88	" To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . "
17351	17486	16720	16720	Darcy	88	" You appear to me , Mr. Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley . We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? "
17487	17531	16720	16720	Darcy	88	" Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? "
17532	17537	17539	17539	Bingley	78	" By all means , "
17541	17648	17539	17539	Bingley	78	" let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . I assure you , that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening , when he has nothing to do . "
17692	17700	17702	17703	his friend	283	" I see your design , Bingley , "
17705	17717	17702	17703	his friend	283	" You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . "
17718	17763	17792	17793	Mr. Darcy	88	" Perhaps I do . Arguments are too much like disputes . If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . "
17764	17769	17771	17771	Elizabeth	81	" What you ask , "
17773	17791	17771	17771	Elizabeth	81	" is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter . "
18029	18051	18018	18019	Mr. Darcy	88	" Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? "
18072	18075	18077	18077	she	81	" Oh ! "
18079	18174	18077	18077	she	81	" I heard you before , but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . You wanted me , I know , to say ' Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt . I have , therefore , made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all — and now despise me if you dare . "
18175	18182	18208	18208	her	81	" Indeed I do not dare . "
18320	18324	18326	18326	she	90	" I hope , "
18340	18416	18326	18326	she	90	" you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , do sure the younger girls of running after officers . And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . "
18417	18429	18326	18326	she	90	" Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity ? "
18430	18504	18326	18326	she	90	" Oh ! yes . Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley . Put them next to your great - uncle the judge . They are in the same profession , you know , only in different lines . As for your Elizabeth 's picture , you must not have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? "
18505	18537	18326	18326	she	90	" It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eyelashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied . "
18554	18565	18567	18568	Miss Bingley	90	" I did not know that you intended to walk , "
18580	18587	18589	18590	Mrs. Hurst	89	" You used us abominably ill , "
18592	18604	18589	18590	Mrs. Hurst	89	" running away without telling us that you were coming out . "
18638	18657	18628	18629	Mr. Darcy	88	" This walk is not wide enough for our party . We had better go into the avenue . "
18675	18710	18659	18659	Elizabeth	81	" No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly grouped , and appear to uncommon advantage . The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth . Good - bye . "
18915	18919	18913	18913	he	88	" very glad ; "
19249	19306	19241	19241	she	90	" How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book ! When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . "
19355	19417	19347	19347	she	90	" By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . "
19418	19424	19426	19427	her brother	3092	" If you mean Darcy , "
19429	19475	19347	19347	she	90	" he may go to bed , if he chooses , before it begins — but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough , I shall send round my cards . "
19476	19484	19485	19485	she	90	" I should like balls infinitely better , "
19488	19534	19485	19485	she	90	" if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting . It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day . "
19535	19560	19347	19347	she	90	" Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . "
19626	19663	19611	19611	she	90	" Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . "
19762	19777	19781	19781	she	81	" What could he mean ? She was dying to know what could be his meaning?"—and
19788	19793	19795	19795	her	81	" Not at all , "
19798	19827	19795	19795	her	81	" but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it . "
19854	19865	19867	19867	he	88	" I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , "
19878	19950	19867	19867	he	88	" You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other 's confidence , and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , I would be completely in your way , and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . "
19951	19956	19958	19959	Miss Bingley	90	" Oh ! shocking ! "
19961	19979	19958	19959	Miss Bingley	90	" I never heard anything so abominable . How shall we punish him for such a speech ? "
19980	19992	19994	19994	Elizabeth	81	" Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , "
19996	20028	19994	19994	Elizabeth	81	" We can all plague and punish one another . Tease him — laugh at him . Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done . "
20029	20102	19958	19959	Miss Bingley	90	" But upon my honour , I do NOT . I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me THAT . Tease calmness of manner and presence of mind ! No , no — feel he may defy us there . And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . Mr. Darcy may hug himself . "
20103	20113	20115	20115	Elizabeth	81	" Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at ! "
20117	20153	20115	20115	Elizabeth	81	" That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to ME to have many such acquaintances . I dearly love a laugh . "
20154	20158	20160	20160	he	619	" Miss Bingley , "
20162	20206	20160	20160	he	619	" has given me more credit than can be . The wisest and the best of men — nay , the wisest and best of their actions — may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . "
20207	20210	19958	19959	Miss Bingley	90	" Certainly , "
20212	20275	20160	20160	he	619	Elizabeth—"there are such people , but I hope I am not one of THEM . I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good . Follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies , DO divert me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are precisely what you are without . "
20276	20307	19958	19959	Miss Bingley	90	" Perhaps that is not possible for anyone . But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . "
20308	20315	20160	20160	he	619	" Such as vanity and pride . "
20316	20345	19958	19959	Miss Bingley	90	" Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . But pride — where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation . "
20354	20366	20368	20369	Miss Bingley	90	" Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over , I presume , "
20371	20379	20368	20369	Miss Bingley	90	" and pray what is the result ? "
20380	20401	20160	20160	he	619	" I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect . He owns it himself without disguise . "
20402	20405	20407	20407	Darcy	88	" No , "
20409	20514	20407	20407	Darcy	88	" I have made no such pretension . I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding . My temper I dare not vouch for . It is , I believe , too little yielding — certainly too little for the convenience of the world . I can not forget the follies and vices of other so soon as I ought , nor their offenses against myself . My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them . My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost , is lost forever . "
20515	20522	20524	20524	Elizabeth	81	" THAT is a failing indeed ! "
20526	20558	20524	20524	Elizabeth	81	" Implacable resentment IS a shade in a character . But you have chosen your fault well . I really can not LAUGH at it . You are safe from me . "
20559	20589	20407	20407	Darcy	88	" There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil — a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . "
20590	20599	20524	20524	Elizabeth	81	" And YOUR defect is to hate everybody . "
20600	20604	20605	20605	he	620	" And yours , "
20611	20618	20605	20605	he	620	" is willfully to misunderstand them . "
20619	20628	20630	20631	Miss Bingley	90	" Do let us have a little music , "
20644	20656	20630	20631	Miss Bingley	90	" Louisa , you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst ? "
21466	21473	21475	21476	Mr. Bennet	74	" I hope , my dear , "
21490	21515	21475	21476	Mr. Bennet	74	" that you have ordered a good dinner to - day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . "
21516	21568	21585	21586	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Who do you mean , my dear ? I know of nobody that is coming , I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in — and I hope MY dinners are good enough for her . I do not believe she often sees such at home . "
21569	21584	21475	21476	Mr. Bennet	74	" The person of whom I speak is a gentleman , and a stranger . "
21591	21661	21585	21586	Mrs. Bennet	84	" A gentleman and a stranger ! It is Mr. Bingley , I am sure ! Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley . But — good Lord ! how unlucky ! There is not a bit of fish to be got to - day . Lydia , my love , ring the bell — I must speak to Hill this moment . "
21662	21669	21671	21672	her husband	254	" It is NOT Mr. Bingley , "
21674	21691	21671	21672	her husband	254	" it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . "
21730	21794	21726	21726	he	254	" About a month ago I received this letter ; and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . It is from my cousin , Mr. Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . "
21795	21801	21803	21804	his wife	225	" Oh ! my dear , "
21806	21874	21803	21804	his wife	225	" I can not bear to hear that mentioned . Pray do not talk of that odious man . I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure , if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . "
21946	21955	21957	21958	Mr. Bennet	74	" It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , "
21960	21997	21957	21958	Mr. Bennet	74	" and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . "
21998	22052	21915	21915	she	84	" No , that I am sure I shall not ; and I think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . I hate such false friends . Why could he not keep on quarreling with you , as his father did before him ? "
22053	22076	21957	21958	Mr. Bennet	74	" Why , indeed ; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . "
22077	22087	21915	21915	she	84	" Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , 15th October .
22088	22092	21957	21958	Mr. Bennet	74	" Dear Sir , —
22093	22505	21915	21915	she	84	" The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to heal the breach ; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.—'There , Mrs. Bennet . '—My mind , however , is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England . As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within in the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive - branch . I can not be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends — but of this hereafter . If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November 18th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.—I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well - wisher and friend ,
22506	22509	22532	22532	he	74	" WILLIAM COLLINS "
22510	22526	22532	22532	he	74	" At four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace - making gentleman , "
22538	22582	22532	22532	he	74	" He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word , and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . "
22583	22619	22532	22532	he	74	" There is some sense in what he says about the girls , however , and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . "
22620	22626	22628	22628	Jane	153	" Though it is difficult , "
22630	22657	22628	22628	Jane	153	" to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . "
22688	22698	22700	22700	she	81	" He must be an oddity , I think , "
22702	22746	22700	22700	she	81	" I can not make him out.—There is something very pompous in his style.—And what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?—We can not suppose he would help it if he could.—Could he be a sensible man , sir ? "
22747	22793	22802	22802	Mary	86	" No , my dear , I think not . I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse . There is a mixture of servility and self - importance in his letter , which promises well . I am impatient to see him . "
22794	22800	22802	22802	Mary	86	" In point of composition , "
22804	22833	22802	22802	Mary	86	" the letter does not seem defective . The idea of the olive - branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . "
23098	23134	23085	23086	Mrs. Bennet	84	" You are very kind , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so , for else they will be destitute enough . Things are settled so oddly . "
23135	23148	23085	23086	Mrs. Bennet	84	" You allude , perhaps , to the entail of this estate . "
23149	23210	23085	23086	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Ah ! sir , I do indeed . It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . Not that I mean to find fault with YOU , for such things I know are all chance in this world . There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . "
23211	23279	23085	23086	Mrs. Bennet	84	" I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them . At present I will not say more ; but , perhaps , when we are better acquainted — "
23568	23785	23565	23565	he	674	" he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank — such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine . She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening . Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but HE had never seen anything but affability in her . She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations . She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage , where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself — some shelves in the closet upstairs . "
23786	23799	23801	23802	Mrs. Bennet	84	" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , "
23804	23839	23801	23802	Mrs. Bennet	84	" and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . Does she live near you , sir ? "
23840	23864	23544	23544	her	85	" The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship 's residence . "
23865	23882	23801	23802	Mrs. Bennet	84	" I think you said she was a widow , sir ? Has she any family ? "
23883	23901	23544	23544	her	85	" She has only one daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and of very extensive property . "
23902	23905	23911	23911	her	84	" Ah ! "
23914	23937	23911	23911	her	84	" then she is better off than many girls . And what sort of young lady is she ? Is she handsome ? "
23938	24058	23544	23544	her	85	" She is a most charming young lady indeed . Lady Catherine herself says that , in point of true beauty , Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex , because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth . She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of , as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them . But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . "
24059	24077	23911	23911	her	84	" Has she been presented ? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . "
24078	24214	23544	23544	her	85	" Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine one day , has deprived the British court of its brightest ornaments . Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea ; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . "
24215	24221	24223	24224	Mr. Bennet	74	" You judge very properly , "
24226	24266	24223	24224	Mr. Bennet	74	" and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? "
24267	24314	24315	24316	Mr. Bennet	74	" They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible . "
24514	24576	24509	24509	she	83	" Do you know , mamma , that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard ; and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him . My aunt told me so herself on Saturday . I shall walk to Meryton to - morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town . "
24605	24662	24591	24592	Mr. Collins	124	" I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit . It amazes me , I confess ; for , certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . But I will no longer importune my young cousin . "
25191	25248	25170	25170	her	83	" As to her YOUNGER daughters , she could not take upon her to say — she could not positively answer — but she did not KNOW of any prepossession ; her ELDEST daughter , she must just mention — she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . "
26446	26452	26455	26455	them	770	" stupid , disagreeable fellows . "
27350	27360	27362	27362	he	132	" I know little of the game at present , "
27364	27381	27362	27362	he	132	" but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation in life — "
27586	27591	27593	27593	Elizabeth	81	" About a month , "
27607	27622	27593	27593	Elizabeth	81	" He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . "
27623	27626	27628	27629	Mr. Wickham	132	" Yes , "
27631	27684	27628	27629	Mr. Wickham	132	" his estate there is a noble one . A clear ten thousand per annum . You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself , for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . "
27692	27732	27685	27685	Elizabeth	81	" You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy ? "
27733	27743	27745	27745	Elizabeth	81	" As much as I ever wish to be , "
27749	27769	27745	27745	Elizabeth	81	" I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . "
27770	27780	27782	27782	Wickham	132	" I have no right to give MY opinion , "
27784	27858	27782	27782	Wickham	132	" as to his being agreeable or otherwise . I am not qualified to form one . I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . It is impossible for ME to be impartial . But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish — and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . Here you are in your own family . "
27859	27911	27745	27745	Elizabeth	81	" Upon my word , I say no more HERE than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield . He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire . Everybody is disgusted with his pride . You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone . "
27912	27921	27923	27923	Wickham	132	" I can not pretend to be sorry , "
27930	27986	27923	27923	Wickham	132	" that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with HIM I believe it does not often happen . The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chooses to be seen . "
27987	28007	28008	28008	Wickham	132	" I should take him , even on MY slight acquaintance , to be an ill - tempered man . "
28014	28018	28020	28020	he	132	" I wonder , "
28029	28042	28020	28020	he	132	" whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . "
28043	28087	28008	28008	Wickham	132	" I do not at all know ; but I HEARD nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield . I hope your plans in favour of the — — shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . "
28088	28259	28020	28020	he	132	" Oh ! no — it is not for ME to be driven away by Mr. Darcy . If HE wishes to avoid seeing ME , he must go . We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding HIM but what I might proclaim before all the world , a sense of very great ill - usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr. Darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . "
28326	28339	28340	28340	he	132	" It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , "
28343	28492	28340	28340	he	132	" which was my chief inducement to enter the — — shire . I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them . Society , I own , is necessary to me . I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . I MUST have employment and society . A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . The church OUGHT to have been my profession — I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . "
28493	28496	28824	28824	Elizabeth	81	" Indeed ! "
28497	28563	28340	28340	he	132	" Yes — the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift . He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me . I can not do justice to his kindness . He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . "
28564	28568	28570	28570	Elizabeth	81	" Good heavens ! "
28572	28594	28570	28570	Elizabeth	81	" but how could THAT be ? How could his will be disregarded ? Why did you not seek legal redress ? "
28595	28776	28340	28340	he	132	" There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law . A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it — or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence — in short anything or nothing . Certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I can not accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it . I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may have spoken my opinion OF him , and TO him , too freely . I can recall nothing worse . But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . "
28777	28790	28570	28570	Elizabeth	81	" This is quite shocking ! He deserves to be publicly disgraced . "
28791	28823	28340	28340	he	132	" Some time or other he WILL be — but it shall not be by ME . Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose HIM . "
28842	28846	28848	28848	she	81	" But what , "
28854	28871	28848	28848	she	81	" can have been his motive ? What can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? "
28872	28958	28570	28570	Elizabeth	81	" A thorough , determined dislike of me — a dislike which I can not but attribute in some measure to jealousy . Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father 's uncommon attachment to me irritated him , I believe , very early in life . He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood — the sort of preference which was often given me . "
28959	29022	28848	28848	she	81	" I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this — though I have never liked him . I had not thought so very ill of him . I had supposed him to be despising his fellow - creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this . "
29035	29067	29032	29032	she	830	" I DO remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper . His disposition must be dreadful . "
29068	29078	29080	29080	Wickham	132	" I will not trust myself on the subject , "
29082	29091	29080	29080	Wickham	132	" I can hardly be just to him . "
29105	29124	29125	29125	She	830	" To treat in such a manner the godson , the friend , the favourite of his father ! "
29130	29148	29149	29149	she	830	" A young man , too , like YOU , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"—but
29154	29183	29125	29125	She	830	" and one , too , who had probably been his companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner ! "
29184	29356	29420	29420	Wickham	132	" We were born in the same parish , within the same park ; the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care . MY father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr. Phillips , appears to do so much credit to — but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property . He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend . Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father 's active superintendence , and when , immediately before my father 's death , Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to HIM , as of his affection to myself . "
29357	29361	29363	29363	Elizabeth	81	" How strange ! "
29365	29412	29363	29363	Elizabeth	81	" How abominable ! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you ! If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest — for dishonesty I must call it . "
29413	29418	29420	29420	Wickham	132	" It IS wonderful , "
29422	29478	29420	29420	Wickham	132	" for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride had often been his best friend . It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling . But we are none of us consistent , and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride . "
29479	29492	29363	29363	Elizabeth	81	" Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good ? "
29493	29620	29420	29420	Wickham	132	" Yes . It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . Family pride , and FILIAL pride — for he is very proud of what his father was — have done this . Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive . He has also BROTHERLY pride , which , with SOME brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister , and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . "
29621	29630	29363	29363	Elizabeth	81	" What sort of girl is Miss Darcy ? "
29636	29748	29633	29633	his	831	" I wish I could call her amiable . It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy . But she is too much like her brother — very , very proud . As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . But she is nothing to me now . She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and , I understand , highly accomplished . Since her father 's death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education . "
29773	29826	29759	29759	Elizabeth	81	" I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley ! How can Mr. Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? How can they suit each other ? Do you know Mr. Bingley ? "
29827	29832	29951	29953	The whist party	832	" Not at all . "
29833	29855	29759	29759	Elizabeth	81	" He is a sweet - tempered , amiable , charming man . He can not know what Mr. Darcy is . "
29856	29950	29951	29953	The whist party	832	" Probably not ; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses . He does not want abilities . He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while . Among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich he is liberal - minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable — allowing something for fortune and figure . "
30053	30061	30063	30063	he	124	" I know very well , madam , "
30065	30133	30063	30063	he	124	" that when persons sit down to a card - table , they must take their chances of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object . There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . "
30172	30178	30179	30179	she	81	" Lady Catherine de Bourgh , "
30182	30213	30179	30179	she	81	" has very lately given him a living . I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . "
30214	30242	30151	30151	he	124	" You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy . "
30243	30275	30179	30179	she	81	" No , indeed , I did not . I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine 's connections . I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . "
30276	30306	30338	30338	her	90	" Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . "
30353	30357	30359	30359	she	81	" Mr. Collins , "
30361	30409	30359	30359	she	81	" speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . "
30410	30422	30424	30424	Wickham	132	" I believe her to be both in a great degree , "
30426	30515	30424	30424	Wickham	132	" I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent . She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride for her nephew , who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . "
30862	30867	30869	30869	she	153	" They have both , "
30871	30931	30869	30869	she	153	" been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other . It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side . "
30932	30982	30869	30869	she	153	" Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear THEM too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . "
30983	31083	30869	30869	she	153	" Laugh as much as you choose , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy , to be treating his father 's favourite in such a manner , one whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible . No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? Oh ! no . "
31084	31146	30869	30869	she	153	" I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley 's being imposed on , than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , everything mentioned without ceremony . If it be not so , let Mr. Darcy contradict it . Besides , there was truth in his looks . "
31147	31165	30869	30869	she	153	" It is difficult indeed — it is distressing . One does not know what to think . "
31166	31179	30869	30869	she	153	" I beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . "
31550	31560	31562	31562	she	86	" While I can have my mornings to myself , "
31564	31608	31562	31562	she	86	" it is enough — I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . Society has claims on us all ; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody . "
31707	31721	31723	31723	he	124	" I am by no means of the opinion , I assure you , "
31725	31826	31723	31723	he	124	" that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself , that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening ; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . "
32405	32432	32436	32436	his	132	" I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here . "
32814	32825	32808	32808	Charlotte	99	" I dare say you will find him very agreeable . "
32826	32859	32808	32808	Charlotte	99	" Heaven forbid ! THAT would be the greatest misfortune of all ! To find a man agreeable whom on is determined to hate ! Do not wish me such an evil . "
33045	33085	33039	33039	she	81	with:—"It is YOUR turn to say something now , Mr. Darcy . I talked about the dance , and YOU ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . "
33103	33139	33039	33039	she	81	" Very well . That reply will do for the present . Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones . But NOW we may be silent . "
33140	33154	33039	33039	she	81	" Do you talk by rule , then , while you are dancing ? "
33155	33210	33039	33039	she	81	" Sometimes . One must speak a little , you know . It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together ; and yet for the advantage of SOME , conversation ought to be so arranged , as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . "
33211	33233	33039	33039	she	81	" Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? "
33234	33237	33239	33239	Elizabeth	81	" Both , "
33242	33299	33239	33239	Elizabeth	81	" for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . We are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb . "
33300	33316	33318	33318	he	889	" This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , "
33320	33344	33318	33318	he	889	" How near it may be to MINE , I can not pretend to say . YOU think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly . "
33345	33355	33375	33375	he	889	" I must not decide on my own performance . "
33407	33426	33391	33391	She	81	" When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . "
33476	33506	33466	33466	Darcy	88	" Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his MAKING friends — whether he may be equally capable of RETAINING them , is less certain . "
33507	33519	33521	33521	Elizabeth	81	" He has been so unlucky as to lose YOUR friendship , "
33525	33541	33521	33521	Elizabeth	81	" and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . "
33605	33733	33587	33587	he	79	" I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir . Such very superior dancing is not often seen . It is evident that you belong to the first circles . Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Eliza ( glancing at her sister and Bingley ) shall take place . What congratulations will then flow in ! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you , sir . You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . "
33796	33811	33787	33787	he	79	" Sir William 's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . "
33812	33866	33787	33787	he	79	" I do not think we were speaking at all . Sir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I can not imagine . "
33867	33874	33876	33876	he	79	" What think you of books ? "
33880	33903	33787	33787	he	79	" Books — oh ! no . I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . "
33904	33936	33787	33787	he	79	" I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . We may compare our different opinions . "
33937	33961	33787	33787	he	79	" No — I can not talk of books in a ball - room ; my head is always full of something else . "
33962	33975	33977	33977	he	79	" The PRESENT always occupies you in such scenes — does it ? "
33985	33990	33991	33991	she	897	" Yes , always , "
34019	34058	34015	34015	her	897	" I remember hearing you once say , Mr. Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that you resentment once created was unappeasable . You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its BEING CREATED . "
34059	34063	34065	34065	he	79	" I am , "
34072	34083	34015	34015	her	897	" And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? "
34084	34089	34015	34015	her	897	" I hope not . "
34090	34111	34015	34015	her	897	" It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first .
34112	34122	34015	34015	her	897	" May I ask to what these questions tend ? "
34123	34132	34134	34134	she	897	" Merely to the illustration of YOUR character , "
34143	34152	34134	34134	she	897	" I am trying to make it out . "
34153	34160	34015	34015	her	897	" And what is your success ? "
34166	34187	34161	34161	She	897	" I do not get on at all . I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . "
34188	34194	34196	34196	he	79	" I can readily believe , "
34199	34247	34196	34196	he	79	" that reports may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . "
34248	34266	34161	34161	She	897	" But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . "
34267	34279	34280	34280	he	79	" I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , "
34365	34623	34349	34350	Miss Bingley	90	" So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ! Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you , among his other communication , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr. Darcy 's steward . Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to Mr. Darcy 's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has always been remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner . I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he can not bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite 's guilt ; but really , considering his descent , one could not expect much better . "
34624	34639	34641	34641	Elizabeth	81	" His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , "
34644	34680	34641	34641	Elizabeth	81	" for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy 's steward , and of THAT , I can assure you , he informed me himself . "
34681	34687	34689	34690	Miss Bingley	90	" I beg your pardon , "
34698	34708	34689	34690	Miss Bingley	90	" Excuse my interference — it was kindly meant . "
34709	34713	34717	34717	herself	81	" Insolent girl ! "
34719	34755	34717	34717	herself	81	" You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy . "
34848	34854	34856	34856	she	153	" I want to know , "
34869	34904	34856	34856	she	153	" what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham . But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . "
34905	34908	34910	34910	Jane	153	" No , "
34912	35037	34910	34910	Jane	153	" I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you . Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity , and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister 's , Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy 's regard . "
35038	35048	34856	34856	she	153	" Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself ? "
35049	35063	34910	34910	Jane	153	" No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . "
35064	35090	34856	34856	she	153	" This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy . I am satisfied . But what does he say of the living ? "
35091	35124	34910	34910	Jane	153	" He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him CONDITIONALLY only . "
35125	35137	35139	35139	Elizabeth	81	" I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley 's sincerity , "
35142	35208	35139	35139	Elizabeth	81	" but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . Mr. Bingley 's defense of his friend was a very able one , I dare say ; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before . "
35324	35330	35332	35332	he	124	" I have found out , "
35334	35470	35332	35332	he	124	" by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness . I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine . How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! Who would have thought of my meeting with , perhaps , a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly ! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . "
35471	35483	35542	35542	him	904	" You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy ! "
35484	35529	35332	35332	he	124	" Indeed I am . I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . I believe him to be Lady Catherine 's NEPHEW . It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight . "
35631	35811	35817	35817	he	906	" My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding ; but permit me to say , that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for , give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom — provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty . Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . "
35883	35886	35879	35879	his	906	" apology , "
35887	35890	35879	35879	his	906	" Hunsford , "
35892	35898	35879	35879	his	906	" Lady Catherine de Bourgh . "
35995	36005	36007	36007	he	124	" I have no reason , I assure you , "
36009	36084	36007	36007	he	124	" to be dissatisfied with my reception . Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine 's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . It was really a very handsome thought . Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . "
36563	36605	36554	36555	Her mother	235	" What is Mr. Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing HE may not like to hear . "
36606	36641	36686	36687	Mr. Darcy	88	" For heaven 's sake , madam , speak lower . What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy ? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing ! "
37063	37089	37053	37053	Mary	86	" That will do extremely well , child . You have delighted us long enough . Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . "
37135	37139	37141	37142	Mr. Collins	124	" If I , "
37144	37373	37141	37142	Mr. Collins	124	" were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . I do not mean , however , to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tithes as a may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron . He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as a comfortable as possible . And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manner towards everybody , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . I can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family . "
38026	38034	38013	38013	Lydia	83	" Lord , how tired I am ! "
38365	38400	38357	38357	he	124	" May I hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? "
38418	38451	38413	38414	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Oh dear!—yes — certainly . I am sure Lizzy will be very happy — I am sure she can have no objection . Come , Kitty , I want you upstairs . "
38469	38510	38465	38465	Elizabeth	81	" Dear madam , do not go . I beg you will not go . Mr. Collins must excuse me . He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear . I am going away myself . "
38511	38529	38547	38547	she	81	" No , no , nonsense , Lizzy . I desire you to stay where you are . "
38550	38563	38547	38547	she	81	" Lizzy , I INSIST upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins . "
38639	38803	38635	38636	Mr. Collins	124	" Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections . You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there NOT been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you , that I have your respected mother 's permission for this address . You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . Almost as soon as I entered the house , I singled you out as the companion of my future life . But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying — and , moreover , for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did . "
38852	39427	38849	38849	he	124	" My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly — which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! ) on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford — between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh 's footstool , that she said , ' Mr. Collins , you must marry . A clergyman like you must marry . Choose properly , choose a gentlewoman for MY sake ; and for your OWN , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . This is my advice . Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity , I think , must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite . Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I can assure you there are many amiable young women . But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father ( who , however , may live many years longer ) , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place — which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years . This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . And now nothing remains but for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents , which will not be yours till after your mother 's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . "
39437	39445	39446	39446	she	978	" You are too hasty , sir , "
39449	39505	39446	39446	she	978	" You forget that I have made no answer . Let me do it without further loss of time . Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them . "
39506	39514	39516	39517	Mr. Collins	124	" I am not now to learn , "
39527	39599	39516	39517	Mr. Collins	124	" that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second , or even a third time . I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . "
39600	39607	39609	39609	Elizabeth	81	" Upon my word , sir , "
39611	39724	39609	39609	Elizabeth	81	" your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration . I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . I am perfectly serious in my refusal . You could not make ME happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so . Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . "
39725	39736	39738	39739	Mr. Collins	124	" Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , "
39741	39790	39738	39739	Mr. Collins	124	gravely—"but I can not imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you . And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again , I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualification . "
39791	39902	39906	39906	she	979	" Indeed , Mr. Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say . I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing you hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self - reproach . This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . "
39925	40016	39918	39919	Mr. Collins	124	" When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . "
40017	40023	40025	40025	Elizabeth	81	" Really , Mr. Collins , "
40030	40073	40025	40025	Elizabeth	81	" you puzzle me exceedingly . If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one . "
40074	40263	39918	39919	Mr. Collins	124	" You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course . My reasons for believing it are briefly these : It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable . My situation in life , my connections with the family of de Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into further consideration , that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . "
40264	40369	40025	40025	Elizabeth	81	" I do assure you , sir , that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man . I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . My feelings in every respect forbid it . Can I speak plainer ? Do not consider me now as an elegant female , intending to plague you , but as a rational creature , speaking the truth from her heart . "
40370	40376	40378	40378	he	981	" You are uniformly charming ! "
40387	40414	40378	40378	he	981	" and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . "
40674	40684	40685	40685	she	84	" But , depend upon it , Mr. Collins , "
40688	40730	40685	40685	she	84	" that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . I will speak to her about it directly . She is a very headstrong , foolish girl , and does not know her own interest but I will MAKE her know it . "
40731	40740	40742	40743	Mr. Collins	124	" Pardon me for interrupting you , madam , "
40745	40824	40742	40743	Mr. Collins	124	" but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . "
40825	40833	40835	40836	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Sir , you quite misunderstand me , "
40840	40888	40835	40836	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . In everything else she is as good - natured a girl as ever lived . I will go directly to Mr. Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . "
40913	40967	40908	40908	she	84	" Oh ! Mr. Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar . You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have HER . "
41001	41011	41013	41013	he	74	" I have not the pleasure of understanding you , "
41022	41029	41013	41013	he	74	" Of what are you talking ? "
41030	41059	41111	41112	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy . Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins , and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . "
41060	41077	41013	41013	he	74	" And what am I to do on the occasion ? It seems an hopeless business . "
41078	41096	41111	41112	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Speak to Lizzy about it yourself . Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . "
41097	41110	41013	41013	he	74	" Let her be called down . She shall hear my opinion . "
41126	41132	41137	41137	she	81	" Come here , child , "
41140	41169	41170	41170	Elizabeth	81	" I have sent for you on an affair of importance . I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage . Is it true ? "
41176	41189	41170	41170	Elizabeth	81	" Very well — and this offer of marriage you have refused ? "
41190	41196	41111	41112	Mrs. Bennet	84	" I have , sir . "
41197	41224	41170	41170	Elizabeth	81	" Very well . We now come to the point . Your mother insists upon your accepting it . Is it not so , Mrs. Bennet ? "
41225	41236	41111	41112	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Yes , or I will never see her again . "
41237	41287	41170	41170	Elizabeth	81	" An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . Your mother will never see you again if you do NOT marry Mr. Collins , and I will never see you again if you DO . "
41324	41348	41303	41304	Mrs. Bennet	84	" What do you mean , Mr. Bennet , in talking this way ? You promised me to INSIST upon her marrying him . "
41349	41353	41355	41356	her husband	254	" My dear , "
41358	41408	41355	41356	her husband	254	" I have two small favours to request . First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room . I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . "
41605	41645	41591	41591	Lydia	83	" I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! What do you think has happened this morning ? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . "
41719	41728	41729	41729	she	99	" Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , "
41736	41762	41729	41729	she	99	" for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me . I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . "
41776	41783	41785	41786	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Aye , there she comes , "
41788	41990	41785	41786	Mrs. Bennet	84	" looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided she can have her own way . But I tell you , Miss Lizzy — if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all — and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead . I shall not be able to keep you — and so I warn you . I have done with you from this very day . I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children . Not that I have much pleasure , indeed , in talking to anybody . People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . Nobody can tell what I suffer ! But it is always so . Those who do not complain are never pitied . "
42061	42093	42055	42055	she	1003	" Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together . "
42175	42181	42168	42169	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Oh ! Mr. Collins ! "
42182	42187	42189	42189	he	124	" My dear madam , "
42191	42208	42209	42209	he	124	" let us be for ever silent on this point . Far be it from me , "
42221	42453	42209	42209	he	124	" to resent the behaviour of your daughter . Resignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned . Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . You will not , I hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . My conduct may , I fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter 's lips instead of your own . But we are all liable to error . I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my MANNER has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . "
42726	42730	42732	42732	he	282	" I found , "
42734	42787	42732	42732	he	282	" as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . "
43022	43073	43013	43013	Jane	153	" This is from Caroline Bingley ; what it contains has surprised me a good deal . The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town — and without any intention of coming back again . You shall hear what she says . "
43123	43193	43110	43111	Mr. Hurst	87	" I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope , at some future period , to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known , and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . I depend on you for that . "
43271	43276	43278	43278	she	153	" It is unlucky , "
43285	43358	43278	43278	she	153	" that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them . "
43359	43381	43254	43254	she	81	" Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . I will read it to you :
43382	43550	43278	43278	she	153	" When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days ; but as we are certain it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel . Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter ; I wish that I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one of the crowd — but of that I despair . I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you . "
43551	43558	43560	43560	Jane	153	" It is evident by this , "
43562	43572	43560	43560	Jane	153	" that he comes back no more this winter . "
43573	43588	43278	43278	she	153	" It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he SHOULD . "
43589	43635	43560	43560	Jane	153	" Why will you think so ? It must be his own doing . He is his own master . But you do not know ALL . I WILL read you the passage which particularly hurts me . I will have no reserves from YOU . "
43636	43848	43278	43278	she	153	" Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister ; and , to confess the truth , WE are scarcely less eager to meet her again . I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister . I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject ; but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . My brother admires her greatly already ; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing ; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own ; and a sister 's partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman 's heart . With all these circumstances to favour an attachment , and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? "
43849	43862	43864	43864	Jane	153	" What do you think of THIS sentence , my dear Lizzy ? "
43870	43942	43864	43864	Jane	153	" Is it not clear enough ? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother 's indifference ; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ! ) to put me on my guard ? Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? "
43943	43960	43278	43278	she	153	" Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . Will you hear it ? "
43961	43965	43864	43864	Jane	153	" Most willingly . "
43966	44021	43278	43278	she	153	" You shall have it in a few words . Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy . She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . "
44027	44244	43864	43864	Jane	153	" Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection . Miss Bingley , I am sure , can not . She is not such a simpleton . Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . But the case is this : We are not rich enough or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been ONE intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . But , my dearest Jane , you can not seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of YOUR merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . "
44245	44254	44256	44256	Jane	153	" If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , "
44258	44302	44256	44256	Jane	153	" your representation of all this might make me quite easy . But I know the foundation is unjust . Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone ; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself . "
44303	44352	43864	43864	Jane	153	" That is right . You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine . Believe her to be deceived , by all means . You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . "
44353	44386	44256	44256	Jane	153	" But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? "
44387	44394	44396	44396	Elizabeth	81	" You must decide for yourself , "
44398	44438	44396	44396	Elizabeth	81	" and if , upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him . "
44439	44446	44448	44448	Jane	153	" How can you talk so ? "
44453	44473	44448	44448	Jane	153	" You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . "
44474	44498	44396	44396	Elizabeth	81	" I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I can not consider your situation with much compassion . "
44499	44525	44448	44448	Jane	153	" But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . A thousand things may arise in six months ! "
44810	44818	44820	44820	she	81	" It keeps him in good humour , "
44822	44835	44836	44836	Charlotte	99	" and I am more obliged to you than I can express . "
45790	45795	45796	45796	he	124	" My dear madam , "
45799	45835	45796	45796	he	124	" this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . "
45860	45892	45842	45843	Mr. Bennet	74	" But is there not danger of Lady Catherine 's disapprobation here , my good sir ? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness . "
45893	45898	45900	45901	Mr. Collins	124	" My dear sir , "
45903	45933	45900	45901	Mr. Collins	124	" I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship 's concurrence . "
45934	45990	45842	45843	Mr. Bennet	74	" You can not be too much upon your guard . Risk anything rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that WE shall take no offence . "
45991	46079	46100	46101	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire . As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . "
46297	46309	46290	46290	she	99	" Engaged to Mr. Collins ! My dear Charlotte — impossible ! "
46358	46400	46348	46348	she	99	" Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman 's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? "
46444	46452	46454	46454	Charlotte	99	" I see what you are feeling , "
46456	46557	46454	46454	Charlotte	99	" You must be surprised , very much surprised — so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you . But when you have had time to think it over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . I am not romantic , you know ; I never was . I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr. Collins 's character , connection , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . "
46561	46564	46558	46558	Elizabeth	81	" Undoubtedly ; "
46849	46876	46838	46838	Lydia	83	" Good Lord ! Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? "
48330	48336	48338	48338	she	99	" Indeed , Mr. Bennet , "
48340	48380	48338	48338	she	99	" it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for HER , and live to see her take her place in it ! "
48381	48412	48431	48431	she	99	" My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . Let us hope for better things . Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor . "
48437	48466	48431	48431	she	99	" I can not bear to think that they should have all this estate . If it was not for the entail , I should not mind it . "
48467	48474	48431	48431	she	99	" What should not you mind ? "
48475	48484	48431	48431	she	99	" I should not mind anything at all . "
48485	48501	48431	48431	she	99	" Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . "
48502	48560	48431	48431	she	99	" I never can be thankful , Mr. Bennet , for anything about the entail . How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one 's own daughters , I can not understand ; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too ! Why should HE have it more than anybody else ? "
48561	48570	48572	48573	Mr. Bennet	74	" I leave it to yourself to determine , "
49074	49132	49068	49068	she	153	" Oh , that my dear mother had more command over herself ! She can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . But I will not repine . It can not last long . He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . "
49146	49151	49153	49153	Jane	153	" You doubt me , "
49158	49226	49153	49153	Jane	153	" indeed , you have no reason . He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all . I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . Thank God ! I have not THAT pain . A little time , therefore — I shall certainly try to get the better . "
49235	49269	49231	49231	she	153	" I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself . "
49270	49275	49277	49277	Elizabeth	81	" My dear Jane ! "
49279	49321	49277	49277	Elizabeth	81	" you are too good . Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; I do not know what to say to you . I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . "
49342	49345	49347	49347	Elizabeth	81	" Nay , "
49349	49513	49347	49347	Elizabeth	81	" this is not fair . YOU wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody . I only want to think YOU perfect , and you set yourself against it . Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good - will . You need not . There are few people whom I really love , and still fewer of whom I think well . The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense . I have met with two instances lately , one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte 's marriage . It is unaccountable ! In every view it is unaccountable ! "
49514	49608	49322	49323	Miss Bennet	81	" My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . They will ruin your happiness . You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . Consider Mr. Collins 's respectability , and Charlotte 's steady , prudent character . Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for everybody 's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . "
49609	49772	49347	49347	Elizabeth	81	" To oblige you , I would try to believe almost anything , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart . My dear Jane , Mr. Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who married him can not have a proper way of thinking . You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger security for happiness . "
49773	49786	49788	49788	Jane	153	" I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , "
49790	49906	49788	49788	Jane	153	" and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together . But enough of this . You alluded to something else . You mentioned TWO instances . I can not misunderstand you , but I entreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking THAT PERSON to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect . It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us . Women fancy admiration means more than it does . "
49907	49916	49347	49347	Elizabeth	81	" And men take care that they should . "
49917	49948	49788	49788	Jane	153	" If it is designedly done , they can not be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine .
49949	49965	49967	49967	Elizabeth	81	" I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley 's conduct to design , "
49969	50015	49967	49967	Elizabeth	81	" but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people 's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . "
50016	50027	49788	49788	Jane	153	" And do you impute it to either of those ? "
50028	50061	49967	49967	Elizabeth	81	" Yes ; to the last . But if I go on , I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem . Stop me whilst you can . "
50062	50075	49788	49788	Jane	153	" You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him ? "
50084	50084	49788	49788	Jane	153	"
50085	50122	49967	49967	Elizabeth	81	" I can not believe it . Why should they try to influence him ? They can only wish his happiness ; and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it . "
50123	50171	49788	49788	Jane	153	" Your first position is false . They may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . "
50172	50186	50188	50188	Jane	153	" Beyond a doubt , they DO wish him to choose Miss Darcy , "
50190	50371	50188	50188	Jane	153	" but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother 's . What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . By supposing such an affection , you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy . Do not distress me by the idea . I am not ashamed of having been mistaken — or , at least , it is light , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . "
50525	50530	50532	50532	he	74	" So , Lizzy , "
50536	50646	50532	50532	he	74	" your sister is crossed in love , I find . I congratulate her . Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then . It is something to think of , and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . When is your turn to come ? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane . Now is your time . Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . Let Wickham be YOUR man . He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . "
50647	50672	50753	50754	general unreserve	1154	" Thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . We must not all expect Jane 's good fortune . "
50673	50676	50678	50679	Mr. Bennet	74	" True , "
50681	50711	50678	50679	Mr. Bennet	74	" but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you , you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it . "
51217	51224	51225	51225	she	117	" I do not blame Jane , "
51228	51413	51225	51225	she	117	" for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could . But Lizzy ! Oh , sister ! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins 's wife by this time , had it not been for her own perverseness . He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . The Lucases are very artful people indeed , sister . They are all for what they can get . I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves . "
51473	51486	51488	51488	she	117	" It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , "
51490	51550	51488	51488	she	117	" I am sorry it went off . But these things happen so often ! A young man , such as you describe Mr. Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent . "
51551	51559	51561	51561	Elizabeth	81	" An excellent consolation in its way , "
51563	51617	51561	51561	Elizabeth	81	" but it will not do for US . We do not suffer by ACCIDENT . It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . "
51618	51681	51488	51488	she	117	" But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea . It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half - hour 's acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . Pray , how VIOLENT WAS Mr. Bingley 's love ? "
51682	51766	51561	51561	Elizabeth	81	" I never saw a more promising inclination ; he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance ; and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer . Could there be finer symptoms ? Is not general incivility the very essence of love ? "
51767	51863	51488	51488	she	117	" Oh , yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . Poor Jane ! I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . It had better have happened to YOU , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us ? Change of scene might be of service — and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything . "
51882	51886	51888	51889	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" I hope , "
51891	51955	51888	51889	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable that they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . "
51956	52054	51888	51889	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" And THAT is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have HEARD of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month 's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , Mr. Bingley never stirs without him . "
52055	52088	51888	51889	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" So much the better . I hope they will not meet at all . But does not Jane correspond with his sister ? SHE will not be able to help calling . "
52089	52097	51888	51889	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" She will drop the acquaintance entirely . "
52667	52822	52662	52662	she	117	" You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . I have nothing to say against HIM ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . But as it is , you must not let your fancy run away with you . You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . Your father would depend on YOUR resolution and good conduct , I am sure . You must not disappoint your father . "
52823	52834	52662	52662	she	117	" My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . "
52835	52849	52662	52662	she	117	" Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . "
52850	52891	52662	52662	she	117	" Well , then , you need not be under any alarm . I will take care of myself , and of Mr. Wickham too . He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . "
52892	52901	52662	52662	she	117	" Elizabeth , you are not serious now . "
52902	53155	52662	52662	she	117	" I beg your pardon , I will try again . At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham ; no , I certainly am not . But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw — and if he becomes really attached to me — I believe it will be better that he should not . I see the imprudence of it . Oh ! THAT abominable Mr. Darcy ! My father 's opinion of me does me the greatest honour , and I should be miserable to forfeit it . My father , however , is partial to Mr. Wickham . In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow - creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ? All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object . When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing . In short , I will do my best . "
53156	53186	53304	53304	her	1185	" Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often . At least , you should not REMIND you mother of inviting him . "
53187	53195	53197	53197	Elizabeth	81	" As I did the other day , "
53203	53291	53197	53197	Elizabeth	81	" very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from THAT . But do not imagine that he is always here so often . It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . You know my mother 's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be the wisest ; and now I hope you are satisfied . "
53405	53412	53377	53377	she	84	" WISHED they might be happy . "
53473	53486	53470	53470	Charlotte	99	" I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . "
53487	53493	53470	53470	Charlotte	99	" THAT you certainly shall . "
53494	53511	53470	53470	Charlotte	99	" And I have another favour to ask you . Will you come and see me ? "
53512	53524	53470	53470	Charlotte	99	" We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . "
53525	53547	53470	53470	Charlotte	99	" I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . "
53562	53574	53576	53576	Charlotte	99	" My father and Maria are coming to me in March , "
53578	53605	53576	53576	Charlotte	99	" and I hope you will consent to be of the party . Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome as either of them . "
53954	53958	53959	53959	she	153	" My aunt , "
53962	53987	53959	53959	she	153	" is going to - morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street . "
54004	54013	54015	54015	her	153	" I did not think Caroline in spirits , "
54018	54125	54015	54015	her	153	" but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . I was right , therefore , my last letter had never reached her . I inquired after their brother , of course . He was well , but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him . I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner . I wish I could see her . My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out . I dare say I shall see them soon here . "
54258	54821	54244	54244	she	153	" My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley 's regard for me . But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me ; but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the meantime . When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . I pity , though I can not help blaming her . She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side . But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . I need not explain myself farther ; and though WE know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable . I can not but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met , long ago . He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . I can not understand it . If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy — your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . Let me hear from you very soon . Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . We had better not mention it . I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford . Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . I am sure you will be very comfortable there.—Yours , etc . "
55155	55354	55150	55150	she	81	" I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . But my feelings are not only cordial towards HIM ; they are even impartial towards Miss King . I can not find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . There can be no love in all this . My watchfulness has been effectual ; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him , I can not say that I regret my comparative insignificance . Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly . Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do . They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain . "
56165	56171	56172	56172	she	117	" But my dear Elizabeth , "
56175	56194	56172	56172	she	117	" what sort of girl is Miss King ? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . "
56195	56270	56145	56146	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . "
56271	56293	56172	56172	she	117	" If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . "
56294	56314	56145	56146	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" She is a very good kind of girl , I believe . I know no harm of her . "
56315	56336	56172	56172	she	117	" But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather 's death made her mistress of this fortune . "
56337	56385	56145	56146	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" No — what should he ? If it were not allowable for him to gain MY affections because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? "
56386	56404	56172	56172	she	117	" But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event . "
56405	56437	56145	56146	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe . If SHE does not object to it , why should WE ? "
56438	56461	56172	56172	she	117	" HER not objecting does not justify HIM . It only shows her being deficient in something herself — sense or feeling . "
56462	56465	56467	56467	Elizabeth	81	" Well , "
56469	56487	56467	56467	Elizabeth	81	" have it as you choose . HE shall be mercenary , and SHE shall be foolish . "
56488	56524	56172	56172	she	117	" No , Lizzy , that is what I do NOT choose . I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . "
56525	56611	56467	56467	Elizabeth	81	" Oh ! if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better . I am sick of them all . Thank Heaven ! I am going to - morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him . Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . "
56612	56625	56172	56172	she	117	" Take care , Lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment . "
56664	56676	56678	56679	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" We have not determined how far it shall carry us , "
56681	56690	56678	56679	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" but , perhaps , to the Lakes . "
56713	56722	56723	56723	she	81	" Oh , my dear , dear aunt , "
56727	56857	56723	56723	she	81	" what delight ! what felicity ! You give me fresh life and vigour . Adieu to disappointment and spleen . What are young men to rocks and mountains ? Oh ! what hours of transport we shall spend ! And when we DO return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of anything . We WILL know where we have gone — we WILL recollect what we have seen . Lakes , mountains , and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarreling about its relative situation . Let OUR first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . "
57741	57883	57734	57735	Mr. Collins	124	" Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . Her ladyship 's carriage is regularly ordered for us . I SHOULD say , one of her ladyship 's carriages , for she has several . "
57884	57899	57901	57904	a most attentive neighbour	1313	" Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , added Charlotte , "
57906	57906	57734	57735	Mr. Collins	124	"
57907	57937	57734	57735	Mr. Collins	124	" Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . She is the sort of woman whom one can not regard with too much deference . "
58129	58175	58114	58114	Maria	93	" Oh , my dear Eliza ! pray make haste and come into the dining - room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! I will not tell you what it is . Make haste , and come down this moment . "
58224	58230	58232	58232	Elizabeth	81	" And is this all ? "
58234	58259	58232	58232	Elizabeth	81	" I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter . "
58260	58266	58268	58268	Maria	93	" La ! my dear , "
58276	58327	58268	58268	Maria	93	" it is not Lady Catherine . The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson , who lives with them ; the other is Miss de Bourgh . Only look at her . She is quite a little creature . Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small ? "
58328	58351	58232	58232	Elizabeth	81	" She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind . Why does she not come in ? "
58352	58375	58268	58268	Maria	93	" Oh , Charlotte says she hardly ever does . It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in . "
58376	58382	58384	58384	Elizabeth	81	" I like her appearance , "
58391	58417	58384	58384	Elizabeth	81	" She looks sickly and cross . Yes , she will do for him very well . She will make him a very proper wife . "
58614	58618	58620	58620	he	124	" I confess , "
58622	58707	58620	58620	he	124	" that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship 's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings . I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation , moreover , including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ! "
58708	58719	58721	58722	Sir William	79	" I am the less surprised at what has happened , "
58724	58762	58721	58722	Sir William	79	" from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire . About the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . "
58830	58914	58825	58825	he	124	" Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel . Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter . I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest — there is no occasion for anything more . Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed . She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . "
60148	60166	60143	60144	Lady Catherine	85	" Your father 's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins , I think . For your sake , "
60171	60214	60143	60144	Lady Catherine	85	" I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line . It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh 's family . Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? "
60215	60219	60143	60144	Lady Catherine	85	" A little . "
60220	60262	60143	60144	Lady Catherine	85	" Oh ! then — some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to —— You shall try it some day . Do your sisters play and sing ? "
60263	60269	60143	60144	Lady Catherine	85	" One of them does . "
60270	60307	60143	60144	Lady Catherine	85	" Why did not you all learn ? You ought all to have learned . The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as yours . Do you draw ? "
60308	60315	60143	60144	Lady Catherine	85	" No , not at all . "
60316	60323	60143	60144	Lady Catherine	85	" What , none of you ? "
60324	60328	60143	60144	Lady Catherine	85	" Not one . "
60329	60359	60143	60144	Lady Catherine	85	" That is very strange . But I suppose you had no opportunity . Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . "
60360	60375	60143	60144	Lady Catherine	85	" My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London . "
60376	60383	60143	60144	Lady Catherine	85	" Has your governess left you ? "
60384	60391	60143	60144	Lady Catherine	85	" We never had any governess . "
60392	60431	60143	60144	Lady Catherine	85	" No governess ! How was that possible ? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . "
60448	60470	60438	60438	she	81	" Then , who taught you ? who attended to you ? Without a governess , you must have been neglected . "
60471	60521	60438	60438	she	81	" Compared with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means . We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . Those who chose to be idle , certainly might . "
60522	60708	60438	60438	she	81	" Aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way . I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . Mrs. Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalf 's calling yesterday to thank me ? She finds Miss Pope a treasure . ' Lady Catherine , ' said she , ' you have given me a treasure . ' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? "
60709	60716	60438	60438	she	81	" Yes , ma'am , all . "
60717	60756	60438	60438	she	81	" All ! What , all five out at once ? Very odd ! And you only the second . The younger ones out before the elder ones are married ! Your younger sisters must be very young ? "
60757	60864	60438	60438	she	81	" Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . Perhaps SHE is full young to be much in company . But really , ma'am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement , because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . The last - born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth at the first . And to be kept back on SUCH a motive ! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . "
60865	60870	60872	60873	her ladyship	3411	" Upon my word , "
60875	60895	60872	60873	her ladyship	3411	" you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . Pray , what is your age ? "
60896	60904	60906	60906	Elizabeth	81	" With three younger sisters grown up , "
60910	60921	60906	60906	Elizabeth	81	" your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . "
60955	60976	60922	60923	Lady Catherine	85	" You can not be more than twenty , I am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age . "
60977	60987	61007	61008	Lady Catherine	85	" I am not one - and - twenty . "
62418	62445	62385	62385	Charlotte	99	" I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . "
62650	62671	62633	62633	She	81	" My eldest sister has been in town these three months . Have you never happened to see her there ? "
63113	63145	63105	63105	she	3411	" What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? What is it you are talking of ? What are you telling Miss Bennet ? Let me hear what it is . "
63146	63155	63157	63157	he	165	" We are speaking of music , madam , "
63168	63272	63105	63105	she	3411	" Of music ! Then pray speak aloud . It is of all subjects my delight . I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music . There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient . And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? "
63285	63299	63301	63302	Lady Catherine	85	" I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , "
63304	63328	63301	63302	Lady Catherine	85	" and pray tell her from me , that she can not expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal . "
63329	63336	63337	63337	he	88	" I assure you , madam , "
63340	63354	63337	63337	he	88	" that she does not need such advice . She practises very constantly . "
63355	63483	63301	63302	Lady Catherine	85	" So much the better . It can not be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice . I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well unless she practises more ; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson 's room . She would be in nobody 's way , you know , in that part of the house . "
63614	63677	63592	63592	he	88	" You mean to frighten me , Mr. Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? I will not be alarmed though your sister DOES play so well . There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me . "
63678	63687	63688	63688	he	88	" I shall not say you are mistaken , "
63691	63737	63688	63688	he	88	" because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own . "
63753	63871	63738	63738	Elizabeth	81	" Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character , in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . Indeed , Mr. Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire — and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too — for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear . "
63872	63880	63882	63882	he	1488	" I am not afraid of you , "
63886	63899	63901	63902	Colonel Fitzwilliam	165	" Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , "
63904	63916	63901	63902	Colonel Fitzwilliam	165	" I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . "
63917	64005	63738	63738	Elizabeth	81	" You shall hear then — but prepare yourself for something very dreadful . The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball — and at this ball , what do you think he did ? He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . Mr. Darcy , you can not deny the fact . "
64006	64027	63901	63902	Colonel Fitzwilliam	165	" I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . "
64028	64060	63738	63738	Elizabeth	81	" True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball - room . Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? My fingers wait your orders . "
64061	64064	64066	64066	Darcy	88	" Perhaps , "
64068	64093	64066	64066	Darcy	88	" I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction ; but I am ill - qualified to recommend myself to strangers . "
64104	64113	64097	64098	your cousin	4092	" said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam . "
64143	64143	64097	64098	your cousin	4092	"
64144	64151	64153	64153	Fitzwilliam	165	" I can answer your question , "
64155	64172	64153	64153	Fitzwilliam	165	" without applying to him . It is because he will not give himself the trouble . "
64173	64185	64187	64187	Darcy	88	" I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , "
64189	64223	64187	64187	Darcy	88	" of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . I can not catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . "
64224	64228	64230	64230	Elizabeth	81	" My fingers , "
64232	64313	64230	64230	Elizabeth	81	" do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women 's do . They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault — because I will not take the trouble of practising . It is not that I do not believe MY fingers as capable as any other woman 's of superior execution . "
64319	64355	64314	64314	Darcy	88	" You are perfectly right . You have employed your time much better . No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting . We neither of us perform to strangers . "
64398	64457	64381	64382	Lady Catherine	85	" Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master . She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne 's . Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . "
64789	64852	64775	64775	he	88	" How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr. Darcy ! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London ? "
64853	64861	64786	64786	she	81	" Perfectly so , I thank you . "
64881	64901	64865	64865	she	81	" I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? "
64902	64949	64862	64862	She	81	" I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future . He has many friends , and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . "
64950	65028	64865	64865	she	81	" If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . But , perhaps , Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle . "
65029	65036	65038	65038	Darcy	88	" I should not be surprised , "
65040	65056	65038	65038	Darcy	88	" if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers . "
65104	65132	65094	65094	He	88	" This seems a very comfortable house . Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford . "
65133	65156	65038	65038	Darcy	88	" I believe she did — and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . "
65157	65172	65094	65094	He	88	" Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife . "
65173	65259	65038	65038	Darcy	88	" Yes , indeed , his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . My friend has an excellent understanding — though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did . She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her . "
65260	65283	65094	65094	He	88	" It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . "
65284	65300	65038	65038	Darcy	88	" An easy distance , do you call it ? It is nearly fifty miles . "
65301	65330	65094	65094	He	88	" And what is fifty miles of good road ? Little more than half a day 's journey . Yes , I call it a VERY easy distance . "
65347	65351	65331	65331	I	0	" cried Elizabeth . "
65365	65365	65357	65358	Mrs. Collins	160	"
65366	65393	65395	65395	he	1510	" It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire . Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . "
65429	65531	65426	65426	she	81	" I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil . But that is not the case HERE . Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys — and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself NEAR her family under less than HALF the present distance . "
65545	65568	65535	65535	his	88	" YOU can not have a right to such very strong local attachment . YOU can not have been always at Longbourn . "
65606	65613	65581	65581	he	282	" Are you pleased with Kent ? "
65692	65701	65703	65703	Charlotte	99	" What can be the meaning of this ? "
65712	65738	65703	65703	Charlotte	99	" My dear , Eliza , he must be in love with you , or he would never have called us in this familiar way . "
66703	66716	66700	66700	she	81	" I did not know before that you ever walked this way . "
66717	66728	66729	66729	he	88	" I have been making the tour of the park , "
66732	66758	66729	66729	he	88	" as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage . Are you going much farther ? "
66759	66770	66700	66700	she	81	" No , I should have turned in a moment . "
66785	66794	66796	66796	she	81	" Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? "
66798	66826	66700	66700	she	81	" Yes — if Darcy does not put it off again . But I am at his disposal . He arranges the business just as he pleases . "
66827	66872	66729	66729	he	88	" And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice . I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy . "
66873	66884	66886	66887	Colonel Fitzwilliam	165	" He likes to have his own way very well , "
66889	66943	66886	66887	Colonel Fitzwilliam	165	" But so we all do . It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . I speak feelingly . A younger son , you know , must be inured to self - denial and dependence . "
66944	67001	66729	66729	he	88	" In my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either . Now seriously , what have you ever known of self - denial and dependence ? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring anything you had a fancy for ? "
67002	67048	66886	66887	Colonel Fitzwilliam	165	" These are home questions — and perhaps I can not say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature . But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from want of money . Younger sons can not marry where they like . "
67049	67066	66729	66729	he	88	" Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . "
67097	67097	66886	66887	Colonel Fitzwilliam	165	"
67098	67102	67104	67104	Elizabeth	81	" Is this , "
67106	67111	67113	67113	she	81	" meant for me ? "
67130	67165	67122	67122	herself	81	" And pray , what is the usual price of an earl 's younger son ? Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . "
67200	67269	67195	67195	she	81	" I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal . I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . But , perhaps , his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . "
67270	67273	67275	67276	Colonel Fitzwilliam	165	" No , "
67278	67302	67275	67276	Colonel Fitzwilliam	165	" that is an advantage which he must divide with me . I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . "
67303	67357	67363	67363	him	165	" Are you indeed ? And pray what sort of guardians do you make ? Does your charge give you much trouble ? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . "
67408	67470	67404	67404	She	1541	" You need not be frightened . I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world . She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley . I think I have heard you say that you know them . "
67471	67495	67404	67404	She	1541	" I know them a little . Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man — he is a great friend of Darcy 's . "
67496	67501	67503	67503	Elizabeth	81	" Oh ! yes , "
67506	67526	67503	67503	Elizabeth	81	" Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . "
67527	67602	67404	67404	She	1541	" Care of him ! Yes , I really believe Darcy DOES take care of him in those points where he most wants care . From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . It was all conjecture . "
67603	67610	67503	67503	Elizabeth	81	" What is it you mean ? "
67611	67646	67404	67404	She	1541	" It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady 's family , it would be an unpleasant thing . "
67647	67657	67503	67503	Elizabeth	81	" You may depend upon my not mentioning it . "
67658	67749	67404	67404	She	1541	" And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley . What he told me was merely this : that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . "
67750	67761	67503	67503	Elizabeth	81	" Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference ? "
67762	67776	67404	67404	She	1541	" I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . "
67777	67788	67503	67503	Elizabeth	81	" And what arts did he use to separate them ? "
67789	67801	67803	67803	Fitzwilliam	88	" He did not talk to me of his own arts , "
67807	67819	67803	67803	Fitzwilliam	88	" He only told me what I have now told you . "
67850	67862	67864	67864	she	81	" I am thinking of what you have been telling me , "
67866	67885	67864	67864	she	81	" Your cousin 's conduct does not suit my feelings . Why was he to be the judge ? "
67886	67897	67841	67841	Fitzwilliam	88	" You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? "
67898	67946	67947	67947	she	81	" I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend 's inclination , or why , upon his own judgement alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy . But , "
67953	67985	67947	67947	she	81	" as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . "
67986	67994	67996	67996	Fitzwilliam	88	" That is not an unnatural surmise , "
67998	68015	67996	67996	Fitzwilliam	88	" but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousin 's triumph very sadly . "
68237	68248	68250	68251	Colonel Fitzwilliam	165	" There were some very strong objections against the lady , "
68281	68286	68287	68287	she	81	" To Jane herself , "
68290	68352	68287	68287	she	81	" there could be no possibility of objection ; all loveliness and goodness as she is!—her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . Neither could anything be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never each . "
68996	69030	68983	68983	he	88	" In vain I have struggled . It will not do . My feelings will not be repressed . You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . "
69342	69475	69339	69339	she	81	" In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned . It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could FEEL gratitude , I would now thank you . But I cannot — I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone . It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . "
69570	69617	69567	69567	he	88	" And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little ENDEAVOUR at civility , I am thus rejected . But it is of small importance . "
69618	69625	69627	69627	she	81	" I might as well inquire , "
69629	69742	69627	69627	she	81	" why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I WAS uncivil ? But I have other provocations . You know I have . Had not my feelings decided against you — had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? "
69772	69862	69769	69769	she	81	" I have every reason in the world to think ill of you . No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted THERE . You dare not , you can not deny , that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other — of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . "
69902	69912	69913	69913	she	81	" Can you deny that you have done it ? "
69923	69963	69919	69919	he	88	" I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . Towards HIM I have been kinder than towards myself . "
69989	69998	69999	69999	she	81	" But it is not merely this affair , "
70002	70074	69999	69999	she	81	" on which my dislike is founded . Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided . Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham . On this subject , what can you have to say ? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others ? "
70075	70087	70089	70089	Darcy	88	" You take an eager interest in that gentleman 's concerns , "
70103	70121	69999	69999	she	81	" Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? "
70122	70126	70128	70128	Darcy	88	" His misfortunes ! "
70131	70141	70128	70128	Darcy	88	" yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . "
70142	70148	70150	70150	Elizabeth	81	" And of your infliction , "
70154	70228	70150	70150	Elizabeth	81	" You have reduced him to his present state of poverty — comparative poverty . You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him . You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert . You have done all this ! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule . "
70229	70233	70235	70235	Darcy	88	" And this , "
70247	70288	70290	70290	he	88	" is your opinion of me ! This is the estimation in which you hold me ! I thank you for explaining it so fully . My faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed ! But perhaps , "
70302	70433	70290	70290	he	88	" these offenses might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I , with greater policy , concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by everything . But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . They were natural and just . Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?—to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? "
70457	70505	70454	70454	she	81	" You are mistaken , Mr. Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . "
70522	70546	70519	70519	she	81	" You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . "
70571	70669	70567	70567	She	81	" From the very beginning — from the first moment , I may almost say — of my acquaintance with you , your manners , impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . "
70670	70722	70567	70567	She	81	" You have said quite enough , madam . I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . "
71322	71350	71309	71309	she	81	" I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? "
71456	71590	71432	71432	she	81	" Be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you . I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice .
71591	71841	71432	71432	she	81	" Two offenses of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge . The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham . Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in the future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . If , in the explanation of them , which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours , I can only say that I am sorry . The necessity must be obeyed , and further apology would be absurd .
71842	72514	71432	71432	she	81	" I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country . But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . I had often seen him in love before . At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas 's accidental information , that Bingley 's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided . From that moment I observed my friend 's behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him . Your sister I also watched . Her look and manners were open , cheerful , and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening 's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment . If YOU have not been mistaken here , I must have been in error . Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . If it be so , if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister 's countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain — but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears . I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason . My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . But there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . These causes must be stated , though briefly . The situation of your mother 's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father . Pardon me . It pains me to offend you . But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . I will only say farther that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .
72515	72919	71432	71432	she	81	" The part which I acted is now to be explained . His sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered , and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . We accordingly went — and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice . I described , and enforced them earnestly . But , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving , of your sister 's indifference . He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard . But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own . To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . I can not blame myself for having done thus much . There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister 's being in town . I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley ; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . That they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger . Perhaps this concealment , this disguise was beneath me ; it is done , however , and it was done for the best . On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . If I have wounded your sister 's feelings , it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them .
72920	72986	71432	71432	she	81	" With respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Mr. Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . Of what he has PARTICULARLY accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .
72987	73266	71432	71432	she	81	" Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates , and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him ; and on George Wickham , who was his godson , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge — most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman 's education . My father was not only fond of this young man 's society , whose manner were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner . The vicious propensities — the want of principle , which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr. Darcy could not have . Here again shall give you pain — to what degree you only can tell . But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character — it adds even another motive .
73267	73792	71432	71432	she	81	" My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow — and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant . There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds . His own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . He had some intention , he added , of studying law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein . I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but , at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal . I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman ; the business was therefore soon settled — he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . All connection between us seemed now dissolved . I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town . In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation . For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . He had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would present him to the living in question — of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered father 's intentions . You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition to it . His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances — and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself . After this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped . How he lived I know not . But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .
73793	74157	71432	71432	she	81	" I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being . Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy . My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother 's nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself . About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr. Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . You may imagine what I felt and how I acted . Regard for my sister 's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure ; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge . Mr. Wickham 's chief object was unquestionably my sister 's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement . His revenge would have been complete indeed .
74158	74258	71432	71432	she	81	" This , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham . I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .
74259	74416	71432	71432	she	81	" You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night ; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . For the truth of everything here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who , from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and , still more , as one of the executors of my father 's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions . If your abhorrence of ME should make MY assertions valueless , you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . I will only add , God bless you ,
74417	74420	71432	71432	she	81	" FITZWILLIAM DARCY "
74751	74767	74741	74741	She	81	" This must be false ! This can not be ! This must be the grossest falsehood!"—and
76062	76069	76070	76070	she	81	" How despicably I have acted ! "
76073	76203	76070	76070	she	81	" I , who have prided myself on my discernment ! I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust ! How humiliating is this discovery ! Yet , how just a humiliation ! Had I been in love , I could not have been more wretchedly blind ! But vanity , not love , has been my folly . Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned . Till this moment I never knew myself . "
76866	76879	76884	76884	she	81	" What would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? "
76899	76909	76911	76912	Lady Catherine	85	" I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , "
76914	77001	76911	76912	Lady Catherine	85	" I believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do . But I am particularly attached to these young men , and know them to be so much attached to me ! They were excessively sorry to go ! But so they always are . The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more , I think , than last year . His attachment to Rosings certainly increases . "
77067	77105	77064	77064	she	85	" But if that is the case , you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer . Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . "
77106	77119	77121	77121	Elizabeth	81	" I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , "
77123	77143	77121	77121	Elizabeth	81	" but it is not in my power to accept it . I must be in town next Saturday . "
77144	77198	77064	77064	she	85	" Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . I expected you to stay two months . I told Mrs. Collins so before you came . There can be no occasion for your going so soon . Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . "
77199	77215	77121	77121	Elizabeth	81	" But my father can not . He wrote last week to hurry my return . "
77216	77333	77064	77064	she	85	" Oh ! your father of course may spare you , if your mother can . Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father . And if you will stay another MONTH complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche - box , there will be very good room for one of you — and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . "
77334	77353	77121	77121	Elizabeth	81	" You are all kindness , madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . "
77359	77536	77354	77355	Lady Catherine	85	" Mrs. Collins , you must send a servant with them . You know I always speak my mind , and I can not bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . It is highly improper . You must contrive to send somebody . I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men - servants go with her . Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr. Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . I am excessively attentive to all those things . You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs. Collins . I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to YOU to let them go alone . "
77537	77548	77354	77355	Lady Catherine	85	" My uncle is to send a servant for us . "
77549	77606	77354	77355	Lady Catherine	85	" Oh ! Your uncle ! He keeps a man - servant , does he ? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things . Where shall you change horses ? Oh ! Bromley , of course . If you mention my name at the Bell , you will be attended to . "
78348	78356	78358	78358	he	124	" I know not , Miss Elizabeth , "
78360	78486	78358	78358	he	124	" whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us ; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . The favor of your company has been much felt , I assure you . We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode . Our plain manner of living , our small rooms and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly . "
78543	78698	78530	78531	Mr. Collins	124	" It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and , from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit can not have been entirely irksome . Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine 's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . You see on what a footing we are . You see how continually we are engaged there . In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings . "
78733	78879	78720	78720	Elizabeth	81	" You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so . Lady Catherine 's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate — but on this point it will be as well to be silent . Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . We seem to have been designed for each other . "
79140	79143	79144	79144	he	124	" But , "
79147	79177	79144	79144	he	124	" you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . "
79198	79202	79204	79204	Maria	93	" Good gracious ! "
79213	79234	79204	79204	Maria	93	" it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! "
79235	79241	79243	79244	her companion	1672	" A great many indeed , "
79249	79272	79204	79204	Maria	93	" We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea there twice ! How much I shall have to tell ! "
79277	79287	79273	79273	Elizabeth	81	" And how much I shall have to conceal ! "
79633	79646	79613	79613	they	1686	" Is not this nice ? Is not this an agreeable surprise ? "
79647	79656	79658	79658	Lydia	83	" And we mean to treat you all , "
79660	79681	79658	79658	Lydia	83	" but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . "
79686	79740	79750	79750	she	83	purchases—"Look here , I have bought this bonnet . I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . "
79757	79826	79750	79750	she	83	" Oh ! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable . Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the — — shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . "
79827	79832	79834	79834	Elizabeth	81	" Are they indeed ! "
79841	79906	79750	79750	she	83	" They are going to be encamped near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! It would be such a delicious scheme ; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all . Mamma would like to go too of all things ! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! "
79907	79910	79912	79912	Elizabeth	81	" Yes , "
79914	79965	79912	79912	Elizabeth	81	" THAT would be a delightful scheme indeed , and completely do for us at once . Good Heaven ! Brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of Meryton ! "
79966	79976	79978	79978	Lydia	83	" Now I have got some news for you , "
79987	80010	79978	79978	Lydia	83	" What do you think ? It is excellent news — capital news — and about a certain person we all like ! "
80035	80159	80029	80029	Lydia	83	" Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion . You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say . But he is an ugly fellow ! I am glad he is gone . I never saw such a long chin in my life . Well , but now for my news ; it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is it not ? There is no danger of Wickham 's marrying Mary King . There 's for you ! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool : gone to stay . Wickham is safe . "
80160	80167	80169	80169	Elizabeth	81	" And Mary King is safe ! "
80171	80181	80169	80169	Elizabeth	81	" safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . "
80182	80197	80029	80029	Lydia	83	" She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . "
80198	80211	80213	80213	Jane	153	" But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , "
80215	80249	80029	80029	Lydia	83	" I am sure there is not on HIS . I will answer for it , he never cared three straws about her — who could about such a nasty little freckled thing ? "
80340	80349	80351	80351	Lydia	83	" How nicely we are all crammed in , "
80353	80772	80351	80351	Lydia	83	" I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox ! Well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home . And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away . Have you seen any pleasant men ? Have you had any flirting ? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . She is almost three - and - twenty ! Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three - and - twenty ! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands , you ca n't think . She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins ; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it . Lord ! how I should like to be married before any of you ; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls . Dear me ! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster 's . Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by the bye , Mrs. Forster and me are SUCH friends ! ) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come , but Harriet was ill , and so Pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman 's clothes on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun ! Not a soul knew of it , but Colonel and Mrs. Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you can not imagine how well he looked ! When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . Lord ! how I laughed ! and so did Mrs. Forster . I thought I should have died . And THAT made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . "
80860	80871	80853	80854	Mr. Bennet	74	" I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . "
80991	80996	80998	80998	she	80	" Oh ! Mary , "
81000	81157	80998	80998	she	80	" I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! As we went along , Kitty and I drew up the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . And then when we came away it was such fun ! I thought we never should have got into the coach . I was ready to die of laughter . And then we were so merry all the way home ! we talked and laughed so loud , that anybody might have heard us ten miles off ! "
81165	81211	81160	81160	Mary	86	" Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures ! They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds . But I confess they would have no charms for ME — I should infinitely prefer a book . "
81577	81587	81589	81589	she	81	" His being so sure of succeeding was wrong , "
81591	81610	81589	81589	she	81	" and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment ! "
81611	81614	81616	81616	Elizabeth	81	" Indeed , "
81618	81655	81616	81616	Elizabeth	81	" I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings , which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? "
81656	81664	81589	81589	she	81	" Blame you ! Oh , no . "
81665	81678	81616	81616	Elizabeth	81	" But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham ? "
81679	81696	81589	81589	she	81	" No — I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . "
81697	81715	81616	81616	Elizabeth	81	" But you WILL know it , when I tell you what happened the very next day . "
81819	81825	81827	81827	Elizabeth	81	" This will not do , "
81829	81911	81827	81827	Elizabeth	81	" you never will be able to make both of them good for anything . Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . There is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much . For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Darcy 's ; but you shall do as you choose . "
81928	81940	81942	81942	she	81	" I do not know when I have been more shocked , "
81944	82013	81942	81942	she	81	" Wickham so very bad ! It is almost past belief . And poor Mr. Darcy ! Dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . Such a disappointment ! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion , too ! and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! It is really too distressing . I am sure you must feel it so . "
82014	82081	81799	81799	she	81	" Oh ! no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both . I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . Your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . "
82082	82106	81942	81942	she	81	" Poor Wickham ! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! such an openness and gentleness in his manner ! "
82107	82139	81799	81799	she	81	" There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men . One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . "
82140	82159	81942	81942	she	81	" I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the APPEARANCE of it as you used to do . "
82160	82235	81799	81799	she	81	" And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . It is such a spur to one 's genius , such an opening for wit , to have a dislike of that kind . One may be continually abusive without saying anything just ; but one can not always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . "
82236	82260	81942	81942	she	81	" Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . "
82261	82322	81799	81799	she	81	" Indeed , I could not . I was uncomfortable enough , I may say unhappy . And with no one to speak to about what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had ! Oh ! how I wanted you ! "
82323	82351	81942	81942	she	81	" How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy , for now they DO appear wholly undeserved . "
82352	82410	81799	81799	she	81	" Certainly . But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . There is one point on which I want your advice . I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not , to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham 's character . "
82421	82439	82411	82412	Miss Bennet	81	" Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . What is your opinion ? "
82440	82596	81942	81942	she	81	" That it ought not to be attempted . Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . On the contrary , every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light . I am not equal to it . Wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is . Some time hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . At present I will say nothing about it . "
82597	82644	82411	82412	Miss Bennet	81	" You are quite right . To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . He is now , perhaps , sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re - establish a character . We must not make him desperate . "
82774	82778	82780	82780	she	81	" And then , "
82782	82828	82780	82780	she	81	" if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . The liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value ! "
82959	82964	82966	82967	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Well , Lizzy , "
82971	83085	82966	82967	Mrs. Bennet	84	" what is your opinion NOW of this sad business of Jane 's ? For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . I told my sister Phillips so the other day . But I can not find out that Jane saw anything of him in London . Well , he is a very undeserving young man — and I do not suppose there 's the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have inquired of everybody , too , who is likely to know . "
83086	83100	83199	83200	her mother	235	" I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more . "
83101	83174	82966	82967	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Oh well ! it is just as he chooses . Nobody wants him to come . Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if I was her , I would not have put up with it . Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart ; and then he will be sorry for what he has done . "
83192	83197	83199	83200	her mother	235	" Well , Lizzy , "
83205	83274	83199	83200	her mother	235	" and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ? Well , well , I only hope it will last . And what sort of table do they keep ? Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say . If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . There is nothing extravagant in THEIR housekeeping , I dare say . "
83275	83282	83199	83200	her mother	235	" No , nothing at all . "
83283	83361	83199	83200	her mother	235	" A great deal of good management , depend upon it . Yes , yes . THEY will take care not to outrun their income . THEY will never be distressed for money . Well , much good may it do them ! And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . They look upon it as quite their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . "
83362	83375	83199	83200	her mother	235	" It was a subject which they could not mention before me . "
83376	83437	83199	83200	her mother	235	" No ; it would have been strange if they had ; but I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves . Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better . I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . "
83541	83558	83560	83560	they	1738	" Good Heaven ! what is to become of us ? What are we to do ? "
83568	83578	83560	83560	they	1738	" How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? "
83607	83612	83614	83614	she	1744	" I am sure , "
83616	83640	83614	83614	she	1744	" I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller 's regiment went away . I thought I should have broken my heart . "
83641	83650	83652	83652	Lydia	83	" I am sure I shall break MINE , "
83654	83663	83665	83666	Mrs. Bennet	84	" If one could but go to Brighton ! "
83668	83685	83614	83614	she	1744	" Oh , yes!—if one could but go to Brighton ! But papa is so disagreeable . "
83686	83698	83614	83614	she	1744	" A little sea - bathing would set me up forever . "
83699	83716	83718	83718	Kitty	85	" And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do ME a great deal of good , "
83948	83965	83967	83967	she	83	" I can not see why Mrs. Forster should not ask ME as well as Lydia , "
83969	84002	83967	83967	she	83	" Though I am NOT her particular friend . I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . "
84154	84196	84145	84145	He	238	" Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . "
84197	84203	84205	84205	Elizabeth	81	" If you were aware , "
84207	84251	84205	84205	Elizabeth	81	" of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia 's unguarded and imprudent manner — nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . "
84252	84256	84258	84259	Mr. Bennet	74	" Already arisen ? "
84261	84324	84258	84259	Mr. Bennet	74	" What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? Poor little Lizzy ! But do not be cast down . Such squeamish youths as can not bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret . Come , let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia 's folly . "
84325	84583	84584	84585	Mr. Bennet	74	" Indeed you are mistaken . I have no such injuries to resent . It is not of particular , but of general evils , which I am now complaining . Our importance , our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia 's character . Excuse me , for I must speak plainly . If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous ; a flirt , too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and , from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . In this danger Kitty also is comprehended . She will follow wherever Lydia leads . Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrolled ! Oh ! my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? "
84605	84778	84584	84585	Mr. Bennet	74	" Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . Wherever you and Jane are known you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of — or I may say , three — very silly sisters . We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton . Let her go , then . Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody . At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . The officers will find women better worth their notice . Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . At any rate , she can not grow many degrees worse , without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life . "
85429	85440	85424	85424	he	254	" How long did you say he was at Rosings ? "
85441	85446	85424	85424	he	254	" Nearly three weeks . "
85447	85454	85424	85424	he	254	" And you saw him frequently ? "
85455	85462	85424	85424	he	254	" Yes , almost every day . "
85463	85474	85424	85424	he	254	" His manners are very different from his cousin 's . "
85475	85490	85424	85424	he	254	" Yes , very different . But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance . "
85491	85494	85496	85497	Mr. Wickham	132	" Indeed ! "
85507	85516	85496	85497	Mr. Wickham	132	" And pray , may I ask ? — "
85529	85555	85556	85556	he	254	" Is it in address that he improves ? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?—for I dare not hope , "
85566	85574	85556	85556	he	254	" that he is improved in essentials . "
85575	85580	85582	85582	Elizabeth	81	" Oh , no ! "
85584	85600	85582	85582	Elizabeth	81	" In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . "
85646	85687	85643	85643	she	81	" When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement , but that , from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . "
85730	85891	85716	85716	he	132	" You , who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the APPEARANCE of what is right . His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by . I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe . His fear of her has always operated , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . "
86765	86771	86773	86773	she	81	" But it is fortunate , "
86775	86856	86773	86773	she	81	" that I have something to wish for . Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister 's absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised . A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . "
87452	87456	87458	87458	she	81	" But surely , "
87460	87482	87458	87458	she	81	" I may enter his county without impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me . "
87834	87854	87856	87857	her aunt	1185	" My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? "
87859	87885	87856	87857	her aunt	1185	" a place , too , with which so many of your acquaintances are connected . Wickham passed all his youth there , you know . "
87947	87958	87960	87960	she	117	" If it were merely a fine house richly furnished , "
87962	87988	87960	87960	she	117	" I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . They have some of the finest woods in the country . "
88762	88768	88770	88770	she	81	" And of this place , "
88772	88820	88770	88770	she	81	" I might have been mistress ! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted ! Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . But no,"—recollecting
88821	88847	88868	88869	the housekeeper	797	herself—"that could never be ; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me ; I should not have been allowed to invite them . "
88914	88930	88909	88909	he	1902	" But we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends . "
89031	89040	89041	89041	she	797	" He is now gone into the army , "
89044	89056	89041	89041	she	797	" but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . "
89074	89078	89080	89081	Mrs. Reynolds	182	" And that , "
89090	89116	89080	89081	Mrs. Reynolds	182	" is my master — and very like him . It was drawn at the same time as the other — about eight years ago . "
89117	89129	89131	89132	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" I have heard much of your master 's fine person , "
89139	89161	89131	89132	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" it is a handsome face . But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . "
89179	89188	89162	89163	Mrs. Reynolds	182	" Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy ? "
89195	89199	89189	89189	Elizabeth	81	" A little . "
89200	89214	89162	89163	Mrs. Reynolds	182	" And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma'am ? "
89215	89221	89189	89189	Elizabeth	81	" Yes , very handsome . "
89222	89279	89162	89163	Mrs. Reynolds	182	" I am sure I know none so handsome ; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . This room was my late master 's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . He was very fond of them . "
89313	89324	89326	89327	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? "
89329	89382	89292	89293	Mrs. Reynolds	182	" Oh ! yes — the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished!—She plays and sings all day long . In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her — a present from my master ; she comes here to - morrow with him . "
89425	89439	89383	89384	Mr. Gardiner	152	" Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? "
89440	89474	89383	89384	Mr. Gardiner	152	" Not so much as I could wish , sir ; but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . "
89475	89478	89480	89480	Elizabeth	81	" Except , "
89482	89489	89480	89480	Elizabeth	81	" when she goes to Ramsgate . "
89490	89504	89383	89384	Mr. Gardiner	152	" If your master would marry , you might see more of him . "
89505	89531	89480	89480	Elizabeth	81	" Yes , sir ; but I do not know when THAT will be . I do not know who is good enough for him . "
89544	89563	89538	89538	Elizabeth	81	" It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . "
89564	89581	89583	89584	the other	585	" I say no more than the truth , and everybody will say that knows him , "
89605	89632	89601	89602	the housekeeper	797	" I have never known a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . "
89685	89708	89670	89670	she	81	" There are very few people of whom so much can be said . You are lucky in having such a master . "
89709	89779	89784	89784	her	81	" Yes , sir , I know I am . If I were to go through the world , I could not meet with a better . But I have always observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest - tempered , most generous - hearted boy in the world . "
89786	89793	89795	89795	she	81	" Can this be Mr. Darcy ? "
89797	89805	89807	89808	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" His father was an excellent man , "
89810	89836	89780	89780	Elizabeth	81	" Yes , ma'am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him — just as affable to the poor . "
89931	89943	89945	89945	she	81	" He is the best landlord , and the best master , "
89947	90019	89945	89945	she	81	" that ever lived ; not like the wild young men nowadays , who think of nothing but themselves . There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name . Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw anything of it . To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . "
90020	90031	90033	90033	Elizabeth	81	" In what an amiable light does this place him ! "
90035	90042	90044	90045	her aunt	1185	" This fine account of him , "
90050	90063	90044	90045	her aunt	1185	" is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . "
90064	90071	90044	90045	her aunt	1185	" Perhaps we might be deceived . "
90072	90085	90044	90045	her aunt	1185	" That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . "
90145	90153	90155	90155	Elizabeth	81	" He is certainly a good brother , "
90181	90191	90192	90192	she	182	" And this is always the way with him , "
90195	90222	90192	90192	she	182	" Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment . There is nothing he would not do for her . "
92063	92066	92040	92040	she	81	" delightful , "
92068	92071	92056	92056	she	81	" charming , "
92177	92184	92186	92186	she	81	" What will be his surprise , "
92188	92205	92186	92186	she	81	" when he knows who they are ? He takes them now for people of fashion . "
92482	92539	92479	92479	she	81	" Why is he so altered ? From what can it proceed ? It can not be for ME — it can not be for MY sake that his manners are thus softened . My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . It is impossible that he should still love me . "
92680	92684	92685	92685	she	579	unexpected—"for your housekeeper , "
92688	92723	92685	92685	she	579	" informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and indeed , before we left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . "
92760	92770	92771	92771	he	254	" They will join me early to - morrow , "
92774	92794	92771	92771	he	254	" and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you — Mr. Bingley and his sisters . "
92843	92854	92855	92855	he	254	" There is also one other person in the party , "
92861	92897	92855	92855	he	254	" who more particularly wishes to be known to you . Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? "
93242	93254	93256	93257	her uncle	567	" He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , "
93259	93273	93275	93276	her aunt	1185	" There IS something a little stately in him , to be sure , "
93278	93316	93275	93276	her aunt	1185	" but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it . "
93317	93358	93275	93276	her aunt	1185	" I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . "
93359	93366	93368	93369	her aunt	1185	" To be sure , Lizzy , "
93371	93411	93368	93369	her aunt	1185	" he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or , rather , he has not Wickham 's countenance , for his features are perfectly good . But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable ? "
93450	93463	93465	93466	her uncle	567	" But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , "
93468	93502	93465	93466	her uncle	567	" Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . "
93517	93526	93528	93529	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" From what we have seen of him , "
93531	93655	93528	93529	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham . He has not an ill - natured look . On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks . And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . But , to be sure , the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character ! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and THAT in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue . "
94994	95010	95018	95018	he	78	" was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; "
95021	95047	95018	95018	he	78	" It is above eight months . We have not met since the 26th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . "
97503	97530	97477	97478	Miss Bingley	90	" Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the — — shire Militia removed from Meryton ? They must be a great loss to YOUR family . "
98032	98046	98047	98047	she	90	" How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr. Darcy , "
98050	98090	98047	98047	she	90	" I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter . She is grown so brown and coarse ! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . "
98129	98135	98136	98136	she	90	" For my own part , "
98139	98257	98136	98136	she	90	" I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her . Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . Her nose wants character — there is nothing marked in its lines . Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I could never see anything extraordinary in them . They have a sharp , shrewish look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether there is a self - sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . "
98324	98402	98321	98321	she	90	" I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' SHE a beauty!—I should as soon call her mother a wit . ' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . "
98403	98406	98408	98408	Darcy	88	" Yes , "
98417	98448	98408	98408	Darcy	88	" but THAT was only when I first saw her , for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintances . "
98768	99094	99106	99106	she	2206	" Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you — be assured that we are all well . What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! Imagine our surprise . To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . I am very , very sorry . So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart . His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . Our poor mother is sadly grieved . My father bears it better . How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . The express was sent off directly . My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . I must conclude , for I can not be long from my poor mother . I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . "
99145	99920	99971	99972	a servant	491	" By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I can not answer for being coherent . Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it can not be delayed . Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . Though Lydia 's short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F. , who , instantly taking the alarm , set off from B. intending to trace their route . He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no further ; for on entering that place , they removed into a hackney coach , and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . I know not what to think . After making every possible inquiry on that side London , Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success — no such people had been seen to pass through . With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F. , but no one can throw any blame on them . Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . My father and mother believe the worst , but I can not think so ill of him . Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if HE could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia 's connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to everything ? Impossible ! I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he fear W. was not a man to be trusted . My poor mother is really ill , and keeps her room . Could she exert herself , it would be better ; but this is not to be expected . And as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected . Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence , one can not wonder . I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now , as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . Adieu ! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not ; but circumstances are such that I can not help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible . I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her . What he means to do I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to - morrow evening . In such and exigence , my uncle 's advice and assistance would be everything in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness . "
99921	99931	99933	99933	Elizabeth	81	" Oh ! where , where is my uncle ? "
100015	100051	99998	99998	she	81	" I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment , on business that can not be delayed ; I have not an instant to loose . "
100052	100061	100063	100063	he	2207	" Good God ! what is the matter ? "
100075	100111	100063	100063	he	2207	" I will not detain you a minute ; but let me , or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner . You are not well enough ; you can not go yourself . "
100212	100247	100193	100193	Darcy	88	" Let me call your maid . Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief ? A glass of wine ; shall I get you one ? You are very ill . "
100248	100255	100256	100256	she	81	" No , I thank you , "
100264	100294	100256	100256	she	81	" There is nothing the matter with me . I am quite well ; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . "
100344	100430	100340	100340	she	81	" I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . It can not be concealed from anyone . My younger sister has left all her friends — has eloped ; has thrown herself into the power of — of Mr. Wickham . They are gone off together from Brighton . YOU know him too well to doubt the rest . She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to — she is lost for ever . "
100437	100442	100443	100443	she	81	" When I consider , "
100452	100512	100443	100443	she	81	" that I might have prevented it ! I , who knew what he was . Had I but explained some part of it only — some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! Had his character been known , this could not have happened . But it is all — all too late now . "
100513	100519	100521	100521	Darcy	88	" I am grieved indeed , "
100523	100536	100521	100521	Darcy	88	" grieved — shocked . But is it certain — absolutely certain ? "
100537	100569	100443	100443	she	81	" Oh , yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to Scotland . "
100570	100586	100521	100521	Darcy	88	" And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? "
100587	100670	100443	100443	she	81	" My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle 's immediate assistance ; and we shall be off , I hope , in half - an - hour . But nothing can be done — I know very well that nothing can be done . How is such a man to be worked on ? How are they even to be discovered ? I have not the smallest hope . It is every way horrible ! "
100679	100723	100724	100724	Darcy	88	" When MY eyes were opened to his real character — Oh ! had I known what I ought , what I dared to do ! But I knew not — I was afraid of doing too much . Wretched , wretched mistake ! "
100954	101051	100933	100934	her companion	1672	" I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing concern . Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress ! But I will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister 's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to - day . "
101052	101097	101098	101098	He	1672	" Oh , yes . Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy . Say that urgent business calls us home immediately . Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible , I know it can not be long . "
101863	101873	101875	101876	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" But what is to be done about Pemberley ? "
101878	101896	101875	101876	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us ; was it so ? "
101897	101919	101875	101876	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . THAT is all settled . "
101920	101926	101928	101929	the other	585	" What is all settled ? "
101940	101965	101932	101932	she	585	" And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ? Oh , that I knew how it was ! "
102123	102134	102136	102137	her uncle	567	" I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , "
102146	102261	102136	102137	her uncle	567	" and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter . It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel 's family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best . Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? His temptation is not adequate to the risk ! "
102262	102269	102271	102271	Elizabeth	81	" Do you really think so ? "
102279	102284	102286	102287	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" Upon my word , "
102289	102352	102286	102287	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" I begin to be of your uncle 's opinion . It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of . I can not think so very ill of Wickham . Can you yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? "
102353	102406	102136	102137	her uncle	567	" Not , perhaps , of neglecting his own interest ; but of every other neglect I can believe him capable . If , indeed , it should be so ! But I dare not hope it . Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case ? "
102407	102413	102415	102416	Mr. Gardiner	152	" In the first place , "
102418	102432	102415	102416	Mr. Gardiner	152	" there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . "
102433	102468	102136	102137	her uncle	567	" Oh ! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption ! And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road . "
102469	102536	102415	102416	Mr. Gardiner	152	" Well , then — supposing them to be in London . They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptional purpose . It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London than in Scotland . "
102765	102765	103019	103019	her	2264	"
102766	102796	103019	103019	her	2264	" But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage ? "
102797	102809	102811	102811	Elizabeth	81	" It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , "
102819	103009	102811	102811	Elizabeth	81	" that a sister 's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . But , really , I know not what to say . Perhaps I am not doing her justice . But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half - year , nay , for a twelvemonth — she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . Since the — — shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers have been in her head . She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater — what shall I call it ? susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . "
103010	103017	103019	103020	her aunt	1185	" But you see that Jane , "
103022	103040	103019	103020	her aunt	1185	" does not think so very ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt . "
103041	103129	102811	102811	Elizabeth	81	" Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would think capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . "
103130	103139	103141	103142	Mrs. Gardiner	117	" And do you really know all this ? "
103157	103162	103164	103164	Elizabeth	81	" I do indeed , "
103168	103291	103164	103164	Elizabeth	81	" I told you , the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy ; and you yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty — which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless . From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . Yet he knew to the contrary himself . He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . "
103292	103316	102811	102811	Elizabeth	81	" But does Lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? "
103317	103499	103164	103164	Elizabeth	81	" Oh , yes!—that , that is the worst of all . Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . And when I returned home , the — — shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight 's time . As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown ? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . That SHE could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . That such a consequence as THIS could ensue , you may easily believe , was far enough from my thoughts . "
103500	103526	102811	102811	Elizabeth	81	" When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other ? "
103527	103659	103164	103164	Elizabeth	81	" Not the slightest . I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had anything of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away . When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished HER by any particular attention ; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . "
103929	103933	103935	103935	Jane	153	" Not yet , "
103937	103954	103935	103935	Jane	153	" But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope everything will be well . "
103955	103962	103901	103901	she	81	" Is my father in town ? "
103963	103977	103935	103935	Jane	153	" Yes , he went on Tuesday , as I wrote you word . "
103978	103987	103901	103901	she	81	" And have you heard from him often ? "
103988	104045	103935	103935	Jane	153	" We have heard only twice . He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . He merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention . "
104046	104060	103901	103901	she	81	" And my mother — how is she ? How are you all ? "
104061	104113	103935	103935	Jane	153	" My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . She does not yet leave her dressing - room . Mary and Kitty are , thank Heaven , are quite well . "
104114	104122	104124	104124	Elizabeth	81	" But you — how are you ? "
104126	104139	104124	104124	Elizabeth	81	" You look pale . How much you must have gone through ! "
104377	104384	104386	104386	she	84	" If I had been able , "
104388	104568	104386	104386	she	84	" to carry my point in going to Brighton , with all my family , THIS would not have happened ; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after . I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was overruled , as I always am . Poor dear child ! And now here 's Mr. Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave , and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . "
104620	104629	104631	104631	he	152	" Do not give way to useless alarm , "
104633	104747	104631	104631	he	152	" though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . In a few days more we may gain some news of them ; and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street ; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . "
104748	104755	104757	104758	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Oh ! my dear brother , "
104760	104955	104757	104758	Mrs. Bennet	84	" that is exactly what I could most wish for . And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , MAKE them marry . And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them , after they are married . And , above all , keep Mr. Bennet from fighting . Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frighted out of my wits — and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me — such spasms in my side and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . Oh , brother , how kind you are ! I know you will contrive it all . "
105235	105275	105209	105209	she	86	" This is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of . But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . "
105289	105360	105286	105286	she	86	" Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson : that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable ; that one false step involves her in endless ruin ; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful ; and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . "
105483	105531	105474	105475	the former	323	" But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard . Give me further particulars . hat did Colonel Forster say ? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place ? They must have seen them together for ever . "
105532	105616	105474	105475	the former	323	" Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia 's side , but nothing to give him any alarm . I am so grieved for him ! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . He WAS coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . "
105617	105645	105474	105475	the former	323	" And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? Did he know of their intending to go off ? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ? "
105646	105702	105474	105475	the former	323	" Yes ; but , when questioned by HIM , Denny denied knowing anything of their plans , and would not give his real opinion about it . He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying — and from THAT , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . "
105703	105728	105474	105475	the former	323	" And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? "
105729	105847	105474	105475	the former	323	" How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ? I felt a little uneasy — a little fearful of my sister 's happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . My father and mother knew nothing of that ; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia 's last letter she had prepared her for such a step . She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . "
105848	105857	105474	105475	the former	323	" But not before they went to Brighton ? "
105858	105865	105474	105475	the former	323	" No , I believe not . "
105866	105886	105474	105475	the former	323	" And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself ? Does he know his real character ? "
105887	105942	105474	105475	the former	323	" I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did . He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant . And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt ; but I hope this may be false . "
105943	105969	105474	105475	the former	323	" Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! "
105970	105978	105980	105981	her sister	324	" Perhaps it would have been better , "
105983	106011	105980	105981	her sister	324	" But to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . We acted with the best intentions . "
106012	106027	105474	105475	the former	323	" Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia 's note to his wife ? "
106028	106039	105980	105981	her sister	324	" He brought it with him for us to see . "
106061	106065	105474	105475	the former	323	" MY DEAR HARRIET ,
106066	106322	105474	105475	the former	323	" You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I can not help laughing myself at your surprise to - morrow morning , as soon as I am missed . I am going to Gretna Green , and if you can not guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel . I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them and sign my name ' Lydia Wickham . ' What a good joke it will be ! I can hardly write for laughing . Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to - night . Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all ; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure . I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up . Good - bye . Give my love to Colonel Forster . I hope you will drink to our good journey .
106323	106327	105474	105475	the former	323	" Your affectionate friend ,
106328	106332	105474	105475	the former	323	" LYDIA BENNET . "
106333	106341	106343	106343	Elizabeth	81	" Oh ! thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! "
106410	106410	106404	106404	he	2314	"
106411	106445	106370	106370	SHE	81	" I never saw anyone so shocked . He could not speak a word for full ten minutes . My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! "
106446	106451	106453	106453	Elizabeth	81	" Oh ! Jane , "
106455	106477	106453	106453	Elizabeth	81	" was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? "
106478	106550	106370	106370	SHE	81	" I do not know . I hope there was . But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult . My mother was in hysterics , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done ! But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties . "
106551	106588	106453	106453	Elizabeth	81	" Your attendance upon her has been too much for you . You do not look well . Oh that I had been with you ! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . "
106589	106724	106370	106370	SHE	81	" Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure ; but I did not think it right for either of them . Kitty is slight and delicate ; and Mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on . My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me . She was of great use and comfort to us all . And Lady Lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters ' , if they should be of use to us . "
106725	106734	106736	106736	Elizabeth	81	" She had better have stayed at home , "
106738	106784	106736	106736	Elizabeth	81	" perhaps she MEANT well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one can not see too little of one 's neighbours . Assistance is impossible ; condolence insufferable . Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . "
106812	106818	106820	106820	Jane	153	" He meant I believe , "
106822	106994	106820	106820	Jane	153	" to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them . His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . It had come with a fare from London ; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady 's removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham . If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make inquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . I do not know of any other designs that he had formed ; but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . "
107608	107742	107578	107578	He	152	" I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man 's intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself . If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . At present we have nothing to guide us . Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head . But , on second thoughts , perhaps , Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living , better than any other person . "
107992	107996	107967	107967	Elizabeth	81	" MY DEAR SIR ,
107997	108390	107967	107967	Elizabeth	81	" I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . Be assured , my dear sir , that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune — or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent 's mind . The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins , but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others ; for who , as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family ? And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect , with augmented satisfaction , on a certain event of last November ; for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . Let me then advise you , dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense .
108391	108403	107967	107967	Elizabeth	81	" I am , dear sir , etc . , etc . "
108623	108627	108628	108628	she	153	" A gamester ! "
108631	108645	108628	108628	she	153	" This is wholly unexpected . I had not an idea of it . "
108754	108767	108768	108768	she	84	" What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ? "
108771	108801	108768	108768	she	84	" Sure he will not leave London before he has found them . Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? "
109125	109151	109122	109122	he	74	" Say nothing of that . Who should suffer but myself ? It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . "
109152	109162	109164	109164	Elizabeth	81	" You must not be too severe upon yourself , "
109166	109224	109122	109122	he	74	" You may well warn me against such an evil . Human nature is so prone to fall into it ! No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . It will pass away soon enough . "
109225	109235	109294	109294	he	238	" Do you suppose them to be in London ? "
109236	109248	109122	109122	he	74	" Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? "
109249	109260	109262	109262	Kitty	85	" And Lydia used to want to go to London , "
109264	109270	109272	109273	her father	238	" She is happy then , "
109276	109288	109272	109273	her father	238	" and her residence there will probably be of some duration . "
109297	109330	109294	109294	he	238	" Lizzy , I bear you no ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shows some greatness of mind . "
109347	109353	109354	109354	he	238	" This is a parade , "
109357	109415	109354	109354	he	238	" which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my nightcap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as I can ; or , perhaps , I may defer it till Kitty runs away . "
109416	109427	109429	109429	Kitty	85	" I am not going to run away , papa , "
109432	109448	109429	109429	Kitty	85	" If I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . "
109449	109553	109354	109354	he	238	" YOU go to Brighton . I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds ! No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . No officer is ever to enter into my house again , nor even to pass through the village . Balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . "
109570	109575	109577	109577	he	2380	" Well , well , "
109579	109611	109577	109577	he	2380	" do not make yourself unhappy . If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them . "
109680	109717	109674	109674	she	797	" I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . "
109718	109733	109674	109674	she	797	" What do you mean , Hill ? We have heard nothing from town . "
109734	109738	109740	109741	Mrs. Hill	123	" Dear madam , "
109747	109779	109740	109741	Mrs. Hill	123	" do n't you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner ? He has been here this half - hour , and master has had a letter . "
109844	109863	109838	109839	the butler	2392	" If you are looking for my master , ma'am , he is walking towards the little copse . "
109943	109961	109926	109927	her sister	324	" Oh , papa , what news — what news ? Have you heard from my uncle ? "
109962	109974	110027	110027	his	241	" Yes I have had a letter from him by express . "
109975	109989	109926	109927	her sister	324	" Well , and what news does it bring — good or bad ? "
109990	110000	110002	110002	he	241	" What is there of good to be expected ? "
110011	110021	110002	110002	he	241	" But perhaps you would like to read it . "
110035	110040	110042	110043	their father	241	" Read it aloud , "
110045	110056	110042	110043	their father	241	" for I hardly know myself what it is about . "
110057	110065	110022	110022	Elizabeth	81	" Gracechurch Street , Monday , August 2 .
110066	110070	110042	110043	their father	241	" MY DEAR BROTHER ,
110071	110148	110022	110022	Elizabeth	81	" At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope it will give you satisfaction . Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were . The particulars I reserve till we meet ; it is enough to know they are discovered . I have seen them both — "
110149	110158	110160	110160	Jane	153	" Then it is as I always hoped , "
110162	110167	110160	110160	Jane	153	" they are married ! "
110172	110535	110022	110022	Elizabeth	81	" I have seen them both . They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . These are conditions which , considering everything , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you . I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr. Wickham 's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care . Send back your answer as fast as you can , and be careful to write explicitly . We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve . She comes to us to - day . I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on . Yours , etc . ,
110536	110541	110623	110623	she	81	" EDW . GARDINER . "
110542	110547	110549	110549	Elizabeth	81	" Is it possible ? "
110556	110567	110552	110552	she	81	" Can it be possible that he will marry her ? "
110568	110582	110584	110585	her sister	324	" Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we thought him , "
110587	110596	110584	110585	her sister	324	" My dear father , I congratulate you . "
110597	110605	110607	110607	Elizabeth	81	" And have you answered the letter ? "
110609	110619	110623	110623	she	81	" No ; but it must be done soon . "
110636	110643	110644	110644	she	81	" Oh ! my dear father , "
110647	110665	110644	110644	she	81	" come back and write immediately . Consider how important every moment is in such a case . "
110666	110673	110675	110675	Jane	153	" Let me write for you , "
110677	110685	110675	110675	Jane	153	" if you dislike the trouble yourself . "
110686	110693	110694	110694	he	2402	" I dislike it very much , "
110697	110704	110694	110694	he	2402	" but it must be done . "
110721	110727	110729	110729	Elizabeth	81	" And may I ask — "
110731	110744	110729	110729	Elizabeth	81	" but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . "
110745	110759	110675	110675	Jane	153	" Complied with ! I am only ashamed of his asking so little . "
110760	110773	110729	110729	Elizabeth	81	" And they MUST marry ! Yet he is SUCH a man ! "
110774	110832	110675	110675	Jane	153	" Yes , yes , they must marry . There is nothing else to be done . But there are two things that I want very much to know ; one is , how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about ; and the other , how am I ever to pay him . "
110833	110839	110841	110841	Jane	153	" Money ! My uncle ! "
110843	110851	110841	110841	Jane	153	" what do you mean , sir ? "
110852	110886	110675	110675	Jane	153	" I mean , that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . "
110887	110893	110895	110895	Elizabeth	81	" That is very true , "
110897	110951	110895	110895	Elizabeth	81	" though it had not occurred to me before . His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! Oh ! it must be my uncle 's doings ! Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . A small sum could not do all this . "
110952	110955	110957	110958	her father	238	" No , "
110960	110997	110957	110958	her father	238	" Wickham 's a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds . I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . "
110998	111016	110957	110958	her father	238	" Ten thousand pounds ! Heaven forbid ! How is half such a sum to be repaid ? "
111061	111070	111072	111072	Elizabeth	81	" And they are really to be married ! "
111082	111127	111072	111072	Elizabeth	81	" How strange this is ! And for THIS we are to be thankful . That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice . Oh , Lydia ! "
111128	111135	111137	111137	Jane	153	" I comfort myself with thinking , "
111139	111207	111137	111137	Jane	153	" that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her . Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I can not believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like it , has been advanced . He has children of his own , and may have more . How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? "
111208	111223	111225	111225	Elizabeth	81	" If he were ever able to learn what Wickham 's debts have been , "
111227	111343	111225	111225	Elizabeth	81	" and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own . The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited . Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge . By this time she is actually with them ! If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! "
111344	111358	111360	111360	Jane	153	" We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , "
111362	111432	111360	111360	Jane	153	" I hope and trust they will yet be happy . His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . "
111433	111440	111442	111442	Elizabeth	81	" Their conduct has been such , "
111444	111466	111442	111442	Elizabeth	81	" as neither you , nor I , nor anybody can ever forget . It is useless to talk of it . "
111525	111531	111519	111519	his	241	" Just as you please . "
111532	111545	111519	111519	his	241	" May we take my uncle 's letter to read to her ? "
111546	111556	111519	111519	his	241	" Take whatever you like , and get away . "
111696	111703	111704	111704	she	153	" My dear , dear Lydia ! "
111707	111849	111704	111704	she	153	" This is delightful indeed ! She will be married ! I shall see her again ! She will be married at sixteen ! My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be . I knew he would manage everything ! How I long to see her ! and to see dear Wickham too ! But the clothes , the wedding clothes ! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . Stay , stay , I will go myself . Ring the bell , Kitty , for Hill . I will put on my things in a moment . My dear , dear Lydia ! How merry we shall be together when we meet ! "
111882	111891	111892	111892	she	2418	" For we must attribute this happy conclusion , "
111895	111919	111892	111892	she	2418	" in a great measure to his kindness . We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money . "
111920	111923	111925	111926	her mother	235	" Well , "
111928	112072	111925	111926	her mother	235	" it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money , you know ; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him , except a few presents . Well ! I am so happy ! In a short time I shall have a daughter married . Mrs. Wickham ! How well it sounds ! And she was only sixteen last June . My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I ca n't write ; so I will dictate , and you write for me . We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . "
112160	112167	112169	112169	she	153	" I will go to Meryton , "
112171	112283	112169	112169	she	153	" as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long . Kitty , run down and order the carriage . An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . Girls , can I do anything for you in Meryton ? Oh ! Here comes Hill ! My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding . "
113284	113290	113292	113292	she	84	" Haye Park might do , "
113294	113347	113292	113292	she	84	" if the Gouldings could quit it — or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but Ashworth is too far off ! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for Pulvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful . "
113373	113427	113368	113368	he	254	" Mrs. Bennet , before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . Into ONE house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance . I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . "
114212	114224	114225	114225	he	152	" It was greatly my wish that he should do so , "
114228	114528	114225	114225	he	152	" as soon as his marriage was fixed on . And I think you will agree with me , in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece 's . It is Mr. Wickham 's intention to go into the regulars ; and among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . He has the promise of an ensigncy in General — — 's regiment , now quartered in the North . It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . He promises fairly ; and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which I have pledged myself . And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his information ? He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us . Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South . She is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and your mother.—Yours , etc . ,
114529	114533	114534	114535	Mr. Bennet	74	" E. GARDINER . "
114643	114652	114654	114654	she	83	" She is so fond of Mrs. Forster , "
114656	114698	114654	114654	she	83	" it will be quite shocking to send her away ! And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . The officers may not be so pleasant in General — — 's regiment . "
115454	115463	115464	115464	she	81	" Only think of its being three months , "
115467	115531	115464	115464	she	81	" since I went away ; it seems but a fortnight I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . Good gracious ! when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again ! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . "
115570	115661	115550	115550	she	81	" Oh ! mamma , do the people here abouts know I am married to - day ? I was afraid they might not ; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side - glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . "
115730	115754	115723	115723	her	83	" Ah ! Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . "
115807	115810	115805	115805	herself	83	" Mrs. Wickham "
115845	115850	115852	115852	she	83	" Well , mamma , "
115864	115931	115852	115852	she	83	" and what do you think of my husband ? Is not he a charming man ? I am sure my sisters must all envy me . I only hope they may have half my good luck . They must all go to Brighton . That is the place to get husbands . What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . "
115932	115969	116048	116049	her mother	235	" Very true ; and if I had my will , we should . But my dear Lydia , I do n't at all like your going such a way off . Must it be so ? "
115970	116036	115852	115852	she	83	" Oh , lord ! yes;—there is nothing in that . I shall like it of all things . You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . "
116037	116046	116048	116049	her mother	235	" I should like it beyond any thing ! "
116051	116087	115852	115852	she	83	" And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . "
116088	116099	116101	116101	Elizabeth	81	" I thank you for my share of the favour , "
116103	116116	116101	116101	Elizabeth	81	" but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . "
116420	116463	116415	116415	she	83	" Lizzy , I never gave YOU an account of my wedding , I believe . You were not by , when I told mamma and the others all about it . Are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? "
116464	116468	116470	116470	Elizabeth	81	" No really , "
116472	116486	116415	116415	she	83	" I think there can not be too little said on the subject . "
116487	116668	116415	116415	she	83	" La ! You are so strange ! But I must tell you how it went off . We were married , you know , at St. Clement 's , because Wickham 's lodgings were in that parish . And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock . My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a fuss ! I was so afraid , you know , that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . "
116669	116905	116415	116415	she	83	" Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . If you 'll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . Not one party , or scheme , or any thing . To be sure London was rather thin , but , however , the Little Theatre was open . Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone . And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day . But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes ' time , and then we all set out . However , I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr. Darcy might have done as well . "
116906	116910	116912	116912	Elizabeth	81	" Mr. Darcy ! "
116918	116970	116415	116415	she	83	" Oh , yes!—he was to come there with Wickham , you know . But gracious me ! I quite forgot ! I ought not to have said a word about it . I promised them so faithfully ! What will Wickham say ? It was to be such a secret ! "
116971	116979	116981	116981	Jane	153	" If it was to be secret , "
116983	117001	116981	116981	Jane	153	" say not another word on the subject . You may depend upon my seeking no further . "
117002	117007	117009	117009	Elizabeth	81	" Oh ! certainly , "
117016	117024	117009	117009	Elizabeth	81	" we will ask you no questions . "
117025	117029	117031	117031	Lydia	83	" Thank you , "
117033	117053	117031	117031	Lydia	83	" for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry . "
117222	117228	117229	117229	she	81	" You may readily comprehend , "
117232	117312	117229	117229	she	81	" what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . Pray write instantly , and let me understand it — unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . "
117313	117321	117322	117322	she	81	" Not that I SHALL , though , "
117333	117364	117322	117322	she	81	" and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . "
117483	117489	119585	119586	Mr. Darcy	88	" Gracechurch street , Sept. 6 .
117490	117494	119585	119586	Mr. Darcy	88	" MY DEAR NIECE ,
117495	119539	119585	119586	Mr. Darcy	88	" I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a LITTLE writing will not comprise what I have to tell you . I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from YOU . Do n't think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on YOUR side . If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . Your uncle is as much surprised as I am — and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done . But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . Mr. Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as YOUR 'S seems to have been . He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both ; Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them . The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him . He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world . His character was to speak for itself . He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself . If he HAD ANOTHER motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than WE had ; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us . There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs. Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . She then took a large house in Edward - street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . This Mrs. Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town . But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished - for direction . They were in — — street . He saw Wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia . His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go . But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . She cared for none of her friends ; she wanted no help of his ; she would not hear of leaving Wickham . She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt had never been HIS design . He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill - consequences of Lydia 's flight on her own folly alone . He meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once . Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country . Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . They met several times , for there was much to be discussed . Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . Every thing being settled between THEM , Mr. Darcy 's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home . But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen , and Mr. Darcy found , on further inquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former . He did not leave his name , and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . On Saturday he came again . Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together . They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too . It was not all settled before Monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn . But our visitor was very obstinate . I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character , after all . He has been accused of many faults at different times , but THIS is the true one . Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ) , your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . They battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most . You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people . His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon HER , and his commission purchased . The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above . It was owing to him , to his reserve and want of proper consideration , that Wickham 's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . Perhaps there was some truth in THIS ; though I doubt whether HIS reserve , or ANYBODY 'S reserve , can be answerable for the event . But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for ANOTHER INTEREST in the affair . When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . I believe I have now told you every thing . It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . Lydia came to us ; and Wickham had constant admission to the house . HE was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane 's letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain . I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding . He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday . Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never bold enough to say before ) how much I like him . His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire . His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and THAT , if he marry PRUDENTLY , his wife may teach him . I thought him very sly;—he hardly ever mentioned your name . But slyness seems the fashion . Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park . A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing . But I must write no more . The children have been wanting me this half hour . Yours , very sincerely ,
119540	119544	119585	119586	Mr. Darcy	88	" M. GARDINER . "
120117	120131	120133	120133	he	132	" I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? "
120140	120145	120146	120146	she	81	" You certainly do , "
120152	120165	120146	120146	she	81	" but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . "
120166	120189	120242	120242	She	81	" I should be sorry indeed , if it were . We were always good friends ; and now we are better . "
120190	120199	120146	120146	she	81	" True . Are the others coming out ? "
120200	120241	120242	120242	She	81	" I do not know . Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton . And so , my dear sister , I find , from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . "
120248	120313	120146	120146	she	81	" I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle . And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ? Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me . But of course she did not mention my name to you . "
120314	120320	120378	120378	she	81	" Yes , she did . "
120321	120328	120146	120146	she	81	" And what did she say ? "
120329	120364	120378	120378	she	81	" That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had — not turned out well . At such a distance as THAT , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . "
120365	120368	120369	120369	he	2583	" Certainly , "
120389	120417	120384	120384	he	2583	" I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . We passed each other several times . I wonder what he can be doing there . "
120418	120429	120431	120431	Elizabeth	81	" Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , "
120433	120450	120431	120431	Elizabeth	81	" It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . "
120451	120475	120384	120384	he	2583	" Undoubtedly . Did you see him while you were at Lambton ? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . "
120476	120486	120431	120431	Elizabeth	81	" Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . "
120487	120494	120384	120384	he	2583	" And do you like her ? "
120495	120499	120431	120431	Elizabeth	81	" Very much . "
120500	120546	120384	120384	he	2583	" I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . When I last saw her , she was not very promising . I am very glad you liked her . I hope she will turn out well . "
120547	120563	120431	120431	Elizabeth	81	" I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . "
120564	120574	120384	120384	he	2583	" Did you go by the village of Kympton ? "
120575	120584	120431	120431	Elizabeth	81	" I do not recollect that we did . "
120585	120618	120384	120384	he	2583	" I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had . A most delightful place!—Excellent Parsonage House ! It would have suited me in every respect . "
120619	120628	120431	120431	Elizabeth	81	" How should you have liked making sermons ? "
120629	120713	120384	120384	he	2583	" Exceedingly well . I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . One ought not to repine;—but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! The quiet , the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! But it was not to be . Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ? "
120714	120744	120431	120431	Elizabeth	81	" I have heard from authority , which I thought AS GOOD , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . "
120745	120769	120384	120384	he	2583	" You have . Yes , there was something in THAT ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . "
120770	120821	120431	120431	Elizabeth	81	" I DID hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon - making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly . "
120822	120852	120384	120384	he	2583	" You did ! and it was not wholly without foundation . You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . "
120901	120938	120888	120888	she	2586	" Come , Mr. Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . Do not let us quarrel about the past . In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . "
121062	121069	121070	121070	she	2586	" Oh ! my dear Lydia , "
121073	121080	121070	121070	she	2586	" when shall we meet again ? "
121081	121100	121156	121156	his	132	" Oh , lord ! I do n't know . Not these two or three years , perhaps . "
121101	121111	121070	121070	she	2586	" Write to me very often , my dear . "
121112	121146	121156	121156	his	132	" As often as I can . But you know married women have never much time for writing . My sisters may write to ME . They will have nothing else to do . "
121172	121180	121182	121183	Mr. Bennet	74	" He is as fine a fellow , "
121195	121239	121182	121183	Mr. Bennet	74	" as ever I saw . He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all . I am prodigiously proud of him . I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son - in - law . "
121254	121259	121261	121261	she	84	" I often think , "
121263	121284	121261	121261	she	84	" that there is nothing so bad as parting with one 's friends . One seems so forlorn without them . "
121285	121301	121303	121303	Elizabeth	81	" This is the consequence , you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , "
121305	121319	121303	121303	Elizabeth	81	" It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . "
121320	121365	121261	121261	she	84	" It is no such thing . Lydia does not leave me because she is married , but only because her husband 's regiment happens to be so far off . If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . "
121459	121474	121445	121445	She	84	" Well , well , and so Mr. Bingley is coming down , sister , "
121486	121584	121445	121445	She	84	" Well , so much the better . Not that I care about it , though . He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . And who knows what MAY happen ? But that is nothing to us . You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . And so , is it quite certain he is coming ? "
121585	121592	121594	121595	the other	585	" You may depend on it , "
121597	121686	121594	121595	the other	585	" for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . He comes down on Thursday at the latest , very likely on Wednesday . She was going to the butcher 's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed . "
121729	121842	121726	121726	she	83	" I saw you look at me to - day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed . But do n't imagine it was from any silly cause . I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I SHOULD be looked at . I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . Not that I am afraid of MYSELF , but I dread other people 's remarks . "
121915	121921	121922	121922	she	81	" Yet it is hard , "
121926	121956	121922	121922	she	81	" that this poor man can not come to a house which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation ! I WILL leave him to himself . "
122029	122041	122043	122044	Mrs. Bennet	84	" As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes , my dear , "
122046	122055	122043	122044	Mrs. Bennet	84	" you will wait on him of course . "
122056	122107	122108	122108	His	2608	" No , no . You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised , if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool 's errand again . "
122133	122141	122143	122143	he	2608	" ' Tis an etiquette I despise , "
122145	122184	122143	122143	he	2608	" If he wants our society , let him seek it . He knows where we live . I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again . "
122185	122254	122260	122260	she	2611	" Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . But , however , that sha n't prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon . That will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . "
122306	122318	122320	122320	Jane	153	" I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , "
122325	122390	122320	122320	Jane	153	" It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know , how much I suffer from what she says . Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over ! "
122391	122403	122405	122405	Elizabeth	81	" I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , "
122407	122443	122405	122405	Elizabeth	81	" but it is wholly out of my power . You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . "
122584	122594	122596	122596	Kitty	85	" There is a gentleman with him , mamma , "
122598	122604	122596	122596	Kitty	85	" who can it be ? "
122605	122625	122568	122568	she	81	" Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . "
122626	122629	122631	122631	Kitty	85	" La ! "
122633	122661	122631	122631	Kitty	85	" it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . Mr. what's - his - name . That tall , proud man . "
122662	122707	122708	122708	Jane	153	" Good gracious ! Mr. Darcy!—and so it does , I vow . Well , any friend of Mr. Bingley 's will always be welcome here , to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . "
123016	123025	123027	123027	she	153	" Let me first see how he behaves , "
123029	123039	123027	123027	she	153	" it will then be early enough for expectation . "
123484	123493	123495	123495	she	81	" Could I expect it to be otherwise ! "
123497	123504	123495	123495	she	81	" Yet why did he come ? "
123539	123554	123556	123557	Mrs. Bennet	84	" It is a long time , Mr. Bingley , since you went away , "
123565	123744	123559	123559	He	88	" I began to be afraid you would never come back again . People DID say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true . A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away . Miss Lucas is married and settled . And one of my own daughters . I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers . It was in The Times and The Courier , I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . It was only said , ' Lately , George Wickham , Esq . to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . It was my brother Gardiner 's drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . Did you see it ? "
123776	123794	123796	123797	her mother	235	" It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , "
123799	123896	123796	123797	her mother	235	" but at the same time , Mr. Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay I do not know how long . His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the — — shire , and of his being gone into the regulars . Thank Heaven ! he has SOME friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . "
123969	123982	123984	123985	her mother	235	" When you have killed all your own birds , Mr. Bingley , "
123987	124032	123984	123985	her mother	235	" I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet 's manor . I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you . "
124103	124111	124113	124113	she	81	" The first wish of my heart , "
124117	124156	124113	124113	she	81	" is never more to be in company with either of them . Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! Let me never see either one or the other again ! "
124329	124342	124343	124343	she	84	" You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr. Bingley , "
124346	124401	124343	124343	she	84	" for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned . I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . "
124539	124555	124557	124557	she	81	" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , "
124559	124566	124557	124557	she	81	" did he come at all ? "
124579	124641	124642	124642	Her	81	" He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? If he fears me , why come hither ? If he no longer cares for me , why silent ? Teasing , teasing , man ! I will think no more about him . "
124678	124681	124683	124683	she	81	" Now , "
124685	124745	124683	124683	she	81	" that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy . I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . I am glad he dines here on Tuesday . It will then be publicly seen that , on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . "
124746	124753	124755	124755	Elizabeth	81	" Yes , very indifferent indeed , "
124759	124767	124755	124755	Elizabeth	81	" Oh , Jane , take care . "
124768	124788	124683	124683	she	81	" My dear Lizzy , you can not think me so weak , as to be in danger now ? "
124789	124810	124755	124755	Elizabeth	81	" I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . "
125361	125372	125374	125374	she	81	" If he does not come to me , THEN , "
125376	125385	125374	125374	she	81	" I shall give him up for ever . "
125476	125499	125458	125461	one of the girls	2684	" The men sha n't come and part us , I am determined . We want none of them ; do we ? "
125546	125604	125540	125540	herself	81	" A man who has once been refused ! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? Is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings ! "
125630	125638	125623	125623	she	81	" Is your sister at Pemberley still ? "
125639	125649	125623	125623	she	81	" Yes , she will remain there till Christmas . "
125650	125662	125623	125623	she	81	" And quite alone ? Have all her friends left her ? "
125663	125683	125623	125623	she	81	" Mrs. Annesley is with her . The others have been gone on to Scarborough , these three weeks . "
125892	125896	125898	125898	she	84	" Well girls , "
125909	126099	125898	125898	she	84	" What say you to the day ? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . The venison was roasted to a turn — and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch . The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases ' last week ; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least . And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . Mrs. Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . And what do you think she said besides ? ' Ah ! Mrs. Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last . ' She did indeed . I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived — and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously . "
126175	126184	126186	126187	Miss Bennet	83	" It has been a very agreeable day , "
126191	126214	126186	126187	Miss Bennet	83	" The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . I hope we may often meet again . "
126218	126313	126215	126215	Elizabeth	81	" Lizzy , you must not do so . You must not suspect me . It mortifies me . I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it . I am perfectly satisfied , from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing , than any other man . "
126314	126320	126322	126323	her sister	324	" You are very cruel , "
126325	126342	126322	126323	her sister	324	" you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . "
126343	126355	126215	126215	Elizabeth	81	" How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! "
126356	126363	126322	126323	her sister	324	" And how impossible in others ! "
126364	126381	126215	126215	Elizabeth	81	" But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? "
126382	126429	126322	126323	her sister	324	" That is a question which I hardly know how to answer . We all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante . "
126503	126509	126511	126511	she	84	" Next time you call , "
126513	126522	126511	126511	she	84	" I hope we shall be more lucky . "
126555	126563	126578	126578	her	84	" Can you come to - morrow ? "
126628	126685	126620	126620	her	84	" My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down . He is come — Mr. Bingley is come . He is , indeed . Make haste , make haste . Here , Sarah , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . Never mind Miss Lizzy 's hair . "
126686	126697	126699	126699	Jane	153	" We will be down as soon as we can , "
126701	126724	126699	126699	Jane	153	" but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . "
126725	126754	126757	126757	her	153	" Oh ! hang Kitty ! what has she to do with it ? Come be quick , be quick ! Where is your sash , my dear ? "
126865	126887	126860	126860	she	85	" What is the matter mamma ? What do you keep winking at me for ? What am I to do ? "
126888	126901	126902	126902	She	153	" Nothing child , nothing . I did not wink at you . "
126929	126943	126919	126919	she	153	" Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , "
126994	127007	126983	126984	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . "
127014	127026	127028	127029	her mother	235	" We may as well leave them by themselves you know ; "
127040	127055	127028	127029	her mother	235	" Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room . "
127617	127623	127624	127624	she	81	" ' Tis too much ! "
127627	127648	127624	127624	she	81	" by far too much . I do not deserve it . Oh ! why is not everybody as happy ? "
127708	127717	127718	127718	she	81	" I must go instantly to my mother ; "
127721	127783	127718	127718	she	81	" I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself . He is gone to my father already . Oh ! Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall I bear so much happiness ! "
127845	127849	127851	127851	she	81	" And this , "
127853	127883	127851	127851	she	81	" is the end of all his friend 's anxious circumspection ! of all his sister 's falsehood and contrivance ! the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! "
127907	127913	127915	127915	he	78	" Where is your sister ? "
127924	127943	127944	127944	He	78	" With my mother up stairs . She will be down in a moment , I dare say . "
128216	128231	128207	128207	he	74	" Jane , I congratulate you . You will be a very happy woman . "
128248	128255	128256	128256	he	74	" You are a good girl ; "
128259	128332	128256	128256	he	74	" and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . I have not a doubt of your doing very well together . Your tempers are by no means unlike . You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . "
128333	128351	128364	128365	his wife	225	" I hope not so . Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me . "
128352	128362	128364	128365	his wife	225	" Exceed their income ! My dear Mr. Bennet , "
128367	128390	128364	128365	his wife	225	" what are you talking of ? Why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . "
128396	128499	128393	128394	her daughter	458	" Oh ! my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy ! I am sure I sha n't get a wink of sleep all night . I knew how it would be . I always said it must be so , at last . I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together . Oh ! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! "
128713	128721	128723	128723	she	153	" He has made me so happy , "
128728	128752	128723	128723	she	153	" by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! I had not believed it possible . "
128753	128759	128761	128761	Elizabeth	81	" I suspected as much , "
128763	128772	128723	128723	she	153	" But how did he account for it ? "
128773	128862	128723	128723	she	153	" It must have been his sister 's doing . They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I can not wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . "
128863	128871	128873	128873	Elizabeth	81	" That is the most unforgiving speech , "
128875	128906	128873	128873	Elizabeth	81	" that I ever heard you utter . Good girl ! It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley 's pretended regard . "
128907	128946	128723	128723	she	153	" Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of MY being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ! "
128947	128967	128873	128873	Elizabeth	81	" He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . "
129035	129047	129049	129049	Jane	153	" I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! "
129051	129090	129049	129049	Jane	153	" Oh ! Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! If I could but see YOU as happy ! If there WERE but such another man for you ! "
129091	129158	129174	129175	Mrs. Bennet	84	" If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you . Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . No , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time . "
129570	129590	129563	129563	she	84	" I hope you are well , Miss Bennet . That lady , I suppose , is your mother . "
129599	129610	129563	129563	she	84	" And THAT I suppose is one of your sisters . "
129611	129616	129618	129619	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Yes , madam , "
129629	129674	129618	129619	Mrs. Bennet	84	" She is my youngest girl but one . My youngest of all is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man who , I believe , will soon become a part of the family . "
129675	129684	129686	129687	Lady Catherine	85	" You have a very small park here , "
129693	129723	129747	129748	Mrs. Bennet	84	" It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas 's . "
129724	129746	129747	129748	Mrs. Bennet	84	" This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west . "
129763	129782	129747	129748	Mrs. Bennet	84	" May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well . "
129783	129797	129747	129748	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Yes , very well . I saw them the night before last . "
129875	129917	129926	129927	her mother	235	" Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn . I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . "
129918	129924	129926	129927	her mother	235	" Go , my dear , "
129929	129949	129926	129927	her mother	235	" and show her ladyship about the different walks . I think she will be pleased with the hermitage . "
130065	130076	130078	130078	she	81	" How could I ever think her like her nephew ? "
130104	130139	130095	130096	Lady Catherine	85	" You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . "
130146	130172	130140	130140	Elizabeth	81	" Indeed , you are mistaken , Madam . I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . "
130173	130177	130179	130180	her ladyship	3411	" Miss Bennet , "
130187	130356	130179	130180	her ladyship	3411	" you ought to know , that I am not to be trifled with . But however insincere YOU may choose to be , you shall not find ME so . My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it . A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago . I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Mr. Darcy . Though I KNOW it must be a scandalous falsehood , though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . "
130357	130367	130369	130369	Elizabeth	81	" If you believed it impossible to be true , "
130377	130397	130369	130369	Elizabeth	81	" I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . What could your ladyship propose by it ? "
130398	130411	130140	130140	Elizabeth	81	" At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted . "
130412	130425	130427	130427	Elizabeth	81	" Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , "
130430	130450	130427	130427	Elizabeth	81	" will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . "
130451	130485	130140	130140	Elizabeth	81	" If ! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? "
130486	130494	130427	130427	Elizabeth	81	" I never heard that it was . "
130495	130510	130140	130140	Elizabeth	81	" And can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? "
130511	130536	130427	130427	Elizabeth	81	" I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship . You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer . "
130537	130568	130140	130140	Elizabeth	81	" This is not to be borne . Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? "
130569	130579	130427	130427	Elizabeth	81	" Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . "
130580	130636	130140	130140	Elizabeth	81	" It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason . But your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . You may have drawn him in . "
130637	130652	130427	130427	Elizabeth	81	" If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . "
130653	130697	130140	130140	Elizabeth	81	" Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ? I have not been accustomed to such language as this . I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . "
130698	130722	130427	130427	Elizabeth	81	" But you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . "
130723	130766	130140	130140	Elizabeth	81	" Let me be rightly understood . This match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place . No , never . Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter . Now what have you to say ? "
130767	130792	130427	130427	Elizabeth	81	" Only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . "
130804	130947	130793	130794	Lady Catherine	85	" The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . From their infancy , they have been intended for each other . It was the favourite wish of HIS mother , as well as of her 's . While in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh ? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? "
130948	131056	130140	130140	Elizabeth	81	" Yes , and I had heard it before . But what is that to me ? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh . You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage . Its completion depended on others . If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? "
131057	131137	130793	130794	Lady Catherine	85	" Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it . Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by everyone connected with him . Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . "
131138	131144	131146	131146	Elizabeth	81	" These are heavy misfortunes , "
131148	131182	131146	131146	Elizabeth	81	" But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . "
131183	131274	130793	130794	Lady Catherine	85	" Obstinate , headstrong girl ! I am ashamed of you ! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? Is nothing due to me on that score ? Let us sit down . You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be dissuaded from it . I have not been used to submit to any person 's whims . I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment . "
131275	131297	131146	131146	Elizabeth	81	" THAT will make your ladyship 's situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on me . "
131298	131443	130793	130794	Lady Catherine	85	" I will not be interrupted . Hear me in silence . My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . They are descended , on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father 's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient — though untitled — families . Their fortune on both sides is splendid . They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune . Is this to be endured ! But it must not , shall not be . If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up . "
131444	131478	131146	131146	Elizabeth	81	" In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman 's daughter ; so far we are equal . "
131479	131511	130793	130794	Lady Catherine	85	" True . You ARE a gentleman 's daughter . But who was your mother ? Who are your uncles and aunts ? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . "
131512	131519	131521	131521	Elizabeth	81	" Whatever my connections may be , "
131523	131540	131521	131521	Elizabeth	81	" if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to YOU . "
131541	131554	130793	130794	Lady Catherine	85	" Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? "
131586	131591	131574	131574	she	81	" I am not . "
131597	131612	131592	131593	Lady Catherine	85	" And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? "
131613	131623	131574	131574	she	81	" I will make no promise of the kind . "
131624	131672	131592	131593	Lady Catherine	85	" Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished . I expected to find a more reasonable young woman . But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede . I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require . "
131673	131844	131574	131574	she	81	" And I certainly NEVER shall give it . I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable . Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise make their marriage at all more probable ? Supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged . You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these . How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I can not tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . I must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject . "
131845	131969	131592	131593	Lady Catherine	85	" Not so hasty , if you please . I have by no means done . To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add . I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister 's infamous elopement . I know it all ; that the young man 's marrying her was a patched - up business , at the expence of your father and uncles . And is such a girl to be my nephew 's sister ? Is her husband , is the son of his late father 's steward , to be his brother ? Heaven and earth!—of what are you thinking ? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ? "
131970	131980	131981	131981	she	2811	" You can now have nothing farther to say , "
131985	132004	131981	131981	she	2811	" You have insulted me in every possible method . I must beg to return to the house . "
132028	132068	131592	131593	Lady Catherine	85	" You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! Unfeeling , selfish girl ! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? "
132069	132085	132009	132009	she	2811	" Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say . You know my sentiments . "
132086	132095	131592	131593	Lady Catherine	85	" You are then resolved to have him ? "
132096	132141	132009	132009	she	2811	" I have said no such thing . I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to YOU , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . "
132142	132193	131592	131593	Lady Catherine	85	" It is well . You refuse , then , to oblige me . You refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . "
132194	132204	132206	132206	Elizabeth	81	" Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , "
132208	132288	132206	132206	Elizabeth	81	" have any possible claim on me , in the present instance . No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy . And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former WERE excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment 's concern — and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . "
132289	132354	131592	131593	Lady Catherine	85	" And this is your real opinion ! This is your final resolve ! Very well . I shall now know how to act . Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified . I came to try you . I hoped to find you reasonable ; but , depend upon it , I will carry my point . "
132382	132413	132379	132379	she	85	" I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . I send no compliments to your mother . You deserve no such attention . I am most seriously displeased . "
132478	132485	132487	132488	her daughter	458	" She did not choose it , "
132490	132495	132487	132488	her daughter	458	" she would go . "
132496	132570	132487	132488	her daughter	458	" She is a very fine - looking woman ! and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well . She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so , passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? "
133071	133093	133094	133094	she	85	" If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days , "
133097	133149	133094	133094	she	85	" I shall know how to understand it . I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy . If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . "
133238	133241	133243	133243	he	238	" Lizzy , "
133245	133259	133243	133243	he	238	" I was going to look for you ; come into my room . "
133335	133389	133331	133331	He	238	" I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony . Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest . "
133449	133490	133445	133446	her father	238	" You look conscious . Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even YOUR sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer . This letter is from Mr. Collins . "
133491	133504	133445	133446	her father	238	" From Mr. Collins ! and what can HE have to say ? "
133505	133575	133445	133446	her father	238	" Something very much to the purpose of course . He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which , it seems , he has been told by some of the good - natured , gossiping Lucases . I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point . What relates to yourself , is as follows . "
133576	133667	133445	133446	her father	238	" Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another ; of which we have been advertised by the same authority . Your daughter Elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . "
133668	133682	133445	133446	her father	238	" Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? "
133683	133763	133445	133446	her father	238	" This young gentleman is blessed , in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage . Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman 's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . "
133764	133783	133445	133446	her father	238	" Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? But now it comes out . "
133784	133819	133445	133446	her father	238	" My motive for cautioning you is as follows . We have reason to imagine that his aunt , Lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . "
133820	133906	133445	133446	her father	238	" MR . DARCY , you see , is the man ! Now , Lizzy , I think I HAVE surprised you . Could he , or the Lucases , have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ? Mr. Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! It is admirable ! "
133941	133947	133445	133446	her father	238	" Are you not diverted ? "
133948	133957	133445	133446	her father	238	" Oh ! yes . Pray read on . "
133958	134068	133445	133446	her father	238	" After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it become apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match . I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . "
134069	134075	133445	133446	her father	238	" Mr. Collins moreover adds , "
134076	134205	133445	133446	her father	238	" I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known . I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it . You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . "
134206	134296	133445	133446	her father	238	" That is his notion of christian forgiveness ! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte 's situation , and his expectation of a young olive - branch . But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . You are not going to be Missish , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? "
134297	134300	134302	134302	Elizabeth	81	" Oh ! "
134304	134316	134302	134302	Elizabeth	81	" I am excessively diverted . But it is so strange ! "
134317	134434	133445	133446	her father	238	" Yes — THAT is what makes it amusing . Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but HIS perfect indifference , and YOUR pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr. Collins 's correspondence for any consideration . Nay , when I read a letter of his , I can not help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son - in - law . And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? Did she call to refuse her consent ? "
134793	134887	134789	134789	she	85	" Mr. Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your 's . I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister . Ever since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . "
134888	134896	134898	134898	Darcy	88	" I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , "
134908	134942	134898	134898	Darcy	88	" that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted . "
134943	135024	134789	134789	she	85	" You must not blame my aunt . Lydia 's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . "
135025	135032	135033	135033	he	88	" If you WILL thank me , "
135036	135092	135033	135033	he	88	" let it be for yourself alone . That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . But your FAMILY owe me nothing . Much as I respect them , I believe I thought only of YOU . "
135112	135160	135108	135109	her companion	1672	" You are too generous to trifle with me . If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once . MY affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . "
135477	135484	135486	135486	he	1672	" It taught me to hope , "
135488	135534	135486	135486	he	1672	" as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , frankly and openly . "
135543	135581	135535	135535	Elizabeth	81	" Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of THAT . After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . "
135582	135637	135486	135486	he	1672	" What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ? For , though your accusations were ill - founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof . It was unpardonable . I can not think of it without abhorrence . "
135638	135654	135656	135656	Elizabeth	81	" We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , "
135658	135687	135656	135656	Elizabeth	81	" The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility . "
135688	135796	135486	135486	he	1672	" I can not be so easily reconciled to myself . The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me . Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : ' had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . ' Those were your words . You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me;—though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . "
135797	135829	135656	135656	Elizabeth	81	" I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . "
135830	135885	135486	135486	he	1672	" I can easily believe it . You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , I am sure you did . The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me . "
135886	135919	135656	135656	Elizabeth	81	" Oh ! do not repeat what I then said . These recollections will not do at all . I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . "
135925	135929	135931	135931	he	88	" Did it , "
135933	135958	135931	135931	he	88	" did it soon make you think better of me ? Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? "
135980	135984	135986	135986	he	88	" I knew , "
135988	136047	135986	135986	he	88	" that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . I hope you have destroyed the letter . There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again . I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . "
136048	136098	135959	135959	She	2865	" The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . "
136099	136106	136108	136108	Darcy	88	" When I wrote that letter , "
136110	136135	136108	136108	Darcy	88	" I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . "
136136	136224	135959	135959	She	2865	" The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . The adieu is charity itself . But think no more of the letter . The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten . You must learn some of my philosophy . Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . "
136225	136525	136108	136108	Darcy	88	" I can not give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of innocence . But with me , it is not so . Painful recollections will intrude which can not , which ought not , to be repelled . I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper . I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . Unfortunately an only son ( for many years an only child ) , I was spoilt by my parents , who , though good themselves ( my father , particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable ) , allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing ; to care for none beyond my own family circle ; to think meanly of all the rest of the world ; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth ! What do I not owe you ! You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . By you , I was properly humbled . I came to you without a doubt of my reception . You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . "
136526	136536	136795	136795	He	88	" Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? "
136537	136561	136108	136108	Darcy	88	" Indeed I had . What will you think of my vanity ? I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . "
136562	136605	136795	136795	He	88	" My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally , I assure you . I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . How you must have hated me after THAT evening ? "
136606	136628	136108	136108	Darcy	88	" Hate you ! I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . "
136629	136654	136795	136795	He	88	" I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me , when we met at Pemberley . You blamed me for coming ? "
136655	136665	136108	136108	Darcy	88	" No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . "
136666	136707	136795	136795	He	88	" Your surprise could not be greater than MINE in being noticed by you . My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive MORE than my due . "
136708	136713	136715	136715	Darcy	88	" My object then , "
136717	136794	136715	136715	Darcy	88	" was to show you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . "
136932	136942	136954	136954	Darcy	146	" What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane ! "
136972	136981	136983	136983	Elizabeth	81	" I must ask whether you were surprised ? "
136985	137003	136983	136983	Elizabeth	81	" Not at all . When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . "
137004	137021	137024	137024	he	88	" That is to say , you had given your permission . I guessed as much . "
137041	137051	137053	137053	he	88	" On the evening before my going to London , "
137055	137157	137053	137053	he	88	" I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent . His surprise was great . He had never had the slightest suspicion . I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . "
137172	137181	137183	137183	she	81	" Did you speak from your own observation , "
137185	137204	137183	137183	she	81	" when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? "
137205	137234	137164	137164	his	2872	" From the former . I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here ; and I was convinced of her affection . "
137235	137251	137183	137183	she	81	" And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . "
137252	137374	137164	137164	his	2872	" It did . Bingley is most unaffectedly modest . His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine made every thing easy . I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him . He was angry . But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister 's sentiments . He has heartily forgiven me now . "
137461	137474	137444	137444	he	78	" My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? "
137692	137724	137686	137686	she	81	" You are joking , Lizzy . This can not be!—engaged to Mr. Darcy ! No , no , you shall not deceive me . I know it to be impossible . "
137725	137781	137686	137686	she	81	" This is a wretched beginning indeed ! My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . I speak nothing but the truth . He still loves me , and we are engaged . "
137788	137806	137782	137782	Jane	153	" Oh , Lizzy ! it can not be . I know how much you dislike him . "
137807	137861	137686	137686	she	81	" You know nothing of the matter . THAT is all to be forgot . Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now . But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable . This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . "
137881	137898	137900	137900	Jane	153	" Good Heaven ! can it be really so ! Yet now I must believe you , "
137902	137938	137900	137900	Jane	153	" My dear , dear Lizzy , I would — I do congratulate you — but are you certain ? forgive the question — are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? "
137939	137983	137869	137869	Elizabeth	81	" There can be no doubt of that . It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . But are you pleased , Jane ? Shall you like to have such a brother ? "
137984	138048	137900	137900	Jane	153	" Very , very much . Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . And do you really love him quite well enough ? Oh , Lizzy ! do any thing rather than marry without affection . Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? "
138049	138073	137869	137869	Elizabeth	81	" Oh , yes ! You will only think I feel MORE than I ought to do , when I tell you all . "
138074	138080	137900	137900	Jane	153	" What do you mean ? "
138081	138105	137869	137869	Elizabeth	81	" Why , I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley . I am afraid you will be angry . "
138106	138147	137900	137900	Jane	153	" My dearest sister , now BE serious . I want to talk very seriously . Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay . Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? "
138148	138182	137869	137869	Elizabeth	81	" It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began . But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . "
138224	138231	138233	138233	she	2885	" Now I am quite happy , "
138235	138336	138233	138233	she	2885	" for you will be as happy as myself . I always had a value for him . Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley 's friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! I owe all that I know of it to another , not to you . "
138406	138410	138412	138413	Mrs. Bennet	84	" Good gracious ! "
138425	138508	138416	138416	she	84	" if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? I had no notion but he would go a - shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company . What shall we do with him ? Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley 's way . "
138572	138594	138566	138566	he	78	" Mrs. Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? "
138595	138607	138609	138610	Mrs. Bennet	84	" I advise Mr. Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , "
138612	138637	138609	138610	Mrs. Bennet	84	" to walk to Oakham Mount this morning . It is a nice long walk , and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view . "
138638	138648	138650	138651	Mr. Bingley	78	" It may do very well for the others , "
138653	138672	138650	138651	Mr. Bingley	78	" but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . Wo n't it , Kitty ? "
138717	138784	138710	138711	Mrs. Bennet	84	" I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . But I hope you will not mind it : it is all for Jane 's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . So , do not put yourself to inconvenience . "
139059	139072	139073	139073	She	81	" Go to your father , he wants you in the library . "
139091	139094	139096	139096	he	238	" Lizzy , "
139098	139124	139096	139096	he	238	" what are you doing ? Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? Have not you always hated him ? "
139184	139226	139169	139169	she	81	" Or , in other words , you are determined to have him . He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane . But will they make you happy ? "
139227	139234	139236	139236	Elizabeth	81	" Have you any other objection , "
139238	139246	139236	139236	Elizabeth	81	" than your belief of my indifference ? "
139247	139277	139169	139169	she	81	" None at all . We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . "
139278	139287	139288	139288	she	81	" I do , I do like him , "
139297	139337	139294	139294	her	81	" I love him . Indeed he has no improper pride . He is perfectly amiable . You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . "
139338	139341	139343	139344	her father	238	" Lizzy , "
139346	139491	139343	139344	her father	238	" I have given him my consent . He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask . I now give it to YOU , if you are resolved on having him . But let me advise you to think better of it . I know your disposition , Lizzy . I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior . Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . You could scarcely escape discredit and misery . My child , let me not have the grief of seeing YOU unable to respect your partner in life . You know not what you are about . "
139586	139592	139594	139594	he	88	" Well , my dear , "
139601	139635	139594	139594	he	88	" I have no more to say . If this be the case , he deserves you . I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to anyone less worthy . "
139661	139775	139657	139657	her	81	" This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! And so , Darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow 's debts , and got him his commission ! So much the better . It will save me a world of trouble and economy . Had it been your uncle 's doing , I must and WOULD have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way . I shall offer to pay him to - morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . "
139817	139839	139812	139812	she	81	" If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . "
140036	140184	140009	140009	She	84	" Good gracious ! Lord bless me ! only think ! dear me ! Mr. Darcy ! Who would have thought it ! And is it really true ? Oh ! my sweetest Lizzy ! how rich and how great you will be ! What pin - money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! Jane 's is nothing to it — nothing at all . I am so pleased — so happy . Such a charming man!—so handsome ! so tall!—Oh , my dear Lizzy ! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before . I hope he will overlook it . Dear , dear Lizzy . A house in town ! Every thing that is charming ! Three daughters married ! Ten thousand a year ! Oh , Lord ! What will become of me . I shall go distracted . "
140233	140238	140239	140239	she	235	" My dearest child , "
140242	140309	140239	140239	she	235	" I can think of nothing else ! Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! ' Tis as good as a Lord ! And a special licence . You must and shall be married by a special licence . But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to - morrow . "
140448	140461	140463	140463	he	74	" I admire all my three sons - in - law highly , "
140465	140489	140463	140463	he	74	" Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like YOUR husband quite as well as Jane 's . "
140515	140521	140523	140523	she	81	" How could you begin ? "
140525	140553	140523	140523	she	81	" I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? "
140554	140599	140499	140499	she	81	" I can not fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . It is too long ago . I was in the middle before I knew that I HAD begun . "
140600	140655	140523	140523	she	81	" My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners — my behaviour to YOU was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . Now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? "
140656	140667	140499	140499	she	81	" For the liveliness of your mind , I did . "
140668	140840	140523	140523	she	81	" You may as well call it impertinence at once . It was very little less . The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking , and looking , and thinking for YOUR approbation alone . I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike THEM . Had you not been really amiable , you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you . There — I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . To be sure , you knew no actual good of me — but nobody thinks of THAT when they fall in love . "
140841	140859	140499	140499	she	81	" Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield ? "
140860	140984	140523	140523	she	81	" Dearest Jane ! who could have done less for her ? But make a virtue of it by all means . My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last . What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? "
140985	140999	140499	140499	she	81	" Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . "
141000	141006	140523	140523	she	81	" But I was embarrassed . "
141007	141012	140499	140499	she	81	" And so was I. "
141013	141027	140523	140523	she	81	" You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . "
141028	141038	140499	140499	she	81	" A man who had felt less , might . "
141039	141152	140523	140523	she	81	" How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! But I wonder how long you WOULD have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . I wonder when you WOULD have spoken , if I had not asked you ! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . TOO MUCH , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise ? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject . This will never do . "
141153	141236	140499	140499	she	81	" You need not distress yourself . The moral will be perfectly fair . Lady Catherine 's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts . I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your 's . My aunt 's intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing . "
141237	141294	140523	140523	she	81	" Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequence ? "
141295	141363	140499	140499	she	81	" My real purpose was to see YOU , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me . My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . "
141364	141381	140523	140523	she	81	" Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her ? "
141382	141419	140499	140499	she	81	" I am more likely to want more time than courage , Elizabeth . But it ought to done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . "
141420	141467	140523	140523	she	81	" And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . "
141537	141764	141512	141512	she	81	" I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , I was too cross to write . You supposed more than really existed . But NOW suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you can not greatly err . You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes . How could I be so silly as to wish it ! Your idea of the ponies is delightful . We will go round the Park every day . I am the happiest creature in the world . Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice . I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me . You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas . Yours , etc . "
141798	141801	141765	141766	Mr. Darcy	88	" DEAR SIR ,
141802	141850	141879	141879	She	90	" I must trouble you once more for congratulations . Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy . Console Lady Catherine as well as you can . But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew . He has more to give .
141851	141857	141879	141879	She	90	" Yours sincerely , etc . "
142928	142932	142894	142894	Lydia	83	" MY DEAR LIZZY ,
142933	143050	142894	142894	Lydia	83	" I wish you joy . If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but however , do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it , if you had rather not .
143051	143056	142894	142894	Lydia	83	" Yours , etc . "
