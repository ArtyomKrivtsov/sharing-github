76	82	84	85	his lady	223	" My dear Mr. Bennet , "
91	103	84	85	his lady	223	" have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? "
112	120	104	105	Mr. Bennet	75	" But it is , returned she ; "
143	155	157	158	his wife	225	" Do you not want to know who has taken it ? "
161	177	104	105	Mr. Bennet	75	" YOU want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . "
183	272	104	105	Mr. Bennet	75	" Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it , that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . "
273	279	104	105	Mr. Bennet	75	" What is his name ? "
280	283	104	105	Mr. Bennet	75	" Bingley . "
284	291	104	105	Mr. Bennet	75	" Is he married or single ? "
292	326	104	105	Mr. Bennet	75	" Oh ! Single , my dear , to be sure ! A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . What a fine thing for our girls ! "
327	337	104	105	Mr. Bennet	75	" How so ? How can it affect them ? "
338	344	346	347	his wife	225	" My dear Mr. Bennet , "
349	371	346	347	his wife	225	" how can you be so tiresome ! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . "
372	381	104	105	Mr. Bennet	75	" Is that his design in settling here ? "
382	421	346	347	his wife	225	" Design ! Nonsense , how can you talk so ! But it is very likely that he MAY fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . "
422	474	104	105	Mr. Bennet	75	" I see no occasion for that . You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party . "
475	524	346	347	his wife	225	" My dear , you flatter me . I certainly HAVE had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now . When a woman has five grown - up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . "
525	541	104	105	Mr. Bennet	75	" In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . "
542	563	346	347	his wife	225	" But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . "
564	577	104	105	Mr. Bennet	75	" It is more than I engage for , I assure you . "
578	644	346	347	his wife	225	" But consider your daughters . Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general , you know , they visit no newcomers . Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for US to visit him if you do not . "
645	706	104	105	Mr. Bennet	75	" You are over - scrupulous , surely . I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . "
707	758	346	347	his wife	225	" I desire you will do no such thing . Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good - humoured as Lydia . But you are always giving HER the preference . "
759	770	772	772	he	228	" They have none of them much to recommend them , "
774	796	772	772	he	228	" they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . "
797	829	346	347	his wife	225	" Mr. Bennet , how CAN you abuse your own children in such a way ? You take delight in vexing me . You have no compassion for my poor nerves . "
830	868	772	772	he	228	" You mistake me , my dear . I have a high respect for your nerves . They are my old friends . I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least . "
1038	1049	1032	1032	he	75	" I hope Mr. Bingley will like it , Lizzy . "
1050	1064	1066	1067	her mother	235	" We are not in a way to know WHAT Mr. Bingley likes , "
1070	1078	1066	1067	her mother	235	" since we are not to visit . "
1079	1086	1088	1088	Elizabeth	82	" But you forget , mamma , "
1090	1109	1088	1088	Elizabeth	82	" that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him . "
1110	1147	1177	1178	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing . She has two nieces of her own . She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . "
1148	1154	1156	1157	Mr. Bennet	75	" No more have I , "
1159	1176	1156	1157	Mr. Bennet	75	" and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . "
1200	1228	1177	1178	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Do n't keep coughing so , Kitty , for Heaven 's sake ! Have a little compassion on my nerves . You tear them to pieces . "
1229	1238	1240	1241	her father	238	" Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , "
1243	1249	1240	1241	her father	238	" she times them ill . "
1250	1260	1262	1262	Kitty	86	" I do not cough for my own amusement , "
1265	1276	1262	1262	Kitty	86	" When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? "
1277	1283	1177	1178	Mrs. Bennet	85	" To - morrow fortnight . "
1284	1291	1293	1294	her mother	235	" Aye , so it is , "
1296	1328	1293	1294	her mother	235	" and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before ; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . "
1329	1351	1177	1178	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to HER . "
1352	1376	1293	1294	her mother	235	" Impossible , Mr. Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teasing ? "
1377	1459	1177	1178	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I honour your circumspection . A fortnight 's acquaintance is certainly very little . One can not know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . But if WE do not venture somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their chance ; and , therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . "
1472	1477	1467	1468	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Nonsense , nonsense ! "
1478	1489	1491	1491	he	241	" What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? "
1493	1550	1491	1491	he	241	" Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? I can not quite agree with you THERE . What say you , Mary ? For you are a young lady of deep reflection , I know , and read great books and make extracts . "
1563	1571	1572	1572	he	241	" While Mary is adjusting her ideas , "
1575	1583	1572	1572	he	241	" let us return to Mr. Bingley . "
1584	1592	1594	1595	his wife	225	" I am sick of Mr. Bingley , "
1597	1654	1594	1595	his wife	225	" I am sorry to hear THAT ; but why did not you tell me that before ? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him . It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we can not escape the acquaintance now . "
1701	1773	1686	1686	she	225	" How good it was in you , my dear Mr. Bennet ! But I knew I should persuade you at last . I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . Well , how pleased I am ! and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now . "
1774	1788	1790	1791	Mr. Bennet	75	" Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , "
1821	1831	1832	1832	I	0	" said she , when the door was shut . "
1915	1915	1904	1905	Mr. Bingley	79	"
1916	1919	1921	1921	Lydia	84	" Oh ! "
1924	1942	1921	1921	Lydia	84	" I am not afraid ; for though I AM the youngest , I 'm the tallest . "
2132	2147	2149	2150	Mrs. Bennet	85	" If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , "
2155	2172	2149	2150	Mrs. Bennet	85	" and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . "
2921	2926	2928	2928	he	89	" Come , Darcy , "
2930	2957	2928	2928	he	89	" I must have you dance . I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . You had much better dance . "
2958	3019	2900	2901	Mr. Bingley	79	" I certainly shall not . You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable . Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . "
3020	3031	3033	3034	Mr. Bingley	79	" I would not be so fastidious as you are , "
3036	3073	3033	3034	Mr. Bingley	79	" for a kingdom ! Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . "
3074	3087	3089	3090	Mr. Darcy	89	" YOU are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , "
3099	3147	3158	3158	he	89	" Oh ! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say very agreeable . Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . "
3148	3154	3158	3158	he	89	" Which do you mean ? "
3179	3233	3171	3171	he	89	" She is tolerable , but not handsome enough to tempt ME ; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me . "
3496	3504	3506	3506	she	225	" Oh ! my dear Mr. Bennet , "
3511	3707	3506	3506	she	225	" we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . I wish you had been there . Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . Everybody said how well she looked ; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice ! Only think of THAT , my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ! But , however , he did not admire her at all ; indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . So he inquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . Then the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the BOULANGER — "
3708	3718	3720	3721	her husband	254	" If he had had any compassion for ME , "
3724	3758	3720	3721	her husband	254	" he would not have danced half so much ! For God 's sake , say no more of his partners . O that he had sprained his ankle in the first place ! "
3759	3809	3720	3721	her husband	254	" Oh ! my dear , I am quite delighted with him . He is so excessively handsome ! And his sisters are charming women . I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses . I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst 's gown — "
3856	3863	3864	3864	she	321	" But I can assure you , "
3867	3957	3864	3864	she	321	" that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting HIS fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him ! He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! Not handsome enough to dance with ! I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set - downs . I quite detest the man . "
3992	4004	4006	4006	she	323	" He is just what a young man ought to be , "
4008	4033	4006	4006	she	323	" sensible , good - humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners!—so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! "
4034	4040	4042	4042	Elizabeth	82	" He is also handsome , "
4044	4065	4042	4042	Elizabeth	82	" which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can . His character is thereby complete . "
4066	4090	4006	4006	she	323	" I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . I did not expect such a compliment . "
4091	4186	4042	4042	Elizabeth	82	" Did not you ? I did for you . But that is one great difference between us . Compliments always take YOU by surprise , and ME never . What could be more natural than his asking you again ? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . No thanks to his gallantry for that . Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . You have liked many a stupider person . "
4187	4191	4006	4006	she	323	" Dear Lizzy ! "
4192	4245	4042	4042	Elizabeth	82	" Oh ! you are a great deal too apt , you know , to like people in general . You never see a fault in anybody . All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life . "
4246	4266	4006	4006	she	323	" I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone ; but I always speak what I think . "
4267	4370	4042	4042	Elizabeth	82	" I know you do ; and it is THAT which makes the wonder . With YOUR good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! Affectation of candour is common enough — one meets with it everywhere . But to be candid without ostentation or design — to take the good of everybody 's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad — belongs to you alone . And so you like this man 's sisters , too , do you ? Their manners are not equal to his . "
4371	4421	4006	4006	she	323	" Certainly not — at first . But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . Miss Bingley is to live with her brother , and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . "
5470	5479	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	85	" YOU began the evening well , Charlotte , "
5492	5501	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	85	" YOU were Mr. Bingley 's first choice . "
5502	5514	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Yes ; but he seemed to like his second better . "
5515	5568	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Oh ! you mean Jane , I suppose , because he danced with her twice . To be sure that DID seem as if he admired her — indeed I rather believe he DID — I heard something about it — but I hardly know what — something about Mr. Robinson . "
5569	5658	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson ; did not I mention it to you ? Mr. Robinson 's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and WHICH he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question : ' Oh ! the eldest Miss Bennet , beyond a doubt ; there can not be two opinions on that point . ' "
5659	5692	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Upon my word ! Well , that is very decided indeed — that does seem as if — but , however , it may all come to nothing , you know . "
5693	5706	5708	5708	Charlotte	100	" MY overhearings were more to the purpose than YOURS , Eliza , "
5710	5732	5708	5708	Charlotte	100	" Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he?—poor Eliza!—to be only just TOLERABLE . "
5733	5799	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I beg you would not put it into Lizzy 's head to be vexed by his ill - treatment , for he is such a disagreeable man , that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half - an - hour without once opening his lips . "
5800	5813	5815	5815	Jane	154	" Are you quite sure , ma'am?—is not there a little mistake ? "
5817	5827	5815	5815	Jane	154	" I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her . "
5828	5862	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Aye — because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her ; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to . "
5863	5869	5871	5871	Jane	154	" Miss Bingley told me , "
5873	5893	5871	5871	Jane	154	" that he never speaks much , unless among his intimate acquaintances . With THEM he is remarkably agreeable . "
5894	5969	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I do not believe a word of it , my dear . If he had been so very agreeable , he would have talked to Mrs. Long . But I can guess how it was ; everybody says that he is eat up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise . "
5970	5982	5984	5985	Miss Lucas	92	" I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long , "
5987	5997	5984	5985	Miss Lucas	92	" but I wish he had danced with Eliza . "
5998	6004	6006	6007	her mother	235	" Another time , Lizzy , "
6009	6022	6006	6007	her mother	235	" I would not dance with HIM , if I were you . "
6023	6040	5481	5482	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I believe , ma'am , I may safely promise you NEVER to dance with him . "
6041	6045	6047	6048	Miss Lucas	92	" His pride , "
6050	6113	6047	6048	Miss Lucas	92	" does not offend ME so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . One can not wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , everything in his favour , should think highly of himself . If I may so express it , he has a RIGHT to be proud . "
6114	6120	6122	6122	Elizabeth	82	" That is very true , "
6124	6140	6122	6122	Elizabeth	82	" and I could easily forgive HIS pride , if he had not mortified MINE . "
6141	6144	6146	6146	Mary	87	" Pride , "
6158	6270	6146	6146	Mary	87	" is a very common failing , I believe . By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed ; that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . Vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonymously . A person may be proud without being vain . Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . "
6271	6281	6283	6285	a young Lucas	383	" If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy , "
6293	6320	6283	6285	a young Lucas	383	" I should not care how proud I was . I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine a day . "
6321	6334	6336	6337	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , "
6339	6358	6336	6337	Mrs. Bennet	85	" and if I were to see you at it , I should take away your bottle directly . "
6627	6634	6636	6636	Charlotte	100	" It may perhaps be pleasant , "
6638	6803	6636	6636	Charlotte	100	" to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . We can all BEGIN freely — a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . In nine cases out of ten a women had better show MORE affection than she feels . Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . "
6804	6843	6624	6625	Miss Lucas	92	" But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . If I can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton , indeed , not to discover it too . "
6844	6861	6636	6636	Charlotte	100	" Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane 's disposition as you do . "
6862	6887	6624	6625	Miss Lucas	92	" But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . "
6888	6985	6636	6636	Charlotte	100	" Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . But , though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and , as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . Jane should therefore make the most of every half - hour in which she can command his attention . When she is secure of him , there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses . "
6986	6994	6996	6996	Elizabeth	82	" Your plan is a good one , "
6998	7121	6996	6996	Elizabeth	82	" where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married , and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it . But these are not Jane 's feelings ; she is not acting by design . As yet , she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness . She has known him only a fortnight . She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined with him in company four times . This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . "
7122	7170	6636	6636	Charlotte	100	" Not as you represent it . Had she merely DINED with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together — and four evenings may do a great deal . "
7171	7212	6996	6996	Elizabeth	82	" Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt - un better than Commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . "
7213	7216	7218	7218	Charlotte	100	" Well , "
7220	7345	7218	7218	Charlotte	100	" I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . "
7346	7378	7412	7413	Mr. Darcy	89	" You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . "
7639	7646	7648	7648	she	324	" What does Mr. Darcy mean , "
7652	7662	7648	7648	she	324	" by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? "
7663	7675	7627	7629	Sir William Lucas	80	" That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer . "
7676	7724	7648	7648	she	324	" But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about . He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . "
7770	7802	7763	7763	she	92	" Did you not think , Mr. Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? "
7803	7820	7763	7763	she	92	" With great energy ; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic . "
7821	7828	7763	7763	she	92	" You are severe on us . "
7829	7840	7842	7843	Miss Lucas	92	" It will be HER turn soon to be teased , "
7845	7862	7842	7843	Miss Lucas	92	" I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . "
7863	7928	7937	7937	she	92	" You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody ! If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable ; but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . "
7940	7953	7937	7937	she	92	" Very well , if it must be so , it must . "
7961	7998	7937	7937	she	92	" There is a fine old saying , which everybody here is of course familiar with : ' Keep your breath to cool your porridge ' ; and I shall keep mine to swell my song . "
8240	8275	8235	8236	Sir William	80	" What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr. Darcy ! There is nothing like dancing after all . I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society . "
8276	8305	8306	8307	Sir William	80	" Certainly , sir ; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world . Every savage can dance . "
8311	8317	8318	8318	he	80	" Your friend performs delightfully , "
8331	8349	8318	8318	he	80	" and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Mr. Darcy . "
8350	8363	8306	8307	Sir William	80	" You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , sir . "
8364	8387	8318	8318	he	80	" Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight . Do you often dance at St. James 's ? "
8388	8393	8306	8307	Sir William	80	" Never , sir . "
8394	8409	8318	8318	he	80	" Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? "
8410	8428	8306	8307	Sir William	80	" It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . "
8429	8440	8318	8318	he	80	" You have a house in town , I conclude ? "
8445	8484	8485	8485	He	89	" I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself — for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . "
8531	8581	8512	8512	he	89	" My dear Miss Eliza , why are you not dancing ? Mr. Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner . You can not refuse to dance , I am sure when so much beauty is before you . "
8624	8657	8610	8610	she	82	" Indeed , sir , I have not the least intention of dancing . I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . "
8698	8752	8610	8610	she	82	" You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half - hour . "
8753	8760	8762	8762	Elizabeth	82	" Mr. Darcy is all politeness , "
8766	8800	8610	8610	she	82	" He is , indeed ; but , considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we can not wonder at his complaisance — for who would object to such a partner ? "
8836	8846	8833	8834	Miss Bingley	91	" I can guess the subject of your reverie . "
8847	8853	8820	8820	he	282	" I should imagine not . "
8854	8923	8833	8834	Miss Bingley	91	" You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner — in such society ; and indeed I am quite of you opinion . I was never more annoyed ! The insipidity , and yet the noise — the nothingness , and yet the self - importance of all those people ! What would I give to hear your strictures on them ! "
8924	8967	8820	8820	he	282	" You conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . My mind was more agreeably engaged . I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . "
9001	9006	8994	8995	Mr. Darcy	89	" Miss Elizabeth Bennet . "
9007	9012	9014	9015	Miss Bingley	91	" Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! "
9017	9041	9014	9015	Miss Bingley	91	" I am all astonishment . How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray , when am I to wish you joy ? "
9042	9088	8994	8995	Mr. Darcy	89	" That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask . A lady 's imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony , in a moment . I knew you would be wishing me joy . "
9089	9136	9014	9015	Miss Bingley	91	" Nay , if you are serious about it , I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled . You will be having a charming mother - in - law , indeed ; and , of course , she will always be at Pemberley with you . "
9571	9609	9566	9567	Mr. Bennet	75	" From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country . I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . "
9658	9666	9668	9669	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I am astonished , my dear , "
9671	9706	9668	9669	Mrs. Bennet	85	" that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . If I wished to think slightingly of anybody 's children , it should not be of my own , however . "
9707	9724	9629	9629	her	84	" If my children are silly , I must hope to be always sensible of it . "
9725	9741	9668	9669	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Yes — but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . "
9742	9789	9629	9629	her	84	" This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . "
9790	9908	9668	9669	Mrs. Bennet	85	" My dear Mr. Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother . When they get to our age , I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well — and , indeed , so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William 's in his regimentals . "
9909	9912	9914	9914	Lydia	84	" Mamma , "
9916	9955	9914	9914	Lydia	84	" my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson 's as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke 's library . "
10007	10043	9996	9996	she	85	" Well , Jane , who is it from ? What is it about ? What does he say ? Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . "
10044	10051	10053	10053	Jane	154	" It is from Miss Bingley , "
10061	10066	9996	9996	she	85	" MY DEAR FRIEND , —
10067	10144	9996	9996	she	85	" If you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day 's tete - a - tete between two women can never end without a quarrel . Come as soon as you can on receipt of this . My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.—Yours ever ,
10145	10148	9996	9996	she	85	" CAROLINE BINGLEY "
10149	10154	10156	10156	Lydia	84	" With the officers ! "
10158	10170	10156	10156	Lydia	84	" I wonder my aunt did not tell us of THAT . "
10171	10175	10177	10178	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Dining out , "
10180	10186	10177	10178	Mrs. Bennet	85	" that is very unlucky . "
10187	10194	10196	10196	Jane	154	" Can I have the carriage ? "
10198	10226	9996	9996	she	85	" No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . "
10227	10235	10237	10237	Elizabeth	82	" That would be a good scheme , "
10239	10254	10237	10237	Elizabeth	82	" if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . "
10255	10281	9996	9996	she	85	" Oh ! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley 's chaise to go to Meryton , and the Hursts have no horses to theirs . "
10282	10292	10237	10237	Elizabeth	82	" I had much rather go in the coach . "
10293	10325	9996	9996	she	85	" But , my dear , your father can not spare the horses , I am sure . They are wanted in the farm , Mr. Bennet , are they not ? "
10326	10341	10237	10237	Elizabeth	82	" They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . "
10342	10353	10355	10355	Elizabeth	82	" But if you have got them to - day , "
10357	10366	10355	10355	Elizabeth	82	" my mother 's purpose will be answered . "
10454	10465	10467	10468	Mrs. Bennet	85	" This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! "
10521	10526	10510	10513	a servant from Netherfield	463	" MY DEAREST LIZZY , —
10527	10611	10510	10513	a servant from Netherfield	463	" I find myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better . They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones — therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me — and , excepting a sore throat and headache , there is not much the matter with me.—Yours , etc . "
10612	10618	10620	10621	Mr. Bennet	75	" Well , my dear , "
10631	10670	10620	10621	Mr. Bennet	75	" if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness — if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley , and under your orders . "
10671	10725	10620	10621	Mr. Bennet	75	" Oh ! I am not afraid of her dying . People do not die of little trifling colds . She will be taken good care of . As long as she stays there , it is all very well . I would go an see her if I could have the carriage . "
10766	10774	10776	10777	her mother	235	" How can you be so silly , "
10779	10806	10761	10761	She	82	" as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . "
10807	10823	10776	10777	her mother	235	" I shall be very fit to see Jane — which is all I want . "
10824	10834	10836	10837	her father	238	" Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , "
10839	10846	10836	10837	her father	238	" to send for the horses ? "
10847	10882	10776	10777	her mother	235	" No , indeed , I do not wish to avoid the walk . The distance is nothing when one has a motive ; only three miles . I shall be back by dinner . "
10883	10892	10894	10894	Mary	87	" I admire the activity of your benevolence , "
10896	10925	10894	10894	Mary	87	" but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . "
10926	10937	10939	10939	Catherine	86	" We will go as far as Meryton with you , "
10957	10963	10965	10965	Lydia	84	" If we make haste , "
10972	10985	10965	10965	Lydia	84	" perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes . "
11895	11928	11886	11887	Mrs. Hurst	90	" She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . I shall never forget her appearance this morning . She really looked almost wild . "
11929	11976	11886	11887	Mrs. Hurst	90	" She did , indeed , Louisa . I could hardly keep my countenance . Very nonsensical to come at all ! Why must SHE be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? Her hair , so untidy , so blowsy ! "
11977	12018	11886	11887	Mrs. Hurst	90	" Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , I am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office . "
12019	12029	12031	12031	Bingley	91	" Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , "
12033	12067	12031	12031	Bingley	91	" but this was all lost upon me . I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning . Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . "
12068	12080	12082	12083	Miss Bingley	91	" YOU observed it , Mr. Darcy , I am sure , "
12085	12106	12082	12083	Miss Bingley	91	" and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see YOUR sister make such an exhibition . "
12107	12111	11886	11887	Mrs. Hurst	90	" Certainly not . "
12112	12172	12082	12083	Miss Bingley	91	" To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ankles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! What could she mean by it ? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country - town indifference to decorum . "
12173	12186	12188	12188	Bingley	91	" It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , "
12190	12198	12200	12201	Miss Bingley	91	" I am afraid , Mr. Darcy , "
12207	12221	12200	12201	Miss Bingley	91	" that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . "
12222	12227	12228	12228	he	503	" Not at all , "
12231	12239	12228	12228	he	503	" they were brightened by the exercise . "
12253	12307	12248	12249	Mrs. Hurst	90	" I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled . But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . "
12308	12325	12248	12249	Mrs. Hurst	90	" I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on Meryton . "
12326	12340	12248	12249	Mrs. Hurst	90	" Yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . "
12341	12346	12348	12349	her sister	324	" That is capital , "
12357	12368	12370	12370	Bingley	91	" If they had uncles enough to fill ALL Cheapside , "
12372	12383	12370	12370	Bingley	91	" it would not make them one jot less agreeable . "
12384	12403	12405	12405	Darcy	89	" But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , "
12585	12593	12595	12595	he	88	" Do you prefer reading to cards ? "
12597	12603	12595	12595	he	88	" that is rather singular . "
12604	12609	12611	12612	Miss Bingley	91	" Miss Eliza Bennet , "
12614	12632	12611	12612	Miss Bingley	91	" despises cards . She is a great reader , and has no pleasure in anything else . "
12633	12643	12645	12645	Elizabeth	82	" I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , "
12647	12663	12645	12645	Elizabeth	82	" I am NOT a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . "
12664	12676	12678	12678	Bingley	91	" In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , "
12680	12695	12678	12678	Bingley	91	" and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well . "
12730	12769	12716	12716	He	88	" And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever looked into . "
12785	12790	12792	12793	Miss Bingley	91	" I am astonished , "
12795	12821	12792	12793	Miss Bingley	91	" that my father should have left so small a collection of books . What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr. Darcy ! "
12822	12829	12830	12830	he	88	" It ought to be good , "
12833	12843	12830	12830	he	88	" it has been the work of many generations . "
12844	12862	12792	12793	Miss Bingley	91	" And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books . "
12863	12880	12830	12830	he	88	" I can not comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . "
12881	12920	12792	12793	Miss Bingley	91	" Neglect ! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . Charles , when you build YOUR house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . "
12921	12927	12830	12830	he	88	" I wish it may . "
12928	12963	12792	12793	Miss Bingley	91	" But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . "
12964	12981	12830	12830	he	88	" With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it . "
12982	12991	12792	12793	Miss Bingley	91	" I am talking of possibilities , Charles . "
12992	13014	12830	12830	he	88	" Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation . "
13066	13066	13042	13042	she	82	"
13067	13076	13078	13079	Miss Bingley	91	" Is Georgiana much grown since the spring ? "
13081	13091	13078	13079	Miss Bingley	91	" will she be as tall as I am ? "
13092	13112	13042	13042	she	82	" I think she will . She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet 's height , or rather taller . "
13113	13156	13078	13079	Miss Bingley	91	" How I long to see her again ! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much . Such a countenance , such manners ! And so extremely accomplished for her age ! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite . "
13157	13164	13166	13166	Bingley	79	" It is amazing to me , "
13168	13185	13166	13166	Bingley	79	" how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are . "
13186	13201	13078	13079	Miss Bingley	91	" All young ladies accomplished ! My dear Charles , what do you mean ? "
13202	13261	13166	13166	Bingley	79	" Yes , all of them , I think . They all paint tables , cover screens , and net purses . I scarcely know anyone who can not do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . "
13262	13272	13274	13274	Darcy	89	" Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , "
13276	13349	13274	13274	Darcy	89	" has too much truth . The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen . But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . I can not boast of knowing more than half - a - dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . "
13350	13358	13360	13361	Miss Bingley	91	" Nor I , I am sure , "
13363	13366	13368	13368	Elizabeth	82	" Then , "
13370	13385	13368	13368	Elizabeth	82	" you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . "
13386	13398	13274	13274	Darcy	89	" Yes , I do comprehend a great deal in it . "
13399	13404	13406	13408	his faithful assistant	519	" Oh ! certainly , "
13410	13495	13406	13408	his faithful assistant	519	" no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with . A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half - deserved . "
13496	13503	13505	13505	Darcy	89	" All this she must possess , "
13507	13530	13505	13505	Darcy	89	" and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . "
13531	13554	13406	13408	his faithful assistant	519	" I am no longer surprised at your knowing ONLY six accomplished women . I rather wonder now at your knowing ANY . "
13555	13572	13505	13505	Darcy	89	" Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this ?
13573	13601	13406	13408	his faithful assistant	519	" I never saw such a woman . I never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe united . "
13668	13672	13674	13675	Miss Bingley	91	" Elizabeth Bennet , "
13685	13735	13674	13675	Miss Bingley	91	" is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it succeeds . But , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art . "
13736	13739	13741	13741	Darcy	89	" Undoubtedly , "
13751	13777	13741	13741	Darcy	89	" there is a meanness in ALL the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation . Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable . "
14209	14216	14218	14218	her	85	" Indeed I have , sir , "
14221	14254	14218	14218	her	85	" She is a great deal too ill to be moved . Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her . We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . "
14255	14258	14260	14260	Bingley	91	" Removed ! "
14262	14284	14260	14260	Bingley	91	" It must not be thought of . My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . "
14285	14294	14296	14297	Miss Bingley	91	" You may depend upon it , Madam , "
14303	14318	14296	14297	Miss Bingley	91	" that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us . "
14327	14332	14333	14333	she	85	" I am sure , "
14336	14469	14333	14333	she	85	" if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper I have ever met with . I often tell my other girls they are nothing to HER . You have a sweet room here , Mr. Bingley , and a charming prospect over the gravel walk . I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . You will not think of quitting it in a hurry , I hope , though you have but a short lease . "
14470	14480	14482	14482	he	549	" Whatever I do is done in a hurry , "
14484	14517	14482	14482	he	549	" and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes . At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . "
14518	14530	14532	14532	Elizabeth	82	" That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , "
14534	14544	14546	14546	he	549	" You begin to comprehend me , do you ? "
14552	14562	14482	14482	he	549	" Oh ! yes — I understand you perfectly . "
14563	14587	14482	14482	he	549	" I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful . "
14588	14617	14482	14482	he	549	" That is as it happens . It does not follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . "
14618	14621	14482	14482	he	549	" Lizzy , "
14626	14650	14482	14482	he	549	" remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . "
14651	14658	14660	14660	Bingley	79	" I did not know before , "
14663	14679	14660	14660	Bingley	79	" that your were a studier of character . It must be an amusing study . "
14680	14698	14482	14482	he	549	" Yes , but intricate characters are the MOST amusing . They have at least that advantage . "
14699	14703	14705	14705	Darcy	89	" The country , "
14707	14735	14705	14705	Darcy	89	" can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study . In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society . "
14736	14757	14482	14482	he	549	" But people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . "
14758	14763	14765	14766	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Yes , indeed , "
14778	14798	14765	14766	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I assure you there is quite as much of THAT going on in the country as in town . "
14836	14877	14833	14833	her	85	" I can not see that London has any great advantage over the country , for my part , except the shops and public places . The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is it not , Mr. Bingley ? "
14878	14886	14887	14887	he	89	" When I am in the country , "
14890	14926	14887	14887	he	89	" I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same . They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . "
14927	14943	14833	14833	her	85	" Aye — that is because you have the right disposition . But that gentleman , "
14948	14959	14833	14833	her	85	" seemed to think the country was nothing at all . "
14960	14969	14971	14971	Elizabeth	82	" Indeed , Mamma , you are mistaken , "
14978	15017	14971	14971	Elizabeth	82	" You quite mistook Mr. Darcy . He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town , which you must acknowledge to be true . "
15018	15061	14975	14976	her mother	235	" Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger . I know we dine with four - and - twenty families . "
15125	15199	15094	15094	Elizabeth	82	" Yes , she called yesterday with her father . What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr. Bingley , is not he ? So much the man of fashion ! So genteel and easy ! He had always something to say to everybody . THAT is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important , and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter . "
15200	15207	15094	15094	Elizabeth	82	" Did Charlotte dine with you ? "
15208	15302	15094	15094	Elizabeth	82	" No , she would go home . I fancy she was wanted about the mince - pies . For my part , Mr. Bingley , I always keep servants that can do their own work ; MY daughters are brought up very differently . But everybody is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls , I assure you . It is a pity they are not handsome ! Not that I think Charlotte so VERY plain — but then she is our particular friend . "
15303	15312	15094	15094	Elizabeth	82	" She seems a very pleasant young woman . "
15313	15458	15094	15094	Elizabeth	82	" Oh ! dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain . Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane 's beauty . I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane — one does not often see anybody better looking . It is what everybody says . I do not trust my own partiality . When she was only fifteen , there was a man at my brother Gardiner 's in town so much in love with her that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . But , however , he did not . Perhaps he thought her too young . However , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were . "
15459	15466	15468	15468	Elizabeth	82	" And so ended his affection , "
15471	15502	15468	15468	Elizabeth	82	" There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way . I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! "
15503	15517	15519	15519	Darcy	89	" I have been used to consider poetry as the FOOD of love , "
15521	15566	15468	15468	Elizabeth	82	" Of a fine , stout , healthy love it may . Everything nourishes what is strong already . But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . "
15881	15931	15867	15867	His	79	" I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall , if you please , name the very day of the ball . But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill . "
15937	15976	15977	15977	she	84	" Oh ! yes — it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . And when you have given YOUR ball , "
15980	16006	15977	15977	she	84	" I shall insist on their giving one also . I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . "
16259	16271	16272	16272	He	89	" How delighted Georgiana will be to receive such a letter ! "
16277	16283	16419	16419	He	580	" You write uncommonly fast . "
16284	16294	16419	16419	He	580	" You are mistaken . I write rather slowly . "
16295	16325	16419	16419	He	580	" How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year ! Letters of business , too ! How odious I should think them ! "
16326	16343	16419	16419	He	580	" It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of yours . "
16344	16356	16419	16419	He	580	" Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . "
16357	16370	16419	16419	He	580	" I have already told her so once , by your desire . "
16371	16395	16419	16419	He	580	" I am afraid you do not like your pen . Let me mend it for you . I mend pens remarkably well . "
16396	16407	16419	16419	He	580	" Thank you — but I always mend my own . "
16408	16418	16419	16419	He	580	" How can you contrive to write so even ? "
16423	16470	16419	16419	He	580	" Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp ; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley 's . "
16471	16497	16419	16419	He	580	" Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ? At present I have not room to do them justice . "
16498	16529	16419	16419	He	580	" Oh ! it is of no consequence . I shall see her in January . But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr. Darcy ? "
16530	16548	16419	16419	He	580	" They are generally long ; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine . "
16549	16574	16419	16419	He	580	" It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter with ease , can not write ill . "
16575	16588	16419	16419	He	580	" That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , "
16593	16618	16419	16419	He	580	" because he does NOT write with ease . He studies too much for words of four syllables . Do not you , Darcy ? "
16619	16630	16419	16419	He	580	" My style of writing is very different from yours . "
16631	16634	16636	16637	Miss Bingley	91	" Oh ! "
16639	16661	16636	16637	Miss Bingley	91	" Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable . He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . "
16662	16692	16419	16419	He	580	" My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them — by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents . "
16693	16700	16702	16702	Elizabeth	82	" Your humility , Mr. Bingley , "
16704	16709	16702	16702	Elizabeth	82	" must disarm reproof . "
16710	16716	16718	16718	Darcy	89	" Nothing is more deceitful , "
16720	16741	16718	16718	Darcy	89	" than the appearance of humility . It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . "
16742	16758	16419	16419	He	580	" And which of the two do you call MY little recent piece of modesty ? "
16759	16901	16718	16718	Darcy	89	" The indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which , if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting . The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance . When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself — and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else ? "
16902	16905	16907	16907	Bingley	79	" Nay , "
16909	16978	16718	16718	Darcy	89	" this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . And yet , upon my honour , I believe what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies . "
16979	17070	16718	16718	Darcy	89	" I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity . Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , ' Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go — and at another word , might stay a month . "
17071	17079	17081	17081	Elizabeth	82	" You have only proved by this , "
17083	17109	17081	17081	Elizabeth	82	" that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition . You have shown him off now much more than he did himself . "
17110	17116	17118	17118	Bingley	79	" I am exceedingly gratified , "
17120	17188	17118	17118	Bingley	79	" by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I could . "
17189	17212	16718	16718	Darcy	89	" Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? "
17213	17232	16718	16718	Darcy	89	" Upon my word , I can not exactly explain the matter ; Darcy must speak for himself . "
17233	17313	16718	16718	Darcy	89	" You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged . Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . "
17314	17333	16718	16718	Darcy	89	" To yield readily — easily — to the PERSUASION of a friend is no merit with you . "
17334	17348	16718	16718	Darcy	89	" To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . "
17349	17484	16718	16718	Darcy	89	" You appear to me , Mr. Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley . We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? "
17485	17529	16718	16718	Darcy	89	" Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? "
17530	17535	17537	17537	Bingley	79	" By all means , "
17539	17646	17537	17537	Bingley	79	" let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . I assure you , that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening , when he has nothing to do . "
17690	17698	17700	17701	his friend	283	" I see your design , Bingley , "
17703	17715	17700	17701	his friend	283	" You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . "
17716	17761	17790	17791	Mr. Darcy	89	" Perhaps I do . Arguments are too much like disputes . If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . "
17762	17767	17769	17769	Elizabeth	82	" What you ask , "
17771	17789	17769	17769	Elizabeth	82	" is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter . "
18027	18049	18016	18017	Mr. Darcy	89	" Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? "
18070	18073	18075	18075	she	82	" Oh ! "
18077	18172	18075	18075	she	82	" I heard you before , but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . You wanted me , I know , to say ' Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt . I have , therefore , made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all — and now despise me if you dare . "
18173	18180	18206	18206	her	82	" Indeed I do not dare . "
18318	18322	18324	18324	she	91	" I hope , "
18338	18414	18324	18324	she	91	" you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , do sure the younger girls of running after officers . And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . "
18415	18427	18324	18324	she	91	" Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity ? "
18428	18502	18324	18324	she	91	" Oh ! yes . Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley . Put them next to your great - uncle the judge . They are in the same profession , you know , only in different lines . As for your Elizabeth 's picture , you must not have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? "
18503	18535	18324	18324	she	91	" It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eyelashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied . "
18552	18563	18565	18566	Miss Bingley	91	" I did not know that you intended to walk , "
18578	18585	18587	18588	Mrs. Hurst	90	" You used us abominably ill , "
18590	18602	18587	18588	Mrs. Hurst	90	" running away without telling us that you were coming out . "
18636	18655	18626	18627	Mr. Darcy	89	" This walk is not wide enough for our party . We had better go into the avenue . "
18673	18708	18657	18657	Elizabeth	82	" No , no ; stay where you are . You are charmingly grouped , and appear to uncommon advantage . The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth . Good - bye . "
18913	18917	18911	18911	he	89	" very glad ; "
19247	19304	19239	19239	she	91	" How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book ! When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . "
19353	19415	19345	19345	she	91	" By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ? I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . "
19416	19422	19424	19425	her brother	3093	" If you mean Darcy , "
19427	19473	19345	19345	she	91	" he may go to bed , if he chooses , before it begins — but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough , I shall send round my cards . "
19474	19482	19483	19483	she	91	" I should like balls infinitely better , "
19486	19532	19483	19483	she	91	" if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting . It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day . "
19533	19558	19345	19345	she	91	" Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . "
19624	19661	19609	19609	she	91	" Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room . I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . "
19760	19775	19779	19779	she	82	" What could he mean ? She was dying to know what could be his meaning?"—and
19786	19791	19793	19793	her	82	" Not at all , "
19796	19825	19793	19793	her	82	" but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it . "
19852	19863	19865	19865	he	89	" I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , "
19876	19948	19865	19865	he	89	" You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other 's confidence , and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , I would be completely in your way , and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . "
19949	19954	19956	19957	Miss Bingley	91	" Oh ! shocking ! "
19959	19977	19956	19957	Miss Bingley	91	" I never heard anything so abominable . How shall we punish him for such a speech ? "
19978	19990	19992	19992	Elizabeth	82	" Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , "
19994	20026	19992	19992	Elizabeth	82	" We can all plague and punish one another . Tease him — laugh at him . Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done . "
20027	20100	19956	19957	Miss Bingley	91	" But upon my honour , I do NOT . I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me THAT . Tease calmness of manner and presence of mind ! No , no — feel he may defy us there . And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . Mr. Darcy may hug himself . "
20101	20111	20113	20113	Elizabeth	82	" Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at ! "
20115	20151	20113	20113	Elizabeth	82	" That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to ME to have many such acquaintances . I dearly love a laugh . "
20152	20156	20158	20158	he	619	" Miss Bingley , "
20160	20204	20158	20158	he	619	" has given me more credit than can be . The wisest and the best of men — nay , the wisest and best of their actions — may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . "
20205	20208	19956	19957	Miss Bingley	91	" Certainly , "
20210	20273	20158	20158	he	619	Elizabeth—"there are such people , but I hope I am not one of THEM . I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good . Follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies , DO divert me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can . But these , I suppose , are precisely what you are without . "
20274	20305	19956	19957	Miss Bingley	91	" Perhaps that is not possible for anyone . But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . "
20306	20313	20158	20158	he	619	" Such as vanity and pride . "
20314	20343	19956	19957	Miss Bingley	91	" Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . But pride — where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation . "
20352	20364	20366	20367	Miss Bingley	91	" Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over , I presume , "
20369	20377	20366	20367	Miss Bingley	91	" and pray what is the result ? "
20378	20399	20158	20158	he	619	" I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect . He owns it himself without disguise . "
20400	20403	20405	20405	Darcy	89	" No , "
20407	20512	20405	20405	Darcy	89	" I have made no such pretension . I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding . My temper I dare not vouch for . It is , I believe , too little yielding — certainly too little for the convenience of the world . I can not forget the follies and vices of other so soon as I ought , nor their offenses against myself . My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them . My temper would perhaps be called resentful . My good opinion once lost , is lost forever . "
20513	20520	20522	20522	Elizabeth	82	" THAT is a failing indeed ! "
20524	20556	20522	20522	Elizabeth	82	" Implacable resentment IS a shade in a character . But you have chosen your fault well . I really can not LAUGH at it . You are safe from me . "
20557	20587	20405	20405	Darcy	89	" There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil — a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . "
20588	20597	20522	20522	Elizabeth	82	" And YOUR defect is to hate everybody . "
20598	20602	20603	20603	he	620	" And yours , "
20609	20616	20603	20603	he	620	" is willfully to misunderstand them . "
20617	20626	20628	20629	Miss Bingley	91	" Do let us have a little music , "
20642	20654	20628	20629	Miss Bingley	91	" Louisa , you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst ? "
21464	21471	21473	21474	Mr. Bennet	75	" I hope , my dear , "
21488	21513	21473	21474	Mr. Bennet	75	" that you have ordered a good dinner to - day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . "
21514	21566	21583	21584	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Who do you mean , my dear ? I know of nobody that is coming , I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in — and I hope MY dinners are good enough for her . I do not believe she often sees such at home . "
21567	21582	21473	21474	Mr. Bennet	75	" The person of whom I speak is a gentleman , and a stranger . "
21589	21659	21583	21584	Mrs. Bennet	85	" A gentleman and a stranger ! It is Mr. Bingley , I am sure ! Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley . But — good Lord ! how unlucky ! There is not a bit of fish to be got to - day . Lydia , my love , ring the bell — I must speak to Hill this moment . "
21660	21667	21669	21670	her husband	254	" It is NOT Mr. Bingley , "
21672	21689	21669	21670	her husband	254	" it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . "
21728	21792	21724	21724	he	254	" About a month ago I received this letter ; and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . It is from my cousin , Mr. Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . "
21793	21799	21801	21802	his wife	225	" Oh ! my dear , "
21804	21872	21801	21802	his wife	225	" I can not bear to hear that mentioned . Pray do not talk of that odious man . I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure , if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . "
21944	21953	21955	21956	Mr. Bennet	75	" It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , "
21958	21995	21955	21956	Mr. Bennet	75	" and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . "
21996	22050	21913	21913	she	85	" No , that I am sure I shall not ; and I think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . I hate such false friends . Why could he not keep on quarreling with you , as his father did before him ? "
22051	22074	21955	21956	Mr. Bennet	75	" Why , indeed ; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . "
22075	22085	21913	21913	she	85	" Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , 15th October .
22086	22090	21955	21956	Mr. Bennet	75	" Dear Sir , —
22091	22501	21913	21913	she	85	" The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to heal the breach ; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.—'There , Mrs. Bennet . '—My mind , however , is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England . As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within in the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive - branch . I can not be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends — but of this hereafter . If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November 18th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Bourgh is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.—I remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well - wisher and friend ,
22502	22505	22528	22528	he	75	" WILLIAM COLLINS "
22506	22522	22528	22528	he	75	" At four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace - making gentleman , "
22534	22578	22528	22528	he	75	" He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word , and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Bourgh should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . "
22579	22615	22528	22528	he	75	" There is some sense in what he says about the girls , however , and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . "
22616	22622	22624	22624	Jane	154	" Though it is difficult , "
22626	22653	22624	22624	Jane	154	" to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . "
22684	22694	22696	22696	she	82	" He must be an oddity , I think , "
22698	22742	22696	22696	she	82	" I can not make him out.—There is something very pompous in his style.—And what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?—We can not suppose he would help it if he could.—Could he be a sensible man , sir ? "
22743	22789	22696	22696	she	82	" No , my dear , I think not . I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse . There is a mixture of servility and self - importance in his letter , which promises well . I am impatient to see him . "
22790	22796	22798	22798	Mary	87	" In point of composition , "
22800	22829	22798	22798	Mary	87	" the letter does not seem defective . The idea of the olive - branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . "
23094	23130	23081	23082	Mrs. Bennet	85	" You are very kind , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so , for else they will be destitute enough . Things are settled so oddly . "
23131	23144	23081	23082	Mrs. Bennet	85	" You allude , perhaps , to the entail of this estate . "
23145	23206	23081	23082	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Ah ! sir , I do indeed . It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . Not that I mean to find fault with YOU , for such things I know are all chance in this world . There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . "
23207	23275	23081	23082	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them . At present I will not say more ; but , perhaps , when we are better acquainted — "
23562	23779	23559	23559	he	125	" he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank — such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from Lady Bourgh . She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her . She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings , and had sent for him only the Saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening . Lady Bourgh was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but HE had never seen anything but affability in her . She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman ; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations . She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion ; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage , where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself — some shelves in the closet upstairs . "
23780	23793	23795	23796	Mrs. Bennet	85	" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , "
23798	23833	23795	23796	Mrs. Bennet	85	" and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . Does she live near you , sir ? "
23834	23858	23538	23538	her	126	" The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship 's residence . "
23859	23876	23795	23796	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I think you said she was a widow , sir ? Has she any family ? "
23877	23895	23538	23538	her	126	" She has only one daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and of very extensive property . "
23896	23899	23905	23905	her	85	" Ah ! "
23908	23931	23905	23905	her	85	" then she is better off than many girls . And what sort of young lady is she ? Is she handsome ? "
23932	24050	23538	23538	her	126	" She is a most charming young lady indeed . Lady Bourgh herself says that , in point of true beauty , Alla is far superior to the handsomest of her sex , because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth . She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of , as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them . But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . "
24051	24069	23905	23905	her	85	" Has she been presented ? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . "
24070	24206	23538	23538	her	126	" Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Bourgh one day , has deprived the British court of its brightest ornaments . Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea ; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . I have more than once observed to Lady Bourgh , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her . These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . "
24207	24213	24215	24216	Mr. Bennet	75	" You judge very properly , "
24218	24258	24215	24216	Mr. Bennet	75	" and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? "
24259	24306	24307	24308	Mr. Bennet	75	" They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible . "
24506	24568	24501	24501	she	84	" Do you know , mamma , that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard ; and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him . My aunt told me so herself on Saturday . I shall walk to Meryton to - morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town . "
24597	24654	24583	24584	Mr. Collins	125	" I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit . It amazes me , I confess ; for , certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . But I will no longer importune my young cousin . "
25181	25238	25160	25160	her	84	" As to her YOUNGER daughters , she could not take upon her to say — she could not positively answer — but she did not KNOW of any prepossession ; her ELDEST daughter , she must just mention — she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . "
26436	26442	26445	26445	them	770	" stupid , disagreeable fellows . "
27340	27350	27352	27352	he	134	" I know little of the game at present , "
27354	27371	27352	27352	he	134	" but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation in life — "
27576	27581	27583	27583	Elizabeth	82	" About a month , "
27597	27612	27583	27583	Elizabeth	82	" He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . "
27613	27616	27618	27619	Mr. Wickham	134	" Yes , "
27621	27674	27618	27619	Mr. Wickham	134	" his estate there is a noble one . A clear ten thousand per annum . You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself , for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . "
27682	27722	27675	27675	Elizabeth	82	" You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday . Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy ? "
27723	27733	27735	27735	Elizabeth	82	" As much as I ever wish to be , "
27739	27759	27735	27735	Elizabeth	82	" I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . "
27760	27770	27772	27772	Wickham	134	" I have no right to give MY opinion , "
27774	27848	27772	27772	Wickham	134	" as to his being agreeable or otherwise . I am not qualified to form one . I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . It is impossible for ME to be impartial . But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish — and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else . Here you are in your own family . "
27849	27901	27735	27735	Elizabeth	82	" Upon my word , I say no more HERE than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield . He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire . Everybody is disgusted with his pride . You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone . "
27902	27911	27913	27913	Wickham	134	" I can not pretend to be sorry , "
27920	27976	27913	27913	Wickham	134	" that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with HIM I believe it does not often happen . The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chooses to be seen . "
27977	27997	27998	27998	Wickham	134	" I should take him , even on MY slight acquaintance , to be an ill - tempered man . "
28004	28008	28010	28010	he	134	" I wonder , "
28019	28032	28010	28010	he	134	" whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . "
28033	28077	27998	27998	Wickham	134	" I do not at all know ; but I HEARD nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield . I hope your plans in favour of the — — shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . "
28078	28249	28010	28010	he	134	" Oh ! no — it is not for ME to be driven away by Mr. Darcy . If HE wishes to avoid seeing ME , he must go . We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding HIM but what I might proclaim before all the world , a sense of very great ill - usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr. Darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . "
28316	28329	28330	28330	he	134	" It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , "
28333	28482	28330	28330	he	134	" which was my chief inducement to enter the — — shire . I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them . Society , I own , is necessary to me . I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . I MUST have employment and society . A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . The church OUGHT to have been my profession — I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . "
28483	28486	28814	28814	Elizabeth	82	" Indeed ! "
28487	28553	28330	28330	he	134	" Yes — the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift . He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me . I can not do justice to his kindness . He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . "
28554	28558	28560	28560	Elizabeth	82	" Good heavens ! "
28562	28584	28560	28560	Elizabeth	82	" but how could THAT be ? How could his will be disregarded ? Why did you not seek legal redress ? "
28585	28766	28330	28330	he	134	" There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law . A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it — or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence — in short anything or nothing . Certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I can not accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it . I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may have spoken my opinion OF him , and TO him , too freely . I can recall nothing worse . But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . "
28767	28780	28560	28560	Elizabeth	82	" This is quite shocking ! He deserves to be publicly disgraced . "
28781	28813	28330	28330	he	134	" Some time or other he WILL be — but it shall not be by ME . Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose HIM . "
28832	28836	28838	28838	she	82	" But what , "
28844	28861	28838	28838	she	82	" can have been his motive ? What can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? "
28862	28948	28560	28560	Elizabeth	82	" A thorough , determined dislike of me — a dislike which I can not but attribute in some measure to jealousy . Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father 's uncommon attachment to me irritated him , I believe , very early in life . He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood — the sort of preference which was often given me . "
28949	29012	28838	28838	she	82	" I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this — though I have never liked him . I had not thought so very ill of him . I had supposed him to be despising his fellow - creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this . "
29025	29057	29022	29022	she	830	" I DO remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper . His disposition must be dreadful . "
29058	29068	29070	29070	Wickham	134	" I will not trust myself on the subject , "
29072	29081	29070	29070	Wickham	134	" I can hardly be just to him . "
29095	29114	29115	29115	She	830	" To treat in such a manner the godson , the friend , the favourite of his father ! "
29120	29138	29139	29139	she	830	" A young man , too , like YOU , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"—but
29144	29173	29115	29115	She	830	" and one , too , who had probably been his companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner ! "
29174	29346	29410	29410	Wickham	134	" We were born in the same parish , within the same park ; the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care . MY father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr. Phillips , appears to do so much credit to — but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property . He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend . Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father 's active superintendence , and when , immediately before my father 's death , Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to HIM , as of his affection to myself . "
29347	29351	29353	29353	Elizabeth	82	" How strange ! "
29355	29402	29353	29353	Elizabeth	82	" How abominable ! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you ! If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest — for dishonesty I must call it . "
29403	29408	29410	29410	Wickham	134	" It IS wonderful , "
29412	29468	29410	29410	Wickham	134	" for almost all his actions may be traced to pride ; and pride had often been his best friend . It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling . But we are none of us consistent , and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride . "
29469	29482	29353	29353	Elizabeth	82	" Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good ? "
29483	29610	29410	29410	Wickham	134	" Yes . It has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . Family pride , and FILIAL pride — for he is very proud of what his father was — have done this . Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive . He has also BROTHERLY pride , which , with SOME brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister , and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . "
29611	29619	29353	29353	Elizabeth	82	" What sort of girl is Georgiana ? "
29625	29737	29622	29622	his	831	" I wish I could call her amiable . It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy . But she is too much like her brother — very , very proud . As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . But she is nothing to me now . She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and , I understand , highly accomplished . Since her father 's death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education . "
29762	29815	29748	29748	Elizabeth	82	" I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley ! How can Mr. Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? How can they suit each other ? Do you know Mr. Bingley ? "
29816	29821	29940	29942	The whist party	832	" Not at all . "
29822	29844	29748	29748	Elizabeth	82	" He is a sweet - tempered , amiable , charming man . He can not know what Mr. Darcy is . "
29845	29939	29940	29942	The whist party	832	" Probably not ; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses . He does not want abilities . He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while . Among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich he is liberal - minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable — allowing something for fortune and figure . "
30042	30050	30052	30052	he	125	" I know very well , madam , "
30054	30120	30052	30052	he	125	" that when persons sit down to a card - table , they must take their chances of these things , and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object . There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . "
30159	30163	30164	30164	she	82	" Lady Bourgh , "
30167	30198	30164	30164	she	82	" has very lately given him a living . I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . "
30199	30224	30138	30138	he	134	" You know of course that Lady Bourgh and Lady Anne were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy . "
30225	30257	30164	30164	she	82	" No , indeed , I did not . I knew nothing at all of Lady Bourgh 's connections . I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . "
30258	30286	30318	30318	her	82	" Her daughter , Alla , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . "
30333	30337	30339	30339	she	82	" Mr. Collins , "
30341	30389	30339	30339	she	82	" speaks highly both of Lady Bourgh and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . "
30390	30402	30404	30404	Wickham	134	" I believe her to be both in a great degree , "
30406	30495	30404	30404	Wickham	134	" I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent . She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride for her nephew , who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . "
30843	30848	30850	30850	she	154	" They have both , "
30852	30912	30850	30850	she	154	" been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other . It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side . "
30913	30963	30850	30850	she	154	" Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? Do clear THEM too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . "
30964	31064	30850	30850	she	154	" Laugh as much as you choose , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy , to be treating his father 's favourite in such a manner , one whom his father had promised to provide for . It is impossible . No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? Oh ! no . "
31065	31127	30850	30850	she	154	" I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley 's being imposed on , than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , everything mentioned without ceremony . If it be not so , let Mr. Darcy contradict it . Besides , there was truth in his looks . "
31128	31146	30850	30850	she	154	" It is difficult indeed — it is distressing . One does not know what to think . "
31147	31160	30850	30850	she	154	" I beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . "
31531	31541	31543	31543	she	87	" While I can have my mornings to myself , "
31545	31589	31543	31543	she	87	" it is enough — I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . Society has claims on us all ; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody . "
31686	31700	31702	31702	he	125	" I am by no means of the opinion , I assure you , "
31704	31805	31702	31702	he	125	" that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself , that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening ; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . "
32385	32412	32416	32416	his	134	" I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here . "
32794	32805	32788	32788	Charlotte	100	" I dare say you will find him very agreeable . "
32806	32839	32788	32788	Charlotte	100	" Heaven forbid ! THAT would be the greatest misfortune of all ! To find a man agreeable whom on is determined to hate ! Do not wish me such an evil . "
33025	33065	33019	33019	she	82	with:—"It is YOUR turn to say something now , Mr. Darcy . I talked about the dance , and YOU ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . "
33083	33119	33019	33019	she	82	" Very well . That reply will do for the present . Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones . But NOW we may be silent . "
33120	33134	33019	33019	she	82	" Do you talk by rule , then , while you are dancing ? "
33135	33190	33019	33019	she	82	" Sometimes . One must speak a little , you know . It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together ; and yet for the advantage of SOME , conversation ought to be so arranged , as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . "
33191	33213	33019	33019	she	82	" Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? "
33214	33217	33219	33219	Elizabeth	82	" Both , "
33222	33279	33219	33219	Elizabeth	82	" for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds . We are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb . "
33280	33296	33298	33298	he	889	" This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , "
33300	33324	33298	33298	he	889	" How near it may be to MINE , I can not pretend to say . YOU think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly . "
33325	33335	33355	33355	he	889	" I must not decide on my own performance . "
33387	33406	33371	33371	She	82	" When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . "
33456	33486	33446	33446	Darcy	89	" Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his MAKING friends — whether he may be equally capable of RETAINING them , is less certain . "
33487	33499	33501	33501	Elizabeth	82	" He has been so unlucky as to lose YOUR friendship , "
33505	33521	33501	33501	Elizabeth	82	" and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . "
33585	33713	33567	33567	he	80	" I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir . Such very superior dancing is not often seen . It is evident that you belong to the first circles . Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Eliza ( glancing at her sister and Bingley ) shall take place . What congratulations will then flow in ! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you , sir . You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . "
33776	33791	33767	33767	he	80	" Sir William 's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . "
33792	33846	33767	33767	he	80	" I do not think we were speaking at all . Sir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves . We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I can not imagine . "
33847	33854	33856	33856	he	80	" What think you of books ? "
33860	33883	33767	33767	he	80	" Books — oh ! no . I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . "
33884	33916	33767	33767	he	80	" I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject . We may compare our different opinions . "
33917	33941	33767	33767	he	80	" No — I can not talk of books in a ball - room ; my head is always full of something else . "
33942	33955	33957	33957	he	80	" The PRESENT always occupies you in such scenes — does it ? "
33965	33970	33971	33971	she	897	" Yes , always , "
33999	34038	33995	33995	her	897	" I remember hearing you once say , Mr. Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that you resentment once created was unappeasable . You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its BEING CREATED . "
34039	34043	34045	34045	he	80	" I am , "
34052	34063	33995	33995	her	897	" And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? "
34064	34069	33995	33995	her	897	" I hope not . "
34070	34091	33995	33995	her	897	" It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first .
34092	34102	33995	33995	her	897	" May I ask to what these questions tend ? "
34103	34112	34114	34114	she	897	" Merely to the illustration of YOUR character , "
34123	34132	34114	34114	she	897	" I am trying to make it out . "
34133	34140	33995	33995	her	897	" And what is your success ? "
34146	34167	34141	34141	She	897	" I do not get on at all . I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . "
34168	34174	34176	34176	he	80	" I can readily believe , "
34179	34227	34176	34176	he	80	" that reports may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . "
34228	34246	34141	34141	She	897	" But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . "
34247	34259	34260	34260	he	80	" I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , "
34345	34603	34329	34330	Miss Bingley	91	" So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham ! Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you , among his other communication , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr. Darcy 's steward . Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to Mr. Darcy 's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has always been remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner . I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he can not bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing , indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite 's guilt ; but really , considering his descent , one could not expect much better . "
34604	34619	34621	34621	Elizabeth	82	" His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , "
34624	34660	34621	34621	Elizabeth	82	" for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy 's steward , and of THAT , I can assure you , he informed me himself . "
34661	34667	34669	34670	Miss Bingley	91	" I beg your pardon , "
34678	34688	34669	34670	Miss Bingley	91	" Excuse my interference — it was kindly meant . "
34689	34693	34697	34697	herself	82	" Insolent girl ! "
34699	34735	34697	34697	herself	82	" You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy . "
34828	34834	34836	34836	she	154	" I want to know , "
34849	34884	34836	34836	she	154	" what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham . But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . "
34885	34888	34890	34890	Jane	154	" No , "
34892	35017	34890	34890	Jane	154	" I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you . Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity , and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister 's , Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy 's regard . "
35018	35028	34836	34836	she	154	" Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself ? "
35029	35043	34890	34890	Jane	154	" No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . "
35044	35070	34836	34836	she	154	" This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy . I am satisfied . But what does he say of the living ? "
35071	35104	34890	34890	Jane	154	" He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him CONDITIONALLY only . "
35105	35117	35119	35119	Elizabeth	82	" I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley 's sincerity , "
35122	35188	35119	35119	Elizabeth	82	" but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . Mr. Bingley 's defense of his friend was a very able one , I dare say ; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before . "
35304	35310	35312	35312	he	125	" I have found out , "
35314	35446	35312	35312	he	125	" by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness . I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Alla , and of her mother Lady Bourgh . How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! Who would have thought of my meeting with , perhaps , a nephew of Lady Bourgh in this assembly ! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . "
35447	35459	35518	35518	him	904	" You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy ! "
35460	35505	35312	35312	he	125	" Indeed I am . I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . I believe him to be Lady Bourgh 's NEPHEW . It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight . "
35607	35787	35793	35793	he	906	" My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding ; but permit me to say , that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for , give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom — provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty . Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . "
35859	35862	35855	35855	his	906	" apology , "
35863	35866	35855	35855	his	906	" Hunsford , "
35868	35872	35855	35855	his	906	" Lady Bourgh . "
35969	35979	35981	35981	he	125	" I have no reason , I assure you , "
35983	36058	35981	35981	he	125	" to be dissatisfied with my reception . Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Bourgh 's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . It was really a very handsome thought . Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . "
36537	36579	36528	36529	Her mother	235	" What is Mr. Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing HE may not like to hear . "
36580	36615	36660	36661	Mr. Darcy	89	" For heaven 's sake , madam , speak lower . What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy ? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing ! "
37037	37063	37027	37027	Mary	87	" That will do extremely well , child . You have delighted us long enough . Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . "
37109	37113	37115	37116	Mr. Collins	125	" If I , "
37118	37347	37115	37116	Mr. Collins	125	" were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman . I do not mean , however , to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . The rector of a parish has much to do . In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tithes as a may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron . He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as a comfortable as possible . And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manner towards everybody , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . I can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family . "
38000	38008	37987	37987	Lydia	84	" Lord , how tired I am ! "
38340	38375	38332	38332	he	125	" May I hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? "
38393	38426	38388	38389	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Oh dear!—yes — certainly . I am sure Lizzy will be very happy — I am sure she can have no objection . Come , Kitty , I want you upstairs . "
38444	38485	38440	38440	Elizabeth	82	" Dear madam , do not go . I beg you will not go . Mr. Collins must excuse me . He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear . I am going away myself . "
38486	38504	38522	38522	she	82	" No , no , nonsense , Lizzy . I desire you to stay where you are . "
38525	38538	38522	38522	she	82	" Lizzy , I INSIST upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins . "
38614	38778	38610	38611	Mr. Collins	125	" Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections . You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there NOT been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you , that I have your respected mother 's permission for this address . You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . Almost as soon as I entered the house , I singled you out as the companion of my future life . But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying — and , moreover , for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did . "
38827	39398	38824	38824	he	125	" My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish ; secondly , that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly — which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! ) on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford — between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Alla 's footstool , that she said , ' Mr. Collins , you must marry . A clergyman like you must marry . Choose properly , choose a gentlewoman for MY sake ; and for your OWN , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . This is my advice . Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity , I think , must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite . Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I can assure you there are many amiable young women . But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father ( who , however , may live many years longer ) , I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place — which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years . This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . And now nothing remains but for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents , which will not be yours till after your mother 's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . "
39408	39416	39417	39417	she	978	" You are too hasty , sir , "
39420	39476	39417	39417	she	978	" You forget that I have made no answer . Let me do it without further loss of time . Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them . "
39477	39485	39487	39488	Mr. Collins	125	" I am not now to learn , "
39498	39570	39487	39488	Mr. Collins	125	" that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second , or even a third time . I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . "
39571	39578	39580	39580	Elizabeth	82	" Upon my word , sir , "
39582	39695	39580	39580	Elizabeth	82	" your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration . I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . I am perfectly serious in my refusal . You could not make ME happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so . Nay , were your friend Lady Bourgh to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . "
39696	39707	39709	39710	Mr. Collins	125	" Were it certain that Lady Bourgh would think so , "
39712	39761	39709	39710	Mr. Collins	125	gravely—"but I can not imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you . And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again , I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualification . "
39762	39873	39877	39877	she	979	" Indeed , Mr. Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say . I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing you hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self - reproach . This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . "
39896	39987	39889	39890	Mr. Collins	125	" When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject , I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . "
39988	39994	39996	39996	Elizabeth	82	" Really , Mr. Collins , "
40001	40044	39996	39996	Elizabeth	82	" you puzzle me exceedingly . If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one . "
40045	40234	39889	39890	Mr. Collins	125	" You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course . My reasons for believing it are briefly these : It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable . My situation in life , my connections with the family of de Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into further consideration , that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . "
40235	40340	39996	39996	Elizabeth	82	" I do assure you , sir , that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man . I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . My feelings in every respect forbid it . Can I speak plainer ? Do not consider me now as an elegant female , intending to plague you , but as a rational creature , speaking the truth from her heart . "
40341	40347	40349	40349	he	981	" You are uniformly charming ! "
40358	40385	40349	40349	he	981	" and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . "
40646	40656	40657	40657	she	85	" But , depend upon it , Mr. Collins , "
40660	40702	40657	40657	she	85	" that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . I will speak to her about it directly . She is a very headstrong , foolish girl , and does not know her own interest but I will MAKE her know it . "
40703	40712	40714	40715	Mr. Collins	125	" Pardon me for interrupting you , madam , "
40717	40796	40714	40715	Mr. Collins	125	" but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . "
40797	40805	40807	40808	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Sir , you quite misunderstand me , "
40812	40860	40807	40808	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . In everything else she is as good - natured a girl as ever lived . I will go directly to Mr. Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . "
40885	40939	40880	40880	she	85	" Oh ! Mr. Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar . You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have HER . "
40973	40983	40985	40985	he	75	" I have not the pleasure of understanding you , "
40994	41001	40985	40985	he	75	" Of what are you talking ? "
41002	41031	41083	41084	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy . Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins , and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . "
41032	41049	40985	40985	he	75	" And what am I to do on the occasion ? It seems an hopeless business . "
41050	41068	41083	41084	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Speak to Lizzy about it yourself . Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . "
41069	41082	40985	40985	he	75	" Let her be called down . She shall hear my opinion . "
41098	41104	41109	41109	she	82	" Come here , child , "
41112	41141	41142	41142	Elizabeth	82	" I have sent for you on an affair of importance . I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage . Is it true ? "
41148	41161	41142	41142	Elizabeth	82	" Very well — and this offer of marriage you have refused ? "
41162	41168	41083	41084	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I have , sir . "
41169	41196	41142	41142	Elizabeth	82	" Very well . We now come to the point . Your mother insists upon your accepting it . Is it not so , Mrs. Bennet ? "
41197	41208	41083	41084	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Yes , or I will never see her again . "
41209	41259	41142	41142	Elizabeth	82	" An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents . Your mother will never see you again if you do NOT marry Mr. Collins , and I will never see you again if you DO . "
41296	41320	41275	41276	Mrs. Bennet	85	" What do you mean , Mr. Bennet , in talking this way ? You promised me to INSIST upon her marrying him . "
41321	41325	41327	41328	her husband	254	" My dear , "
41330	41380	41327	41328	her husband	254	" I have two small favours to request . First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room . I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . "
41577	41617	41563	41563	Lydia	84	" I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! What do you think has happened this morning ? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . "
41691	41700	41701	41701	she	100	" Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , "
41708	41734	41701	41701	she	100	" for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me . I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . "
41748	41755	41757	41758	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Aye , there she comes , "
41760	41962	41757	41758	Mrs. Bennet	85	" looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided she can have her own way . But I tell you , Miss Lizzy — if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all — and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead . I shall not be able to keep you — and so I warn you . I have done with you from this very day . I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children . Not that I have much pleasure , indeed , in talking to anybody . People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . Nobody can tell what I suffer ! But it is always so . Those who do not complain are never pitied . "
42033	42065	42027	42027	she	1003	" Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together . "
42147	42153	42140	42141	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Oh ! Mr. Collins ! "
42154	42159	42161	42161	he	125	" My dear madam , "
42163	42180	42181	42181	he	125	" let us be for ever silent on this point . Far be it from me , "
42193	42425	42181	42181	he	125	" to resent the behaviour of your daughter . Resignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned . Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . You will not , I hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . My conduct may , I fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter 's lips instead of your own . But we are all liable to error . I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my MANNER has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . "
42699	42703	42705	42705	he	282	" I found , "
42707	42760	42705	42705	he	282	" as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy ; that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . "
42995	43046	42986	42986	Jane	154	" This is from Caroline Bingley ; what it contains has surprised me a good deal . The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town — and without any intention of coming back again . You shall hear what she says . "
43096	43166	43083	43084	Mr. Hurst	88	" I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope , at some future period , to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known , and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . I depend on you for that . "
43244	43249	43251	43251	she	154	" It is unlucky , "
43258	43331	43251	43251	she	154	" that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them . "
43332	43354	43227	43227	she	82	" Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . I will read it to you :
43355	43523	43251	43251	she	154	" When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days ; but as we are certain it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel . Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter ; I wish that I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one of the crowd — but of that I despair . I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you . "
43524	43531	43533	43533	Jane	154	" It is evident by this , "
43535	43545	43533	43533	Jane	154	" that he comes back no more this winter . "
43546	43561	43251	43251	she	154	" It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he SHOULD . "
43562	43608	43533	43533	Jane	154	" Why will you think so ? It must be his own doing . He is his own master . But you do not know ALL . I WILL read you the passage which particularly hurts me . I will have no reserves from YOU . "
43609	43820	43251	43251	she	154	" Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister ; and , to confess the truth , WE are scarcely less eager to meet her again . I really do not think Georgiana has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister . I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject ; but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . My brother admires her greatly already ; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing ; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own ; and a sister 's partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman 's heart . With all these circumstances to favour an attachment , and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? "
43821	43834	43836	43836	Jane	154	" What do you think of THIS sentence , my dear Lizzy ? "
43842	43914	43836	43836	Jane	154	" Is it not clear enough ? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother 's indifference ; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ! ) to put me on my guard ? Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? "
43915	43932	43251	43251	she	154	" Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different . Will you hear it ? "
43933	43937	43836	43836	Jane	154	" Most willingly . "
43938	43992	43251	43251	she	154	" You shall have it in a few words . Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Georgiana . She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . "
43998	44211	43836	43836	Jane	154	" Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me . No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection . Miss Bingley , I am sure , can not . She is not such a simpleton . Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . But the case is this : We are not rich enough or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Georgiana for her brother , from the notion that when there has been ONE intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Alla were out of the way . But , my dearest Jane , you can not seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Georgiana , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of YOUR merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that , instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . "
44212	44221	44223	44223	Jane	154	" If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , "
44225	44269	44223	44223	Jane	154	" your representation of all this might make me quite easy . But I know the foundation is unjust . Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone ; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself . "
44270	44319	43836	43836	Jane	154	" That is right . You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine . Believe her to be deceived , by all means . You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . "
44320	44353	44223	44223	Jane	154	" But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? "
44354	44361	44363	44363	Elizabeth	82	" You must decide for yourself , "
44365	44405	44363	44363	Elizabeth	82	" and if , upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him . "
44406	44413	44415	44415	Jane	154	" How can you talk so ? "
44420	44440	44415	44415	Jane	154	" You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . "
44441	44465	44363	44363	Elizabeth	82	" I did not think you would ; and that being the case , I can not consider your situation with much compassion . "
44466	44492	44415	44415	Jane	154	" But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . A thousand things may arise in six months ! "
44778	44786	44788	44788	she	82	" It keeps him in good humour , "
44790	44803	44804	44804	Charlotte	100	" and I am more obliged to you than I can express . "
45758	45763	45764	45764	he	125	" My dear madam , "
45767	45803	45764	45764	he	125	" this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . "
45828	45860	45810	45811	Mr. Bennet	75	" But is there not danger of Lady Bourgh 's disapprobation here , my good sir ? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness . "
45861	45866	45868	45869	Mr. Collins	125	" My dear sir , "
45871	45901	45868	45869	Mr. Collins	125	" I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship 's concurrence . "
45902	45958	45810	45811	Mr. Bennet	75	" You can not be too much upon your guard . Risk anything rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that WE shall take no offence . "
45959	46047	46068	46069	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire . As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . "
46265	46277	46258	46258	she	100	" Engaged to Mr. Collins ! My dear Charlotte — impossible ! "
46326	46368	46316	46316	she	100	" Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza ? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman 's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? "
46412	46420	46422	46422	Charlotte	100	" I see what you are feeling , "
46424	46525	46422	46422	Charlotte	100	" You must be surprised , very much surprised — so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you . But when you have had time to think it over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . I am not romantic , you know ; I never was . I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr. Collins 's character , connection , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . "
46529	46532	46526	46526	Elizabeth	82	" Undoubtedly ; "
46818	46845	46807	46807	Lydia	84	" Good Lord ! Sir William , how can you tell such a story ? Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? "
48298	48304	48306	48306	she	100	" Indeed , Mr. Bennet , "
48308	48348	48306	48306	she	100	" it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for HER , and live to see her take her place in it ! "
48349	48380	48399	48399	she	100	" My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . Let us hope for better things . Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor . "
48405	48434	48399	48399	she	100	" I can not bear to think that they should have all this estate . If it was not for the entail , I should not mind it . "
48435	48442	48399	48399	she	100	" What should not you mind ? "
48443	48452	48399	48399	she	100	" I should not mind anything at all . "
48453	48469	48399	48399	she	100	" Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . "
48470	48528	48399	48399	she	100	" I never can be thankful , Mr. Bennet , for anything about the entail . How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one 's own daughters , I can not understand ; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too ! Why should HE have it more than anybody else ? "
48529	48538	48540	48541	Mr. Bennet	75	" I leave it to yourself to determine , "
49041	49099	49035	49035	she	154	" Oh , that my dear mother had more command over herself ! She can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . But I will not repine . It can not last long . He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . "
49113	49118	49120	49120	Jane	154	" You doubt me , "
49125	49193	49120	49120	Jane	154	" indeed , you have no reason . He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all . I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . Thank God ! I have not THAT pain . A little time , therefore — I shall certainly try to get the better . "
49202	49236	49198	49198	she	154	" I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself . "
49237	49242	49244	49244	Elizabeth	82	" My dear Jane ! "
49246	49288	49244	49244	Elizabeth	82	" you are too good . Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; I do not know what to say to you . I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . "
49309	49312	49314	49314	Elizabeth	82	" Nay , "
49316	49480	49314	49314	Elizabeth	82	" this is not fair . YOU wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody . I only want to think YOU perfect , and you set yourself against it . Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good - will . You need not . There are few people whom I really love , and still fewer of whom I think well . The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense . I have met with two instances lately , one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte 's marriage . It is unaccountable ! In every view it is unaccountable ! "
49481	49575	49289	49290	Miss Bennet	82	" My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . They will ruin your happiness . You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . Consider Mr. Collins 's respectability , and Charlotte 's steady , prudent character . Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for everybody 's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . "
49576	49739	49314	49314	Elizabeth	82	" To oblige you , I would try to believe almost anything , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart . My dear Jane , Mr. Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who married him can not have a proper way of thinking . You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger security for happiness . "
49740	49753	49755	49755	Jane	154	" I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , "
49757	49873	49755	49755	Jane	154	" and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together . But enough of this . You alluded to something else . You mentioned TWO instances . I can not misunderstand you , but I entreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking THAT PERSON to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect . It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us . Women fancy admiration means more than it does . "
49874	49883	49314	49314	Elizabeth	82	" And men take care that they should . "
49884	49915	49755	49755	Jane	154	" If it is designedly done , they can not be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine .
49916	49932	49934	49934	Elizabeth	82	" I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley 's conduct to design , "
49936	49982	49934	49934	Elizabeth	82	" but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people 's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . "
49983	49994	49755	49755	Jane	154	" And do you impute it to either of those ? "
49995	50028	49934	49934	Elizabeth	82	" Yes ; to the last . But if I go on , I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem . Stop me whilst you can . "
50029	50042	49755	49755	Jane	154	" You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him ? "
50051	50051	49755	49755	Jane	154	"
50052	50089	49934	49934	Elizabeth	82	" I can not believe it . Why should they try to influence him ? They can only wish his happiness ; and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it . "
50090	50138	49755	49755	Jane	154	" Your first position is false . They may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . "
50139	50152	50154	50154	Jane	154	" Beyond a doubt , they DO wish him to choose Georgiana , "
50156	50337	50154	50154	Jane	154	" but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother 's . What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . By supposing such an affection , you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy . Do not distress me by the idea . I am not ashamed of having been mistaken — or , at least , it is light , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . "
50491	50496	50498	50498	he	75	" So , Lizzy , "
50502	50612	50498	50498	he	75	" your sister is crossed in love , I find . I congratulate her . Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then . It is something to think of , and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . When is your turn to come ? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane . Now is your time . Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . Let Wickham be YOUR man . He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . "
50613	50638	50719	50720	general unreserve	1152	" Thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . We must not all expect Jane 's good fortune . "
50639	50642	50644	50645	Mr. Bennet	75	" True , "
50647	50677	50644	50645	Mr. Bennet	75	" but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you , you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it . "
51184	51191	51192	51192	she	118	" I do not blame Jane , "
51195	51380	51192	51192	she	118	" for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could . But Lizzy ! Oh , sister ! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins 's wife by this time , had it not been for her own perverseness . He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . The Lucases are very artful people indeed , sister . They are all for what they can get . I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves . "
51440	51453	51455	51455	she	118	" It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , "
51457	51517	51455	51455	she	118	" I am sorry it went off . But these things happen so often ! A young man , such as you describe Mr. Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent . "
51518	51526	51528	51528	Elizabeth	82	" An excellent consolation in its way , "
51530	51584	51528	51528	Elizabeth	82	" but it will not do for US . We do not suffer by ACCIDENT . It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . "
51585	51648	51455	51455	she	118	" But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea . It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half - hour 's acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . Pray , how VIOLENT WAS Mr. Bingley 's love ? "
51649	51733	51528	51528	Elizabeth	82	" I never saw a more promising inclination ; he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance ; and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer . Could there be finer symptoms ? Is not general incivility the very essence of love ? "
51734	51830	51455	51455	she	118	" Oh , yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . Poor Jane ! I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . It had better have happened to YOU , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us ? Change of scene might be of service — and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything . "
51849	51853	51855	51856	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" I hope , "
51858	51922	51855	51856	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable that they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . "
51923	52021	51855	51856	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" And THAT is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have HEARD of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month 's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , Mr. Bingley never stirs without him . "
52022	52055	51855	51856	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" So much the better . I hope they will not meet at all . But does not Jane correspond with his sister ? SHE will not be able to help calling . "
52056	52064	51855	51856	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" She will drop the acquaintance entirely . "
52635	52790	52630	52630	she	118	" You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . I have nothing to say against HIM ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . But as it is , you must not let your fancy run away with you . You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . Your father would depend on YOUR resolution and good conduct , I am sure . You must not disappoint your father . "
52791	52802	52630	52630	she	118	" My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . "
52803	52817	52630	52630	she	118	" Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . "
52818	52859	52630	52630	she	118	" Well , then , you need not be under any alarm . I will take care of myself , and of Mr. Wickham too . He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . "
52860	52869	52630	52630	she	118	" Elizabeth , you are not serious now . "
52870	53123	52630	52630	she	118	" I beg your pardon , I will try again . At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham ; no , I certainly am not . But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw — and if he becomes really attached to me — I believe it will be better that he should not . I see the imprudence of it . Oh ! THAT abominable Mr. Darcy ! My father 's opinion of me does me the greatest honour , and I should be miserable to forfeit it . My father , however , is partial to Mr. Wickham . In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow - creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ? All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object . When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing . In short , I will do my best . "
53124	53154	53265	53265	she	82	" Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often . At least , you should not REMIND you mother of inviting him . "
53155	53163	53165	53165	Elizabeth	82	" As I did the other day , "
53171	53259	53165	53165	Elizabeth	82	" very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from THAT . But do not imagine that he is always here so often . It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . You know my mother 's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be the wisest ; and now I hope you are satisfied . "
53373	53380	53345	53345	she	85	" WISHED they might be happy . "
53441	53454	53438	53438	Charlotte	100	" I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . "
53455	53461	53438	53438	Charlotte	100	" THAT you certainly shall . "
53462	53479	53438	53438	Charlotte	100	" And I have another favour to ask you . Will you come and see me ? "
53480	53492	53438	53438	Charlotte	100	" We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . "
53493	53515	53438	53438	Charlotte	100	" I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . "
53530	53542	53544	53544	Charlotte	100	" My father and Maria are coming to me in March , "
53546	53573	53544	53544	Charlotte	100	" and I hope you will consent to be of the party . Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome as either of them . "
53922	53926	53927	53927	she	154	" My aunt , "
53930	53955	53927	53927	she	154	" is going to - morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street . "
53972	53981	53983	53983	her	154	" I did not think Caroline in spirits , "
53986	54092	53983	53983	her	154	" but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . I was right , therefore , my last letter had never reached her . I inquired after their brother , of course . He was well , but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him . I found that Georgiana was expected to dinner . I wish I could see her . My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out . I dare say I shall see them soon here . "
54225	54787	54211	54211	she	154	" My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement , at my expense , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley 's regard for me . But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me ; but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the meantime . When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . I pity , though I can not help blaming her . She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side . But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . I need not explain myself farther ; and though WE know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable . I can not but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met , long ago . He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it would seem , by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Georgiana . I can not understand it . If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy — your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . Let me hear from you very soon . Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . We had better not mention it . I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford . Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . I am sure you will be very comfortable there.—Yours , etc . "
55121	55320	55116	55116	she	82	" I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . But my feelings are not only cordial towards HIM ; they are even impartial towards Miss King . I can not find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . There can be no love in all this . My watchfulness has been effectual ; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him , I can not say that I regret my comparative insignificance . Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly . Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do . They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain . "
56130	56136	56137	56137	she	118	" But my dear Elizabeth , "
56140	56159	56137	56137	she	118	" what sort of girl is Miss King ? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . "
56160	56235	56110	56111	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . "
56236	56258	56137	56137	she	118	" If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . "
56259	56279	56110	56111	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" She is a very good kind of girl , I believe . I know no harm of her . "
56280	56301	56137	56137	she	118	" But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather 's death made her mistress of this fortune . "
56302	56350	56110	56111	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" No — what should he ? If it were not allowable for him to gain MY affections because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? "
56351	56369	56137	56137	she	118	" But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event . "
56370	56402	56110	56111	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe . If SHE does not object to it , why should WE ? "
56403	56426	56137	56137	she	118	" HER not objecting does not justify HIM . It only shows her being deficient in something herself — sense or feeling . "
56427	56430	56432	56432	Elizabeth	82	" Well , "
56434	56452	56432	56432	Elizabeth	82	" have it as you choose . HE shall be mercenary , and SHE shall be foolish . "
56453	56489	56137	56137	she	118	" No , Lizzy , that is what I do NOT choose . I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . "
56490	56576	56432	56432	Elizabeth	82	" Oh ! if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better . I am sick of them all . Thank Heaven ! I am going to - morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him . Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . "
56577	56590	56137	56137	she	118	" Take care , Lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment . "
56629	56641	56643	56644	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" We have not determined how far it shall carry us , "
56646	56655	56643	56644	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" but , perhaps , to the Lakes . "
56678	56687	56688	56688	she	1268	" Oh , my dear , dear aunt , "
56692	56822	56688	56688	she	1268	" what delight ! what felicity ! You give me fresh life and vigour . Adieu to disappointment and spleen . What are young men to rocks and mountains ? Oh ! what hours of transport we shall spend ! And when we DO return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of anything . We WILL know where we have gone — we WILL recollect what we have seen . Lakes , mountains , and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarreling about its relative situation . Let OUR first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . "
57707	57847	57700	57701	Mr. Collins	125	" Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . Her ladyship 's carriage is regularly ordered for us . I SHOULD say , one of her ladyship 's carriages , for she has several . "
57848	57863	57865	57868	a most attentive neighbour	1316	" Lady Bourgh is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , added Charlotte , "
57870	57870	57700	57701	Mr. Collins	125	"
57871	57901	57700	57701	Mr. Collins	125	" Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . She is the sort of woman whom one can not regard with too much deference . "
58093	58139	58078	58078	Maria	94	" Oh , my dear Eliza ! pray make haste and come into the dining - room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! I will not tell you what it is . Make haste , and come down this moment . "
58188	58194	58196	58196	Elizabeth	82	" And is this all ? "
58198	58223	58196	58196	Elizabeth	82	" I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Bourgh and her daughter . "
58224	58230	58232	58232	Maria	94	" La ! my dear , "
58240	58289	58232	58232	Maria	94	" it is not Lady Bourgh . The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson , who lives with them ; the other is Alla . Only look at her . She is quite a little creature . Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small ? "
58290	58313	58196	58196	Elizabeth	82	" She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind . Why does she not come in ? "
58314	58335	58232	58232	Maria	94	" Oh , Charlotte says she hardly ever does . It is the greatest of favours when Alla comes in . "
58336	58342	58344	58344	Elizabeth	82	" I like her appearance , "
58351	58377	58344	58344	Elizabeth	82	" She looks sickly and cross . Yes , she will do for him very well . She will make him a very proper wife . "
58573	58577	58579	58579	he	125	" I confess , "
58581	58666	58579	58579	he	125	" that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship 's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings . I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation , moreover , including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ! "
58667	58678	58680	58681	Sir William	80	" I am the less surprised at what has happened , "
58683	58721	58680	58681	Sir William	80	" from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire . About the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . "
58789	58873	58784	58784	he	125	" Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel . Lady Bourgh is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter . I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest — there is no occasion for anything more . Lady Bourgh will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed . She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . "
60101	60119	60096	60097	Lady Bourgh	126	" Your father 's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins , I think . For your sake , "
60124	60167	60096	60097	Lady Bourgh	126	" I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line . It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh 's family . Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? "
60168	60172	60096	60097	Lady Bourgh	126	" A little . "
60173	60215	60096	60097	Lady Bourgh	126	" Oh ! then — some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to —— You shall try it some day . Do your sisters play and sing ? "
60216	60222	60096	60097	Lady Bourgh	126	" One of them does . "
60223	60260	60096	60097	Lady Bourgh	126	" Why did not you all learn ? You ought all to have learned . The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as yours . Do you draw ? "
60261	60268	60096	60097	Lady Bourgh	126	" No , not at all . "
60269	60276	60096	60097	Lady Bourgh	126	" What , none of you ? "
60277	60281	60096	60097	Lady Bourgh	126	" Not one . "
60282	60312	60096	60097	Lady Bourgh	126	" That is very strange . But I suppose you had no opportunity . Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . "
60313	60328	60096	60097	Lady Bourgh	126	" My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London . "
60329	60336	60096	60097	Lady Bourgh	126	" Has your governess left you ? "
60337	60344	60096	60097	Lady Bourgh	126	" We never had any governess . "
60345	60384	60096	60097	Lady Bourgh	126	" No governess ! How was that possible ? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! I never heard of such a thing . Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . "
60401	60423	60391	60391	she	82	" Then , who taught you ? who attended to you ? Without a governess , you must have been neglected . "
60424	60474	60391	60391	she	82	" Compared with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means . We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . Those who chose to be idle , certainly might . "
60475	60661	60391	60391	she	82	" Aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way . I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . Mrs. Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalf 's calling yesterday to thank me ? She finds Miss Pope a treasure . ' Lady Bourgh , ' said she , ' you have given me a treasure . ' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? "
60662	60669	60391	60391	she	82	" Yes , ma'am , all . "
60670	60709	60391	60391	she	82	" All ! What , all five out at once ? Very odd ! And you only the second . The younger ones out before the elder ones are married ! Your younger sisters must be very young ? "
60710	60817	60391	60391	she	82	" Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . Perhaps SHE is full young to be much in company . But really , ma'am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement , because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early . The last - born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth at the first . And to be kept back on SUCH a motive ! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . "
60818	60823	60825	60826	her ladyship	3412	" Upon my word , "
60828	60848	60825	60826	her ladyship	3412	" you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . Pray , what is your age ? "
60849	60857	60859	60859	Elizabeth	82	" With three younger sisters grown up , "
60863	60874	60859	60859	Elizabeth	82	" your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . "
60908	60929	60875	60876	Lady Bourgh	126	" You can not be more than twenty , I am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age . "
60930	60940	60960	60961	Lady Bourgh	126	" I am not one - and - twenty . "
62366	62393	62333	62333	Charlotte	100	" I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . "
62598	62619	62581	62581	She	82	" My eldest sister has been in town these three months . Have you never happened to see her there ? "
63062	63094	63054	63054	she	3412	" What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? What is it you are talking of ? What are you telling Miss Bennet ? Let me hear what it is . "
63095	63104	63106	63106	he	163	" We are speaking of music , madam , "
63117	63221	63054	63054	she	3412	" Of music ! Then pray speak aloud . It is of all subjects my delight . I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music . There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient . And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? "
63234	63248	63250	63251	Lady Bourgh	126	" I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , "
63253	63277	63250	63251	Lady Bourgh	126	" and pray tell her from me , that she can not expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal . "
63278	63285	63286	63286	he	89	" I assure you , madam , "
63289	63303	63286	63286	he	89	" that she does not need such advice . She practises very constantly . "
63304	63432	63433	63434	Mr. Darcy	89	" So much the better . It can not be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice . I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well unless she practises more ; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson 's room . She would be in nobody 's way , you know , in that part of the house . "
63563	63626	63541	63541	he	89	" You mean to frighten me , Mr. Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? I will not be alarmed though your sister DOES play so well . There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me . "
63627	63636	63637	63637	he	89	" I shall not say you are mistaken , "
63640	63686	63637	63637	he	89	" because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own . "
63702	63820	63687	63687	Elizabeth	82	" Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character , in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . Indeed , Mr. Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire — and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too — for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear . "
63821	63829	63831	63831	he	1492	" I am not afraid of you , "
63835	63848	63850	63851	Colonel Fitzwilliam	163	" Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , "
63853	63865	63850	63851	Colonel Fitzwilliam	163	" I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . "
63866	63954	63687	63687	Elizabeth	82	" You shall hear then — but prepare yourself for something very dreadful . The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball — and at this ball , what do you think he did ? He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . Mr. Darcy , you can not deny the fact . "
63955	63976	63850	63851	Colonel Fitzwilliam	163	" I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . "
63977	64009	63687	63687	Elizabeth	82	" True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball - room . Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? My fingers wait your orders . "
64010	64013	64015	64015	Darcy	89	" Perhaps , "
64017	64042	64015	64015	Darcy	89	" I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction ; but I am ill - qualified to recommend myself to strangers . "
64053	64062	64046	64047	your cousin	4092	" said Elizabeth , still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam . "
64092	64092	64046	64047	your cousin	4092	"
64093	64100	64102	64102	Fitzwilliam	163	" I can answer your question , "
64104	64121	64102	64102	Fitzwilliam	163	" without applying to him . It is because he will not give himself the trouble . "
64122	64134	64136	64136	Darcy	89	" I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , "
64138	64172	64136	64136	Darcy	89	" of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . I can not catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . "
64173	64177	64179	64179	Elizabeth	82	" My fingers , "
64181	64262	64179	64179	Elizabeth	82	" do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women 's do . They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault — because I will not take the trouble of practising . It is not that I do not believe MY fingers as capable as any other woman 's of superior execution . "
64268	64304	64263	64263	Darcy	89	" You are perfectly right . You have employed your time much better . No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting . We neither of us perform to strangers . "
64347	64406	64330	64331	Lady Bourgh	126	" Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master . She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne 's . Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . "
64737	64800	64723	64723	he	89	" How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr. Darcy ! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London ? "
64801	64809	64734	64734	she	82	" Perfectly so , I thank you . "
64829	64849	64813	64813	she	82	" I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? "
64850	64897	64810	64810	She	82	" I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future . He has many friends , and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . "
64898	64976	64813	64813	she	82	" If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . But , perhaps , Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle . "
64977	64984	64986	64986	Darcy	89	" I should not be surprised , "
64988	65004	64986	64986	Darcy	89	" if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers . "
65052	65080	65042	65042	He	1512	" This seems a very comfortable house . Lady Bourgh , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford . "
65081	65104	64986	64986	Darcy	89	" I believe she did — and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . "
65105	65120	65042	65042	He	1512	" Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife . "
65121	65207	64986	64986	Darcy	89	" Yes , indeed , his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . My friend has an excellent understanding — though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did . She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her . "
65208	65231	65042	65042	He	1512	" It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . "
65232	65248	64986	64986	Darcy	89	" An easy distance , do you call it ? It is nearly fifty miles . "
65249	65278	65042	65042	He	1512	" And what is fifty miles of good road ? Little more than half a day 's journey . Yes , I call it a VERY easy distance . "
65295	65299	65279	65279	I	0	" cried Elizabeth . "
65313	65313	65305	65306	Mrs. Collins	159	"
65314	65341	65343	65343	he	1515	" It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire . Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . "
65377	65479	65374	65374	she	82	" I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil . But that is not the case HERE . Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys — and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself NEAR her family under less than HALF the present distance . "
65493	65516	65483	65483	his	89	" YOU can not have a right to such very strong local attachment . YOU can not have been always at Longbourn . "
65554	65561	65529	65529	he	282	" Are you pleased with Kent ? "
65640	65649	65651	65651	Charlotte	100	" What can be the meaning of this ? "
65660	65686	65651	65651	Charlotte	100	" My dear , Eliza , he must be in love with you , or he would never have called us in this familiar way . "
66652	66665	66649	66649	she	82	" I did not know before that you ever walked this way . "
66666	66677	66678	66678	he	89	" I have been making the tour of the park , "
66681	66707	66678	66678	he	89	" as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage . Are you going much farther ? "
66708	66719	66649	66649	she	82	" No , I should have turned in a moment . "
66734	66743	66745	66745	she	82	" Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? "
66747	66775	66649	66649	she	82	" Yes — if Darcy does not put it off again . But I am at his disposal . He arranges the business just as he pleases . "
66776	66821	66678	66678	he	89	" And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice . I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy . "
66822	66833	66835	66836	Colonel Fitzwilliam	163	" He likes to have his own way very well , "
66838	66892	66835	66836	Colonel Fitzwilliam	163	" But so we all do . It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . I speak feelingly . A younger son , you know , must be inured to self - denial and dependence . "
66893	66950	66678	66678	he	89	" In my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either . Now seriously , what have you ever known of self - denial and dependence ? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring anything you had a fancy for ? "
66951	66997	66835	66836	Colonel Fitzwilliam	163	" These are home questions — and perhaps I can not say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature . But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from want of money . Younger sons can not marry where they like . "
66998	67015	66678	66678	he	89	" Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . "
67046	67046	66835	66836	Colonel Fitzwilliam	163	"
67047	67051	67053	67053	Elizabeth	82	" Is this , "
67055	67060	67062	67062	she	82	" meant for me ? "
67079	67114	67071	67071	herself	82	" And pray , what is the usual price of an earl 's younger son ? Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . "
67149	67218	67144	67144	she	82	" I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal . I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . But , perhaps , his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . "
67219	67222	67224	67225	Colonel Fitzwilliam	163	" No , "
67227	67250	67224	67225	Colonel Fitzwilliam	163	" that is an advantage which he must divide with me . I am joined with him in the guardianship of Georgiana . "
67251	67305	67311	67311	him	163	" Are you indeed ? And pray what sort of guardians do you make ? Does your charge give you much trouble ? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . "
67355	67417	67351	67351	She	1545	" You need not be frightened . I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world . She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley . I think I have heard you say that you know them . "
67418	67442	67322	67322	he	163	" I know them a little . Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man — he is a great friend of Darcy 's . "
67443	67448	67450	67450	Elizabeth	82	" Oh ! yes , "
67453	67473	67450	67450	Elizabeth	82	" Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . "
67474	67549	67322	67322	he	163	" Care of him ! Yes , I really believe Darcy DOES take care of him in those points where he most wants care . From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . It was all conjecture . "
67550	67557	67450	67450	Elizabeth	82	" What is it you mean ? "
67558	67593	67322	67322	he	163	" It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady 's family , it would be an unpleasant thing . "
67594	67604	67450	67450	Elizabeth	82	" You may depend upon my not mentioning it . "
67605	67696	67322	67322	he	163	" And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley . What he told me was merely this : that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . "
67697	67708	67450	67450	Elizabeth	82	" Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference ? "
67709	67723	67322	67322	he	163	" I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . "
67724	67735	67450	67450	Elizabeth	82	" And what arts did he use to separate them ? "
67736	67748	67750	67750	Fitzwilliam	89	" He did not talk to me of his own arts , "
67754	67766	67750	67750	Fitzwilliam	89	" He only told me what I have now told you . "
67797	67809	67811	67811	she	82	" I am thinking of what you have been telling me , "
67813	67832	67811	67811	she	82	" Your cousin 's conduct does not suit my feelings . Why was he to be the judge ? "
67833	67844	67788	67788	Fitzwilliam	89	" You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? "
67845	67893	67894	67894	she	82	" I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend 's inclination , or why , upon his own judgement alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy . But , "
67900	67932	67894	67894	she	82	" as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . "
67933	67941	67943	67943	Fitzwilliam	89	" That is not an unnatural surmise , "
67945	67962	67943	67943	Fitzwilliam	89	" but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousin 's triumph very sadly . "
68184	68195	68197	68198	Colonel Fitzwilliam	163	" There were some very strong objections against the lady , "
68228	68233	68234	68234	she	82	" To Jane herself , "
68237	68299	68234	68234	she	82	" there could be no possibility of objection ; all loveliness and goodness as she is!—her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . Neither could anything be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never each . "
68944	68978	68931	68931	he	89	" In vain I have struggled . It will not do . My feelings will not be repressed . You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . "
69290	69423	69287	69287	she	82	" In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned . It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could FEEL gratitude , I would now thank you . But I cannot — I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone . It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . "
69518	69565	69515	69515	he	89	" And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little ENDEAVOUR at civility , I am thus rejected . But it is of small importance . "
69566	69573	69575	69575	she	82	" I might as well inquire , "
69577	69690	69575	69575	she	82	" why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I WAS uncivil ? But I have other provocations . You know I have . Had not my feelings decided against you — had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? "
69720	69810	69717	69717	she	82	" I have every reason in the world to think ill of you . No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted THERE . You dare not , you can not deny , that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other — of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . "
69850	69860	69861	69861	she	82	" Can you deny that you have done it ? "
69871	69911	69867	69867	he	89	" I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . Towards HIM I have been kinder than towards myself . "
69937	69946	69947	69947	she	82	" But it is not merely this affair , "
69950	70022	69947	69947	she	82	" on which my dislike is founded . Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided . Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham . On this subject , what can you have to say ? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others ? "
70023	70035	70037	70037	Darcy	89	" You take an eager interest in that gentleman 's concerns , "
70051	70069	69947	69947	she	82	" Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? "
70070	70074	70076	70076	Darcy	89	" His misfortunes ! "
70079	70089	70076	70076	Darcy	89	" yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . "
70090	70096	70098	70098	Elizabeth	82	" And of your infliction , "
70102	70176	70098	70098	Elizabeth	82	" You have reduced him to his present state of poverty — comparative poverty . You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him . You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert . You have done all this ! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule . "
70177	70181	70183	70183	Darcy	89	" And this , "
70195	70236	70238	70238	he	89	" is your opinion of me ! This is the estimation in which you hold me ! I thank you for explaining it so fully . My faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed ! But perhaps , "
70250	70381	70238	70238	he	89	" these offenses might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I , with greater policy , concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by everything . But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . They were natural and just . Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?—to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? "
70405	70453	70402	70402	she	82	" You are mistaken , Mr. Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . "
70470	70494	70467	70467	she	82	" You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . "
70519	70617	70515	70515	She	82	" From the very beginning — from the first moment , I may almost say — of my acquaintance with you , your manners , impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . "
70618	70670	70515	70515	She	82	" You have said quite enough , madam . I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . "
71271	71299	71258	71258	she	82	" I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . Will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? "
71405	71539	71381	71381	she	82	" Be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you . I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice .
71540	71790	71381	71381	she	82	" Two offenses of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge . The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister , and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham . Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison . But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in the future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read . If , in the explanation of them , which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours , I can only say that I am sorry . The necessity must be obeyed , and further apology would be absurd .
71791	72463	71381	71381	she	82	" I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country . But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment . I had often seen him in love before . At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas 's accidental information , that Bingley 's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided . From that moment I observed my friend 's behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him . Your sister I also watched . Her look and manners were open , cheerful , and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening 's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment . If YOU have not been mistaken here , I must have been in error . Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable . If it be so , if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister 's countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched . That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain — but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears . I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it ; I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason . My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me . But there were other causes of repugnance ; causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me . These causes must be stated , though briefly . The situation of your mother 's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father . Pardon me . It pains me to offend you . But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both . I will only say farther that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection . He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning .
72464	72868	71381	71381	she	82	" The part which I acted is now to be explained . His sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered , and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London . We accordingly went — and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice . I described , and enforced them earnestly . But , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving , of your sister 's indifference . He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard . But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own . To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment . I can not blame myself for having done thus much . There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister 's being in town . I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley ; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it . That they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable ; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger . Perhaps this concealment , this disguise was beneath me ; it is done , however , and it was done for the best . On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . If I have wounded your sister 's feelings , it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them .
72869	72935	71381	71381	she	82	" With respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Mr. Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . Of what he has PARTICULARLY accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity .
72936	73215	71381	71381	she	82	" Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates , and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him ; and on George Wickham , who was his godson , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge — most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman 's education . My father was not only fond of this young man 's society , whose manner were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner . The vicious propensities — the want of principle , which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr. Darcy could not have . Here again shall give you pain — to what degree you only can tell . But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character — it adds even another motive .
73216	73741	71381	71381	she	82	" My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow — and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant . There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds . His own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . He had some intention , he added , of studying law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein . I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but , at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal . I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman ; the business was therefore soon settled — he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . All connection between us seemed now dissolved . I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town . In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation . For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . He had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would present him to the living in question — of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered father 's intentions . You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition to it . His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances — and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself . After this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped . How he lived I know not . But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice .
73742	74106	71381	71381	she	82	" I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being . Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy . My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother 's nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself . About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr. Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . You may imagine what I felt and how I acted . Regard for my sister 's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure ; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge . Mr. Wickham 's chief object was unquestionably my sister 's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement . His revenge would have been complete indeed .
74107	74207	71381	71381	she	82	" This , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham . I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination .
74208	74365	71381	71381	she	82	" You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night ; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . For the truth of everything here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who , from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and , still more , as one of the executors of my father 's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions . If your abhorrence of ME should make MY assertions valueless , you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . I will only add , God bless you ,
74366	74369	71381	71381	she	82	" FITZWILLIAM DARCY "
74701	74717	74691	74691	She	82	" This must be false ! This can not be ! This must be the grossest falsehood!"—and
76011	76018	76019	76019	she	82	" How despicably I have acted ! "
76022	76152	76019	76019	she	82	" I , who have prided myself on my discernment ! I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust ! How humiliating is this discovery ! Yet , how just a humiliation ! Had I been in love , I could not have been more wretchedly blind ! But vanity , not love , has been my folly . Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned . Till this moment I never knew myself . "
76816	76829	76834	76834	she	82	" What would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? "
76849	76859	76861	76862	Lady Bourgh	126	" I assure you , I feel it exceedingly , "
76864	76951	76861	76862	Lady Bourgh	126	" I believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do . But I am particularly attached to these young men , and know them to be so much attached to me ! They were excessively sorry to go ! But so they always are . The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more , I think , than last year . His attachment to Rosings certainly increases . "
77017	77055	77014	77014	she	126	" But if that is the case , you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer . Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . "
77056	77069	77071	77071	Elizabeth	82	" I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , "
77073	77093	77071	77071	Elizabeth	82	" but it is not in my power to accept it . I must be in town next Saturday . "
77094	77148	77014	77014	she	126	" Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . I expected you to stay two months . I told Mrs. Collins so before you came . There can be no occasion for your going so soon . Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . "
77149	77165	77071	77071	Elizabeth	82	" But my father can not . He wrote last week to hurry my return . "
77166	77283	77014	77014	she	126	" Oh ! your father of course may spare you , if your mother can . Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father . And if you will stay another MONTH complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche - box , there will be very good room for one of you — and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . "
77284	77303	77071	77071	Elizabeth	82	" You are all kindness , madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . "
77309	77485	77304	77305	Lady Bourgh	126	" Mrs. Collins , you must send a servant with them . You know I always speak my mind , and I can not bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . It is highly improper . You must contrive to send somebody . I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing . Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men - servants go with her . Georgiana , the daughter of Mr. Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner . I am excessively attentive to all those things . You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs. Collins . I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to YOU to let them go alone . "
77486	77497	77304	77305	Lady Bourgh	126	" My uncle is to send a servant for us . "
77498	77555	77304	77305	Lady Bourgh	126	" Oh ! Your uncle ! He keeps a man - servant , does he ? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things . Where shall you change horses ? Oh ! Bromley , of course . If you mention my name at the Bell , you will be attended to . "
78296	78304	78306	78306	he	125	" I know not , Miss Elizabeth , "
78308	78434	78306	78306	he	125	" whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us ; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . The favor of your company has been much felt , I assure you . We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode . Our plain manner of living , our small rooms and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly . "
78491	78646	78478	78479	Mr. Collins	125	" It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and , from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit can not have been entirely irksome . Our situation with regard to Lady Bourgh 's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . You see on what a footing we are . You see how continually we are engaged there . In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings . "
78681	78827	78668	78668	Elizabeth	82	" You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so . Lady Bourgh 's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate — but on this point it will be as well to be silent . Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . We seem to have been designed for each other . "
79088	79091	79092	79092	he	125	" But , "
79095	79125	79092	79092	he	125	" you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . "
79146	79150	79152	79152	Maria	94	" Good gracious ! "
79161	79182	79152	79152	Maria	94	" it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! "
79183	79189	79191	79192	her companion	1675	" A great many indeed , "
79197	79220	79152	79152	Maria	94	" We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea there twice ! How much I shall have to tell ! "
79225	79235	79221	79221	Elizabeth	82	" And how much I shall have to conceal ! "
79582	79595	79562	79562	they	1688	" Is not this nice ? Is not this an agreeable surprise ? "
79596	79605	79607	79607	Lydia	84	" And we mean to treat you all , "
79609	79630	79607	79607	Lydia	84	" but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . "
79635	79689	79699	79699	she	84	purchases—"Look here , I have bought this bonnet . I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . "
79706	79775	79699	79699	she	84	" Oh ! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable . Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the — — shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . "
79776	79781	79783	79783	Elizabeth	82	" Are they indeed ! "
79790	79855	79699	79699	she	84	" They are going to be encamped near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! It would be such a delicious scheme ; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all . Mamma would like to go too of all things ! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! "
79856	79859	79861	79861	Elizabeth	82	" Yes , "
79863	79914	79861	79861	Elizabeth	82	" THAT would be a delightful scheme indeed , and completely do for us at once . Good Heaven ! Brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of Meryton ! "
79915	79925	79927	79927	Lydia	84	" Now I have got some news for you , "
79936	79959	79927	79927	Lydia	84	" What do you think ? It is excellent news — capital news — and about a certain person we all like ! "
79984	80108	79978	79978	Lydia	84	" Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion . You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say . But he is an ugly fellow ! I am glad he is gone . I never saw such a long chin in my life . Well , but now for my news ; it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is it not ? There is no danger of Wickham 's marrying Mary King . There 's for you ! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool : gone to stay . Wickham is safe . "
80109	80116	80118	80118	Elizabeth	82	" And Mary King is safe ! "
80120	80130	80118	80118	Elizabeth	82	" safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . "
80131	80146	79978	79978	Lydia	84	" She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . "
80147	80160	80162	80162	Jane	154	" But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , "
80164	80198	79978	79978	Lydia	84	" I am sure there is not on HIS . I will answer for it , he never cared three straws about her — who could about such a nasty little freckled thing ? "
80289	80298	80300	80300	Lydia	84	" How nicely we are all crammed in , "
80302	80721	80300	80300	Lydia	84	" I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox ! Well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home . And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away . Have you seen any pleasant men ? Have you had any flirting ? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . She is almost three - and - twenty ! Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three - and - twenty ! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands , you ca n't think . She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins ; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it . Lord ! how I should like to be married before any of you ; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls . Dear me ! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster 's . Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by the bye , Mrs. Forster and me are SUCH friends ! ) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come , but Harriet was ill , and so Pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman 's clothes on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun ! Not a soul knew of it , but Colonel and Mrs. Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you can not imagine how well he looked ! When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . Lord ! how I laughed ! and so did Mrs. Forster . I thought I should have died . And THAT made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . "
80809	80820	80802	80803	Mr. Bennet	75	" I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . "
80940	80945	80947	80947	she	81	" Oh ! Mary , "
80949	81106	80947	80947	she	81	" I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! As we went along , Kitty and I drew up the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . And then when we came away it was such fun ! I thought we never should have got into the coach . I was ready to die of laughter . And then we were so merry all the way home ! we talked and laughed so loud , that anybody might have heard us ten miles off ! "
81114	81160	81109	81109	Mary	87	" Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures ! They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds . But I confess they would have no charms for ME — I should infinitely prefer a book . "
81527	81537	81539	81539	she	82	" His being so sure of succeeding was wrong , "
81541	81560	81539	81539	she	82	" and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment ! "
81561	81564	81566	81566	Elizabeth	82	" Indeed , "
81568	81605	81566	81566	Elizabeth	82	" I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings , which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? "
81606	81614	81539	81539	she	82	" Blame you ! Oh , no . "
81615	81628	81566	81566	Elizabeth	82	" But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham ? "
81629	81646	81539	81539	she	82	" No — I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . "
81647	81665	81566	81566	Elizabeth	82	" But you WILL know it , when I tell you what happened the very next day . "
81769	81775	81777	81777	Elizabeth	82	" This will not do , "
81779	81861	81777	81777	Elizabeth	82	" you never will be able to make both of them good for anything . Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . There is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much . For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Darcy 's ; but you shall do as you choose . "
81878	81890	81892	81892	she	154	" I do not know when I have been more shocked , "
81894	81963	81892	81892	she	154	" Wickham so very bad ! It is almost past belief . And poor Mr. Darcy ! Dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . Such a disappointment ! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion , too ! and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! It is really too distressing . I am sure you must feel it so . "
81964	82031	81749	81749	she	154	" Oh ! no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both . I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . Your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . "
82032	82056	81892	81892	she	154	" Poor Wickham ! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! such an openness and gentleness in his manner ! "
82057	82089	81749	81749	she	154	" There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men . One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . "
82090	82109	81892	81892	she	154	" I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the APPEARANCE of it as you used to do . "
82110	82185	81749	81749	she	154	" And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . It is such a spur to one 's genius , such an opening for wit , to have a dislike of that kind . One may be continually abusive without saying anything just ; but one can not always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . "
82186	82210	81892	81892	she	154	" Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . "
82211	82272	81749	81749	she	154	" Indeed , I could not . I was uncomfortable enough , I may say unhappy . And with no one to speak to about what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had ! Oh ! how I wanted you ! "
82273	82301	81892	81892	she	154	" How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy , for now they DO appear wholly undeserved . "
82302	82360	81749	81749	she	154	" Certainly . But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . There is one point on which I want your advice . I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not , to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham 's character . "
82371	82389	82361	82362	Miss Bennet	82	" Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . What is your opinion ? "
82390	82546	81892	81892	she	154	" That it ought not to be attempted . Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . On the contrary , every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light . I am not equal to it . Wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is . Some time hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . At present I will say nothing about it . "
82547	82594	82361	82362	Miss Bennet	82	" You are quite right . To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . He is now , perhaps , sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re - establish a character . We must not make him desperate . "
82724	82728	82730	82730	she	82	" And then , "
82732	82778	82730	82730	she	82	" if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . The liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value ! "
82909	82914	82916	82917	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Well , Lizzy , "
82921	83035	82916	82917	Mrs. Bennet	85	" what is your opinion NOW of this sad business of Jane 's ? For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . I told my sister Phillips so the other day . But I can not find out that Jane saw anything of him in London . Well , he is a very undeserving young man — and I do not suppose there 's the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have inquired of everybody , too , who is likely to know . "
83036	83050	83149	83150	her mother	235	" I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more . "
83051	83124	82916	82917	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Oh well ! it is just as he chooses . Nobody wants him to come . Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if I was her , I would not have put up with it . Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart ; and then he will be sorry for what he has done . "
83142	83147	83149	83150	her mother	235	" Well , Lizzy , "
83155	83224	83149	83150	her mother	235	" and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ? Well , well , I only hope it will last . And what sort of table do they keep ? Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say . If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . There is nothing extravagant in THEIR housekeeping , I dare say . "
83225	83232	83149	83150	her mother	235	" No , nothing at all . "
83233	83311	83149	83150	her mother	235	" A great deal of good management , depend upon it . Yes , yes . THEY will take care not to outrun their income . THEY will never be distressed for money . Well , much good may it do them ! And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . They look upon it as quite their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . "
83312	83325	83149	83150	her mother	235	" It was a subject which they could not mention before me . "
83326	83387	83149	83150	her mother	235	" No ; it would have been strange if they had ; but I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves . Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better . I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . "
83492	83509	83511	83511	they	1740	" Good Heaven ! what is to become of us ? What are we to do ? "
83519	83529	83511	83511	they	1740	" How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? "
83558	83563	83565	83565	she	1746	" I am sure , "
83567	83591	83565	83565	she	1746	" I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller 's regiment went away . I thought I should have broken my heart . "
83592	83601	83603	83603	Lydia	84	" I am sure I shall break MINE , "
83605	83614	83616	83617	Mrs. Bennet	85	" If one could but go to Brighton ! "
83619	83636	83565	83565	she	1746	" Oh , yes!—if one could but go to Brighton ! But papa is so disagreeable . "
83637	83649	83565	83565	she	1746	" A little sea - bathing would set me up forever . "
83650	83667	83669	83669	Kitty	86	" And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do ME a great deal of good , "
83899	83916	83918	83918	she	84	" I can not see why Mrs. Forster should not ask ME as well as Lydia , "
83920	83953	83918	83918	she	84	" Though I am NOT her particular friend . I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . "
84105	84147	84096	84096	He	238	" Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . "
84148	84154	84156	84156	Elizabeth	82	" If you were aware , "
84158	84202	84156	84156	Elizabeth	82	" of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia 's unguarded and imprudent manner — nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . "
84203	84207	84209	84210	Mr. Bennet	75	" Already arisen ? "
84212	84275	84209	84210	Mr. Bennet	75	" What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? Poor little Lizzy ! But do not be cast down . Such squeamish youths as can not bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret . Come , let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia 's folly . "
84276	84534	84535	84536	Mr. Bennet	75	" Indeed you are mistaken . I have no such injuries to resent . It is not of particular , but of general evils , which I am now complaining . Our importance , our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia 's character . Excuse me , for I must speak plainly . If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous ; a flirt , too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and , from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . In this danger Kitty also is comprehended . She will follow wherever Lydia leads . Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrolled ! Oh ! my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? "
84556	84729	84535	84536	Mr. Bennet	75	" Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . Wherever you and Jane are known you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of — or I may say , three — very silly sisters . We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton . Let her go , then . Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody . At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . The officers will find women better worth their notice . Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . At any rate , she can not grow many degrees worse , without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life . "
85380	85391	85375	85375	he	254	" How long did you say he was at Rosings ? "
85392	85397	85375	85375	he	254	" Nearly three weeks . "
85398	85405	85375	85375	he	254	" And you saw him frequently ? "
85406	85413	85375	85375	he	254	" Yes , almost every day . "
85414	85425	85375	85375	he	254	" His manners are very different from his cousin 's . "
85426	85441	85375	85375	he	254	" Yes , very different . But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance . "
85442	85445	85447	85448	Mr. Wickham	134	" Indeed ! "
85458	85467	85447	85448	Mr. Wickham	134	" And pray , may I ask ? — "
85480	85506	85507	85507	he	254	" Is it in address that he improves ? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?—for I dare not hope , "
85517	85525	85507	85507	he	254	" that he is improved in essentials . "
85526	85531	85533	85533	Elizabeth	82	" Oh , no ! "
85535	85551	85533	85533	Elizabeth	82	" In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . "
85597	85638	85594	85594	she	82	" When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement , but that , from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . "
85681	85840	85667	85667	he	134	" You , who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the APPEARANCE of what is right . His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by . I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe . His fear of her has always operated , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Alla , which I am certain he has very much at heart . "
86715	86721	86723	86723	she	82	" But it is fortunate , "
86725	86806	86723	86723	she	82	" that I have something to wish for . Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister 's absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised . A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . "
87402	87406	87408	87408	she	82	" But surely , "
87410	87432	87408	87408	she	82	" I may enter his county without impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me . "
87784	87804	87806	87807	her aunt	1185	" My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? "
87809	87835	87806	87807	her aunt	1185	" a place , too , with which so many of your acquaintances are connected . Wickham passed all his youth there , you know . "
87897	87908	87910	87910	she	118	" If it were merely a fine house richly furnished , "
87912	87938	87910	87910	she	118	" I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . They have some of the finest woods in the country . "
88713	88719	88721	88721	she	82	" And of this place , "
88723	88771	88721	88721	she	82	" I might have been mistress ! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted ! Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt . But no,"—recollecting
88772	88798	88819	88820	the housekeeper	797	herself—"that could never be ; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me ; I should not have been allowed to invite them . "
88865	88881	88860	88860	he	1904	" But we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends . "
88982	88991	88992	88992	she	797	" He is now gone into the army , "
88995	89007	88992	88992	she	797	" but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . "
89025	89029	89031	89032	Mrs. Reynolds	182	" And that , "
89041	89067	89031	89032	Mrs. Reynolds	182	" is my master — and very like him . It was drawn at the same time as the other — about eight years ago . "
89068	89080	89082	89083	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" I have heard much of your master 's fine person , "
89090	89112	89082	89083	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" it is a handsome face . But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . "
89130	89139	89113	89114	Mrs. Reynolds	182	" Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy ? "
89146	89150	89140	89140	Elizabeth	82	" A little . "
89151	89165	89113	89114	Mrs. Reynolds	182	" And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma'am ? "
89166	89172	89140	89140	Elizabeth	82	" Yes , very handsome . "
89173	89230	89113	89114	Mrs. Reynolds	182	" I am sure I know none so handsome ; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . This room was my late master 's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . He was very fond of them . "
89263	89273	89275	89276	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" And is Georgiana as handsome as her brother ? "
89278	89331	89243	89244	Mrs. Reynolds	182	" Oh ! yes — the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished!—She plays and sings all day long . In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her — a present from my master ; she comes here to - morrow with him . "
89374	89388	89332	89333	Mr. Gardiner	153	" Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? "
89389	89422	89332	89333	Mr. Gardiner	153	" Not so much as I could wish , sir ; but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Georgiana is always down for the summer months . "
89423	89426	89428	89428	Elizabeth	82	" Except , "
89430	89437	89428	89428	Elizabeth	82	" when she goes to Ramsgate . "
89438	89452	89332	89333	Mr. Gardiner	153	" If your master would marry , you might see more of him . "
89453	89479	89428	89428	Elizabeth	82	" Yes , sir ; but I do not know when THAT will be . I do not know who is good enough for him . "
89492	89511	89486	89486	Elizabeth	82	" It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . "
89512	89529	89531	89532	the other	585	" I say no more than the truth , and everybody will say that knows him , "
89553	89580	89549	89550	the housekeeper	797	" I have never known a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . "
89633	89656	89618	89618	she	82	" There are very few people of whom so much can be said . You are lucky in having such a master . "
89657	89727	89732	89732	her	82	" Yes , sir , I know I am . If I were to go through the world , I could not meet with a better . But I have always observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest - tempered , most generous - hearted boy in the world . "
89734	89741	89743	89743	she	82	" Can this be Mr. Darcy ? "
89745	89753	89755	89756	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" His father was an excellent man , "
89758	89784	89728	89728	Elizabeth	82	" Yes , ma'am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him — just as affable to the poor . "
89879	89891	89893	89893	she	82	" He is the best landlord , and the best master , "
89895	89967	89893	89893	she	82	" that ever lived ; not like the wild young men nowadays , who think of nothing but themselves . There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name . Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw anything of it . To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . "
89968	89979	89981	89981	Elizabeth	82	" In what an amiable light does this place him ! "
89983	89990	89992	89993	her aunt	1185	" This fine account of him , "
89998	90011	89992	89993	her aunt	1185	" is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . "
90012	90019	89992	89993	her aunt	1185	" Perhaps we might be deceived . "
90020	90033	89992	89993	her aunt	1185	" That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . "
90092	90100	90102	90102	Elizabeth	82	" He is certainly a good brother , "
90127	90137	90138	90138	she	182	" And this is always the way with him , "
90141	90168	90138	90138	she	182	" Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment . There is nothing he would not do for her . "
92008	92011	91985	91985	she	82	" delightful , "
92013	92016	92001	92001	she	82	" charming , "
92122	92129	92131	92131	she	82	" What will be his surprise , "
92133	92150	92131	92131	she	82	" when he knows who they are ? He takes them now for people of fashion . "
92427	92484	92424	92424	she	82	" Why is he so altered ? From what can it proceed ? It can not be for ME — it can not be for MY sake that his manners are thus softened . My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . It is impossible that he should still love me . "
92625	92629	92630	92630	she	579	unexpected—"for your housekeeper , "
92633	92668	92630	92630	she	579	" informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and indeed , before we left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . "
92705	92715	92716	92716	he	254	" They will join me early to - morrow , "
92719	92739	92716	92716	he	254	" and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you — Mr. Bingley and his sisters . "
92788	92799	92800	92800	he	254	" There is also one other person in the party , "
92806	92842	92800	92800	he	254	" who more particularly wishes to be known to you . Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? "
93186	93198	93200	93201	her uncle	567	" He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , "
93203	93217	93219	93220	her aunt	1185	" There IS something a little stately in him , to be sure , "
93222	93260	93219	93220	her aunt	1185	" but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , I have seen nothing of it . "
93261	93302	93219	93220	her aunt	1185	" I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . "
93303	93310	93312	93313	her aunt	1185	" To be sure , Lizzy , "
93315	93355	93312	93313	her aunt	1185	" he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or , rather , he has not Wickham 's countenance , for his features are perfectly good . But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable ? "
93394	93407	93409	93410	her uncle	567	" But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , "
93412	93446	93409	93410	her uncle	567	" Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . "
93461	93470	93472	93473	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" From what we have seen of him , "
93475	93599	93472	93473	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham . He has not an ill - natured look . On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks . And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . But , to be sure , the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character ! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and THAT in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue . "
94935	94951	94959	94959	he	79	" was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; "
94962	94988	94959	94959	he	79	" It is above eight months . We have not met since the 26th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . "
97438	97465	97412	97413	Miss Bingley	91	" Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the — — shire Militia removed from Meryton ? They must be a great loss to YOUR family . "
97966	97980	97981	97981	she	91	" How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr. Darcy , "
97984	98024	97981	97981	she	91	" I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter . She is grown so brown and coarse ! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . "
98063	98069	98070	98070	she	91	" For my own part , "
98073	98191	98070	98070	she	91	" I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her . Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . Her nose wants character — there is nothing marked in its lines . Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I could never see anything extraordinary in them . They have a sharp , shrewish look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether there is a self - sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . "
98258	98336	98255	98255	she	91	" I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' SHE a beauty!—I should as soon call her mother a wit . ' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . "
98337	98340	98342	98342	Darcy	89	" Yes , "
98351	98382	98342	98342	Darcy	89	" but THAT was only when I first saw her , for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintances . "
98703	99029	99041	99041	she	2209	" Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you — be assured that we are all well . What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham ! Imagine our surprise . To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . I am very , very sorry . So imprudent a match on both sides ! But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart . His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . Our poor mother is sadly grieved . My father bears it better . How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . The express was sent off directly . My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . I must conclude , for I can not be long from my poor mother . I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . "
99080	99855	99906	99907	a servant	491	" By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I can not answer for being coherent . Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it can not be delayed . Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . Though Lydia 's short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F. , who , instantly taking the alarm , set off from B. intending to trace their route . He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no further ; for on entering that place , they removed into a hackney coach , and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . I know not what to think . After making every possible inquiry on that side London , Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success — no such people had been seen to pass through . With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F. , but no one can throw any blame on them . Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . My father and mother believe the worst , but I can not think so ill of him . Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if HE could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia 's connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to everything ? Impossible ! I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he fear W. was not a man to be trusted . My poor mother is really ill , and keeps her room . Could she exert herself , it would be better ; but this is not to be expected . And as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected . Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence , one can not wonder . I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now , as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . Adieu ! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not ; but circumstances are such that I can not help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible . I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her . What he means to do I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to - morrow evening . In such and exigence , my uncle 's advice and assistance would be everything in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness . "
99856	99866	99868	99868	Elizabeth	82	" Oh ! where , where is my uncle ? "
99950	99986	99933	99933	she	82	" I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment , on business that can not be delayed ; I have not an instant to loose . "
99987	99996	99998	99998	he	2210	" Good God ! what is the matter ? "
100010	100046	99998	99998	he	2210	" I will not detain you a minute ; but let me , or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner . You are not well enough ; you can not go yourself . "
100147	100182	100128	100128	Darcy	89	" Let me call your maid . Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief ? A glass of wine ; shall I get you one ? You are very ill . "
100183	100190	100191	100191	she	82	" No , I thank you , "
100199	100229	100191	100191	she	82	" There is nothing the matter with me . I am quite well ; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . "
100279	100365	100275	100275	she	82	" I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . It can not be concealed from anyone . My younger sister has left all her friends — has eloped ; has thrown herself into the power of — of Mr. Wickham . They are gone off together from Brighton . YOU know him too well to doubt the rest . She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to — she is lost for ever . "
100372	100377	100378	100378	she	82	" When I consider , "
100387	100447	100378	100378	she	82	" that I might have prevented it ! I , who knew what he was . Had I but explained some part of it only — some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! Had his character been known , this could not have happened . But it is all — all too late now . "
100448	100454	100456	100456	Darcy	89	" I am grieved indeed , "
100458	100471	100456	100456	Darcy	89	" grieved — shocked . But is it certain — absolutely certain ? "
100472	100504	100378	100378	she	82	" Oh , yes ! They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to Scotland . "
100505	100521	100456	100456	Darcy	89	" And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? "
100522	100605	100378	100378	she	82	" My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle 's immediate assistance ; and we shall be off , I hope , in half - an - hour . But nothing can be done — I know very well that nothing can be done . How is such a man to be worked on ? How are they even to be discovered ? I have not the smallest hope . It is every way horrible ! "
100614	100658	100659	100659	Darcy	89	" When MY eyes were opened to his real character — Oh ! had I known what I ought , what I dared to do ! But I knew not — I was afraid of doing too much . Wretched , wretched mistake ! "
100889	100986	100868	100869	her companion	1675	" I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing concern . Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress ! But I will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister 's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to - day . "
100987	101031	101032	101032	He	1675	" Oh , yes . Be so kind as to apologise for us to Georgiana . Say that urgent business calls us home immediately . Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible , I know it can not be long . "
101797	101807	101809	101810	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" But what is to be done about Pemberley ? "
101812	101830	101809	101810	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us ; was it so ? "
101831	101853	101809	101810	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . THAT is all settled . "
101854	101860	101862	101863	the other	585	" What is all settled ? "
101874	101899	101866	101866	she	585	" And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ? Oh , that I knew how it was ! "
102058	102069	102071	102072	her uncle	567	" I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , "
102081	102196	102071	102072	her uncle	567	" and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter . It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel 's family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best . Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? His temptation is not adequate to the risk ! "
102197	102204	102206	102206	Elizabeth	82	" Do you really think so ? "
102214	102219	102221	102222	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" Upon my word , "
102224	102287	102221	102222	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" I begin to be of your uncle 's opinion . It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of . I can not think so very ill of Wickham . Can you yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? "
102288	102341	102071	102072	her uncle	567	" Not , perhaps , of neglecting his own interest ; but of every other neglect I can believe him capable . If , indeed , it should be so ! But I dare not hope it . Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case ? "
102342	102348	102350	102351	Mr. Gardiner	153	" In the first place , "
102353	102367	102350	102351	Mr. Gardiner	153	" there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . "
102368	102403	102071	102072	her uncle	567	" Oh ! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption ! And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road . "
102404	102471	102350	102351	Mr. Gardiner	153	" Well , then — supposing them to be in London . They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptional purpose . It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London than in Scotland . "
102700	102700	102954	102954	her	2267	"
102701	102731	102954	102954	her	2267	" But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage ? "
102732	102744	102746	102746	Elizabeth	82	" It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , "
102754	102944	102746	102746	Elizabeth	82	" that a sister 's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . But , really , I know not what to say . Perhaps I am not doing her justice . But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half - year , nay , for a twelvemonth — she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . Since the — — shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers have been in her head . She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater — what shall I call it ? susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . "
102945	102952	102954	102955	her aunt	1185	" But you see that Jane , "
102957	102975	102954	102955	her aunt	1185	" does not think so very ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt . "
102976	103064	102746	102746	Elizabeth	82	" Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would think capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word ; that he has neither integrity nor honour ; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating . "
103065	103074	103076	103077	Mrs. Gardiner	118	" And do you really know all this ? "
103092	103097	103099	103099	Elizabeth	82	" I do indeed , "
103103	103225	103099	103099	Elizabeth	82	" I told you , the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy ; and you yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty — which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless . From what he said of Georgiana I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . Yet he knew to the contrary himself . He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . "
103226	103250	102746	102746	Elizabeth	82	" But does Lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? "
103251	103433	103099	103099	Elizabeth	82	" Oh , yes!—that , that is the worst of all . Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . And when I returned home , the — — shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight 's time . As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown ? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . That SHE could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . That such a consequence as THIS could ensue , you may easily believe , was far enough from my thoughts . "
103434	103460	102746	102746	Elizabeth	82	" When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other ? "
103461	103593	103099	103099	Elizabeth	82	" Not the slightest . I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had anything of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away . When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished HER by any particular attention ; and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . "
103863	103867	103869	103869	Jane	154	" Not yet , "
103871	103888	103869	103869	Jane	154	" But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope everything will be well . "
103889	103896	103835	103835	she	82	" Is my father in town ? "
103897	103911	103869	103869	Jane	154	" Yes , he went on Tuesday , as I wrote you word . "
103912	103921	103835	103835	she	82	" And have you heard from him often ? "
103922	103979	103869	103869	Jane	154	" We have heard only twice . He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . He merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention . "
103980	103994	103835	103835	she	82	" And my mother — how is she ? How are you all ? "
103995	104047	103869	103869	Jane	154	" My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . She does not yet leave her dressing - room . Mary and Kitty are , thank Heaven , are quite well . "
104048	104056	104058	104058	Elizabeth	82	" But you — how are you ? "
104060	104073	104058	104058	Elizabeth	82	" You look pale . How much you must have gone through ! "
104311	104318	104320	104320	she	85	" If I had been able , "
104322	104502	104320	104320	she	85	" to carry my point in going to Brighton , with all my family , THIS would not have happened ; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after . I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was overruled , as I always am . Poor dear child ! And now here 's Mr. Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave , and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . "
104554	104563	104565	104565	he	153	" Do not give way to useless alarm , "
104567	104681	104565	104565	he	153	" though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . In a few days more we may gain some news of them ; and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street ; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . "
104682	104689	104691	104692	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Oh ! my dear brother , "
104694	104889	104691	104692	Mrs. Bennet	85	" that is exactly what I could most wish for . And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , MAKE them marry . And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them , after they are married . And , above all , keep Mr. Bennet from fighting . Tell him what a dreadful state I am in , that I am frighted out of my wits — and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me — such spasms in my side and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . Oh , brother , how kind you are ! I know you will contrive it all . "
105169	105209	105143	105143	she	87	" This is a most unfortunate affair , and will probably be much talked of . But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation . "
105223	105294	105220	105220	she	87	" Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson : that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable ; that one false step involves her in endless ruin ; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful ; and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . "
105417	105465	105408	105409	the former	323	" But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard . Give me further particulars . hat did Colonel Forster say ? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place ? They must have seen them together for ever . "
105466	105550	105408	105409	the former	323	" Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia 's side , but nothing to give him any alarm . I am so grieved for him ! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . He WAS coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . "
105551	105579	105408	105409	the former	323	" And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? Did he know of their intending to go off ? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ? "
105580	105636	105408	105409	the former	323	" Yes ; but , when questioned by HIM , Denny denied knowing anything of their plans , and would not give his real opinion about it . He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying — and from THAT , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . "
105637	105662	105408	105409	the former	323	" And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? "
105663	105781	105408	105409	the former	323	" How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ? I felt a little uneasy — a little fearful of my sister 's happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . My father and mother knew nothing of that ; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia 's last letter she had prepared her for such a step . She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . "
105782	105791	105408	105409	the former	323	" But not before they went to Brighton ? "
105792	105799	105408	105409	the former	323	" No , I believe not . "
105800	105820	105408	105409	the former	323	" And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself ? Does he know his real character ? "
105821	105876	105408	105409	the former	323	" I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did . He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant . And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt ; but I hope this may be false . "
105877	105903	105408	105409	the former	323	" Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! "
105904	105912	105914	105915	her sister	324	" Perhaps it would have been better , "
105917	105945	105914	105915	her sister	324	" But to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . We acted with the best intentions . "
105946	105961	105408	105409	the former	323	" Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia 's note to his wife ? "
105962	105973	105914	105915	her sister	324	" He brought it with him for us to see . "
105995	105999	105408	105409	the former	323	" MY DEAR HARRIET ,
106000	106256	105408	105409	the former	323	" You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I can not help laughing myself at your surprise to - morrow morning , as soon as I am missed . I am going to Gretna Green , and if you can not guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel . I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them and sign my name ' Lydia Wickham . ' What a good joke it will be ! I can hardly write for laughing . Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to - night . Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all ; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure . I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up . Good - bye . Give my love to Colonel Forster . I hope you will drink to our good journey .
106257	106261	105408	105409	the former	323	" Your affectionate friend ,
106262	106266	105408	105409	the former	323	" LYDIA BENNET . "
106267	106275	106277	106277	Elizabeth	82	" Oh ! thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! "
106344	106344	106338	106338	he	2317	"
106345	106379	106304	106304	SHE	82	" I never saw anyone so shocked . He could not speak a word for full ten minutes . My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! "
106380	106385	106387	106387	Elizabeth	82	" Oh ! Jane , "
106389	106411	106387	106387	Elizabeth	82	" was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? "
106412	106484	106304	106304	SHE	82	" I do not know . I hope there was . But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult . My mother was in hysterics , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done ! But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties . "
106485	106522	106387	106387	Elizabeth	82	" Your attendance upon her has been too much for you . You do not look well . Oh that I had been with you ! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . "
106523	106658	106304	106304	SHE	82	" Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure ; but I did not think it right for either of them . Kitty is slight and delicate ; and Mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on . My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me . She was of great use and comfort to us all . And Lady Lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters ' , if they should be of use to us . "
106659	106668	106670	106670	Elizabeth	82	" She had better have stayed at home , "
106672	106718	106670	106670	Elizabeth	82	" perhaps she MEANT well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one can not see too little of one 's neighbours . Assistance is impossible ; condolence insufferable . Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . "
106746	106752	106754	106754	Jane	154	" He meant I believe , "
106756	106928	106754	106754	Jane	154	" to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them . His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . It had come with a fare from London ; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady 's removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham . If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make inquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . I do not know of any other designs that he had formed ; but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . "
107543	107677	107513	107513	He	153	" I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man 's intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself . If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . At present we have nothing to guide us . Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head . But , on second thoughts , perhaps , Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living , better than any other person . "
107927	107931	107902	107902	Elizabeth	82	" MY DEAR SIR ,
107932	108325	107902	107902	Elizabeth	82	" I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . Be assured , my dear sir , that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune — or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent 's mind . The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence ; though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied ; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins , but likewise by Lady Bourgh and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others ; for who , as Lady Bourgh herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family ? And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect , with augmented satisfaction , on a certain event of last November ; for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . Let me then advise you , dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense .
108326	108338	107902	107902	Elizabeth	82	" I am , dear sir , etc . , etc . "
108558	108562	108563	108563	she	154	" A gamester ! "
108566	108580	108563	108563	she	154	" This is wholly unexpected . I had not an idea of it . "
108689	108702	108703	108703	she	85	" What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ? "
108706	108736	108703	108703	she	85	" Sure he will not leave London before he has found them . Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? "
109060	109086	109057	109057	he	75	" Say nothing of that . Who should suffer but myself ? It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . "
109087	109097	109099	109099	Elizabeth	82	" You must not be too severe upon yourself , "
109101	109159	109057	109057	he	75	" You may well warn me against such an evil . Human nature is so prone to fall into it ! No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . It will pass away soon enough . "
109160	109170	109229	109229	he	238	" Do you suppose them to be in London ? "
109171	109183	109057	109057	he	75	" Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? "
109184	109195	109197	109197	Kitty	86	" And Lydia used to want to go to London , "
109199	109205	109207	109208	her father	238	" She is happy then , "
109211	109223	109207	109208	her father	238	" and her residence there will probably be of some duration . "
109232	109265	109229	109229	he	238	" Lizzy , I bear you no ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shows some greatness of mind . "
109282	109288	109289	109289	he	238	" This is a parade , "
109292	109350	109289	109289	he	238	" which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my nightcap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as I can ; or , perhaps , I may defer it till Kitty runs away . "
109351	109362	109364	109364	Kitty	86	" I am not going to run away , papa , "
109367	109383	109364	109364	Kitty	86	" If I should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . "
109384	109488	109289	109289	he	238	" YOU go to Brighton . I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds ! No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . No officer is ever to enter into my house again , nor even to pass through the village . Balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . "
109505	109510	109512	109512	he	2383	" Well , well , "
109514	109546	109512	109512	he	2383	" do not make yourself unhappy . If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them . "
109616	109653	109610	109610	she	797	" I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . "
109654	109669	109610	109610	she	797	" What do you mean , Hill ? We have heard nothing from town . "
109670	109674	109676	109677	Mrs. Hill	124	" Dear madam , "
109683	109715	109676	109677	Mrs. Hill	124	" do n't you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner ? He has been here this half - hour , and master has had a letter . "
109780	109799	109774	109775	the butler	2395	" If you are looking for my master , ma'am , he is walking towards the little copse . "
109879	109897	109862	109863	her sister	324	" Oh , papa , what news — what news ? Have you heard from my uncle ? "
109898	109910	109963	109963	his	241	" Yes I have had a letter from him by express . "
109911	109925	109862	109863	her sister	324	" Well , and what news does it bring — good or bad ? "
109926	109936	109938	109938	he	241	" What is there of good to be expected ? "
109947	109957	109938	109938	he	241	" But perhaps you would like to read it . "
109971	109976	109978	109979	their father	241	" Read it aloud , "
109981	109992	109978	109979	their father	241	" for I hardly know myself what it is about . "
109993	110001	109958	109958	Elizabeth	82	" Gracechurch Street , Monday , August 2 .
110002	110006	109978	109979	their father	241	" MY DEAR BROTHER ,
110007	110084	109958	109958	Elizabeth	82	" At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope it will give you satisfaction . Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were . The particulars I reserve till we meet ; it is enough to know they are discovered . I have seen them both — "
110085	110094	110096	110096	Jane	154	" Then it is as I always hoped , "
110098	110103	110096	110096	Jane	154	" they are married ! "
110108	110471	109958	109958	Elizabeth	82	" I have seen them both . They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . These are conditions which , considering everything , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you . I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr. Wickham 's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care . Send back your answer as fast as you can , and be careful to write explicitly . We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve . She comes to us to - day . I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on . Yours , etc . ,
110472	110477	110559	110559	she	82	" EDW . GARDINER . "
110478	110483	110485	110485	Elizabeth	82	" Is it possible ? "
110492	110503	110488	110488	she	82	" Can it be possible that he will marry her ? "
110504	110518	110520	110521	her sister	324	" Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we thought him , "
110523	110532	110520	110521	her sister	324	" My dear father , I congratulate you . "
110533	110541	110543	110543	Elizabeth	82	" And have you answered the letter ? "
110545	110555	110559	110559	she	82	" No ; but it must be done soon . "
110572	110579	110580	110580	she	82	" Oh ! my dear father , "
110583	110601	110580	110580	she	82	" come back and write immediately . Consider how important every moment is in such a case . "
110602	110609	110611	110611	Jane	154	" Let me write for you , "
110613	110621	110611	110611	Jane	154	" if you dislike the trouble yourself . "
110622	110629	110630	110630	he	2405	" I dislike it very much , "
110633	110640	110630	110630	he	2405	" but it must be done . "
110657	110663	110665	110665	Elizabeth	82	" And may I ask — "
110667	110680	110665	110665	Elizabeth	82	" but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . "
110681	110695	110611	110611	Jane	154	" Complied with ! I am only ashamed of his asking so little . "
110696	110709	110665	110665	Elizabeth	82	" And they MUST marry ! Yet he is SUCH a man ! "
110710	110768	110611	110611	Jane	154	" Yes , yes , they must marry . There is nothing else to be done . But there are two things that I want very much to know ; one is , how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about ; and the other , how am I ever to pay him . "
110769	110775	110777	110777	Jane	154	" Money ! My uncle ! "
110779	110787	110777	110777	Jane	154	" what do you mean , sir ? "
110788	110822	110611	110611	Jane	154	" I mean , that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . "
110823	110829	110831	110831	Elizabeth	82	" That is very true , "
110833	110887	110831	110831	Elizabeth	82	" though it had not occurred to me before . His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! Oh ! it must be my uncle 's doings ! Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . A small sum could not do all this . "
110888	110891	110893	110894	her father	238	" No , "
110896	110933	110893	110894	her father	238	" Wickham 's a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds . I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . "
110934	110952	110893	110894	her father	238	" Ten thousand pounds ! Heaven forbid ! How is half such a sum to be repaid ? "
110997	111006	111008	111008	Elizabeth	82	" And they are really to be married ! "
111018	111063	111008	111008	Elizabeth	82	" How strange this is ! And for THIS we are to be thankful . That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice . Oh , Lydia ! "
111064	111071	111073	111073	Jane	154	" I comfort myself with thinking , "
111075	111143	111073	111073	Jane	154	" that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her . Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I can not believe that ten thousand pounds , or anything like it , has been advanced . He has children of his own , and may have more . How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? "
111144	111159	111161	111161	Elizabeth	82	" If he were ever able to learn what Wickham 's debts have been , "
111163	111279	111161	111161	Elizabeth	82	" and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own . The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited . Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge . By this time she is actually with them ! If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! "
111280	111294	111296	111296	Jane	154	" We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , "
111298	111368	111296	111296	Jane	154	" I hope and trust they will yet be happy . His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . "
111369	111376	111378	111378	Elizabeth	82	" Their conduct has been such , "
111380	111402	111378	111378	Elizabeth	82	" as neither you , nor I , nor anybody can ever forget . It is useless to talk of it . "
111461	111467	111455	111455	his	241	" Just as you please . "
111468	111481	111455	111455	his	241	" May we take my uncle 's letter to read to her ? "
111482	111492	111455	111455	his	241	" Take whatever you like , and get away . "
111632	111639	111640	111640	she	154	" My dear , dear Lydia ! "
111643	111785	111640	111640	she	154	" This is delightful indeed ! She will be married ! I shall see her again ! She will be married at sixteen ! My good , kind brother ! I knew how it would be . I knew he would manage everything ! How I long to see her ! and to see dear Wickham too ! But the clothes , the wedding clothes ! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . Stay , stay , I will go myself . Ring the bell , Kitty , for Hill . I will put on my things in a moment . My dear , dear Lydia ! How merry we shall be together when we meet ! "
111818	111827	111828	111828	she	2421	" For we must attribute this happy conclusion , "
111831	111855	111828	111828	she	2421	" in a great measure to his kindness . We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money . "
111856	111859	111861	111862	her mother	235	" Well , "
111864	112008	111861	111862	her mother	235	" it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money , you know ; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him , except a few presents . Well ! I am so happy ! In a short time I shall have a daughter married . Mrs. Wickham ! How well it sounds ! And she was only sixteen last June . My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I ca n't write ; so I will dictate , and you write for me . We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . "
112096	112103	112105	112105	she	154	" I will go to Meryton , "
112107	112219	112105	112105	she	154	" as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long . Kitty , run down and order the carriage . An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . Girls , can I do anything for you in Meryton ? Oh ! Here comes Hill ! My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding . "
113221	113227	113229	113229	she	85	" Haye Park might do , "
113231	113284	113229	113229	she	85	" if the Gouldings could quit it — or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but Ashworth is too far off ! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for Pulvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful . "
113310	113364	113305	113305	he	254	" Mrs. Bennet , before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . Into ONE house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance . I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . "
114149	114161	114162	114162	he	153	" It was greatly my wish that he should do so , "
114165	114465	114162	114162	he	153	" as soon as his marriage was fixed on . And I think you will agree with me , in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece 's . It is Mr. Wickham 's intention to go into the regulars ; and among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . He has the promise of an ensigncy in General — — 's regiment , now quartered in the North . It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . He promises fairly ; and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which I have pledged myself . And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his information ? He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us . Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South . She is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and your mother.—Yours , etc . ,
114466	114470	114471	114472	Mr. Bennet	75	" E. GARDINER . "
114580	114589	114591	114591	she	84	" She is so fond of Mrs. Forster , "
114593	114635	114591	114591	she	84	" it will be quite shocking to send her away ! And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . The officers may not be so pleasant in General — — 's regiment . "
115392	115401	115402	115402	she	82	" Only think of its being three months , "
115405	115469	115402	115402	she	82	" since I went away ; it seems but a fortnight I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . Good gracious ! when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again ! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . "
115508	115599	115488	115488	she	82	" Oh ! mamma , do the people here abouts know I am married to - day ? I was afraid they might not ; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side - glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . "
115668	115692	115661	115661	her	84	" Ah ! Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . "
115745	115748	115743	115743	herself	84	" Mrs. Wickham "
115783	115788	115790	115790	she	84	" Well , mamma , "
115802	115869	115790	115790	she	84	" and what do you think of my husband ? Is not he a charming man ? I am sure my sisters must all envy me . I only hope they may have half my good luck . They must all go to Brighton . That is the place to get husbands . What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . "
115870	115907	115986	115987	her mother	235	" Very true ; and if I had my will , we should . But my dear Lydia , I do n't at all like your going such a way off . Must it be so ? "
115908	115974	115790	115790	she	84	" Oh , lord ! yes;—there is nothing in that . I shall like it of all things . You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . "
115975	115984	115986	115987	her mother	235	" I should like it beyond any thing ! "
115989	116025	115790	115790	she	84	" And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . "
116026	116037	116039	116039	Elizabeth	82	" I thank you for my share of the favour , "
116041	116054	116039	116039	Elizabeth	82	" but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . "
116358	116401	116353	116353	she	84	" Lizzy , I never gave YOU an account of my wedding , I believe . You were not by , when I told mamma and the others all about it . Are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? "
116402	116406	116408	116408	Elizabeth	82	" No really , "
116410	116424	116353	116353	she	84	" I think there can not be too little said on the subject . "
116425	116606	116353	116353	she	84	" La ! You are so strange ! But I must tell you how it went off . We were married , you know , at St. Clement 's , because Wickham 's lodgings were in that parish . And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock . My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a fuss ! I was so afraid , you know , that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . "
116607	116843	116353	116353	she	84	" Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . If you 'll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . Not one party , or scheme , or any thing . To be sure London was rather thin , but , however , the Little Theatre was open . Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone . And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day . But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes ' time , and then we all set out . However , I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr. Darcy might have done as well . "
116844	116848	116850	116850	Elizabeth	82	" Mr. Darcy ! "
116856	116908	116353	116353	she	84	" Oh , yes!—he was to come there with Wickham , you know . But gracious me ! I quite forgot ! I ought not to have said a word about it . I promised them so faithfully ! What will Wickham say ? It was to be such a secret ! "
116909	116917	116919	116919	Jane	154	" If it was to be secret , "
116921	116939	116919	116919	Jane	154	" say not another word on the subject . You may depend upon my seeking no further . "
116940	116945	116947	116947	Elizabeth	82	" Oh ! certainly , "
116954	116962	116947	116947	Elizabeth	82	" we will ask you no questions . "
116963	116967	116969	116969	Lydia	84	" Thank you , "
116971	116991	116969	116969	Lydia	84	" for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry . "
117160	117166	117167	117167	she	82	" You may readily comprehend , "
117170	117250	117167	117167	she	82	" what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . Pray write instantly , and let me understand it — unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . "
117251	117259	117260	117260	she	82	" Not that I SHALL , though , "
117271	117302	117260	117260	she	82	" and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . "
117422	117428	119523	119524	Mr. Darcy	89	" Gracechurch street , Sept. 6 .
117429	117433	119523	119524	Mr. Darcy	89	" MY DEAR NIECE ,
117434	119477	119523	119524	Mr. Darcy	89	" I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a LITTLE writing will not comprise what I have to tell you . I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from YOU . Do n't think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on YOUR side . If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . Your uncle is as much surprised as I am — and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done . But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . Mr. Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as YOUR 'S seems to have been . He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both ; Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them . The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him . He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world . His character was to speak for itself . He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself . If he HAD ANOTHER motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than WE had ; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us . There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs. Younge , who was some time ago governess to Georgiana , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . She then took a large house in Edward - street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . This Mrs. Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town . But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished - for direction . They were in — — street . He saw Wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia . His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go . But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . She cared for none of her friends ; she wanted no help of his ; she would not hear of leaving Wickham . She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt had never been HIS design . He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill - consequences of Lydia 's flight on her own folly alone . He meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once . Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country . Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . They met several times , for there was much to be discussed . Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . Every thing being settled between THEM , Mr. Darcy 's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home . But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen , and Mr. Darcy found , on further inquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former . He did not leave his name , and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . On Saturday he came again . Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together . They met again on Sunday , and then I saw him too . It was not all settled before Monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn . But our visitor was very obstinate . I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character , after all . He has been accused of many faults at different times , but THIS is the true one . Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it ) , your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . They battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most . You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people . His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon HER , and his commission purchased . The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above . It was owing to him , to his reserve and want of proper consideration , that Wickham 's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . Perhaps there was some truth in THIS ; though I doubt whether HIS reserve , or ANYBODY 'S reserve , can be answerable for the event . But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for ANOTHER INTEREST in the affair . When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . I believe I have now told you every thing . It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . Lydia came to us ; and Wickham had constant admission to the house . HE was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane 's letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain . I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding . He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday . Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never bold enough to say before ) how much I like him . His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire . His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and THAT , if he marry PRUDENTLY , his wife may teach him . I thought him very sly;—he hardly ever mentioned your name . But slyness seems the fashion . Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park . A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing . But I must write no more . The children have been wanting me this half hour . Yours , very sincerely ,
119478	119482	119523	119524	Mr. Darcy	89	" M. GARDINER . "
120055	120069	120071	120071	he	134	" I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? "
120078	120083	120084	120084	she	82	" You certainly do , "
120090	120103	120084	120084	she	82	" but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . "
120104	120127	120180	120180	She	82	" I should be sorry indeed , if it were . We were always good friends ; and now we are better . "
120128	120137	120084	120084	she	82	" True . Are the others coming out ? "
120138	120179	120180	120180	She	82	" I do not know . Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton . And so , my dear sister , I find , from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . "
120186	120251	120084	120084	she	82	" I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle . And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ? Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me . But of course she did not mention my name to you . "
120252	120258	120316	120316	she	82	" Yes , she did . "
120259	120266	120084	120084	she	82	" And what did she say ? "
120267	120302	120316	120316	she	82	" That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had — not turned out well . At such a distance as THAT , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . "
120303	120306	120307	120307	he	2586	" Certainly , "
120327	120355	120322	120322	he	2586	" I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . We passed each other several times . I wonder what he can be doing there . "
120356	120365	120367	120367	Elizabeth	82	" Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Alla , "
120369	120386	120367	120367	Elizabeth	82	" It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . "
120387	120411	120322	120322	he	2586	" Undoubtedly . Did you see him while you were at Lambton ? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . "
120412	120422	120367	120367	Elizabeth	82	" Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . "
120423	120430	120322	120322	he	2586	" And do you like her ? "
120431	120435	120367	120367	Elizabeth	82	" Very much . "
120436	120482	120322	120322	he	2586	" I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . When I last saw her , she was not very promising . I am very glad you liked her . I hope she will turn out well . "
120483	120499	120367	120367	Elizabeth	82	" I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . "
120500	120510	120322	120322	he	2586	" Did you go by the village of Kympton ? "
120511	120520	120367	120367	Elizabeth	82	" I do not recollect that we did . "
120521	120554	120322	120322	he	2586	" I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had . A most delightful place!—Excellent Parsonage House ! It would have suited me in every respect . "
120555	120564	120367	120367	Elizabeth	82	" How should you have liked making sermons ? "
120565	120649	120322	120322	he	2586	" Exceedingly well . I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . One ought not to repine;—but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! The quiet , the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! But it was not to be . Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ? "
120650	120680	120367	120367	Elizabeth	82	" I have heard from authority , which I thought AS GOOD , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . "
120681	120705	120322	120322	he	2586	" You have . Yes , there was something in THAT ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . "
120706	120757	120367	120367	Elizabeth	82	" I DID hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon - making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly . "
120758	120788	120322	120322	he	2586	" You did ! and it was not wholly without foundation . You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . "
120837	120874	120824	120824	she	2589	" Come , Mr. Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . Do not let us quarrel about the past . In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . "
120999	121006	121007	121007	she	2589	" Oh ! my dear Lydia , "
121010	121017	121007	121007	she	2589	" when shall we meet again ? "
121018	121037	121093	121093	his	134	" Oh , lord ! I do n't know . Not these two or three years , perhaps . "
121038	121048	121007	121007	she	2589	" Write to me very often , my dear . "
121049	121083	121093	121093	his	134	" As often as I can . But you know married women have never much time for writing . My sisters may write to ME . They will have nothing else to do . "
121109	121117	121119	121120	Mr. Bennet	75	" He is as fine a fellow , "
121132	121176	121119	121120	Mr. Bennet	75	" as ever I saw . He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all . I am prodigiously proud of him . I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son - in - law . "
121191	121196	121198	121198	she	85	" I often think , "
121200	121221	121198	121198	she	85	" that there is nothing so bad as parting with one 's friends . One seems so forlorn without them . "
121222	121238	121240	121240	Elizabeth	82	" This is the consequence , you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , "
121242	121256	121240	121240	Elizabeth	82	" It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . "
121257	121302	121198	121198	she	85	" It is no such thing . Lydia does not leave me because she is married , but only because her husband 's regiment happens to be so far off . If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . "
121396	121411	121382	121382	She	85	" Well , well , and so Mr. Bingley is coming down , sister , "
121423	121521	121382	121382	She	85	" Well , so much the better . Not that I care about it , though . He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure I never want to see him again . But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . And who knows what MAY happen ? But that is nothing to us . You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . And so , is it quite certain he is coming ? "
121522	121529	121531	121532	the other	585	" You may depend on it , "
121534	121623	121531	121532	the other	585	" for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . He comes down on Thursday at the latest , very likely on Wednesday . She was going to the butcher 's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed . "
121666	121779	121663	121663	she	84	" I saw you look at me to - day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed . But do n't imagine it was from any silly cause . I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I SHOULD be looked at . I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . Not that I am afraid of MYSELF , but I dread other people 's remarks . "
121852	121858	121859	121859	she	82	" Yet it is hard , "
121863	121893	121859	121859	she	82	" that this poor man can not come to a house which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation ! I WILL leave him to himself . "
121966	121978	121980	121981	Mrs. Bennet	85	" As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes , my dear , "
121983	121992	121980	121981	Mrs. Bennet	85	" you will wait on him of course . "
121993	122044	122045	122045	His	2612	" No , no . You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised , if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool 's errand again . "
122070	122078	122080	122080	he	2612	" ' Tis an etiquette I despise , "
122082	122121	122080	122080	he	2612	" If he wants our society , let him seek it . He knows where we live . I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again . "
122122	122191	122197	122197	she	2615	" Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . But , however , that sha n't prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon . That will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . "
122243	122255	122257	122257	Jane	154	" I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , "
122262	122327	122257	122257	Jane	154	" It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know , how much I suffer from what she says . Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over ! "
122328	122340	122342	122342	Elizabeth	82	" I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , "
122344	122380	122342	122342	Elizabeth	82	" but it is wholly out of my power . You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . "
122521	122531	122533	122533	Kitty	86	" There is a gentleman with him , mamma , "
122535	122541	122533	122533	Kitty	86	" who can it be ? "
122542	122562	122505	122505	she	82	" Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . "
122563	122566	122568	122568	Kitty	86	" La ! "
122570	122598	122568	122568	Kitty	86	" it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . Mr. what's - his - name . That tall , proud man . "
122599	122644	122645	122645	Jane	154	" Good gracious ! Mr. Darcy!—and so it does , I vow . Well , any friend of Mr. Bingley 's will always be welcome here , to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . "
122953	122962	122964	122964	she	82	" Let me first see how he behaves , "
122966	122976	122964	122964	she	82	" it will then be early enough for expectation . "
123421	123430	123432	123432	she	82	" Could I expect it to be otherwise ! "
123434	123441	123432	123432	she	82	" Yet why did he come ? "
123476	123491	123493	123494	Mrs. Bennet	85	" It is a long time , Mr. Bingley , since you went away , "
123502	123681	123496	123496	He	79	" I began to be afraid you would never come back again . People DID say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true . A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away . Miss Lucas is married and settled . And one of my own daughters . I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers . It was in The Times and The Courier , I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . It was only said , ' Lately , George Wickham , Esq . to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . It was my brother Gardiner 's drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . Did you see it ? "
123713	123731	123733	123734	her mother	235	" It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , "
123736	123833	123733	123734	her mother	235	" but at the same time , Mr. Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay I do not know how long . His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the — — shire , and of his being gone into the regulars . Thank Heaven ! he has SOME friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . "
123906	123919	123921	123922	her mother	235	" When you have killed all your own birds , Mr. Bingley , "
123924	123969	123921	123922	her mother	235	" I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet 's manor . I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you . "
124040	124048	124050	124050	she	82	" The first wish of my heart , "
124054	124093	124050	124050	she	82	" is never more to be in company with either of them . Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! Let me never see either one or the other again ! "
124266	124279	124280	124280	she	85	" You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr. Bingley , "
124283	124338	124280	124280	she	85	" for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned . I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . "
124477	124493	124495	124495	she	82	" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , "
124497	124504	124495	124495	she	82	" did he come at all ? "
124517	124579	124580	124580	Her	82	" He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? If he fears me , why come hither ? If he no longer cares for me , why silent ? Teasing , teasing , man ! I will think no more about him . "
124616	124619	124621	124621	she	324	" Now , "
124623	124683	124621	124621	she	324	" that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy . I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . I am glad he dines here on Tuesday . It will then be publicly seen that , on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . "
124684	124691	124693	124693	Elizabeth	82	" Yes , very indifferent indeed , "
124697	124705	124693	124693	Elizabeth	82	" Oh , Jane , take care . "
124706	124726	124621	124621	she	324	" My dear Lizzy , you can not think me so weak , as to be in danger now ? "
124727	124748	124693	124693	Elizabeth	82	" I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . "
125299	125310	125312	125312	she	82	" If he does not come to me , THEN , "
125314	125323	125312	125312	she	82	" I shall give him up for ever . "
125414	125437	125396	125399	one of the girls	2689	" The men sha n't come and part us , I am determined . We want none of them ; do we ? "
125484	125542	125478	125478	herself	82	" A man who has once been refused ! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? Is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings ! "
125568	125576	125561	125561	she	82	" Is your sister at Pemberley still ? "
125577	125587	125561	125561	she	82	" Yes , she will remain there till Christmas . "
125588	125600	125561	125561	she	82	" And quite alone ? Have all her friends left her ? "
125601	125621	125561	125561	she	82	" Mrs. Annesley is with her . The others have been gone on to Scarborough , these three weeks . "
125830	125834	125836	125836	she	85	" Well girls , "
125847	126037	125836	125836	she	85	" What say you to the day ? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . The venison was roasted to a turn — and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch . The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases ' last week ; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least . And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . Mrs. Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . And what do you think she said besides ? ' Ah ! Mrs. Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last . ' She did indeed . I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived — and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously . "
126113	126122	126124	126125	Miss Bennet	84	" It has been a very agreeable day , "
126129	126152	126124	126125	Miss Bennet	84	" The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . I hope we may often meet again . "
126156	126251	126153	126153	Elizabeth	82	" Lizzy , you must not do so . You must not suspect me . It mortifies me . I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it . I am perfectly satisfied , from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing , than any other man . "
126252	126258	126260	126261	her sister	324	" You are very cruel , "
126263	126280	126260	126261	her sister	324	" you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . "
126281	126293	126153	126153	Elizabeth	82	" How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! "
126294	126301	126260	126261	her sister	324	" And how impossible in others ! "
126302	126319	126153	126153	Elizabeth	82	" But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? "
126320	126367	126260	126261	her sister	324	" That is a question which I hardly know how to answer . We all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante . "
126442	126448	126450	126450	she	85	" Next time you call , "
126452	126461	126450	126450	she	85	" I hope we shall be more lucky . "
126494	126502	126517	126517	her	85	" Can you come to - morrow ? "
126567	126624	126559	126559	her	85	" My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down . He is come — Mr. Bingley is come . He is , indeed . Make haste , make haste . Here , Sarah , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . Never mind Miss Lizzy 's hair . "
126625	126636	126638	126638	Jane	154	" We will be down as soon as we can , "
126640	126663	126638	126638	Jane	154	" but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . "
126664	126693	126696	126696	her	154	" Oh ! hang Kitty ! what has she to do with it ? Come be quick , be quick ! Where is your sash , my dear ? "
126804	126826	126799	126799	she	86	" What is the matter mamma ? What do you keep winking at me for ? What am I to do ? "
126827	126840	126841	126841	She	154	" Nothing child , nothing . I did not wink at you . "
126868	126882	126858	126858	she	154	" Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , "
126933	126946	126922	126923	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . "
126953	126965	126967	126968	her mother	235	" We may as well leave them by themselves you know ; "
126979	126994	126967	126968	her mother	235	" Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room . "
127556	127562	127563	127563	she	82	" ' Tis too much ! "
127566	127587	127563	127563	she	82	" by far too much . I do not deserve it . Oh ! why is not everybody as happy ? "
127647	127656	127657	127657	she	82	" I must go instantly to my mother ; "
127660	127722	127657	127657	she	82	" I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself . He is gone to my father already . Oh ! Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall I bear so much happiness ! "
127784	127788	127790	127790	she	82	" And this , "
127792	127822	127790	127790	she	82	" is the end of all his friend 's anxious circumspection ! of all his sister 's falsehood and contrivance ! the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! "
127846	127852	127854	127854	he	79	" Where is your sister ? "
127863	127882	127883	127883	He	79	" With my mother up stairs . She will be down in a moment , I dare say . "
128155	128170	128146	128146	he	75	" Jane , I congratulate you . You will be a very happy woman . "
128187	128194	128195	128195	he	75	" You are a good girl ; "
128198	128271	128195	128195	he	75	" and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . I have not a doubt of your doing very well together . Your tempers are by no means unlike . You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . "
128272	128290	128303	128304	his wife	225	" I hope not so . Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me . "
128291	128301	128303	128304	his wife	225	" Exceed their income ! My dear Mr. Bennet , "
128306	128329	128303	128304	his wife	225	" what are you talking of ? Why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more . "
128335	128438	128332	128333	her daughter	458	" Oh ! my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy ! I am sure I sha n't get a wink of sleep all night . I knew how it would be . I always said it must be so , at last . I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together . Oh ! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! "
128652	128660	128662	128662	she	154	" He has made me so happy , "
128667	128691	128662	128662	she	154	" by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! I had not believed it possible . "
128692	128698	128700	128700	Elizabeth	82	" I suspected as much , "
128702	128711	128662	128662	she	154	" But how did he account for it ? "
128712	128801	128662	128662	she	154	" It must have been his sister 's doing . They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I can not wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . "
128802	128810	128812	128812	Elizabeth	82	" That is the most unforgiving speech , "
128814	128845	128812	128812	Elizabeth	82	" that I ever heard you utter . Good girl ! It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley 's pretended regard . "
128846	128885	128662	128662	she	154	" Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of MY being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ! "
128886	128906	128812	128812	Elizabeth	82	" He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . "
128974	128986	128988	128988	Jane	154	" I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! "
128990	129029	128988	128988	Jane	154	" Oh ! Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! If I could but see YOU as happy ! If there WERE but such another man for you ! "
129030	129097	129113	129114	Mrs. Bennet	85	" If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you . Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . No , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time . "
129508	129528	129501	129501	she	85	" I hope you are well , Miss Bennet . That lady , I suppose , is your mother . "
129537	129548	129501	129501	she	85	" And THAT I suppose is one of your sisters . "
129549	129554	129556	129557	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Yes , madam , "
129567	129612	129556	129557	Mrs. Bennet	85	" She is my youngest girl but one . My youngest of all is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man who , I believe , will soon become a part of the family . "
129613	129622	129624	129625	Lady Bourgh	126	" You have a very small park here , "
129631	129661	129685	129686	Mrs. Bennet	85	" It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas 's . "
129662	129684	129685	129686	Mrs. Bennet	85	" This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west . "
129701	129720	129685	129686	Mrs. Bennet	85	" May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well . "
129721	129735	129685	129686	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Yes , very well . I saw them the night before last . "
129813	129855	129788	129789	Lady Bourgh	126	" Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn . I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . "
129856	129862	129864	129865	her mother	235	" Go , my dear , "
129867	129887	129864	129865	her mother	235	" and show her ladyship about the different walks . I think she will be pleased with the hermitage . "
130003	130014	130016	130016	she	126	" How could I ever think her like her nephew ? "
130042	130077	130033	130034	Lady Bourgh	126	" You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . "
130084	130110	130078	130078	Elizabeth	82	" Indeed , you are mistaken , Madam . I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . "
130111	130115	130117	130118	her ladyship	3412	" Miss Bennet , "
130125	130294	130117	130118	her ladyship	3412	" you ought to know , that I am not to be trifled with . But however insincere YOU may choose to be , you shall not find ME so . My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it . A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago . I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Mr. Darcy . Though I KNOW it must be a scandalous falsehood , though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . "
130295	130305	130307	130307	Elizabeth	82	" If you believed it impossible to be true , "
130315	130335	130307	130307	Elizabeth	82	" I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . What could your ladyship propose by it ? "
130336	130349	130117	130118	her ladyship	3412	" At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted . "
130350	130363	130365	130365	Elizabeth	82	" Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , "
130368	130388	130365	130365	Elizabeth	82	" will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . "
130389	130423	130117	130118	her ladyship	3412	" If ! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? "
130424	130432	130365	130365	Elizabeth	82	" I never heard that it was . "
130433	130448	130117	130118	her ladyship	3412	" And can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? "
130449	130474	130365	130365	Elizabeth	82	" I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship . You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer . "
130475	130506	130117	130118	her ladyship	3412	" This is not to be borne . Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? "
130507	130517	130365	130365	Elizabeth	82	" Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . "
130518	130574	130117	130118	her ladyship	3412	" It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason . But your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . You may have drawn him in . "
130575	130590	130365	130365	Elizabeth	82	" If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . "
130591	130635	130117	130118	her ladyship	3412	" Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ? I have not been accustomed to such language as this . I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . "
130636	130660	130365	130365	Elizabeth	82	" But you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . "
130661	130704	130117	130118	her ladyship	3412	" Let me be rightly understood . This match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place . No , never . Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter . Now what have you to say ? "
130705	130730	130365	130365	Elizabeth	82	" Only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . "
130742	130883	130731	130732	Lady Bourgh	126	" The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . From their infancy , they have been intended for each other . It was the favourite wish of HIS mother , as well as of her 's . While in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? To his tacit engagement with Alla ? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? "
130884	130990	130117	130118	her ladyship	3412	" Yes , and I had heard it before . But what is that to me ? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Alla . You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage . Its completion depended on others . If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? "
130991	131071	130731	130732	Lady Bourgh	126	" Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it . Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by everyone connected with him . Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . "
131072	131078	131080	131080	Elizabeth	82	" These are heavy misfortunes , "
131082	131116	131080	131080	Elizabeth	82	" But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . "
131117	131208	130731	130732	Lady Bourgh	126	" Obstinate , headstrong girl ! I am ashamed of you ! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? Is nothing due to me on that score ? Let us sit down . You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be dissuaded from it . I have not been used to submit to any person 's whims . I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment . "
131209	131231	131080	131080	Elizabeth	82	" THAT will make your ladyship 's situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on me . "
131232	131377	130731	130732	Lady Bourgh	126	" I will not be interrupted . Hear me in silence . My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . They are descended , on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father 's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient — though untitled — families . Their fortune on both sides is splendid . They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune . Is this to be endured ! But it must not , shall not be . If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up . "
131378	131412	131080	131080	Elizabeth	82	" In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman 's daughter ; so far we are equal . "
131413	131445	130731	130732	Lady Bourgh	126	" True . You ARE a gentleman 's daughter . But who was your mother ? Who are your uncles and aunts ? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . "
131446	131453	131455	131455	Elizabeth	82	" Whatever my connections may be , "
131457	131474	131455	131455	Elizabeth	82	" if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to YOU . "
131475	131488	130731	130732	Lady Bourgh	126	" Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? "
131520	131525	131508	131508	she	82	" I am not . "
131531	131546	130731	130732	Lady Bourgh	126	" And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? "
131547	131557	131508	131508	she	82	" I will make no promise of the kind . "
131558	131606	130731	130732	Lady Bourgh	126	" Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished . I expected to find a more reasonable young woman . But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede . I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require . "
131607	131778	131508	131508	she	82	" And I certainly NEVER shall give it . I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable . Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise make their marriage at all more probable ? Supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? Allow me to say , Lady Bourgh , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged . You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these . How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , I can not tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . I must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject . "
131779	131903	130731	130732	Lady Bourgh	126	" Not so hasty , if you please . I have by no means done . To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add . I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister 's infamous elopement . I know it all ; that the young man 's marrying her was a patched - up business , at the expence of your father and uncles . And is such a girl to be my nephew 's sister ? Is her husband , is the son of his late father 's steward , to be his brother ? Heaven and earth!—of what are you thinking ? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ? "
131904	131914	131915	131915	she	2816	" You can now have nothing farther to say , "
131919	131938	131915	131915	she	2816	" You have insulted me in every possible method . I must beg to return to the house . "
131962	132002	130731	130732	Lady Bourgh	126	" You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! Unfeeling , selfish girl ! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? "
132003	132019	131943	131943	she	2816	" Lady Bourgh , I have nothing farther to say . You know my sentiments . "
132020	132029	130731	130732	Lady Bourgh	126	" You are then resolved to have him ? "
132030	132075	131943	131943	she	2816	" I have said no such thing . I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to YOU , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . "
132076	132127	130731	130732	Lady Bourgh	126	" It is well . You refuse , then , to oblige me . You refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . "
132128	132138	132140	132140	Elizabeth	82	" Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , "
132142	132222	132140	132140	Elizabeth	82	" have any possible claim on me , in the present instance . No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy . And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former WERE excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment 's concern — and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . "
132223	132288	132313	132313	she	126	" And this is your real opinion ! This is your final resolve ! Very well . I shall now know how to act . Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified . I came to try you . I hoped to find you reasonable ; but , depend upon it , I will carry my point . "
132316	132347	132313	132313	she	126	" I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . I send no compliments to your mother . You deserve no such attention . I am most seriously displeased . "
132412	132419	132421	132422	her daughter	458	" She did not choose it , "
132424	132429	132421	132422	her daughter	458	" she would go . "
132430	132504	132421	132422	her daughter	458	" She is a very fine - looking woman ! and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well . She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so , passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? "
133006	133028	133029	133029	she	82	" If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days , "
133032	133084	133029	133029	she	82	" I shall know how to understand it . I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy . If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . "
133173	133176	133178	133178	he	238	" Lizzy , "
133180	133194	133178	133178	he	238	" I was going to look for you ; come into my room . "
133270	133324	133266	133266	He	238	" I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . I did not know before , that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony . Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest . "
133384	133425	133380	133381	her father	238	" You look conscious . Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even YOUR sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer . This letter is from Mr. Collins . "
133426	133439	133380	133381	her father	238	" From Mr. Collins ! and what can HE have to say ? "
133440	133510	133380	133381	her father	238	" Something very much to the purpose of course . He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which , it seems , he has been told by some of the good - natured , gossiping Lucases . I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point . What relates to yourself , is as follows . "
133511	133602	133380	133381	her father	238	" Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another ; of which we have been advertised by the same authority . Your daughter Elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of Bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land . "
133603	133617	133380	133381	her father	238	" Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? "
133618	133698	133380	133381	her father	238	" This young gentleman is blessed , in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage . Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman 's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . "
133699	133718	133380	133381	her father	238	" Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? But now it comes out . "
133719	133752	133380	133381	her father	238	" My motive for cautioning you is as follows . We have reason to imagine that his aunt , Lady Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . "
133753	133839	133380	133381	her father	238	" MR . DARCY , you see , is the man ! Now , Lizzy , I think I HAVE surprised you . Could he , or the Lucases , have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ? Mr. Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! It is admirable ! "
133874	133880	133380	133381	her father	238	" Are you not diverted ? "
133881	133890	133380	133381	her father	238	" Oh ! yes . Pray read on . "
133891	134001	133380	133381	her father	238	" After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it become apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match . I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . "
134002	134008	133380	133381	her father	238	" Mr. Collins moreover adds , "
134009	134138	133380	133381	her father	238	" I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known . I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it . You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . "
134139	134229	133380	133381	her father	238	" That is his notion of christian forgiveness ! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte 's situation , and his expectation of a young olive - branch . But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . You are not going to be Missish , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? "
134230	134233	134235	134235	Elizabeth	82	" Oh ! "
134237	134249	134235	134235	Elizabeth	82	" I am excessively diverted . But it is so strange ! "
134250	134367	133380	133381	her father	238	" Yes — THAT is what makes it amusing . Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but HIS perfect indifference , and YOUR pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr. Collins 's correspondence for any consideration . Nay , when I read a letter of his , I can not help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son - in - law . And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Bourgh about this report ? Did she call to refuse her consent ? "
134727	134821	134723	134723	she	86	" Mr. Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your 's . I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister . Ever since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . "
134822	134830	134832	134832	Darcy	89	" I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , "
134842	134876	134832	134832	Darcy	89	" that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted . "
134877	134958	134723	134723	she	86	" You must not blame my aunt . Lydia 's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . "
134959	134966	134967	134967	he	89	" If you WILL thank me , "
134970	135026	134967	134967	he	89	" let it be for yourself alone . That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . But your FAMILY owe me nothing . Much as I respect them , I believe I thought only of YOU . "
135046	135094	135042	135043	her companion	1675	" You are too generous to trifle with me . If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once . MY affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . "
135411	135418	135420	135420	he	1675	" It taught me to hope , "
135422	135468	135420	135420	he	1675	" as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Bourgh , frankly and openly . "
135477	135515	135469	135469	Elizabeth	82	" Yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of THAT . After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . "
135516	135571	135420	135420	he	1675	" What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ? For , though your accusations were ill - founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof . It was unpardonable . I can not think of it without abhorrence . "
135572	135588	135590	135590	Elizabeth	82	" We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , "
135592	135621	135590	135590	Elizabeth	82	" The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility . "
135622	135730	135420	135420	he	1675	" I can not be so easily reconciled to myself . The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me . Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : ' had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner . ' Those were your words . You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me;—though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . "
135731	135763	135590	135590	Elizabeth	82	" I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . "
135764	135819	135420	135420	he	1675	" I can easily believe it . You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , I am sure you did . The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me . "
135820	135853	135590	135590	Elizabeth	82	" Oh ! do not repeat what I then said . These recollections will not do at all . I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . "
135859	135863	135865	135865	he	89	" Did it , "
135867	135892	135865	135865	he	89	" did it soon make you think better of me ? Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? "
135914	135918	135920	135920	he	89	" I knew , "
135922	135981	135920	135920	he	89	" that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . I hope you have destroyed the letter . There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again . I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . "
135982	136032	135893	135893	She	2868	" The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . "
136033	136040	136042	136042	Darcy	89	" When I wrote that letter , "
136044	136069	136042	136042	Darcy	89	" I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . "
136070	136158	135893	135893	She	2868	" The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . The adieu is charity itself . But think no more of the letter . The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten . You must learn some of my philosophy . Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . "
136159	136459	136042	136042	Darcy	89	" I can not give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy , but , what is much better , of innocence . But with me , it is not so . Painful recollections will intrude which can not , which ought not , to be repelled . I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . As a child I was taught what was right , but I was not taught to correct my temper . I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . Unfortunately an only son ( for many years an only child ) , I was spoilt by my parents , who , though good themselves ( my father , particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable ) , allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing ; to care for none beyond my own family circle ; to think meanly of all the rest of the world ; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth ! What do I not owe you ! You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . By you , I was properly humbled . I came to you without a doubt of my reception . You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . "
136460	136470	136729	136729	He	89	" Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? "
136471	136495	136042	136042	Darcy	89	" Indeed I had . What will you think of my vanity ? I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . "
136496	136539	136729	136729	He	89	" My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally , I assure you . I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . How you must have hated me after THAT evening ? "
136540	136562	136042	136042	Darcy	89	" Hate you ! I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . "
136563	136588	136729	136729	He	89	" I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me , when we met at Pemberley . You blamed me for coming ? "
136589	136599	136042	136042	Darcy	89	" No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . "
136600	136641	136729	136729	He	89	" Your surprise could not be greater than MINE in being noticed by you . My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive MORE than my due . "
136642	136647	136649	136649	Darcy	89	" My object then , "
136651	136728	136649	136649	Darcy	89	" was to show you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . "
136866	136876	136888	136888	Darcy	89	" What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane ! "
136906	136915	136917	136917	Elizabeth	82	" I must ask whether you were surprised ? "
136919	136937	136917	136917	Elizabeth	82	" Not at all . When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . "
136938	136955	136958	136958	he	89	" That is to say , you had given your permission . I guessed as much . "
136975	136985	136987	136987	he	89	" On the evening before my going to London , "
136989	137091	136987	136987	he	89	" I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent . His surprise was great . He had never had the slightest suspicion . I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . "
137106	137115	137117	137117	she	82	" Did you speak from your own observation , "
137119	137138	137117	137117	she	82	" when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? "
137139	137168	137098	137098	his	2875	" From the former . I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here ; and I was convinced of her affection . "
137169	137185	137117	137117	she	82	" And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . "
137186	137308	137098	137098	his	2875	" It did . Bingley is most unaffectedly modest . His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine made every thing easy . I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him . He was angry . But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister 's sentiments . He has heartily forgiven me now . "
137395	137408	137378	137378	he	79	" My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? "
137626	137658	137620	137620	she	82	" You are joking , Lizzy . This can not be!—engaged to Mr. Darcy ! No , no , you shall not deceive me . I know it to be impossible . "
137659	137715	137620	137620	she	82	" This is a wretched beginning indeed ! My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . I speak nothing but the truth . He still loves me , and we are engaged . "
137722	137740	137716	137716	Jane	154	" Oh , Lizzy ! it can not be . I know how much you dislike him . "
137741	137795	137620	137620	she	82	" You know nothing of the matter . THAT is all to be forgot . Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now . But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable . This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . "
137815	137832	137834	137834	Jane	154	" Good Heaven ! can it be really so ! Yet now I must believe you , "
137836	137872	137834	137834	Jane	154	" My dear , dear Lizzy , I would — I do congratulate you — but are you certain ? forgive the question — are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? "
137873	137917	137803	137803	Elizabeth	82	" There can be no doubt of that . It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . But are you pleased , Jane ? Shall you like to have such a brother ? "
137918	137982	137834	137834	Jane	154	" Very , very much . Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . And do you really love him quite well enough ? Oh , Lizzy ! do any thing rather than marry without affection . Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? "
137983	138007	137803	137803	Elizabeth	82	" Oh , yes ! You will only think I feel MORE than I ought to do , when I tell you all . "
138008	138014	137834	137834	Jane	154	" What do you mean ? "
138015	138039	137803	137803	Elizabeth	82	" Why , I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley . I am afraid you will be angry . "
138040	138081	137834	137834	Jane	154	" My dearest sister , now BE serious . I want to talk very seriously . Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay . Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? "
138082	138116	137803	137803	Elizabeth	82	" It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began . But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . "
138158	138165	138167	138167	she	2887	" Now I am quite happy , "
138169	138270	138167	138167	she	2887	" for you will be as happy as myself . I always had a value for him . Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley 's friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! I owe all that I know of it to another , not to you . "
138340	138344	138346	138347	Mrs. Bennet	85	" Good gracious ! "
138359	138442	138350	138350	she	85	" if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? I had no notion but he would go a - shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company . What shall we do with him ? Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley 's way . "
138506	138528	138500	138500	he	79	" Mrs. Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? "
138529	138541	138543	138544	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I advise Mr. Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , "
138546	138571	138543	138544	Mrs. Bennet	85	" to walk to Oakham Mount this morning . It is a nice long walk , and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view . "
138572	138582	138584	138585	Mr. Bingley	79	" It may do very well for the others , "
138587	138606	138584	138585	Mr. Bingley	79	" but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . Wo n't it , Kitty ? "
138651	138718	138644	138645	Mrs. Bennet	85	" I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . But I hope you will not mind it : it is all for Jane 's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . So , do not put yourself to inconvenience . "
138993	139006	139007	139007	She	82	" Go to your father , he wants you in the library . "
139025	139028	139030	139030	he	238	" Lizzy , "
139032	139058	139030	139030	he	238	" what are you doing ? Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? Have not you always hated him ? "
139118	139160	139103	139103	she	82	" Or , in other words , you are determined to have him . He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane . But will they make you happy ? "
139161	139168	139170	139170	Elizabeth	82	" Have you any other objection , "
139172	139180	139170	139170	Elizabeth	82	" than your belief of my indifference ? "
139181	139211	139103	139103	she	82	" None at all . We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . "
139212	139221	139222	139222	she	82	" I do , I do like him , "
139231	139271	139228	139228	her	82	" I love him . Indeed he has no improper pride . He is perfectly amiable . You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . "
139272	139275	139277	139278	her father	238	" Lizzy , "
139280	139425	139277	139278	her father	238	" I have given him my consent . He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask . I now give it to YOU , if you are resolved on having him . But let me advise you to think better of it . I know your disposition , Lizzy . I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior . Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . You could scarcely escape discredit and misery . My child , let me not have the grief of seeing YOU unable to respect your partner in life . You know not what you are about . "
139520	139526	139528	139528	he	89	" Well , my dear , "
139535	139569	139528	139528	he	89	" I have no more to say . If this be the case , he deserves you . I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to anyone less worthy . "
139595	139709	139591	139591	her	82	" This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! And so , Darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow 's debts , and got him his commission ! So much the better . It will save me a world of trouble and economy . Had it been your uncle 's doing , I must and WOULD have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way . I shall offer to pay him to - morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . "
139751	139773	139746	139746	she	82	" If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . "
139970	140118	139943	139943	She	85	" Good gracious ! Lord bless me ! only think ! dear me ! Mr. Darcy ! Who would have thought it ! And is it really true ? Oh ! my sweetest Lizzy ! how rich and how great you will be ! What pin - money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! Jane 's is nothing to it — nothing at all . I am so pleased — so happy . Such a charming man!—so handsome ! so tall!—Oh , my dear Lizzy ! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before . I hope he will overlook it . Dear , dear Lizzy . A house in town ! Every thing that is charming ! Three daughters married ! Ten thousand a year ! Oh , Lord ! What will become of me . I shall go distracted . "
140167	140172	140173	140173	she	235	" My dearest child , "
140176	140243	140173	140173	she	235	" I can think of nothing else ! Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! ' Tis as good as a Lord ! And a special licence . You must and shall be married by a special licence . But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to - morrow . "
140382	140395	140397	140397	he	75	" I admire all my three sons - in - law highly , "
140399	140423	140397	140397	he	75	" Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like YOUR husband quite as well as Jane 's . "
140450	140456	140458	140458	she	82	" How could you begin ? "
140460	140488	140458	140458	she	82	" I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? "
140489	140534	140434	140434	she	82	" I can not fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . It is too long ago . I was in the middle before I knew that I HAD begun . "
140535	140590	140458	140458	she	82	" My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners — my behaviour to YOU was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . Now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? "
140591	140602	140434	140434	she	82	" For the liveliness of your mind , I did . "
140603	140775	140458	140458	she	82	" You may as well call it impertinence at once . It was very little less . The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking , and looking , and thinking for YOUR approbation alone . I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike THEM . Had you not been really amiable , you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you . There — I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . To be sure , you knew no actual good of me — but nobody thinks of THAT when they fall in love . "
140776	140794	140434	140434	she	82	" Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield ? "
140795	140919	140458	140458	she	82	" Dearest Jane ! who could have done less for her ? But make a virtue of it by all means . My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last . What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? "
140920	140934	140434	140434	she	82	" Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . "
140935	140941	140458	140458	she	82	" But I was embarrassed . "
140942	140947	140434	140434	she	82	" And so was I. "
140948	140962	140458	140458	she	82	" You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . "
140963	140973	140434	140434	she	82	" A man who had felt less , might . "
140974	141087	140458	140458	she	82	" How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! But I wonder how long you WOULD have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . I wonder when you WOULD have spoken , if I had not asked you ! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . TOO MUCH , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise ? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject . This will never do . "
141088	141171	140434	140434	she	82	" You need not distress yourself . The moral will be perfectly fair . Lady Bourgh 's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts . I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your 's . My aunt 's intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing . "
141172	141229	140458	140458	she	82	" Lady Bourgh has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequence ? "
141230	141298	140434	140434	she	82	" My real purpose was to see YOU , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me . My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . "
141299	141316	140458	140458	she	82	" Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Bourgh what is to befall her ? "
141317	141354	140434	140434	she	82	" I am more likely to want more time than courage , Elizabeth . But it ought to done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . "
141355	141402	140458	140458	she	82	" And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . "
141472	141699	141447	141447	she	82	" I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , I was too cross to write . You supposed more than really existed . But NOW suppose as much as you choose ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you can not greatly err . You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes . How could I be so silly as to wish it ! Your idea of the ponies is delightful . We will go round the Park every day . I am the happiest creature in the world . Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice . I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me . You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas . Yours , etc . "
141733	141736	141700	141701	Mr. Darcy	89	" DEAR SIR ,
141737	141785	141814	141814	She	91	" I must trouble you once more for congratulations . Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy . Console Lady Bourgh as well as you can . But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew . He has more to give .
141786	141792	141793	141794	Miss Bingley	91	" Yours sincerely , etc . "
142863	142867	142829	142829	Lydia	84	" MY DEAR LIZZY ,
142868	142985	142829	142829	Lydia	84	" I wish you joy . If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but however , do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it , if you had rather not .
142986	142991	142829	142829	Lydia	84	" Yours , etc . "
