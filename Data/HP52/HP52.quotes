1357	1361	1363	1363	Hagrid	116	“ They do , ”

1598	1619	1641	1641	Hagrid	116	“ — and I had to go to a hearing and everything , but tell us about the giants first . ”
1620	1625	1641	1641	Hagrid	116	“ You were expelled ? ”
1626	1640	1641	1641	Hagrid	116	“ Tell us about your summer and I ’ll tell you about mine . ”

1748	1757	1758	1758	Hermione	114	“ Madame Maxime went with you , then ? ”
1761	1768	1770	1770	Hagrid	116	“ Yeah , tha ’s right , ”
1793	1876	1770	1770	Hagrid	116	“ Yeah , it was jus ’ the pair of us . An ’ I ’ll tell yeh this , she ’s not afraid of roughin ’ it , Olympe . Yeh know , she ’s a fine , well - dressed woman , an ’ knowin ’ where we was goin’ I wondered ’ ow she ’d feel abou ’ clamberin ’ over boulders an ’ sleepin ’ in caves an ’ tha ’ , bu ’ she never complained once . ”
1877	1885	1886	1886	Harry	112	“ You knew where you were going ? ”
1889	1897	1886	1886	Harry	112	“ You knew where the giants were ? ”
1898	1910	1912	1912	Hagrid	116	“ Well , Dumbledore knew , an ’ he told us , ”
1914	1919	1921	1921	Ron	113	“ Are they hidden ? ”
1923	1933	1921	1921	Ron	113	“ Is it a secret , where they are ? ”
1934	1938	1940	1940	Hagrid	116	“ Not really , ”
1947	2007	1943	1943	his	116	“ It ’s jus ’ that mos ’ wizards aren ’ bothered where they are , s ’ long as it ’s a good long way away . But where they are ’s very difficult ter get ter , fer humans anyway , so we needed Dumbledore ’s instructions . Took us abou ’ a month ter get there — ”
2008	2012	2014	2014	Ron	113	“ A month ? ”
2032	2046	2014	2014	Ron	113	“ But — why could n’t you just grab a Portkey or something ? ”
2068	2077	2078	2078	he	116	“ We ’re bein ’ watched , Ron , ”
2082	2087	2058	2058	he	116	“ What d’you mean ? ”
2088	2094	2096	2096	Hagrid	116	“ Yeh don ’ understand , ”
2098	2122	2096	2096	Hagrid	116	“ The Ministry ’s keepin ’ an eye on Dumbledore an ’ anyone they reckon ’s in league with him , an ’ — ”
2123	2129	2131	2131	Harry	112	“ We know about that , ”
2144	2153	2131	2131	Harry	112	“ We know about the Ministry watching Dumbledore — ”
2154	2165	2167	2167	Ron	113	“ So you could n’t use magic to get there ? ”
2172	2183	2167	2167	Ron	113	“ You had to act like Muggles all the way ? ”
2184	2193	2195	2195	Hagrid	116	“ Well , not exactly all the way , ”
2198	2219	2195	2195	Hagrid	116	“ We jus ’ had ter be careful , ’cause Olympe an ’ me , we stick out a bit — ”
2240	2347	2167	2167	Ron	113	“ — so we ’re not hard ter follow . We was pretendin ’ we was goin’ on holiday together , so we got inter France an ’ we made like we was headin ’ fer where Olympe ’s school is , ’cause we knew we was bein ’ tailed by someone from the Ministry . We had to go slow , ’cause I ’m not really s’posed ter use magic an ’ we knew the Ministry’d be lookin ’ fer a reason ter run us in . But we managed ter give the berk tailin ’ us the slip round abou ’ Dee - John — ”
2348	2353	2355	2355	Hermione	114	“ Ooooh , Dijon ? ”
2358	2371	2355	2355	Hermione	114	“ I ’ve been there on holiday , did you see — ? ”
2383	2564	2167	2167	Ron	113	“ We chanced a bit o ’ magic after that , and it wasn ’ a bad journey . Ran inter a couple o ’ mad trolls on the Polish border , an ’ I had a sligh ’ disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk , but apart from tha ’ , couldn’t’a bin smoother . An ’ then we reached the place , an ’ we started trekkin ’ up through the mountains , lookin ’ fer signs of ’em ... We had ter lay off the magic once we got near ’em . Partly ’cause they don ’ like wizards an ’ we didn ’ want ter put their backs up too soon , and partly ’cause Dumbledore had warned us You - Know - Who was bound ter be after the giants an ’ all . Said it was odds on he ’d sent a messenger off ter them already . Told us ter be very careful of drawin ’ attention ter ourselves as we got nearer in case there was Death Eaters around . ”
2574	2578	2580	2580	Harry	112	“ Go on ! ”
2583	2587	2589	2589	Hagrid	116	“ Found ’em , ”
2592	2635	2589	2589	Hagrid	116	“ Went over a ridge one nigh ’ an ’ there they was , spread ou ’ underneath us . Little fires burnin ’ below an ’ huge shadows ... It was like watchin ’ bits o ’ the mountain movin ’ . ”
2636	2642	2644	2644	Ron	113	“ How big are they ? ”
2650	2656	2658	2658	Hagrid	116	“ ’ Bout twenty feet , ”
2661	2674	2658	2658	Hagrid	116	“ Some o ’ the bigger ones mighta bin twenty - five . ”
2675	2682	2684	2684	Harry	112	“ And how many were there ? ”
2686	2695	2697	2697	Hagrid	116	“ I reckon abou ’ seventy or eighty , ”
2699	2704	2706	2706	Hermione	114	“ Is that all ? ”
2708	2711	2713	2713	Hagrid	116	“ Yep , ”
2716	2832	2713	2713	Hagrid	116	“ eighty left , an ’ there was loads once , musta bin a hundred diff’rent tribes from all over the world . But they ’ve bin dyin ’ out fer ages . Wizards killed a few , o ’ course , but mostly they killed each other , an ’ now they ’re dyin ’ out faster than ever . They ’re not made ter live bunched up together like tha ’ . Dumbledore says it ’s our fault , it was the wizards who forced ’em to go an ’ made ’em live a good long way from us an ’ they had no choice but ter stick together fer their own protection . ”
2833	2836	2838	2838	Harry	112	“ So , ”
2840	2848	2838	2838	Harry	112	“ you saw them and then what ? ”
2849	2876	2878	2878	Hagrid	116	“ Well , we waited till morning , didn ’ want ter go sneakin ’ up on ’em in the dark , fer our own safety , ”
2880	2959	2878	2878	Hagrid	116	“ ’ Bout three in the mornin ’ they fell asleep jus ’ where they was sittin ’ . We didn ’ dare sleep . Fer one thing , we wanted ter make sure none of ’em woke up an ’ came up where we were , an ’ fer another , the snorin ’ was unbelievable . Caused an avalanche near mornin ’ . Anyway , once it was light we wen ’ down ter see ’em . ”
2960	2965	2967	2967	Ron	113	“ Just like that ? ”
2972	2982	2967	2967	Ron	113	“ You just walked right into a giant camp ? ”
2983	2994	2996	2996	Hagrid	116	“ Well , Dumbledore’d told us how ter do it , ”
2998	3011	2996	2996	Hagrid	116	“ Give the Gurg gifts , show some respect , yeh know . ”
3012	3018	3020	3020	Harry	112	“ Give the what gifts ? ”
3022	3032	2996	2996	Hagrid	116	“ Oh , the Gurg — means the chief . ”
3033	3044	3046	3046	Ron	113	“ How could you tell which one was the Gurg ? ”
3053	3057	3058	3058	he	116	“ No problem , ”
3061	3134	3058	3058	he	116	“ He was the biggest , the ugliest , an ’ the laziest . Sittin ’ there waitin ’ ter be brought food by the others . Dead goats an ’ such like . Name o ’ Karkus . I ’d put him at twenty - two , twenty - three feet , an ’ the weight of a couple o ’ bull elephants . Skin like rhino hide an ’ all . ”
3135	3144	3146	3146	Hermione	114	“ And you just walked up to him ? ”
3149	3214	3058	3058	he	116	“ Well ... down ter him , where he was lyin ’ in the valley . They was in this dip between four pretty high mountains , see , beside a mountain lake , an ’ Karkus was lyin ’ by the lake roarin ’ at the others ter feed him an ’ his wife . Olympe an ’ I went down the mountainside — ”
3215	3229	3231	3231	Ron	113	“ But did n’t they try and kill you when they saw you ? ”
3234	3244	3246	3246	Hagrid	116	“ It was def’nitely on some of their minds , ”
3250	3329	3246	3246	Hagrid	116	“ but we did what Dumbledore told us ter do , which was ter hold our gift up high an ’ keep our eyes on the Gurg an ’ ignore the others . So tha ’s what we did . An ’ the rest of ’em went quiet an ’ watched us pass an ’ we got right up ter Karkus ’s feet an ’ we bowed an ’ put our present down in front o ’ him . ”
3330	3338	3340	3340	Ron	113	“ What do you give a giant ? ”
3343	3346	3340	3340	Ron	113	“ Food ? ”
3347	3360	3362	3362	Hagrid	116	“ Nah , he can get food all righ ’ fer himself , ”
3364	3402	3362	3362	Hagrid	116	“ We took him magic . Giants like magic , jus ’ do n’t like us usin ’ it against ’em . Anyway , that firs ’ day we gave him a branch o ’ Gubraithian fire . ”
3405	3407	3403	3403	Hermione	114	“ wow ”
3419	3425	3403	3403	Hermione	114	“ A branch of — ? ”
3426	3430	3432	3432	Hermione	114	“ Everlasting fire , ”
3435	3455	3432	3432	Hermione	114	“ you ought to know that by now , Professor Flitwick ’s mentioned it at least twice in class ! ”
3456	3460	3462	3462	Hagrid	116	“ Well anyway , ”
3472	3527	3462	3462	Hagrid	116	“ Dumbledore’d bewitched this branch to burn evermore , which isn ’ somethin’ any wizard could do , an ’ so I lies it down in the snow by Karkus ’s feet and says , ‘ A gift to the Gurg of the giants from Albus Dumbledore , who sends his respectful greetings . ’ ”
3528	3535	3537	3537	Harry	112	“ And what did Karkus say ? ”
3540	3543	3545	3545	Hagrid	116	“ Nothin’ , ”
3547	3553	3545	3545	Hagrid	116	“ Didn ’ speak English . ”
3554	3559	3462	3462	Hagrid	116	“ You ’re kidding ! ”
3560	3565	3567	3567	Hagrid	116	“ Didn ’ matter , ”
3570	3603	3567	3567	Hagrid	116	“ Dumbledore had warned us tha ’ migh ’ happen . Karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o ’ giants who knew our lingo an ’ they translated fer us . ”
3604	3612	3614	3614	Ron	113	“ And did he like the present ? ”
3616	3632	3634	3634	Hagrid	116	“ Oh yeah , it went down a storm once they understood what it was , ”
3651	3680	3634	3634	Hagrid	116	“ Very pleased . So then I said , ‘ Albus Dumbledore asks the Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift . ’ ”
3681	3692	3694	3694	Hermione	114	“ Why could n’t you speak to them that day ? ”
3696	3706	3708	3708	Hagrid	116	“ Dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow , ”
3710	3853	3708	3708	Hagrid	116	“ Let ’em see we kept our promises . We ’ll come back tomorrow with another present , an ’ then we do come back with another present — gives a good impression , see ? An ’ gives them time ter test out the firs ’ present an ’ find out it ’s a good one , an ’ get ’em eager fer more . In any case , giants like Karkus — overload ’em with information an ’ they ’ll kill yeh jus ’ to simplify things . So we bowed outta the way an ’ went off an ’ found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in , an ’ the followin ’ mornin ’ we went back an ’ this time we found Karkus sittin ’ up waitin ’ fer us lookin ’ all eager . ”
3854	3861	3694	3694	Hermione	114	“ And you talked to him ? ”
3862	3898	3708	3708	Hagrid	116	“ Oh yeah . Firs ’ we presented him with a nice battle helmet — goblin - made an ’ indestructible , yeh know — an ’ then we sat down an ’ we talked . ”
3899	3905	3694	3694	Hermione	114	“ What did he say ? ”
3906	3910	3912	3912	Hagrid	116	“ Not much , ”
3914	4013	3912	3912	Hagrid	116	“ Listened mostly . But there were good signs . He ’d heard o ’ Dumbledore , heard he ’d argued against the killin ’ of the last giants in Britain . Karkus seemed ter be quite int’rested in what Dumbledore had ter say . An ’ a few o ’ the others , ’ specially the ones who had some English , they gathered round an ’ listened too . We were hopeful when we left that day . Promised ter come back next day with another present . But that night it all wen ’ wrong . ”
4014	4019	4021	4021	Ron	113	“ What d’you mean ? ”
4024	4041	4043	4043	Hagrid	116	“ Well , like I say , they ’re not meant ter live together , giants , ”
4046	4136	4043	4043	Hagrid	116	“ Not in big groups like that . They can ’ help themselves , they half kill each other every few weeks . The men fight each other an ’ the women fight each other , the remnants of the old tribes fight each other , an ’ that ’s even without squabbles over food an ’ the best fires an ’ sleepin ’ spots . Yeh’d think , seein ’ as how their whole race is abou ’ finished , they ’d lay off each other , but ... ”
4141	4204	4043	4043	Hagrid	116	“ That night a fight broke out , we saw it from the mouth of our cave , lookin ’ down on the valley . Went on fer hours , yeh wouldn ’ believe the noise . An ’ when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an ’ his head was lyin ’ at the bottom o ’ the lake . ”
4205	4209	4211	4211	Hermione	114	“ Whose head ? ”
4213	4217	4219	4219	Hagrid	116	“ Karkus ’s , ”
4222	4231	4232	4232	He	116	“ There was a new Gurg , Golgomath . ”
4236	4286	4232	4232	He	116	“ Well , we hadn ’ bargained on a new Gurg two days after we ’d made friendly contact with the firs ’ one , an ’ we had a funny feelin ’ Golgomath wouldn ’ be so keen ter listen to us , but we had ter try . ”
4287	4295	4297	4297	Ron	113	“ You went to speak to him ? ”
4300	4313	4297	4297	Ron	113	“ After you ’d watched him rip off another giant ’s head ? ”
4314	4320	4322	4322	Hagrid	116	“ ’ Course we did , ”
4324	4483	4322	4322	Hagrid	116	“ we hadn ’ gone all that way ter give up after two days ! We wen ’ down with the next present we ’d meant ter give ter Karkus . I knew it was no go before I ’d opened me mouth . He was sitting there wearin ’ Karkus ’s helmet , leerin ’ at us as we got nearer . He ’s massive , one o ’ the biggest ones there . Black hair an ’ matchin ’ teeth an ’ a necklace o ’ bones . Human - lookin ’ bones , some of ’em . Well , I gave it a go — held out a great roll o ’ dragon skin — an ’ said ‘ A gift fer the Gurg of the giants — ’ Nex ’ thing I knew , I was hangin ’ upside down in the air by me feet , two of his mates had grabbed me . ”
4492	4501	4503	4503	Harry	112	“ How did you get out of that ? ”
4505	4515	4517	4517	Hagrid	116	“ Wouldn’ta done if Olympe hadn ’ bin there , ”
4519	4615	4517	4517	Hagrid	116	“ She pulled out her wand an ’ did some o ’ the fastes ’ spellwork I ’ve ever seen . Ruddy marvelous . Hit the two holdin ’ me right in the eyes with Conjunctivitus Curses an ’ they dropped me straightaway — bu ’ we were in trouble then , ’cause we ’d used magic against ’em , an ’ that ’s what giants hate abou ’ wizards . We had ter leg it an ’ we knew there was no way we was going ter be able ter march inter camp again . ”
4616	4621	4623	4623	Ron	113	“ Blimey , Hagrid , ”
4626	4648	4650	4650	Hermione	114	“ So how come it ’s taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days ? ”
4652	4661	4663	4663	Hagrid	116	“ We didn ’ leave after three days ! ”
4668	4676	4663	4663	Hagrid	116	“ Dumbledore was relyin ’ on us ! ”
4677	4692	4517	4517	Hagrid	116	“ But you ’ve just said there was no way you could go back ! ”
4693	4740	4663	4663	Hagrid	116	“ Not by daylight , we couldn ’ , no . We just had ter rethink a bit . Spent a couple o ’ days lyin ’ low up in the cave an ’ watchin ’ . An ’ wha ’ we saw wasn ’ good . ”
4741	4749	4751	4751	Hermione	114	“ Did he rip off more heads ? ”
4756	4759	4761	4761	Hagrid	116	“ No , ”
4763	4769	4761	4761	Hagrid	116	“ I wish he had . ”
4770	4775	4663	4663	Hagrid	116	“ What d’you mean ? ”
4776	4794	4761	4761	Hagrid	116	“ I mean we soon found out he didn ’ object ter all wizards — just us . ”
4795	4799	4801	4801	Harry	112	“ Death Eaters ? ”
4804	4807	4809	4809	Hagrid	116	“ Yep , ”
4812	4840	4809	4809	Hagrid	116	“ Couple of ’em were visitin ’ him ev’ry day , bringin ’ gifts ter the Gurg , an ’ he wasn ’ dangling them upside down . ”
4841	4850	4852	4852	Ron	113	“ How d’you know they were Death Eaters ? ”
4854	4862	4863	4863	Hagrid	116	“ Because I recognized one of ’em , ”
4866	4902	4863	4863	Hagrid	116	“ Macnair , remember him ? Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak ? Maniac , he is . Likes killin ’ as much as Golgomath , no wonder they were gettin ’ on so well . ”
4903	4918	4920	4920	Hermione	114	“ So Macnair ’s persuaded the giants to join You - Know - Who ? ”
4923	4936	4938	4938	Hagrid	116	“ Hold yer hippogriffs , I haven ’ finished me story yet ! ”
4965	5023	4963	4963	himself	116	“ Me an ’ Olympe talked it over an ’ we agreed , jus ’ ’cause the Gurg looked like favorin ’ You - Know - Who didn ’ mean all of ’em would . We had ter try an ’ persuade some o ’ the others , the ones who hadn ’ wanted Golgomath as Gurg . ”
5024	5034	5036	5036	Ron	113	“ How could you tell which ones they were ? ”
5038	5056	5058	5058	Hagrid	116	“ Well , they were the ones bein ’ beaten to a pulp , weren ’ they ? ”
5061	5117	5058	5058	Hagrid	116	“ The ones with any sense were keepin ’ outta Golgomath ’s way , hidin ’ out in caves roun ’ the gully jus ’ like we were . So we decided we ’d go pokin ’ round the caves by night an ’ see if we couldn ’ persuade a few o ’ them . ”
5118	5129	5131	5131	Ron	113	“ You went poking around dark caves looking for giants ? ”
5139	5152	5154	5154	Hagrid	116	“ Well , it wasn ’ the giants who worried us most , ”
5156	5256	5258	5258	Hagrid	116	“ We were more concerned abou ’ the Death Eaters . Dumbledore had told us before we wen ’ not ter tangle with ’em if we could avoid it , an ’ the trouble was they knew we was around — ’ spect Golgomath told him abou ’ us . At night when the giants were sleepin ’ an ’ we wanted ter be creepin ’ inter the caves , Macnair an ’ the other one were sneakin ’ round the mountains lookin ’ fer us . I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin ’ out at them , ”
5270	5303	5263	5263	his	116	“ She was rarin ’ ter attack ’em ... She ’s somethin’ when she ’s roused , Olympe ... Fiery , yeh know ... ’ spect it ’s the French in her ... ”
5326	5342	5263	5263	his	116	“ So what happened ? Did you ever get near any of the other giants ? ”
5343	5422	5263	5263	his	116	“ What ? Oh ... oh yeah , we did . Yeah , on the third night after Karkus was killed , we crept outta the cave we ’d bin hidin ’ in and headed back down inter the gully , keepin ’ our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters . Got inside a few o ’ the caves , no go — then , in abou ’ the sixth one , we found three giants hidin ’ . ”
5423	5430	5432	5432	Ron	113	“ Cave must ’ve been cramped , ”
5434	5443	5445	5445	Hagrid	116	“ Wasn ’ room ter swing a kneazle , ”
5447	5458	5460	5460	Hermione	114	“ Did n’t they attack you when they saw you ? ”
5462	5474	5476	5476	Hagrid	116	“ Probably woulda done if they ’d bin in any condition , ”
5478	5580	5476	5476	Hagrid	116	“ but they was badly hurt , all three o ’ them . Golgomath ’s lot had beaten ’em unconscious ; they ’d woken up an ’ crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find . Anyway , one o ’ them had a bit of English an ’ ’ e translated fer the others , an ’ what we had ter say didn ’ seem ter go down too badly . So we kep ’ goin’ back , visitin ’ the wounded ... I reckon we had abou ’ six or seven o ’ them convinced at one poin ’ . ”
5581	5586	5588	5588	Ron	113	“ Six or seven ? ”
5591	5616	5588	5588	Ron	113	“ Well that ’s not bad — are they going to come over here and start fighting You - Know - Who with us ? ”
5621	5634	5618	5618	Hermione	114	“ What do you mean ‘ at one point , ’ Hagrid ? ”
5641	5668	5635	5635	Hagrid	116	“ Golgomath ’s lot raided the caves . The ones tha ’ survived didn ’ wan ’ no more ter to do with us after that . ”
5669	5680	5682	5682	Ron	113	“ So ... so there are n’t any giants coming ? ”
5687	5690	5692	5692	Hagrid	116	“ Nope , ”
5714	5793	5699	5699	he	116	“ but we did wha ’ we meant ter do , we gave ’em Dumbledore ’s message an ’ some o ’ them heard it an ’ I ’ spect some o ’ them’ll remember it . Jus ’ maybe , them that don ’ want ter stay around Golgomath’ll move outta the mountains , an ’ there ’s got ta be a chance they ’ll remember Dumbledore ’s friendly to ’em ... Could be they ’ll come ... ”
5826	5829	5831	5831	Hermione	114	“ Hagrid ? ”
5837	5840	5867	5867	Hagrid	116	“ Mmm ? ”
5841	5866	5867	5867	Hagrid	116	“ Did you ... was there any sign of ... did you hear anything about your ... your ... mother while you were there ? ”
5881	5891	5867	5867	Hagrid	116	“ I ’m sorry ... I ... forget it — ”
5892	5895	5896	5896	Hagrid	116	“ Dead , ”
5899	5908	5896	5896	Hagrid	116	“ Died years ago . They told me . ”
5909	5920	5922	5922	Hermione	114	“ Oh ... I ’m ... I ’m really sorry , ”
5935	5939	5940	5940	he	116	“ No need , ”
5944	5957	5940	5940	he	116	“ Can ’ remember her much . Wasn ’ a great mother . ”
5977	5993	5994	5994	Ron	113	“ But you still have n’t explained how you got in this state , Hagrid , ”
6004	6013	6015	6015	Harry	112	“ Or why you ’re back so late , ”
6017	6027	6015	6015	Harry	112	“ Sirius says Madame Maxime got back ages ago — ”
6028	6033	6035	6035	Ron	113	“ Who attacked you ? ”
6037	6044	6046	6046	Hagrid	116	“ I haven ’ bin attacked ! ”
6049	6052	6046	6046	Hagrid	116	“ I — ”
6114	6119	6120	6120	Ron	113	“ It ’s her ! ”
6123	6128	6129	6129	Harry	112	“ Get under here ! ”
6180	6187	6175	6175	Hagrid	116	“ Hagrid , hide our mugs ! ”
6270	6273	6274	6274	she	144	“ So , ”
6287	6295	6274	6274	she	144	“ You ’re Hagrid , are you ? ”
6315	6319	6320	6320	she	144	“ Get away , ”
6343	6354	6356	6356	Hagrid	116	“ Er — I don ’ want ter be rude , ”
6362	6371	6356	6356	Hagrid	116	“ but who the ruddy hell are you ? ”
6372	6379	6380	6380	Her	144	“ My name is Dolores Umbridge . ”
6404	6408	6409	6409	Hagrid	116	“ Dolores Umbridge ? ”
6416	6434	6409	6409	Hagrid	116	“ I thought you were one o ’ them Ministry — don ’ you work with Fudge ? ”
6435	6446	6448	6448	Umbridge	144	“ I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister , yes , ”
6475	6487	6448	6448	Umbridge	144	“ I am now the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher — ”
6488	6495	6497	6497	Hagrid	116	“ Tha ’s brave of yeh , ”
6499	6510	6497	6497	Hagrid	116	“ there ’s not many’d take tha ’ job anymore — ”
6511	6518	6520	6520	Umbridge	144	“ — and Hogwarts High Inquisitor , ”
6531	6536	6538	6538	Hagrid	116	“ Wha ’s that ? ”
6542	6551	6553	6553	Umbridge	144	“ Precisely what I was going to ask , ”
6572	6575	6577	6577	Hagrid	116	“ Oh , ”
6597	6621	6593	6593	Hermione	114	“ oh , tha ’ was ... was Fang . He broke a mug . So I had ter use this one instead . ”
6666	6671	6672	6672	she	144	“ I heard voices , ”
6676	6684	6686	6686	Hagrid	116	“ I was talkin ’ ter Fang , ”
6689	6698	6647	6647	Umbridge	144	“ And was he talking back to you ? ”
6699	6710	6712	6712	Hagrid	116	“ Well ... in a manner o ’ speakin ’ , ”
6717	6727	6712	6712	Hagrid	116	“ I sometimes say Fang ’s near enough human — ”
6728	6747	6749	6749	Umbridge	144	“ There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin , ”
6787	6797	6799	6799	Hagrid	116	“ Well , I on’y jus ’ got back , ”
6809	6822	6799	6799	Hagrid	116	“ Maybe someone came ter call earlier an ’ I missed ’em . ”
6823	6835	6883	6883	Umbridge	144	“ There are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door . ”
6836	6849	6851	6851	Hagrid	116	“ Well I ... I don ’ know why that ’d be ... ”
6879	6882	6870	6870	Hermione	114	“ Erm ... ”
6960	6974	6953	6953	she	144	“ What has happened to you ? How did you sustain those injuries ? ”
7026	7038	7039	7039	he	116	“ Oh , I ... had a bit of an accident , ”
7043	7049	7163	7163	Umbridge	144	“ What sort of accident ? ”
7050	7056	7163	7163	Umbridge	144	“ I - I tripped . ”
7057	7061	7062	7062	she	144	“ You tripped , ”
7066	7154	7163	7163	Umbridge	144	“ Yeah , tha ’s right . Over ... over a friend ’s broomstick . I don ’ fly , meself . Well , look at the size o ’ me , I don ’ reckon there ’s a broomstick that ’d hold me . Friend o ’ mine breeds Abraxan horses , I dunno if you ’ve ever seen ’em , big beasts , winged , yeh know , I ’ve had a bit of a ride on one o ’ them an ’ it was — ”
7155	7161	7163	7163	Umbridge	144	“ Where have you been ? ”
7172	7178	7163	7163	Umbridge	144	“ Where ’ve I ... ? ”
7179	7184	7185	7185	she	144	“ Been , yes , ”
7188	7233	7185	7185	she	144	“ Term started more than two months ago . Another teacher has had to cover your classes . None of your colleagues has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts . You left no address . Where have you been ? ”
7259	7270	7271	7271	he	112	“ I — I ’ve been away for me health , ”
7274	7279	7281	7281	Umbridge	144	“ For your health , ”
7305	7309	7283	7283	Her	144	“ I see . ”

7331	7346	7348	7348	Umbridge	144	“ Yes , as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by , ”
7366	7377	7315	7315	Hagrid	116	“ Well — change o ’ scene , yeh know — ”
7378	7382	7384	7384	Umbridge	144	“ Mountain scenery ? ”
7394	7397	7398	7398	Hagrid	116	“ Mountains ? ”
7405	7425	7398	7398	Hagrid	116	“ Nope , South of France fer me . Bit o ’ sun an ’ ... an ’ sea . ”
7426	7429	7431	7431	Umbridge	144	“ Really ? ”
7433	7443	7431	7431	Umbridge	144	“ You do n’t have much of a tan . ”
7444	7452	7454	7454	Hagrid	116	“ Yeah ... well ... sensitive skin , ”
7500	7516	7484	7484	she	144	“ I shall , of course , be informing the Minister of your late return . ”
7517	7521	7523	7523	Hagrid	116	“ Righ ’ , ”
7527	7560	7593	7593	Umbridge	144	“ You ought to know too that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers . So I daresay we shall meet again soon enough . ”
7571	7578	7579	7579	Hagrid	116	“ You ’re inspectin ’ us ? ”
7587	7591	7593	7593	Umbridge	144	“ Oh yes , ”
7608	7624	7601	7601	her	144	“ The Ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers , Hagrid . Good night . ”
7651	7655	7656	7656	she	114	“ Not yet , ”
7662	7670	7656	7656	she	114	“ She might not be gone yet . ”
7695	7704	7705	7705	he	116	“ She ’s goin’ back ter the castle , ”
7712	7722	7705	7705	he	116	“ Blimey ... inspectin ’ people , is she ? ”
7723	7726	7728	7728	Harry	112	“ Yeah , ”
7735	7742	7728	7728	Harry	112	“ Trelawney ’s on probation already ... ”
7743	7762	7764	7764	Hermione	114	“ Um ... what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class , Hagrid ? ”
7766	7788	7790	7790	Hagrid	116	“ Oh , don ’ you worry abou ’ that , I ’ve got a great load o ’ lessons planned , ”
7809	7835	7790	7790	Hagrid	116	“ I ’ve bin keepin ’ a couple o ’ creatures saved fer yer O.W.L. year , you wait , they ’re somethin’ really special . ”
7836	7844	7846	7846	Hermione	114	“ Erm ... special in what way ? ”
7849	7856	7858	7858	Hagrid	116	“ I ’m not sayin ’ , ”
7861	7871	7858	7858	Hagrid	116	“ I don ’ want ter spoil the surprise . ”
7872	7877	7879	7879	Hermione	114	“ Look , Hagrid , ”
7886	7906	7879	7879	Hermione	114	“ Professor Umbridge wo n’t be at all happy if you bring anything to class that ’s too dangerous — ”
7907	7910	7912	7912	Hagrid	116	“ Dangerous ? ”
7918	7946	7912	7912	Hagrid	116	“ Don ’ be silly , I wouldn ’ give yeh anythin ’ dangerous ! I mean , all righ ’ , they can look after themselves — ”
7947	7994	7996	7996	Hermione	114	“ Hagrid , you ’ve got to pass Umbridge ’s inspection , and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after porlocks , how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs , stuff like that ! ”
7999	8010	8012	8012	Hagrid	116	“ But tha ’s not very interestin ’ , Hermione , ”
8014	8047	8012	8012	Hagrid	116	“ The stuff I ’ve got ’s much more impressive , I ’ve bin bringin ’ ’em on fer years , I reckon I ’ve got the on’y domestic herd in Britain — ”
8048	8053	8063	8063	her	114	“ Hagrid ... please ... ”
8066	8104	8063	8063	her	114	“ Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore . Please , Hagrid , teach us something dull that ’s bound to come up in our O.W.L ... ”
8127	8142	8143	8143	he	116	“ Lis’en , it ’s bin a long day an ’ it ’s late , ”
8167	8172	8173	8173	He	116	“ Oh — sorry — ”
8185	8241	8173	8173	He	116	“ Look , don ’ you go worryin ’ abou ’ me , I promise yeh I ’ve got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now I ’m back ... Now you lot had better get back up to the castle , an ’ don ’ forget ter wipe yer footprints out behind yeh ! ”
8242	8252	8254	8254	Ron	113	“ I dunno if you got through to him , ”
8298	8307	8309	8309	Hermione	114	“ Then I ’ll go back again tomorrow , ”
8312	8341	8309	8309	Hermione	114	“ I ’ll plan his lessons for him if I have to . I do n’t care if she throws out Trelawney but she ’s not taking Hagrid ! ”
8436	8439	8441	8441	Ron	113	“ Oy ! ”
8455	8471	8448	8448	his	113	“ I am a prefect and if one more snowball hits this window — OUCH ! ”
8484	8491	8492	8492	he	113	“ It ’s Fred and George , ”
8502	8505	8492	8492	he	113	“ Gits ... ”
8525	8528	8530	8530	Ron	113	“ So ? ”
8538	8547	8530	8530	Ron	113	“ Got all his lessons planned for him ? ”
8548	8554	8555	8555	she	114	“ Well , I tried , ”
8605	8635	8588	8588	she	114	“ He was n’t even there when I arrived , I was knocking for at least half an hour . And then he came stumping out of the forest — ”
8657	8669	8671	8671	Harry	112	“ What ’s he keeping in there ? Did he say ? ”
8673	8676	8678	8678	Hermione	114	“ No , ”
8681	8733	8734	8734	she	114	“ He says he wants them to be a surprise . I tried to explain about Umbridge , but he just does n’t get it . He kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather study knarls than chimaeras — oh I do n’t think he ’s got a chimaera , ”
8747	8830	8734	8734	she	114	“ but that ’s not for lack of trying from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs ... I do n’t know how many times I told him he ’d be better off following Grubbly - Plank ’s plan , I honestly do n’t think he listened to half of what I said . He ’s in a bit of a funny mood , you know . He still wo n’t say how he got all those injuries ... ”
9140	9149	9150	9150	Hagrid	116	“ We ’re workin ’ in here today ! ”
9169	9181	9159	9159	his	116	“ Bit more sheltered ! Anyway , they prefer the dark ... ”
9182	9188	9204	9204	his	155	“ What prefers the dark ? ”
9207	9220	9204	9204	his	155	“ What did he say prefers the dark — did you hear ? ”
9265	9268	9270	9270	Hagrid	116	“ Ready ? ”
9279	9342	9270	9270	Hagrid	116	“ Right , well , I ’ve bin savin ’ a trip inter the forest fer yer fifth year . Thought we ’d go an ’ see these creatures in their natural habitat . Now , what we ’re studyin ’ today is pretty rare , I reckon I ’m probably the on’y person in Britain who ’s managed ter train ’em — ”
9343	9355	9357	9357	Malfoy	155	“ And you ’re sure they ’re trained , are you ? ”
9369	9389	9362	9362	his	155	“ Only it would n’t be the first time you ’d brought wild stuff to class , would it ? ”
9410	9417	9419	9419	Hagrid	116	“ ’ Course they ’re trained , ”

11935	12032	11908	11908	Hermione	114	“ You see what she ’s up to ? It ’s her thing about half - breeds all over again — she ’s trying to make out Hagrid ’s some kind of dim - witted troll , just because he had a giantess for a mother — and oh , it ’s not fair , that really was n’t a bad lesson at all — I mean , all right , if it had been Blast - Ended Skrewts again , but thestrals are fine — in fact , for Hagrid , they ’re really good ! ”
12033	12040	12042	12042	Ron	113	“ Umbridge said they ’re dangerous , ”
12044	12059	12061	12061	Hermione	114	“ Well , it ’s like Hagrid said , they can look after themselves , ”
12064	12115	12061	12061	Hermione	114	“ and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly - Plank would n’t usually show them to us before N.E.W.T. level , but , well , they are very interesting , are n’t they ? The way some people can see them and some ca n’t ! I wish I could . ”

12430	12454	12456	12456	Ron	113	“ And they ’re cheeky little snotrags , you know , we definitely were n’t that rude when we were in first year , ”
12486	12497	12499	12499	Ron	113	“ He ’s got dung for brains , that one , ”
12526	12551	12518	12518	she	114	“ All those poor elves I have n’t set free yet , having to stay over during Christmas because there are n’t enough hats ! ”
12752	12775	12734	12734	Ron	113	“ But you ’re coming too ! Did n’t I say ? Mum wrote and told me to invite you weeks ago ! ”

13299	13308	13289	13289	she	553	“ but as we ca n’t have you ... ”
13344	13351	13352	13352	he	112	“ And what about the Beaters ? ”

13372	13395	13368	13368	Alicia	181	“ and Jack Sloper . Neither of them are brilliant , but compared with the rest of the idiots who turned up ... ”
13433	13436	13437	13437	he	112	“ Okay , ”
13446	13489	13437	13437	he	112	“ I thought this evening we should just go over the things we ’ve done so far , because it ’s the last meeting before the holidays and there ’s no point starting anything new right before a three - week break — ”
13490	13498	13500	13501	Zacharias Smith	186	“ We ’re not doing anything new ? ”
13515	13528	13500	13501	Zacharias Smith	186	“ If I ’d known that , I would n’t have come ... ”

14111	14145	14107	14107	she	187	“ I suppose ... it ’s just ... learning all this stuff ... It just makes me ... wonder whether ... if he ’d known it all ... he ’d still be alive ... ”
14176	14183	14184	14184	Harry	112	“ He did know this stuff , ”
14188	14225	14184	14184	Harry	112	“ He was really good at it , or he could never have got to the middle of that maze . But if Voldemort really wants to kill you , you do n’t stand a chance . ”

14258	14263	14265	14265	Harry	112	“ Yeah , well , ”
14273	14292	14265	14265	Harry	112	“ I dunno why , nor does anyone else , so it ’s nothing to be proud of . ”

15201	15204	15206	15206	Harry	112	“ Dunno , ”
15220	15225	15206	15206	Harry	112	“ Maybe I am . ”
15226	15233	15235	15235	Hermione	114	“ Of course you ’re not , ”
15245	15251	15253	15253	Ron	113	“ How do you know ? ”
15259	15270	15272	15272	Hermione	114	“ Because Cho spends half her time crying these days , ”
15275	15291	15272	15272	Hermione	114	“ She does it at mealtimes , in the loos , all over the place . ”
15292	15305	15307	15307	Ron	113	“ You ’d think a bit of kissing would cheer her up , ”
15311	15314	15316	15316	Hermione	114	“ Ron , ”
15333	15349	15316	15316	Hermione	114	“ you are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet . ”
15350	15358	15360	15360	Ron	113	“ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
15363	15375	15360	15360	Ron	113	“ What sort of person cries while someone ’s kissing them ? ”
15376	15379	15381	15381	Harry	112	“ Yeah , ”
15386	15390	15381	15381	Harry	112	“ who does ? ”
15407	15420	15421	15421	she	114	“ Do n’t you understand how Cho ’s feeling at the moment ? ”
15424	15427	15429	15429	Harry	112	“ No , ”
15442	15593	15434	15434	Hermione	114	“ Well , obviously , she ’s feeling very sad , because of Cedric dying . Then I expect she ’s feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry , and she ca n’t work out who she likes best . Then she ’ll be feeling guilty , thinking it ’s an insult to Cedric ’s memory to be kissing Harry at all , and she ’ll be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with Harry . And she probably ca n’t work out what her feelings toward Harry are anyway , because he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died , so that ’s all very mixed up and painful . Oh , and she ’s afraid she ’s going to be thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because she ’s been flying so badly . ”
15609	15624	15606	15606	Ron	113	“ One person ca n’t feel all that at once , they ’d explode . ”
15625	15644	15646	15646	Hermione	114	“ Just because you ’ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon does n’t mean we all have , ”
15655	15664	15666	15666	Harry	112	“ She was the one who started it , ”
15668	15700	15666	15666	Harry	112	“ I would n’t ’ve — she just sort of came at me — and next thing she ’s crying all over me — I did n’t know what to do — ”
15701	15709	15711	15711	Ron	113	“ Do n’t blame you , mate , ”
15720	15730	15732	15732	Hermione	114	“ You just had to be nice to her , ”
15738	15746	15732	15732	Hermione	114	“ You were , were n’t you ? ”
15747	15750	15752	15752	Harry	112	“ Well , ”
15762	15775	15752	15752	Harry	112	“ I sort of — patted her on the back a bit . ”
15792	15803	15804	15804	she	114	“ Well , I suppose it could have been worse , ”
15807	15816	15804	15804	she	114	“ Are you going to see her again ? ”
15817	15827	15829	15829	Harry	112	“ I ’ll have to , wo n’t I ? ”
15831	15842	15829	15829	Harry	112	“ We ’ve got D.A. meetings , have n’t we ? ”
15843	15850	15852	15852	Hermione	114	“ You know what I mean , ”
15923	15927	15929	15929	Hermione	114	“ Oh well , ”
15939	15950	15929	15929	Hermione	114	“ you ’ll have plenty of opportunities to ask her ... ”
15951	15962	15964	15964	Ron	113	“ What if he does n’t want to ask her ? ”
15980	15986	15988	15988	Hermione	114	“ Do n’t be silly , ”
15991	16005	15988	15988	Hermione	114	“ Harry ’s liked her for ages , have n’t you , Harry ? ”
16056	16066	16067	16067	Ron	113	“ Who ’re you writing the novel to anyway ? ”
16092	16095	16084	16084	Hermione	114	“ Viktor . ”
16096	16099	16084	16084	Hermione	114	“ Krum ? ”
16100	16109	16084	16084	Hermione	114	“ How many other Viktors do we know ? ”
16226	16232	16240	16240	she	114	“ Well , ’ night , ”
16249	16257	16258	16258	Ron	113	“ What does she see in Krum ? ”
16270	16273	16275	16275	Harry	112	“ Well , ”
16281	16300	16275	16275	Harry	112	“ I s’pose he ’s older , is n’t he ... and he ’s an international Quidditch player ... ”
16301	16309	16311	16311	Ron	113	“ Yeah , but apart from that , ”
16316	16329	16311	16311	Ron	113	“ I mean he ’s a grouchy git , is n’t he ? ”
16330	16336	16338	16338	Harry	112	“ Bit grouchy , yeah , ”
16438	16442	16444	16444	Ron	113	“ ’ Night , ”
16452	16456	16458	16458	Harry	112	“ ’ Night , ”
16631	16643	16628	16628	Cho	187	“ Cedric gave me loads of Chocolate Frog cards , look ! ”
16671	16698	16666	16666	Hermione	114	“ You did promise her , you know , Harry ... I think you ’d better give her something else instead ... How about your Firebolt ? ”
17024	17029	17012	17012	His	112	“ Harry ! HARRY ! ”
17073	17076	17077	17077	Ron	113	“ Harry ! ”
17125	17131	17161	17161	he	112	“ He ’s really ill , ”
17137	17143	17161	17161	he	112	“ Should we call someone ? ”
17144	17149	17161	17161	he	112	“ Harry ! Harry ! ”
17193	17197	17198	17198	he	112	“ Your dad , ”
17205	17213	17198	17198	he	112	“ Your dad ’s ... been attacked ... ”
17214	17217	17219	17219	Ron	113	“ What ? ”
17222	17240	17198	17198	he	112	“ Your dad ! He ’s been bitten , it ’s serious , there was blood everywhere ... ”
17241	17248	17250	17253	the same scared voice	605	“ I ’m going for help , ”
17265	17270	17272	17272	Ron	113	“ Harry , mate , ”
17275	17283	17272	17272	Ron	113	“ you ... you were just dreaming ... ”
17284	17287	17289	17289	Harry	112	“ No ! ”
17299	17323	17296	17296	Ron	113	“ It was n’t a dream ... not an ordinary dream ... I was there , I saw it ... I did it ... ”
17366	17374	17375	17375	he	113	“ Harry , you ’re not well , ”

17387	17392	17393	17393	Harry	112	“ I ’m fine ! ”
17406	17449	17393	17393	Harry	112	“ There ’s nothing wrong with me , it ’s your dad you ’ve got to worry about — we need to find out where he is — he ’s bleeding like mad — I was — it was a huge snake ... ”
17520	17526	17515	17515	Neville	161	“ Over here , Professor ... ”
17552	17564	17535	17535	her	200	“ What is it , Potter ? Where does it hurt ? ”

17614	17632	17607	17607	he	112	“ He ’s been attacked by a snake and it ’s serious , I saw it happen . ”
17633	17644	17646	17647	Professor McGonagall	200	“ What do you mean , you saw it happen ? ”
17654	17669	17607	17607	he	112	“ I do n’t know ... I was asleep and then I was there ... ”
17670	17677	17607	17607	he	112	“ You mean you dreamed this ? ”
17678	17681	17683	17683	Harry	112	“ No ! ”
17692	17760	17683	17683	Harry	112	“ I was having a dream at first about something completely different , something stupid ... and then this interrupted it . It was real , I did n’t imagine it , Mr. Weasley was asleep on the floor and he was attacked by a gigantic snake , there was a load of blood , he collapsed , someone ’s got to find out where he is ... ”
17780	17792	17793	17793	Harry	112	“ I ’m not lying , and I ’m not mad ! ”
17804	17814	17793	17793	Harry	112	“ I tell you , I saw it happen ! ”
17815	17822	17824	17825	Professor McGonagall	200	“ I believe you , Potter , ”

18584	18592	18594	18594	Harry	112	“ Well ... I do n’t know , ”
18604	18612	18594	18594	Harry	112	“ Inside my head , I suppose — ”
18613	18618	18620	18620	Dumbledore	133	“ You misunderstand me , ”
18629	18668	18620	18620	Dumbledore	133	“ I mean ... can you remember — er — where you were positioned as you watched this attack happen ? Were you perhaps standing beside the victim , or else looking down on the scene from above ? ”
18689	18695	18696	18696	he	112	“ I was the snake , ”
18699	18712	18696	18696	he	112	“ I saw it all from the snake ’s point of view ... ”
18743	18749	18726	18726	Ron	113	“ Is Arthur seriously injured ? ”
18750	18753	18755	18755	Harry	112	“ Yes , ”

18914	18935	18912	18912	Dumbledore	133	“ Everard , you will need to raise the alarm , make sure he is found by the right people — ”
19026	19039	19040	19040	Dumbledore	133	“ Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwarts ’s most celebrated Heads , ”
19066	19102	19060	19060	his	112	“ Their renown is such that both have portraits hanging in other important Wizarding institutions . As they are free to move between their own portraits they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere ... ”
19103	19111	19113	19113	Harry	112	“ But Mr. Weasley could be anywhere ! ”
19115	19125	19127	19127	Dumbledore	133	“ Please sit down , all three of you , ”
19136	19159	19127	19127	Dumbledore	133	“ Everard and Dilys may not be back for several minutes ... Professor McGonagall , if you could draw up extra chairs ... ”
19249	19254	19256	19256	Dumbledore	133	“ We will need , ”
19263	19267	19256	19256	Dumbledore	133	“ a warning . ”
19430	19435	19437	19437	Dumbledore	133	“ Naturally , naturally , ”
19455	19461	19437	19437	Dumbledore	133	“ But in essence divided ? ”
19622	19625	19609	19612	the wizard called Everard	645	“ Dumbledore ! ”
19626	19630	19632	19632	Dumbledore	133	“ What news ? ”
19636	19644	19646	19647	the wizard	634	“ I yelled until someone came running , ”
19660	19735	19646	19647	the wizard	634	“ said I ’d heard something moving downstairs — they were n’t sure whether to believe me but went down to check — you know there are no portraits down there to watch from . Anyway , they carried him up a few minutes later . He does n’t look good , he ’s covered in blood , I ran along to Elfrida Cragg ’s portrait to get a good view as they left — ”
19736	19739	19741	19741	Dumbledore	133	“ Good , ”
19749	19762	19743	19743	Ron	113	“ I take it Dilys will have seen him arrive , then — ”

19848	19852	19825	19825	He	133	“ Of course ... ”
19878	19886	19888	19889	Professor McGonagall	200	“ And Dumbledore — what about Molly ? ”
19896	19915	19917	19917	Dumbledore	133	“ That will be a job for Fawkes when he has finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching , ”
19919	19932	19917	19917	Dumbledore	133	“ But she may already know ... that excellent clock of hers ... ”

21383	21389	21390	21390	he	142	“ What ’s going on ? ”
21402	21412	21390	21390	he	142	“ Phineas Nigellus said Arthur ’s been badly injured — ”
21413	21417	21419	21419	Fred	149	“ Ask Harry , ”
21421	21432	21434	21434	George	150	“ Yeah , I want to hear this for myself , ”
21455	21459	21460	21460	Harry	112	“ It was — ”
21473	21484	21486	21486	he	112	“ I had a — a kind of — vision ... ”
21623	21628	21630	21630	Fred	149	“ Is Mum here ? ”
21636	21648	21650	21650	Sirius	142	“ She probably does n’t even know what ’s happened yet , ”
21652	21675	21650	21650	Sirius	142	“ The important thing was to get you away before Umbridge could interfere . I expect Dumbledore ’s letting Molly know now . ”
21676	21687	21689	21689	Ginny	182	“ We ’ve got to go to St. Mungo ’s , ”
21708	21720	21692	21692	She	182	“ Sirius , can you lend us cloaks or anything — ? ”
21721	21736	21738	21738	Sirius	142	“ Hang on , you ca n’t go tearing off to St. Mungo ’s ! ”
21740	21754	21756	21756	Fred	149	“ ’ Course we can go to St. Mungo ’s if we want , ”
21763	21769	21756	21756	Fred	149	“ he ’s our dad ! ”
21770	21793	21692	21692	She	182	“ And how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur was attacked before the hospital even let his wife know ? ”
21794	21800	21802	21802	George	150	“ What does that matter ? ”
21805	21834	21836	21836	Sirius	142	“ It matters because we do n’t want to draw attention to the fact that Harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles away ! ”
21839	21853	21836	21836	Sirius	142	“ Have you any idea what the Ministry would make of that information ? ”
21884	21902	21881	21881	Ginny	182	“ Somebody else could have told us ... We could have heard it somewhere other than Harry ... ”
21903	21907	21909	21909	Sirius	142	“ Like who ? ”
21912	21951	21909	21909	Sirius	142	“ Listen , your dad ’s been hurt while on duty for the Order and the circumstances are fishy enough without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened , you could seriously damage the Order ’s — ”
21952	21962	21964	21964	Fred	149	“ We do n’t care about the dumb Order ! ”
21966	21977	21979	21979	George	150	“ It ’s our dad dying we ’re talking about ! ”
21981	22005	22007	22007	Sirius	142	“ Your father knew what he was getting into , and he wo n’t thank you for messing things up for the Order ! ”
22013	22042	22007	22007	Sirius	142	“ This is how it is — this is why you ’re not in the Order — you do n’t understand — there are things worth dying for ! ”
22043	22053	22055	22055	Fred	149	“ Easy for you to say , stuck here ! ”
22057	22067	22055	22055	Fred	149	“ I do n’t see you risking your neck ! ”
22109	22151	22097	22097	he	142	“ I know it ’s hard , but we ’ve all got to act as though we do n’t know anything yet . We ’ve got to stay put , at least until we hear from your mother , all right ? ”
22218	22223	22225	22225	Sirius	142	“ That ’s right , ”
22228	22250	22225	22225	Sirius	142	“ come on , let ’s all ... let ’s all have a drink while we ’re waiting . Accio Butterbeer ! ”
22556	22559	22561	22561	Sirius	142	“ Fawkes ! ”
22570	22589	22561	22561	Sirius	142	“ That ’s not Dumbledore ’s writing — it must be a message from your mother — here — ”
22607	22640	22590	22590	He	142	“ Dad is still alive . I am setting out for St. Mungo ’s now . Stay where you are . I will send news as soon as I can . Mum . ”
22647	22651	22652	22652	he	142	“ Still alive ... ”
22656	22663	22652	22652	he	142	“ But that makes it sound ... ”
23015	23024	23025	23025	she	175	“ He ’s going to be all right , ”
23034	23065	23025	23025	she	175	“ He ’s sleeping . We can all go and see him later . Bill ’s sitting with him now , he ’s going to take the morning off work . ”
23112	23115	23117	23117	Sirius	142	“ Breakfast ! ”
23127	23140	23117	23117	Sirius	142	“ Where ’s that accursed house - elf ? Kreacher ! KREACHER ! ”
23149	23157	23159	23159	Sirius	142	“ Oh , forget it , then , ”
23169	23196	23159	23159	Sirius	142	“ So it ’s breakfast for — let ’s see — seven ... Bacon and eggs , I think , and some tea , and toast — ”
23260	23279	23280	23280	she	175	“ I do n’t know what would have happened if it had n’t been for you , Harry , ”
23287	23350	23280	23280	she	175	“ They might not have found Arthur for hours , and then it would have been too late , but thanks to you he ’s alive and Dumbledore ’s been able to think up a good cover story for Arthur being where he was , you ’ve no idea what trouble he would have been in otherwise , look at poor Sturgis ... ”
23411	23451	23380	23380	Sirius	142	“ Oh , Sirius , I ’m so grateful ... They think he ’ll be there a little while and it would be wonderful to be nearer ... Of course , that might mean we ’re here for Christmas ... ”
23452	23458	23460	23460	Sirius	142	“ The more the merrier ! ”
23484	23487	23488	23488	Harry	112	“ Sirius , ”
23499	23511	23488	23488	Harry	112	“ Can I have a quick word ? Er — now ? ”
23562	23569	23559	23559	Sirius	142	“ Did you tell Dumbledore this ? ”
23570	23573	23575	23575	Harry	112	“ Yes , ”
23578	23599	23575	23575	Harry	112	“ but he did n’t tell me what it meant . Well , he does n’t tell me anything anymore ... ”
23600	23617	23619	23619	Sirius	142	“ I ’m sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about , ”
23622	23629	23631	23631	Harry	112	“ But that ’s not all , ”
23642	23704	23631	23631	Harry	112	“ Sirius , I ... I think I ’m going mad ... Back in Dumbledore ’s office , just before we took the Portkey ... for a couple of seconds there I thought I was a snake , I felt like one — my scar really hurt when I was looking at Dumbledore — Sirius , I wanted to attack him — ”
23722	23737	23739	23739	Sirius	142	“ It must have been the aftermath of the vision , that ’s all , ”
23741	23755	23739	23739	Sirius	142	“ You were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and — ”
23756	23762	23764	23764	Harry	112	“ It was n’t that , ”
23770	23788	23767	23767	his	112	“ It was like something rose up inside me , like there ’s a snake inside me — ”
23789	23795	23797	23797	Sirius	142	“ You need to sleep , ”
24068	24082	24083	24083	she	220	“ There is n’t any Seer blood in your family , is there ? ”
24104	24107	24109	24109	Harry	112	“ No , ”
24119	24122	24124	24124	Tonks	220	“ No , ”
24127	24172	24124	24124	Tonks	220	“ no , I suppose it ’s not really prophecy you ’re doing , is it ? I mean , you ’re not seeing the future , you ’re seeing the present ... It ’s odd , is n’t it ? Useful , though ... ”
24296	24302	24304	24304	Moody	221	“ Not far from here , ”
24353	24416	24325	24325	He	221	“ Was n’t easy to find a good location for a hospital . Nowhere in Diagon Alley was big enough and we could n’t have it underground like the Ministry — unhealthy . In the end they managed to get hold of a building up here . Theory was sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd ... ”
24448	24453	24455	24455	Moody	221	“ Here we go , ”
24548	24557	24532	24546	a large woman laden with plastic shopping bags say to her friend as they passed	723	“ It ’s never open , that place ... ”
24558	24561	24563	24563	Tonks	220	“ Right , ”
24595	24599	24563	24563	Tonks	220	“ Everybody ready ? ”
24645	24656	24638	24638	her	220	“ Wotcher ... We ’re here to see Arthur Weasley . ”
24820	24824	24826	24826	Moody	221	“ C’m on , ”
25084	25089	25090	25090	he	112	“ Are they doctors ? ”
25095	25098	25100	25100	Ron	113	“ Doctors ? ”
25105	25120	25100	25100	Ron	113	“ Those Muggle nutters that cut people up ? Nah , they ’re Healers . ”
25121	25125	25127	25128	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ Over here ! ”
25295	25346	25347	25347	He	756	“ It ’s these — ouch — shoes my brother gave me — ow — they ’re eating my — OUCH — feet — look at them , there must be some kind of — AARGH — jinx on them and I ca n’t — AAAAARGH — get them off — ”
25362	25374	25376	25378	the blonde witch	758	“ The shoes do n’t prevent you reading , do they ? ”
25393	25413	25376	25378	the blonde witch	758	“ You want Spell Damage , fourth floor . Just like it says on the floor guide . Next ! ”
25491	25499	25500	25500	he	765	“ I ’m here to see Bode ! ”
25503	25519	25521	25522	the witch	635	“ Ward forty - nine , but I ’m afraid you ’re wasting your time , ”
25525	25543	25521	25522	the witch	635	“ He ’s completely addled , you know , still thinks he ’s a teapot ... Next ! ”
25583	25587	25589	25590	the witch	635	“ Fourth floor , ”
25620	25623	25600	25601	the man	599	“ Next ! ”
25632	25635	25636	25636	she	175	“ Hello , ”
25639	25664	25636	25636	she	175	“ My husband , Arthur Weasley , was supposed to be moved to a different ward this morning , could you tell us — ? ”
25665	25669	25671	25672	the witch	635	“ Arthur Weasley ? ”
25686	25702	25671	25672	the witch	635	“ Yes , first floor , second door on the right , Dai Llewellyn ward . ”
25703	25707	25709	25710	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ Thank you , ”
25712	25719	25709	25710	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ Come on , you lot . ”
25816	25821	25867	25868	Trainee Healer	781	“ Creature - Induced Injuries ”
25834	25836	25882	25882	Tonks	220	“ DANGEROUS ”
25873	25881	25882	25882	Tonks	220	“ We ’ll wait outside , Molly , ”
25885	25905	25882	25882	Tonks	220	“ Arthur wo n’t want too many visitors at once ... It ought to be just the family first . ”
25955	25969	25940	25941	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ Do n’t be silly , Harry , Arthur wants to thank you ... ”
26119	26122	26123	26123	he	112	“ Hello ! ”
26131	26156	26123	26123	he	112	“ Bill just left , Molly , had to get back to work , but he says he ’ll drop in on you later ... ”
26157	26164	26166	26167	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ How are you , Arthur ? ”
26182	26191	26166	26167	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ You ’re still looking a bit peaky ... ”
26192	26198	26200	26201	Mr. Weasley	201	“ I feel absolutely fine , ”
26215	26233	26206	26206	his	201	“ If they could only take the bandages off , I ’d be fit to go home . ”
26234	26245	26247	26247	Fred	149	“ Why ca n’t they take them off , Dad ? ”
26249	26262	26264	26265	Mr. Weasley	201	“ Well , I start bleeding like mad every time they try , ”
26298	26365	26366	26366	he	201	“ It seems there was some rather unusual kind of poison in that snake ’s fangs that keeps wounds open ... They ’re sure they ’ll find an antidote , though , they say they ’ve had much worse cases than mine , and in the meantime I just have to keep taking a Blood - Replenishing Potion every hour . But that fellow over there , ”
26393	26407	26366	26366	he	201	“ Bitten by a werewolf , poor chap . No cure at all . ”
26408	26412	26414	26415	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ A werewolf ? ”
26420	26438	26414	26415	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ Is he safe in a public ward ? Should n’t he be in a private room ? ”
26439	26448	26449	26450	Mr. Weasley	201	“ It ’s two weeks till full moon , ”
26455	26521	26449	26450	Mr. Weasley	201	“ They ’ve been talking to him this morning , the Healers , you know , trying to persuade him he ’ll be able to lead an almost normal life . I said to him — did n’t mention names , of course — but I said I knew a werewolf personally , very nice man , who finds the condition quite easy to manage ... ”
26522	26528	26530	26530	George	150	“ What did he say ? ”
26532	26547	26549	26550	Mr. Weasley	201	“ Said he ’d give me another bite if I did n’t shut up , ”
26553	26560	26561	26561	he	201	“ And that woman over there , ”
26576	26623	26561	26561	he	201	“ wo n’t tell the Healers what bit her , which makes us all think it must have been something she was handling illegally . Whatever it was took a real chunk out of her leg , very nasty smell when they take off the dressings . ”
26624	26637	26639	26639	Fred	149	“ So , you going to tell us what happened , Dad ? ”
26649	26660	26662	26663	Mr. Weasley	201	“ Well , you already know , do n’t you ? ”
26672	26697	26662	26663	Mr. Weasley	201	“ It ’s very simple — I ’d had a very long day , dozed off , got sneaked up on , and bitten . ”
26698	26709	26711	26711	Fred	149	“ Is it in the Prophet , you being attacked ? ”
26722	26729	26731	26732	Mr. Weasley	201	“ No , of course not , ”
26740	26755	26731	26732	Mr. Weasley	201	“ the Ministry would n’t want everyone to know a dirty great serpent got — ”
26756	26759	26761	26762	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ Arthur ! ”
26765	26773	26774	26775	Mr. Weasley	201	“ — got — er — me , ”
26794	26805	26807	26807	George	150	“ So where were you when it happened , Dad ? ”
26809	26815	26817	26818	Mr. Weasley	201	“ That ’s my business , ”
26840	26893	26826	26826	He	201	“ I was just reading about Widdershins ’s arrest when you arrived . You know Widdershins turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets last summer ? One of his jinxes backfired , the toilet exploded , and they found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in — ”
26894	26905	26906	26906	Fred	149	“ When you say you were ‘ on duty , ’ ”
26913	26919	26906	26906	Fred	149	“ what were you doing ? ”
26920	26926	26928	26929	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ You heard your father , ”
26931	26946	26928	26929	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ we are not discussing this here ! Go on about Widdershins , Arthur — ”
26947	26966	26968	26969	Mr. Weasley	201	“ Well , do n’t ask me how , but he actually got off on the toilet charge , ”
26972	26981	26968	26969	Mr. Weasley	201	“ I can only suppose gold changed hands — ”
26982	26992	26994	26994	George	150	“ You were guarding it , were n’t you ? ”
26997	27011	26994	26994	George	150	“ The weapon ? The thing You - Know - Who ’s after ? ”
27012	27018	27020	27021	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ George , be quiet ! ”
27023	27026	27028	27029	Mr. Weasley	201	“ Anyway , ”
27035	27109	27028	27029	Mr. Weasley	201	“ this time Widdershins ’s been caught selling biting doorknobs to Muggles , and I do n’t think he ’ll be able to worm his way out of it because according to this article , two Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St. Mungo ’s for emergency bone regrowth and memory modification . Just think of it , Muggles in St. Mungo ’s ! I wonder which ward they ’re in ? ”
27123	27140	27142	27142	Fred	149	“ Did n’t you say You - Know - Who ’s got a snake , Harry ? ”
27152	27169	27142	27142	Fred	149	“ A massive one ? You saw it the night he returned , did n’t you ? ”
27170	27175	27177	27178	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ That ’s enough , ”
27181	27207	27208	27208	she	175	“ Mad - Eye and Tonks are outside , Arthur , they want to come and see you . And you lot can wait outside , ”
27216	27230	27208	27208	she	175	“ You can come and say good - bye afterward . Go on ... ”
27260	27263	27264	27264	he	149	“ Fine , ”
27273	27284	27264	27264	he	149	“ be like that . Do n’t tell us anything . ”
27285	27290	27292	27292	George	150	“ Looking for these ? ”
27307	27313	27315	27315	Fred	149	“ You read my mind , ”
27319	27338	27315	27315	Fred	149	“ Let ’s see if St. Mungo ’s puts Imperturbable Charms on its ward doors , shall we ? ”
27367	27396	27401	27401	himself	112	“ Go on , Harry , take it ! You saved Dad ’s life , if anyone ’s got the right to eavesdrop on him it ’s you ... ”
27422	27427	27428	27428	Fred	149	“ Okay , go ! ”
27473	27521	27460	27460	Tonks	220	“ ... they searched the whole area but they could n’t find the snake anywhere , it just seems to have vanished after it attacked you , Arthur ... But You - Know - Who ca n’t have expected a snake to get in , can he ? ”
27522	27532	27534	27534	Moody	221	“ I reckon he sent it as a lookout , ”
27536	27595	27534	27534	Moody	221	“ ’cause he ’s not had any luck so far , has he ? No , I reckon he ’s trying to get a clearer picture of what he ’s facing and if Arthur had n’t been there the beast would ’ve had much more time to look around . So Potter says he saw it all happen ? ”
27596	27599	27601	27602	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ Yes , ”
27609	27628	27604	27604	She	175	“ You know , Dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for Harry to see something like this ... ”
27629	27634	27636	27636	Moody	221	“ Yeah , well , ”
27638	27653	27636	27636	Moody	221	“ there ’s something funny about the Potter kid , we all know that . ”
27654	27668	27670	27671	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ Dumbledore seemed worried about Harry when I spoke to him this morning , ”
27673	27680	27682	27682	Moody	221	“ ’ Course he ’s worried , ”
27684	27721	27682	27682	Moody	221	“ The boy ’s seeing things from inside You - Know - Who ’s snake ... Obviously , Potter does n’t realize what that means , but if You - Know - Who ’s possessing him — ”
27954	27963	27991	27991	Harry	112	“ What ’s he after apart from followers ? ”
27964	27985	27986	27986	I	0	“ Stuff he can only get by stealth ... like a weapon . Something he did n’t have last time . ”
28113	28123	28125	28126	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ Are you all right , Harry , dear ? ”
28145	28158	28125	28126	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ You do n’t look very well . Are you feeling sick ? ”
28180	28193	28195	28196	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ Harry , dear , are you sure you ’re all right ? ”
28218	28257	28195	28196	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ You look ever so pale ... Are you sure you slept this morning ? You go upstairs to bed right now , and you can have a couple of hours ’ sleep before dinner , all right ? ”
28777	28784	28785	28785	He	0	“ Running away , are we ? ”
28816	28823	28825	28825	Harry	112	“ Not running away , no , ”
28839	28843	28845	28846	Phineas Nigellus	210	“ I thought , ”
28853	28912	28845	28846	Phineas Nigellus	210	“ that to belong in Gryffindor House you were supposed to be brave ? It looks to me as though you would have been better off in my own House . We Slytherins are brave , yes , but not stupid . For instance , given the choice , we will always choose to save our own necks . ”
28913	28924	28926	28926	Harry	112	“ It ’s not my own neck I ’m saving , ”
28950	28955	28957	28958	Phineas Nigellus	210	“ Oh I see , ”
28965	28977	28957	28958	Phineas Nigellus	210	“ This is no cowardly flight — you are being noble . ”
28994	29005	28989	28990	Phineas Nigellus	210	“ I have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore . ”
29010	29015	28989	28990	Phineas Nigellus	210	“ What is it ? ”
29016	29022	28989	28990	Phineas Nigellus	210	“ Stay where you are . ”
29023	29029	29031	29031	Harry	112	“ I have n’t moved ! ”
29040	29047	29031	29031	Harry	112	“ So what ’s the message ? ”
29048	29059	29061	29062	Phineas Nigellus	210	“ I have just given it to you , dolt , ”
29065	29076	29061	29062	Phineas Nigellus	210	“ Dumbledore says , ‘ Stay where you are . ’ ”
29077	29080	29082	29082	Harry	112	“ Why ? ”
29092	29107	29082	29082	Harry	112	“ Why does he want me to stay ? What else did he say ? ”
29108	29112	29114	29115	Phineas Nigellus	210	“ Nothing whatsoever , ”
29182	29191	29192	29192	he	112	“ So that ’s it , is it ? ”
29196	29254	29192	29192	he	112	“ Stay there ? That ’s all anyone could tell me after I got attacked by those dementors too ! Just stay put while the grown - ups sort it out , Harry ! We wo n’t bother telling you anything , though , because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it ! ”
29255	29259	29261	29262	Phineas Nigellus	210	“ You know , ”
29270	29404	29261	29262	Phineas Nigellus	210	“ this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher ! Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything . Has it not occurred to you , my poor puffed - up popinjay , that there might be an excellent reason why the headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you ? Have you never paused , while feeling hard - done - by , to note that following Dumbledore ’s orders has never yet led you into harm ? No . No , like all young people , you are quite sure that you alone feel and think , you alone recognize danger , you alone are the only one clever enough to realize what the Dark Lord may be planning ... ”
29405	29417	29419	29419	Harry	112	“ He is planning something to do with me , then ? ”
29422	29428	29430	29431	Phineas Nigellus	210	“ Did I say that ? ”
29439	29466	29430	29431	Phineas Nigellus	210	“ Now , if you will excuse me , I have better things to do than to listen to adolescent agonizing ... Good day to you ... ”
29478	29484	29485	29485	Harry	112	“ Fine , go then ! ”
29492	29500	29485	29485	Harry	112	“ And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing ! ”
29735	29738	29740	29740	Ron	113	“ Harry , ”
29750	29771	29740	29740	Ron	113	“ Mum says dinner ’s ready , but she ’ll save you something if you want to stay in bed ... ”
30185	30193	30195	30195	Hermione	114	“ I know you ’re in there , ”
30199	30213	30195	30195	Hermione	114	“ Will you please come out ? I want to talk to you . ”
30214	30221	30222	30222	Harry	112	“ What are you doing here ? ”
30252	30264	30234	30234	his	139	“ I thought you were skiing with your mum and dad . ”
30265	30280	30282	30282	Hermione	114	“ Well , to tell the truth , skiing ’s not really my thing , ”
30284	30292	30282	30282	Hermione	114	“ So I ’ve come for Christmas . ”
30307	30372	30373	30373	she	114	“ But do n’t tell Ron that , I told him it ’s really good because he kept laughing so much . Anyway , Mum and Dad are a bit disappointed , but I ’ve told them that everyone who ’s serious about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study . They want me to do well , they ’ll understand . Anyway , ”
30377	30401	30373	30373	she	114	“ let ’s go to your bedroom , Ron ’s mum ’s lit a fire in there and she ’s sent up sandwiches . ”
30436	30444	30446	30446	Hermione	114	“ I came on the Knight Bus , ”
30460	30524	30446	30446	Hermione	114	“ Dumbledore told me what had happened first thing yesterday morning , but I had to wait for term to end officially before setting off . Umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose , even though Dumbledore told her Mr. Weasley was in St. Mungo ’s , and he ’d given you all permission to visit . So ... ”
30543	30549	30551	30551	Hermione	114	“ How ’re you feeling ? ”
30553	30556	30558	30558	Harry	112	“ Fine , ”
30561	30570	30571	30571	she	114	“ Oh , do n’t lie , Harry , ”
30575	30595	30571	30571	she	114	“ Ron and Ginny say you ’ve been hiding from everyone since you got back from St. Mungo ’s . ”
30596	30603	30605	30605	Harry	112	“ They do , do they ? ”
30625	30631	30632	30632	she	182	“ Well , you have ! ”
30635	30646	30632	30632	she	182	“ And you wo n’t look at any of us ! ”
30647	30659	30661	30661	Harry	112	“ It ’s you lot who wo n’t look at me ! ”
30664	30680	30682	30682	Hermione	114	“ Maybe you ’re taking it in turns to look and keep missing each other , ”
30691	30695	30697	30697	Harry	112	“ Very funny , ”
30702	30710	30712	30712	Hermione	114	“ Oh , stop feeling all misunderstood , ”
30715	30733	30712	30712	Hermione	114	“ Look , the others have told me what you overheard last night on the Extendable Ears — ”
30734	30737	30739	30739	Harry	112	“ Yeah ? ”
30757	30776	30739	30739	Harry	112	“ All been talking about me , have you ? Well , I ’m getting used to it ... ”
30777	30787	30789	30789	Ginny	182	“ We wanted to talk to you , Harry , ”
30791	30804	30789	30789	Ginny	182	“ but as you ’ve been hiding ever since we got back — ”
30805	30816	30818	30818	Harry	112	“ I did n’t want anyone to talk to me , ”
30828	30839	30841	30841	Ginny	182	“ Well , that was a bit stupid of you , ”
30844	30874	30841	30841	Ginny	182	“ seeing as you do n’t know anyone but me who ’s been possessed by You - Know - Who , and I can tell you how it feels . ”
30898	30902	30903	30903	he	112	“ I forgot , ”
30906	30910	30912	30912	Ginny	182	“ Lucky you , ”
30915	30920	30921	30921	Harry	112	“ I ’m sorry , ”
30929	30943	30925	30925	he	112	“ So ... so do you think I ’m being possessed , then ? ”
30944	30956	30957	30957	Ginny	182	“ Well , can you remember everything you ’ve been doing ? ”
30960	30978	30957	30957	Ginny	182	“ Are there big blank periods where you do n’t know what you ’ve been up to ? ”
30984	30987	30988	30988	he	112	“ No , ”
30991	31004	31006	31006	Ginny	182	“ Then You - Know - Who has n’t ever possessed you , ”
31009	31045	31006	31006	Ginny	182	“ When he did it to me , I could n’t remember what I ’d been doing for hours at a time . I ’d find myself somewhere and not know how I got there . ”
31063	31077	31050	31050	her	182	“ That dream I had about your dad and the snake , though — ”
31078	31088	31089	31089	Hermione	114	“ Harry , you ’ve had these dreams before , ”
31092	31105	31089	31089	Hermione	114	“ You had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year . ”
31106	31111	31113	31113	Harry	112	“ This was different , ”
31119	31144	31116	31116	his	112	“ I was inside that snake . It was like I was the snake ... What if Voldemort somehow transported me to London — ? ”

31157	31197	31151	31151	Hermione	114	“ you ’ll read Hogwarts : A History , and perhaps that will remind you that you ca n’t Apparate or Disapparate inside Hogwarts . Even Voldemort could n’t just make you fly out of your dormitory , Harry . ”
31198	31208	31210	31210	Ron	113	“ You did n’t leave your bed , mate , ”
31212	31231	31210	31210	Ron	113	“ I saw you thrashing around in your sleep about a minute before we could wake you up ... ”

31866	31872	31874	31874	Fred	149	“ Mum ’s crying again , ”
31877	31885	31874	31874	Fred	149	“ Percy sent back his Christmas jumper . ”
31886	31891	31893	31893	George	150	“ Without a note , ”

31947	31953	31955	31955	George	150	“ — did n’t work , ”
31964	31986	31955	31955	George	150	“ So Lupin took over . Best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast , I reckon . ”
31987	31996	31998	31998	Fred	149	“ What ’s that supposed to be anyway ? ”
32006	32016	32002	32002	Dobby	173	“ Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes . ”
32017	32022	32024	32024	George	150	“ It ’s Harry ! ”
32034	32041	32024	32024	George	150	“ Says so on the back ! ”
32042	32046	32048	32048	Fred	149	“ Good likeness , ”

32165	32169	32171	32171	Ron	113	“ No problem , ”
32173	32180	32181	32181	he	113	“ Who ’s that for anyway ? ”
32194	32197	32199	32199	Hermione	114	“ Kreacher , ”
32202	32210	32212	32212	Ron	113	“ It had better not be clothes ! ”
32215	32234	32212	32212	Ron	113	“ You know what Sirius said , Kreacher knows too much , we ca n’t set him free ! ”
32235	32241	32243	32243	Hermione	114	“ It is n’t clothes , ”
32245	32284	32243	32243	Hermione	114	“ although if I had my way I ’d certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag . No , it ’s a patchwork quilt , I thought it would brighten up his bedroom . ”
32285	32289	32291	32291	Harry	112	“ What bedroom ? ”
32310	32330	32332	32332	Hermione	114	“ Well , Sirius says it ’s not so much a bedroom , more a kind of — den , ”
32334	32348	32332	32332	Hermione	114	“ Apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen . ”
32393	32402	32404	32404	Ron	113	“ So , this is Kreacher ’s bedroom ? ”
32425	32428	32430	32430	Hermione	114	“ Yes , ”
32438	32448	32430	32430	Hermione	114	“ Er ... I think we ’d better knock ... ”
32462	32470	32471	32471	he	113	“ He must be sneaking around upstairs , ”
32483	32486	32471	32471	he	113	“ Urgh . ”
32714	32725	32727	32727	Hermione	114	“ I think I ’ll just leave his present here , ”
32750	32762	32727	32727	Hermione	114	“ He ’ll find it later , that ’ll be fine ... ”
32763	32770	32772	32772	Sirius	142	“ Come to think of it , ”
32789	32797	32772	32772	Sirius	142	“ has anyone actually seen Kreacher lately ? ”
32798	32812	32814	32814	Harry	112	“ I have n’t seen him since the night we came back here , ”
32816	32826	32814	32814	Harry	112	“ You were ordering him out of the kitchen . ”
32827	32830	32832	32832	Sirius	142	“ Yeah ... ”
32836	32860	32832	32832	Sirius	142	“ You know , I think that ’s the last time I saw him , too ... He must be hiding upstairs somewhere ... ”
32861	32871	32873	32873	Harry	112	“ He could n’t have left , could he ? ”
32875	32898	32873	32873	Harry	112	“ I mean , when you said ‘ out , ’ maybe he thought you meant , get out of the house ? ”
32899	32925	32927	32927	Sirius	142	“ No , no , house - elves ca n’t leave unless they ’re given clothes , they ’re tied to their family ’s house , ”
32929	32941	32942	32942	Harry	112	“ They can leave the house if they really want to , ”
32946	32976	32942	32942	Harry	112	“ Dobby did , he left the Malfoys ’ to give me warnings three years ago . He had to punish himself afterward , but he still managed it . ”
32988	33039	32977	32977	Sirius	142	“ I ’ll look for him later , I expect I ’ll find him upstairs crying his eyes out over my mother ’s old bloomers or something ... Of course , he might have crawled into the airing cupboard and died ... But I must n’t get my hopes up ... ”

33499	33504	33506	33507	Mr. Weasley	201	“ Fine , fine , ”
33514	33528	33506	33507	Mr. Weasley	201	“ You — er — have n’t seen Healer Smethwyck , have you ? ”
33529	33532	33534	33535	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ No , ”
33538	33541	33534	33535	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ why ? ”

33561	33587	33549	33550	Mr. Weasley	201	“ Well , everyone had a good day ? What did you all get for Christmas ? Oh , Harry — this is absolutely wonderful — ”
33636	33639	33640	33640	she	175	“ Arthur , ”
33653	33685	33640	33640	she	175	“ you ’ve had your bandages changed . Why have you had your bandages changed a day early , Arthur ? They told me they would n’t need doing until tomorrow . ”
33686	33689	33691	33692	Mr. Weasley	201	“ What ? ”
33707	33721	33691	33692	Mr. Weasley	201	“ No , no — it ’s nothing — it ’s — I — ”
33733	33803	33722	33722	He	112	“ Well — now do n’t get upset , Molly , but Augustus Pye had an idea ... He ’s the Trainee Healer , you know , lovely young chap and very interested in ... um ... complementary medicine ... I mean , some of these old Muggle remedies ... well , they ’re called stitches , Molly , and they work very well on — on Muggle wounds — ”
33869	33877	33882	33882	her	175	“ Do you mean to tell me , ”
33901	33912	33882	33882	her	175	“ that you have been messing about with Muggle remedies ? ”
33913	33922	33924	33925	Mr. Weasley	201	“ Not messing about , Molly , dear , ”
33928	33970	33924	33925	Mr. Weasley	201	“ It was just — just something Pye and I thought we ’d try — only , most unfortunately — well , with these particular kinds of wounds — it does n’t seem to work as well as we ’d hoped — ”
33971	33974	33882	33882	her	175	“ Meaning ? ”
33975	33993	33924	33925	Mr. Weasley	201	“ Well ... well , I do n’t know whether you know what — what stitches are ? ”
33994	34010	34012	34013	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ It sounds as though you ’ve been trying to sew your skin back together , ”
34021	34034	34012	34013	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ but even you , Arthur , would n’t be that stupid — ”
34035	34044	34046	34046	Harry	112	“ I fancy a cup of tea too , ”
34080	34092	34076	34077	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ WHAT DO YOU MEAN , THAT ’S THE GENERAL IDEA ? ”
34093	34097	34099	34099	Ginny	182	“ Typical Dad , ”

34120	34136	34138	34138	Hermione	114	“ Well , you know , they do work well on non - magical wounds , ”
34141	34162	34138	34138	Hermione	114	“ I suppose something in that snake ’s venom dissolves them or something ... I wonder where the tearoom is ? ”
34163	34167	34169	34169	Harry	112	“ Fifth floor , ”
34248	34257	34258	34258	he	113	“ And what ’s that supposed to be ? ”
34280	34308	34263	34264	the Healer	905	“ ’ Tis a most grievous affliction of the skin , young master , that will leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now — ”
34309	34317	34319	34319	Ron	113	“ Watch who you ’re calling gruesome ! ”
34326	34360	34263	34264	the Healer	905	“ The only remedy is to take the liver of a toad , bind it tight about your throat , stand naked by the full moon in a barrel of eels ’ eyes — ”
34361	34368	34263	34264	the Healer	905	“ I have not got spattergroit ! ”
34369	34381	34263	34264	the Healer	905	“ But the unsightly blemishes upon your visage , young master — ”
34382	34387	34389	34389	Ron	113	“ They ’re freckles ! ”
34392	34405	34389	34389	Ron	113	“ Now get back in your own picture and leave me alone ! ”
34420	34426	34406	34406	He	113	“ What floor ’s this ? ”
34427	34435	34437	34437	Hermione	114	“ I think it ’s the fifth , ”
34439	34447	34449	34449	Harry	112	“ Nah , it ’s the fourth , ”
34451	34455	34449	34449	Harry	112	“ one more — ”
34528	34531	34533	34533	Ron	113	“ Blimey ! ”
34541	34546	34548	34548	Hermione	114	“ Oh my goodness , ”
34554	34558	34548	34548	Hermione	114	“ Professor Lockhart ! ”
34584	34590	34591	34591	he	113	“ Well , hello there ! ”
34594	34606	34591	34591	he	113	“ I expect you ’d like my autograph , would you ? ”
34607	34616	34617	34617	Harry	112	“ Has n’t changed much , has he ? ”
34625	34634	34636	34636	Ron	113	“ Er — how are you , Professor ? ”
34693	34703	34705	34705	Lockhart	244	“ I ’m very well indeed , thank you ! ”
34720	34742	34705	34705	Lockhart	244	“ Now , how many autographs would you like ? I can do joined - up writing now , you know ! ”
34743	34757	34759	34759	Ron	113	“ Er — we do n’t want any at the moment , thanks , ”
34770	34789	34765	34765	Harry	112	“ Professor , should you be wandering around the corridors ? Should n’t you be in a ward ? ”
34813	34819	34810	34810	he	113	“ Have n’t we met ? ”
34820	34828	34830	34830	Harry	112	“ Er ... yeah , we have , ”
34832	34843	34830	34830	Harry	112	“ You used to teach us at Hogwarts , remember ? ”
34844	34847	34849	34849	Lockhart	244	“ Teach ? ”
34855	34861	34849	34849	Lockhart	244	“ Me ? Did I ? ”
34877	34923	34830	34830	Harry	112	“ Taught you everything you know , I expect , did I ? Well , how about those autographs , then ? Shall we say a round dozen , you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left out ! ”
34946	34960	34970	34970	her	916	“ Gilderoy , you naughty boy , where have you wandered off to ? ”
34986	35033	34970	34970	her	916	“ Oh Gilderoy , you ’ve got visitors ! How lovely , and on Christmas Day too ! Do you know , he never gets visitors , poor lamb , and I ca n’t think why , he ’s such a sweetie , are n’t you ? ”
35034	35040	35041	35041	Gilderoy	245	“ We ’re doing autographs ! ”
35050	35074	35041	35041	Gilderoy	245	“ They want loads of them , wo n’t take no for an answer ! I just hope we ’ve got enough photographs ! ”
35075	35080	35082	35083	the Healer	905	“ Listen to him , ”
35106	35186	35187	35187	she	905	“ He was rather well known a few years ago ; we very much hope that this liking for giving autographs is a sign that his memory might be coming back a little bit . Will you step this way ? He ’s in a closed ward , you know , he must have slipped out while I was bringing in the Christmas presents , the door ’s usually kept locked ... not that he ’s dangerous ! But , ”
35195	35239	35187	35187	she	905	“ bit of a danger to himself , bless him ... Does n’t know who he is , you see , wanders off and ca n’t remember how to get back ... It is nice of you to have come to see him — ”
35240	35243	35245	35245	Ron	113	“ Er , ”
35254	35263	35245	35245	Ron	113	“ actually , we were just — er — ”
35279	35287	35274	35274	Ron	113	“ going to have a cup of tea ”
35311	35318	35319	35319	Ron	113	“ Let ’s not stay long , ”
35338	35341	35326	35326	her	905	“ Alohomora . ”
35373	35383	35384	35384	she	905	“ This is our long - term resident ward , ”
35399	35494	35393	35393	Ginny	182	“ For permanent spell damage , you know . Of course , with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck , we can produce some improvement ... Gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of himself , and we ’ve seen a real improvement in Mr. Bode , he seems to be regaining the power of speech very well , though he is n’t speaking any language we recognize yet ... Well , I must finish giving out the Christmas presents , I ’ll leave you all to chat ... ”
35604	35612	35613	35613	he	245	“ You can put them in envelopes , ”
35633	35667	35668	35668	He	245	“ I am not forgotten , you know , no , I still receive a very great deal of fan mail ... Gladys Gudgeon writes weekly ... I just wish I knew why ... ”
35687	35697	35668	35668	He	245	“ I suspect it is simply my good looks ... ”
35797	35804	35806	35807	the Healer	905	“ Here you are , Agnes , ”
35825	35857	35806	35807	the Healer	905	“ See , not forgotten , are you ? And your son ’s sent an owl to say he ’s visiting tonight , so that ’s nice , is n’t it ? ”
35864	35900	35902	35903	the Healer	905	“ And look , Broderick , you ’ve been sent a potted plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy hippogriff for each month , they ’ll brighten things up , wo n’t they ? ”
35937	35950	35934	35934	her	905	“ And — oh , Mrs. Longbottom , are you leaving already ? ”
36080	36082	36070	36070	Ron	113	“ Longbottom ”
36094	36097	36090	36090	him	113	“ Neville ! ”
36111	36118	36120	36120	Ron	113	“ It ’s us , Neville ! ”
36128	36143	36120	36120	Ron	113	“ Have you seen ? Lockhart ’s here ! Who ’ve you been visiting ? ”
36144	36153	36155	36155	Neville	161	“ Friends of yours , Neville , dear ? ”
36203	36208	36210	36211	his grandmother	959	“ Ah , yes , ”
36229	36250	36210	36211	his grandmother	959	“ Yes , yes , I know who you are , of course . Neville speaks most highly of you . ”
36251	36256	36258	36258	Harry	112	“ Er — thanks , ”
36287	36295	36296	36297	Mrs. Longbottom	249	“ And you two are clearly Weasleys , ”
36311	36339	36296	36297	Mrs. Longbottom	249	“ Yes , I know your parents — not well , of course — but fine people , fine people ... and you must be Hermione Granger ? ”
36358	36388	36389	36389	she	249	“ Yes , Neville ’s told me all about you . Helped him out of a few sticky spots , have n’t you ? He ’s a good boy , ”
36405	36422	36424	36424	she	249	“ but he has n’t got his father ’s talent , I ’m afraid to say ... ”
36453	36456	36458	36458	Ron	113	“ What ? ”
36494	36505	36458	36458	Ron	113	“ Is that your dad down the end , Neville ? ”
36506	36511	36513	36514	Mrs. Longbottom	249	“ What ’s this ? ”
36517	36530	36513	36514	Mrs. Longbottom	249	“ Have n’t you told your friends about your parents , Neville ? ”
36574	36585	36587	36588	Mrs. Longbottom	249	“ Well , it ’s nothing to be ashamed of ! ”
36591	36623	36587	36588	Mrs. Longbottom	249	“ You should be proud , Neville , proud ! They did n’t give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them , you know ! ”
36624	36630	36632	36632	Neville	161	“ I ’m not ashamed , ”
36663	36676	36678	36679	Mrs. Longbottom	249	“ Well , you ’ve got a funny way of showing it ! ”
36681	36688	36689	36689	she	249	“ My son and his wife , ”
36704	36718	36689	36689	she	249	“ were tortured into insanity by You - Know - Who ’s followers . ”
36747	36764	36765	36766	Mrs. Longbottom	249	“ They were Aurors , you know , and very well respected within the Wizarding community , ”
36770	36790	36765	36766	Mrs. Longbottom	249	“ Highly gifted , the pair of them . I — yes , Alice dear , what is it ? ”
36892	36895	36897	36898	Mrs. Longbottom	249	“ Again ? ”
36904	36923	36897	36898	Mrs. Longbottom	249	“ Very well , Alice dear , very well — Neville , take it , whatever it is ... ”
36946	36952	36954	36954	Neville	161	“ Very nice , dear , ”
36975	36979	36971	36971	Neville	161	“ Thanks Mum . ”
37028	37037	37039	37040	Mrs. Longbottom	249	“ Well , we ’d better get back , ”
37048	37081	37039	37040	Mrs. Longbottom	249	“ Very nice to have met you all . Neville , put that wrapper in the bin , she must have given you enough of them to paper your bedroom by now ... ”
37106	37111	37113	37113	Hermione	114	“ I never knew , ”
37119	37124	37126	37126	Ron	113	“ Nor did I , ”
37130	37134	37136	37136	Ginny	182	“ Nor me , ”
37144	37148	37149	37149	he	112	“ I did , ”
37153	37191	37149	37149	he	112	“ Dumbledore told me but I promised I would n’t mention it ... that ’s what Bellatrix Lestrange got sent to Azkaban for , using the Cruciatus Curse on Neville ’s parents until they lost their minds . ”
37192	37198	37200	37200	Hermione	114	“ Bellatrix Lestrange did that ? ”
37204	37217	37200	37200	Hermione	114	“ That woman Kreacher ’s got a photo of in his den ? ”
37231	37248	37226	37226	Lockhart	244	“ Look , I did n’t learn joined - up writing for nothing , you know ! ”
37403	37409	37400	37401	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ fits of the sullens , ”
37623	37627	37633	37633	her	175	“ Harry dear , ”
37660	37678	37658	37658	Crookshanks	254	“ could you come down to the kitchen ? Professor Snape would like a word with you . ”
37714	37740	37685	37685	she	175	“ Squash him — squash him , he ’s only a pawn , you idiot — sorry , Mrs. Weasley , what did you say ? ”
37741	37757	37707	37707	he	112	“ Professor Snape , dear . In the kitchen . He ’d like a word . ”
37824	37827	37829	37829	Harry	112	“ Snape ? ”
37832	37838	37840	37841	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ Professor Snape , dear , ”
37844	37859	37840	37841	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ Now come on , quickly , he says he ca n’t stay long . ”
37860	37868	37870	37870	Ron	113	“ What ’s he want with you ? ”
37882	37892	37875	37876	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ You have n’t done anything , have you ? ”
37893	37896	37898	37898	Harry	112	“ No ! ”
37983	37986	37988	37988	Harry	112	“ Er , ”
38010	38016	37994	37994	Snape	255	“ Sit down , Potter . ”
38017	38021	38023	38023	Sirius	142	“ You know , ”
38039	38064	38023	38023	Sirius	142	“ I think I ’d prefer it if you did n’t give orders here , Snape . It ’s my house , you see . ”
38089	38100	38102	38102	Snape	255	“ I was supposed to see you alone , Potter , ”
38111	38115	38102	38102	Snape	255	“ but Black — ”
38116	38122	38124	38124	Sirius	142	“ I ’m his godfather , ”
38130	38139	38141	38141	Snape	255	“ I am here on Dumbledore ’s orders , ”
38157	38175	38141	38141	Snape	255	“ but by all means stay , Black , I know you like to feel ... involved . ”
38176	38184	38186	38186	Sirius	142	“ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
38202	38225	38226	38226	Snape	255	“ Merely that I am sure you must feel — ah — frustrated by the fact that you can do nothing useful , ”
38235	38240	38226	38226	Snape	255	“ for the Order . ”
38261	38286	38256	38256	he	255	“ The headmaster has sent me to tell you , Potter , that it is his wish for you to study Occlumency this term . ”
38287	38291	38293	38293	Harry	112	“ Study what ? ”
38303	38330	38296	38296	Snape	255	“ Occlumency , Potter . The magical defense of the mind against external penetration . An obscure branch of magic , but a highly useful one . ”
38360	38371	38372	38372	he	112	“ Why do I have to study Occlu — thing ? ”
38376	38386	38388	38388	Snape	255	“ Because the headmaster thinks it a good idea , ”
38391	38421	38388	38388	Snape	255	“ You will receive private lessons once a week , but you will not tell anybody what you are doing , least of all Dolores Umbridge . You understand ? ”
38422	38425	38427	38427	Harry	112	“ Yes , ”
38429	38438	38427	38427	Harry	112	“ Who ’s going to be teaching me ? ”
38444	38448	38449	38449	he	255	“ I am , ”
38487	38495	38497	38497	Sirius	142	“ Why ca n’t Dumbledore teach Harry ? ”
38500	38504	38497	38497	Sirius	142	“ Why you ? ”
38505	38521	38523	38523	Snape	255	“ I suppose because it is a headmaster ’s privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks , ”
38526	38538	38523	38523	Snape	255	“ I assure you I did not beg for the job . ”
38545	38586	38539	38539	He	255	“ I will expect you at six o’clock on Monday evening , Potter . My office . If anybody asks , you are taking Remedial Potions . Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them . ”
38600	38605	38607	38607	Sirius	142	“ Wait a moment , ”
38625	38646	38616	38616	Snape	255	“ I am in rather a hurry , Black ... unlike you , I do not have unlimited leisure time ... ”
38647	38657	38659	38659	Sirius	142	“ I ’ll get to the point , then , ”
38697	38722	38677	38677	his	255	“ If I hear you ’re using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard time , you ’ll have me to answer to . ”
38723	38727	38728	38728	Snape	255	“ How touching , ”
38731	38745	38728	38728	Snape	255	“ But surely you have noticed that Potter is very like his father ? ”
38746	38752	38754	38754	Sirius	142	“ Yes , I have , ”
38757	38775	38776	38776	Snape	255	“ Well then , you ’ll know he ’s so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him , ”
38836	38839	38841	38841	Harry	112	“ Sirius ! ”
38852	38860	38862	38862	Sirius	142	“ I ’ve warned you , Snivellus , ”
38873	38889	38862	38862	Sirius	142	“ I do n’t care if Dumbledore thinks you ’ve reformed , I know better — ”
38890	38902	38904	38904	Snape	255	“ Oh , but why do n’t you tell him so ? ”
38906	38935	38904	38904	Snape	255	“ Or are you afraid he might not take the advice of a man who has been hiding inside his mother ’s house for six months very seriously ? ”
38936	38963	38862	38862	Sirius	142	“ Tell me , how is Lucius Malfoy these days ? I expect he ’s delighted his lapdog ’s working at Hogwarts , is n’t he ? ”
38964	38969	38971	38971	Snape	255	“ Speaking of dogs , ”
38974	39027	38971	38971	Snape	255	“ did you know that Lucius Malfoy recognized you last time you risked a little jaunt outside ? Clever idea , Black , getting yourself seen on a safe station platform ... gave you a cast - iron excuse not to leave your hidey - hole in future , did n’t it ? ”
39033	39036	39037	39037	Harry	112	“ NO ! ”
39052	39058	39037	39037	Harry	112	“ Sirius , do n’t — ”
39059	39067	39069	39069	Sirius	142	“ Are you calling me a coward ? ”
39086	39096	39098	39098	Snape	255	“ Why , yes , I suppose I am , ”
39100	39111	39113	39113	Sirius	142	“ Harry — get — out — of — it ! ”
39167	39170	39171	39171	he	201	“ Cured ! ”
39180	39184	39171	39171	he	201	“ Completely cured ! ”
39252	39257	39266	39266	his	201	“ Merlin ’s beard , ”
39269	39276	39266	39266	his	201	“ what ’s going on here ? ”
39342	39350	39338	39338	he	255	“ Six o’clock Monday evening , Potter . ”
39366	39374	39376	39377	Mr. Weasley	201	“ But what ’s been going on ? ”
39380	39385	39387	39387	Sirius	142	“ Nothing , Arthur , ”
39403	39415	39387	39387	Sirius	142	“ Just a friendly little chat between two old school friends ... ”
39427	39442	39424	39424	he	142	“ So ... you ’re cured ? That ’s great news , really great ... ”
39443	39450	39452	39453	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ Yes , is n’t it ? ”
39463	39504	39505	39505	she	175	“ Healer Smethwyck worked his magic in the end , found an antidote to whatever that snake ’s got in its fangs , and Arthur ’s learned his lesson about dabbling in Muggle medicine , have n’t you , dear ? ”
39511	39517	39519	39520	Mr. Weasley	201	“ Yes , Molly dear , ”
39713	39725	39727	39727	Hermione	114	“ Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort , ”
39731	39748	39727	39727	Hermione	114	“ Well , you wo n’t be sorry not to have them anymore , will you ? ”
39749	39755	39757	39757	Ron	113	“ Extra lessons with Snape ? ”
39762	39770	39757	39757	Ron	113	“ I ’d rather have the nightmares ! ”
39965	39973	39974	39974	he	142	“ I want you to take this , ”
39995	40000	40001	40001	Harry	112	“ What is it ? ”
40004	40029	40031	40031	Sirius	142	“ A way of letting me know if Snape ’s giving you a hard time . No , do n’t open it in here ! ”
40055	40077	40038	40039	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ I doubt Molly would approve — but I want you to use it if you need me , all right ? ”
40078	40081	40083	40083	Harry	112	“ Okay , ”
40138	40145	40147	40147	Sirius	142	“ Let ’s go , then , ”
40185	40195	40197	40198	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ Good - bye , Harry , take care , ”
40203	40218	40220	40221	Mr. Weasley	201	“ See you Harry , and keep an eye out for snakes for me ! ”
40228	40233	40235	40235	Harry	112	“ Right — yeah , ”
40288	40295	40284	40284	He	142	“ Look after yourself , Harry , ”
40392	40406	40408	40408	Tonks	220	“ Come on , the quicker we get on the bus the better , ”
40488	40493	40467	40479	A thin , pimply , jug - eared youth in a purple uniform	1028	“ Welcome to the — ”
40494	40505	40507	40507	Tonks	220	“ Yes , yes , we know , thank you , ”
40510	40518	40507	40507	Tonks	220	“ On , on , get on — ”
40540	40550	40520	40520	she	220	“ ’ Ere — it ’s ’ Arry — ! ”
40551	40564	40566	40566	Tonks	220	“ If you shout his name I will curse you into oblivion , ”
40576	40587	40589	40589	Ron	113	“ I ’ve always wanted to go on this thing , ”
40708	40718	40720	40720	Tonks	220	“ Looks like we ’ll have to split up , ”
40729	40753	40720	40720	Tonks	220	“ Fred , George , and Ginny , if you just take those seats at the back ... Remus can stay with you ... ”
40944	40949	40951	40951	Stan	258	“ Just outside Birmingham , ”
40967	41031	40960	40960	Ron	113	“ You keepin ’ well , then , ’ Arry ? I seen your name in the paper loads over the summer , but it were n’t never nuffink very nice ... I said to Ern , I said , ‘ ’ e did n’t seem like a nutter when we met ’ i m , just goes to show , dunnit ? ’ ”
41194	41201	41203	41203	Ron	113	“ I ’ve changed my mind , ”
41216	41226	41203	41203	Ron	113	“ I never want to ride on here again . ”
41227	41238	41240	41240	Stan	258	“ Listen , it ’s ’ Ogwarts stop after this , ”
41247	41287	41240	41240	Stan	258	“ That bossy woman up front ’ oo got on with you , she ’s given us a little tip to move you up the queue . We ’re just gon na let Madam Marsh off first , though — ”
41302	41311	41240	41240	Stan	258	“ She ’s not feeling ’ er best . ”
41488	41500	41502	41502	Tonks	220	“ You ’ll be safe once you ’re in the grounds , ”
41514	41522	41502	41502	Tonks	220	“ Have a good term , okay ? ”
41523	41528	41530	41530	Lupin	238	“ Look after yourselves , ”
41541	41545	41546	41546	He	238	“ And listen ... ”
41565	41604	41546	41546	He	238	“ Harry , I know you do n’t like Snape , but he is a superb Occlumens and we all — Sirius included — want you to learn to protect yourself , so work hard , all right ? ”
41605	41611	41613	41613	Harry	112	“ Yeah , all right , ”
41625	41631	41613	41613	Harry	112	“ See you , then ... ”
41766	41778	41779	41779	Harry	112	“ I ’ll let you know when the next one is , ”
41786	41807	41779	41779	Harry	112	“ but I ca n’t do it tonight , I ’ve got to go to — er — Remedial Potions ... ”
41808	41814	41816	41817	Zacharias Smith	186	“ You take Remedial Potions ? ”
41830	41850	41816	41817	Zacharias Smith	186	“ Good Lord , you must be terrible , Snape does n’t usually give extra lessons , does he ? ”
41866	41880	41881	41881	he	113	“ Shall I jinx him ? I can still get him from here , ”
41896	41900	41902	41902	Harry	112	“ Forget it , ”
41905	41925	41902	41902	Harry	112	“ It ’s what everyone ’s going to think , is n’t it ? That I ’m really stup — ”
41926	41931	41938	41938	He	112	“ Hi , Harry , ”
41947	41950	41952	41952	Harry	112	“ Oh , ”
41959	41962	41952	41952	Harry	112	“ Hi . ”
41963	41973	41979	41979	she	114	“ We ’ll be in the library , Harry , ”
41994	42000	42002	42002	Cho	187	“ Had a good Christmas ? ”
42004	42010	42012	42012	Harry	112	“ Yeah , not bad , ”
42014	42020	42022	42022	Cho	187	“ Mine was pretty quiet , ”
42034	42051	42028	42028	she	187	“ Erm ... there ’s another Hogsmeade trip next month , did you see the notice ? ”
42052	42070	42028	42028	she	187	“ What ? Oh no , I have n’t checked the notice board since I got back ... ”
42071	42081	42028	42028	she	187	“ Yes , it ’s on Valentine ’s Day ... ”
42082	42085	42087	42087	Harry	112	“ Right , ”
42097	42107	42091	42091	she	187	“ Well , I suppose you want to — ? ”
42108	42114	42115	42115	she	187	“ Only if you do , ”
42128	42142	42122	42122	He	112	“ I suppose you want to know when the next D.A. meeting is ? ”
42152	42157	42158	42158	he	112	“ I — er — ”
42161	42172	42173	42173	she	187	“ Oh , it ’s okay if you do n’t , ”
42179	42191	42173	42173	she	187	“ Do n’t worry . I - I’ll see you around . ”
42213	42220	42224	42224	her	187	“ Cho ! Hey — CHO ! ”
42234	42250	42221	42221	He	112	“ Er — d’you want to come into Hogsmeade with me on Valentine ’s Day ? ”
42251	42256	42257	42257	she	187	“ Oooh , yes ! ”
42267	42277	42279	42279	Harry	112	“ Right ... well ... that ’s settled then , ”
42500	42509	42490	42490	Snape	255	“ Shut the door behind you , Potter . ”
42581	42593	42594	42594	he	255	“ Well , Potter , you know why you are here , ”
42597	42622	42594	42594	he	255	“ The headmaster has asked me to teach you Occlumency . I can only hope that you prove more adept at it than Potions . ”
42623	42626	42628	42628	Harry	112	“ Right , ”
42631	42642	42644	42644	Snape	255	“ This may not be an ordinary class , Potter , ”
42651	42675	42646	42646	his	255	“ but I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me ‘ sir ’ or ‘ Professor ’ at all times . ”
42676	42681	42683	42683	Harry	112	“ Yes ... sir , ”
42685	42715	42646	42646	his	255	“ Now , Occlumency . As I told you back in your dear godfather ’s kitchen , this branch of magic seals the mind against magical intrusion and influence . ”
42716	42729	42731	42731	Harry	112	“ And why does Professor Dumbledore think I need it , sir ? ”
42762	42785	42749	42749	Snape	255	“ Surely even you could have worked that out by now , Potter ? The Dark Lord is highly skilled at Legilimency — ”
42786	42793	42837	42837	Snape	255	“ What ’s that ? Sir ? ”
42794	42810	42749	42749	Snape	255	“ It is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another person ’s mind — ”
42811	42817	42819	42819	Harry	112	“ He can read minds ? ”
42827	42835	42837	42837	Snape	255	“ You have no subtlety , Potter , ”
42844	42868	42837	42837	Snape	255	“ You do not understand fine distinctions . It is one of the shortcomings that makes you such a lamentable potion - maker . ”
42887	42952	42953	42953	He	255	“ Only Muggles talk of ‘ mind reading . ’ The mind is not a book , to be opened at will and examined at leisure . Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls , to be perused by any invader . The mind is a complex and many - layered thing , Potter ... or at least , most minds are ... ”
42956	43037	42953	42953	He	255	“ It is true , however , that those who have mastered Legilimency are able , under certain conditions , to delve into the minds of their victims and to interpret their findings correctly . The Dark Lord , for instance , almost always knows when somebody is lying to him . Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie , and so utter falsehoods in his presence without detection . ”
43061	43075	43039	43039	Snape	255	“ So he could know what we ’re thinking right now ? Sir ? ”
43076	43114	43116	43116	Snape	255	“ The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them , ”
43118	43136	43116	43116	Snape	255	“ Time and space matter in magic , Potter . Eye contact is often essential to Legilimency . ”
43137	43149	43150	43150	Snape	255	“ Well then , why do I have to learn Occlumency ? ”
43168	43265	43150	43150	Snape	255	“ The usual rules do not seem to apply with you , Potter . The curse that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection between you and the Dark Lord . The evidence suggests that at times , when your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable — when you are asleep , for instance — you are sharing the Dark Lord ’s thoughts and emotions . The headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue . He wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark Lord . ”
43280	43291	43292	43292	he	112	“ But why does Professor Dumbledore want to stop it ? ”
43296	43346	43292	43292	he	112	“ I do n’t like it much , but it ’s been useful , has n’t it ? I mean ... I saw that snake attack Mr. Weasley and if I had n’t , Professor Dumbledore would n’t have been able to save him , would he ? Sir ? ”
43382	43436	43365	43365	he	255	“ It appears that the Dark Lord has been unaware of the connection between you and himself until very recently . Up till now it seems that you have been experiencing his emotions and sharing his thoughts without his being any the wiser . However , the vision you had shortly before Christmas — ”
43437	43447	43365	43365	he	255	“ The one with the snake and Mr. Weasley ? ”
43448	43456	43458	43458	Snape	255	“ Do not interrupt me , Potter , ”
43464	43489	43458	43458	Snape	255	“ As I was saying ... the vision you had shortly before Christmas represented such a powerful incursion upon the Dark Lord ’s thoughts — ”
43490	43502	43365	43365	he	255	“ I saw inside the snake ’s head , not his ! ”
43503	43517	43458	43458	Snape	255	“ I thought I just told you not to interrupt me , Potter ? ”
43571	43591	43542	43542	He	255	“ How come I saw through the snake ’s eyes if it ’s Voldemort ’s thoughts I ’m sharing ? ”
43592	43602	43604	43604	Snape	255	“ Do not say the Dark Lord ’s name ! ”
43621	43628	43630	43630	Harry	112	“ Professor Dumbledore says his name , ”
43633	43641	43642	43642	Snape	255	“ Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard , ”
43645	43662	43663	43663	He	255	“ While he may feel secure enough to use the name ... the rest of us ... ”
43687	43694	43695	43695	Harry	112	“ I just wanted to know , ”
43706	43709	43695	43695	Harry	112	“ why — ”
43710	43733	43735	43735	Snape	255	“ You seem to have visited the snake ’s mind because that was where the Dark Lord was at that particular moment , ”
43737	43756	43735	43735	Snape	255	“ He was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too ... ”
43757	43768	43695	43695	Harry	112	“ And Vol — he — realized I was there ? ”
43769	43774	43776	43776	Snape	255	“ It seems so , ”
43779	43785	43787	43787	Harry	112	“ How do you know ? ”
43790	43801	43787	43787	Harry	112	“ Is this just Professor Dumbledore guessing , or — ? ”
43802	43807	43809	43809	Snape	255	“ I told you , ”
43820	43828	43809	43809	Snape	255	“ to call me ‘ sir . ’ ”
43829	43834	43836	43836	Harry	112	“ Yes , sir , ”
43839	43847	43836	43836	Harry	112	“ but how do you know — ? ”
43848	43856	43858	43858	Snape	255	“ It is enough that we know , ”
43861	43920	43858	43858	Snape	255	“ The important point is that the Dark Lord is now aware that you are gaining access to his thoughts and feelings . He has also deduced that the process is likely to work in reverse ; that is to say , he has realized that he might be able to access your thoughts and feelings in return — ”
43921	43932	43934	43934	Harry	112	“ And he might try and make me do things ? ”
43936	43939	43940	43940	he	112	“ Sir ? ”
43944	43948	43950	43950	Snape	255	“ He might , ”
43957	43965	43950	43950	Snape	255	“ Which brings us back to Occlumency . ”
44114	44125	44085	44085	he	255	“ Stand up and take out your wand , Potter . ”
44144	44168	44170	44170	Snape	255	“ You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me , or defend yourself in any other way you can think of , ”
44172	44181	44182	44182	Harry	112	“ And what are you going to do ? ”
44191	44203	44205	44205	Snape	255	“ I am about to attempt to break into your mind , ”
44208	44253	44205	44205	Snape	255	“ We are going to see how well you resist . I have been told that you have already shown aptitude at resisting the Imperius Curse ... You will find that similar powers are needed for this ... Brace yourself , now ... Legilimens ! ”
44516	44526	44528	44528	Snape	255	“ Did you mean to produce a Stinging Hex ? ”
44531	44534	44536	44536	Harry	112	“ No , ”
44545	44550	44552	44552	Snape	255	“ I thought not , ”
44555	44568	44552	44552	Snape	255	“ You let me get in too far . You lost control . ”
44569	44577	44578	44578	Harry	112	“ Did you see everything I saw ? ”
44590	44595	44597	44597	Snape	255	“ Flashes of it , ”
44603	44611	44597	44597	Snape	255	“ To whom did the dog belong ? ”
44612	44617	44618	44618	Harry	112	“ My Aunt Marge , ”
44624	44642	44644	44644	Snape	255	“ Well , for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been , ”
44652	44689	44644	44644	Snape	255	“ You managed to stop me eventually , though you wasted time and energy shouting . You must remain focused . Repel me with your brain and you will not need to resort to your wand . ”
44690	44695	44697	44697	Harry	112	“ I ’m trying , ”
44700	44709	44697	44697	Harry	112	“ but you ’re not telling me how ! ”
44710	44715	44717	44717	Snape	255	“ Manners , Potter , ”
44720	44731	44717	44717	Snape	255	“ Now , I want you to close your eyes . ”
44767	44774	44776	44776	Snape	255	“ Clear your mind , Potter , ”
44781	44788	44776	44776	Snape	255	“ Let go of all emotion ... ”
44818	44839	44810	44810	He	255	“ You ’re not doing it , Potter ... You will need more discipline than this ... Focus , now ... ”
44858	44878	44840	44840	Harry	112	“ Let ’s go again ... on the count of three ... one — two — three — Legilimens ! ”
44918	44921	44904	44905	Cedric Diggory	191	“ NOOOOOOO ! ”
44952	44956	44958	44958	Snape	255	“ Get up ! ”
44961	44990	44958	44958	Snape	255	“ Get up ! You are not trying , you are making no effort , you are allowing me access to memories you fear , handing me weapons ! ”
45031	45042	45043	45043	he	255	“ I — am — making — an — effort , ”
45049	45059	45043	45043	he	255	“ I told you to empty yourself of emotion ! ”
45060	45074	45075	45075	Harry	112	“ Yeah ? Well , I ’m finding that hard at the moment , ”
45078	45091	45093	45093	Snape	255	“ Then you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord ! ”
45096	45154	45093	45093	Snape	255	“ Fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves , who can not control their emotions , who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked this easily — weak people , in other words — they stand no chance against his powers ! He will penetrate your mind with absurd ease , Potter ! ”
45155	45161	45163	45163	Harry	112	“ I am not weak , ”
45186	45194	45196	45196	Snape	255	“ Then prove it ! Master yourself ! ”
45198	45219	45196	45196	Snape	255	“ Control your anger , discipline your mind ! We shall try again ! Get ready , now ! Legilimens ! ”
45296	45303	45280	45281	Mr. Weasley	201	“ I KNOW ! I KNOW ! ”
45373	45380	45381	45381	he	255	“ What happened then , Potter ? ”
45388	45395	45396	45396	Harry	112	“ I saw — I remembered , ”
45399	45405	45396	45396	Harry	112	“ I ’ve just realized ... ”
45406	45410	45412	45412	Snape	255	“ Realized what ? ”
45540	45549	45534	45534	He	112	“ What ’s in the Department of Mysteries ? ”
45550	45556	45557	45557	Snape	255	“ What did you say ? ”
45573	45587	45588	45588	Harry	112	“ I said , what ’s in the Department of Mysteries , sir ? ”
45591	45595	45597	45597	Snape	255	“ And why , ”
45600	45608	45597	45597	Snape	255	“ would you ask such a thing ? ”
45609	45612	45614	45614	Harry	112	“ Because , ”
45623	45662	45614	45614	Harry	112	“ that corridor I ’ve just seen — I ’ve been dreaming about it for months — I ’ve just recognized it — it leads to the Department of Mysteries ... and I think Voldemort wants something from — ”
45663	45677	45678	45678	They	1120	“ I have told you not to say the Dark Lord ’s name ! ”
45717	45749	45708	45708	he	255	“ There are many things in the Department of Mysteries , Potter , few of which you would understand and none of which concern you , do I make myself plain ? ”
45750	45753	45754	45754	Harry	112	“ Yes , ”
45769	45787	45708	45708	he	255	“ I want you back here same time on Wednesday , and we will continue work then . ”
45788	45791	45793	45793	Harry	112	“ Fine , ”
45811	45838	45708	45708	he	255	“ You are to rid your mind of all emotion every night before sleep — empty it , make it blank and calm , you understand ? ”
45839	45842	45844	45844	Harry	112	“ Yes , ”
45851	45867	45708	45708	he	255	“ And be warned , Potter ... I shall know if you have not practiced ... ”
45868	45871	45872	45872	Harry	112	“ Right , ”
46099	46105	46106	46106	Hermione	114	“ How did it go ? ”
46115	46123	46106	46106	Hermione	114	“ Are you all right , Harry ? ”
46124	46132	46134	46134	Harry	112	“ Yeah ... fine ... I dunno , ”
46146	46155	46134	46134	Harry	112	“ Listen ... I ’ve just realized something ... ”
46168	46177	46179	46179	Ron	113	“ So ... so , are you saying ... ”
46190	46212	46182	46183	Madam Pince	273	“ that the weapon — the thing You - Know - Who ’s after — is in the Ministry of Magic ? ”
46213	46226	46227	46227	Harry	112	“ In the Department of Mysteries , it ’s got to be , ”
46230	46263	46227	46227	Harry	112	“ I saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms for my hearing and it ’s definitely the same one he was guarding when the snake bit him . ”
46273	46277	46278	46278	she	114	“ Of course , ”
46281	46286	46288	46288	Ron	113	“ Of course what ? ”
46292	46329	46264	46264	Hermione	114	“ Ron , think about it ... Sturgis Podmore was trying to get through a door at the Ministry of Magic ... It must have been that one , it ’s too much of a coincidence ! ”
46330	46346	46348	46348	Ron	113	“ How come Sturgis was trying to break in when he ’s on our side ? ”
46350	46358	46359	46359	Hermione	114	“ Well , I do n’t know , ”
46362	46369	46359	46359	Hermione	114	“ That is a bit odd ... ”
46370	46380	46381	46381	Harry	112	“ So what ’s in the Department of Mysteries ? ”
46385	46395	46383	46383	Ron	113	“ Has your dad ever mentioned anything about it ? ”
46396	46411	46413	46413	Ron	113	“ I know they call the people who work in there ‘ Unspeakables , ’ ”
46417	46438	46413	46413	Ron	113	“ Because no one really seems to know what they do in there ... Weird place to have a weapon ... ”
46439	46452	46454	46454	Hermione	114	“ It ’s not weird at all , it makes perfect sense , ”
46456	46483	46454	46454	Hermione	114	“ It will be something top secret that the Ministry has been developing , I expect ... Harry , are you sure you ’re all right ? ”
46503	46508	46509	46509	he	112	“ Yeah ... fine ... ”
46520	46534	46509	46509	he	112	“ I just feel a bit ... I do n’t like Occlumency much ... ”
46535	46554	46556	46556	Hermione	114	“ I expect anyone would feel shaky if they ’d had their mind attacked over and over again , ”
46559	46580	46556	46556	Hermione	114	“ Look , let ’s get back to the common room , we ’ll be a bit more comfortable there ... ”
46609	46613	46615	46615	George	150	“ Headless Hats ! ”
46634	46644	46618	46618	Fred	149	“ Two Galleons each — watch Fred , now ! ”
46683	46688	46690	46690	George	150	“ And off again ! ”
46727	46736	46738	46738	Hermione	114	“ How do those hats work , then ? ”
46750	46797	46738	46738	Hermione	114	“ I mean , obviously it ’s some kind of Invisibility Spell , but it ’s rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object ... I ’d imagine the charm would n’t have a very long life though ... ”
46809	46820	46821	46821	he	112	“ I ’m going to have to do this tomorrow , ”
46839	46850	46852	46852	Hermione	114	“ Well , write it in your homework planner then ! ”
46855	46862	46852	46852	Hermione	114	“ So you do n’t forget ! ”
46883	46897	46902	46902	Harry	112	“ Do n’t leave it till later , you big second - rater ! ”
46914	46923	46925	46925	Harry	112	“ I think I ’ll go to bed , ”
47120	47125	47126	47126	Someone	3263	“ Harry ? HARRY ! ”
47224	47228	47229	47229	he	113	“ What happened ? ”
47232	47237	47238	47238	Harry	112	“ I ... dunno ... ”
47245	47254	47238	47238	Harry	112	“ He ’s really happy ... really happy ... ”
47255	47263	47229	47229	he	113	“ You - Know - Who is ? ”
47264	47270	47272	47272	Harry	112	“ Something good ’s happened , ”
47295	47303	47229	47229	he	113	“ Something he ’s been hoping for . ”
47368	47379	47381	47381	Ron	113	“ Hermione told me to come and check on you , ”
47393	47431	47381	47381	Ron	113	“ She says your defenses will be low at the moment , after Snape ’s been fiddling around with your mind ... Still , I suppose it ’ll help in the long run , wo n’t it ? ”
47571	47574	47576	47576	Harry	112	“ What ? ”
47894	47897	47899	47899	Harry	112	“ Black ? ”
47902	47906	47899	47899	Harry	112	“ Not — ? ”
47907	47910	47912	47912	Hermione	114	“ Shhh ! ”
47915	47924	47912	47912	Hermione	114	“ Not so loud — just read it ! ”
47992	48019	48021	48021	Fudge	280	“ We find ourselves , most unfortunately , in the same position we were two and a half years ago when the murderer Sirius Black escaped , ”
48025	48136	48021	48021	Fudge	280	“ Nor do we think the two breakouts are unrelated . An escape of this magnitude suggests outside help , and we must remember that Black , as the first person ever to break out of Azkaban , would be ideally placed to help others follow in his footsteps . We think it likely that these individuals , who include Black ’s cousin , Bellatrix Lestrange , have rallied around Black as their leader . We are , however , doing all we can to round up the criminals and beg the magical community to remain alert and cautious . On no account should any of these individuals be approached . ”
48137	48144	48146	48146	Ron	113	“ There you are , Harry , ”
48151	48161	48146	48146	Ron	113	“ That ’s why he was happy last night ... ”
48162	48169	48171	48171	Harry	112	“ I do n’t believe this , ”
48173	48182	48171	48171	Harry	112	“ Fudge is blaming the breakout on Sirius ? ”
48183	48191	48193	48193	Hermione	114	“ What other options does he have ? ”
48196	48262	48193	48193	Hermione	114	“ He can hardly say , ‘ Sorry everyone , Dumbledore warned me this might happen , the Azkaban guards have joined Lord Voldemort ’ — stop whimpering , Ron — ‘ and now Voldemort ’s worst supporters have broken out too . ’ I mean , he ’s spent a good six months telling everyone you and Dumbledore are liars , has n’t he ? ”
48491	48495	48497	48497	Hermione	114	“ Oh my — ”
48506	48510	48512	48512	Harry	112	“ What now ? ”
48520	48526	48528	48528	Hermione	114	“ It ’s ... horrible , ”
48662	48802	48652	48656	a spokeswizard for the hospital	1175	“ St. Mungo ’s deeply regrets the death of Mr. Bode , whose health was improving steadily prior to this tragic accident . We have strict guidelines on the decorations permitted on our wards but it appears that Healer Strout , busy over the Christmas period , overlooked the dangers of the plant on Mr. Bode ’s bedside table . As his speech and mobility improved , Healer Strout encouraged Mr. Bode to look after the plant himself , unaware that it was not an innocent Flitterbloom , but a cutting of Devil ’s Snare , which , when touched by the convalescent Mr. Bode , throttled him instantly . St. Mungo ’s is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come forward . ”
48803	48806	48808	48808	Ron	113	“ Bode ... ”
48810	48818	48808	48808	Ron	113	“ Bode . It rings a bell ... ”
48819	48824	48825	48825	Hermione	114	“ We saw him , ”
48828	48875	48825	48825	Hermione	114	“ In St. Mungo ’s , remember ? He was in the bed opposite Lockhart ’s , just lying there , staring at the ceiling . And we saw the Devil ’s Snare arrive . She — the Healer — said it was a Christmas present ... ”
48895	48921	48808	48808	Ron	113	“ How come we did n’t recognize Devil ’s Snare ... ? We ’ve seen it before ... we could ’ve stopped this from happening ... ”
48922	48940	48942	48942	Ron	113	“ Who expects Devil ’s Snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a potted plant ? ”
48945	48979	48942	48942	Ron	113	“ It ’s not our fault , whoever sent it to the bloke is to blame ! They must be a real prat , why did n’t they check what they were buying ? ”
48980	48987	48989	48989	Hermione	114	“ Oh come on , Ron ! ”
48992	49049	48989	48989	Hermione	114	“ I do n’t think anyone could put Devil ’s Snare in a pot and not realize it tries to kill whoever touches it ? This — this was murder ... A clever murder , as well ... If the plant was sent anonymously , how ’s anyone ever going to find out who did it ? ”
49095	49100	49101	49101	he	112	“ I met Bode , ”
49105	49116	49101	49101	he	112	“ I saw him at the Ministry with your dad ... ”
49123	49147	49117	49117	Ron	113	“ I ’ve heard Dad talk about him at home ! He was an Unspeakable — he worked in the Department of Mysteries ! ”
49192	49198	49200	49200	Ron	113	“ Where are you going ? ”
49204	49210	49212	49212	Hermione	114	“ To send a letter , ”
49221	49247	49212	49212	Hermione	114	“ It ... well , I do n’t know whether ... but it ’s worth trying ... and I ’m the only one who can ... ”
49248	49257	49259	49259	Ron	113	“ I hate it when she does that , ”
49282	49311	49263	49263	Harry	112	“ Would it kill her to tell us what she ’s up to for once ? It ’d take her about ten more seconds — hey , Hagrid ! ”
49369	49377	49378	49378	he	116	“ All righ ’ , you two ? ”
49395	49402	49404	49404	Harry	112	“ Are you okay , Hagrid ? ”
49415	49420	49422	49422	Hagrid	116	“ Fine , fine , ”
49449	49479	49480	49480	he	116	“ Jus ’ busy , yeh know , usual stuff — lessons ter prepare — couple o ’ salamanders got scale rot — an ’ I ’m on probation , ”
49483	49489	49491	49491	Ron	113	“ You ’re on probation ? ”
49504	49515	49516	49516	he	116	“ Sorry — I mean — you ’re on probation ? ”
49519	49522	49524	49524	Hagrid	116	“ Yeah , ”
49526	49564	49565	49565	he	116	“ ’ S’no more’n I expected , ter tell yeh the truth . Yeh migh ’ not ’ve picked up on it , bu ’ that inspection didn ’ go too well , yeh know ... anyway , ”
49569	49600	49565	49565	he	116	“ Bes ’ go an rub a bit more chili powder on them salamanders or their tails’ll be hangin ’ off ’em next . See yeh , Harry ... Ron ... ”
49914	49929	49930	49930	she	1215	“ And I do n’t know how you stand it , it ’s horrible , ”
50123	50135	50137	50137	Hermione	114	“ They obviously ca n’t talk freely in the staffroom anymore , ”
50167	50173	50157	50157	Sprout	281	“ Not with Umbridge there . ”
50174	50181	50183	50183	Ron	113	“ Reckon they know anything new ? ”
50195	50212	50214	50214	Harry	112	“ If they do , we ’re not going to hear about it , are we ? ”
50217	50229	50214	50214	Harry	112	“ Not after Decree ... What number are we on now ? ”
50346	50372	50325	50325	she	1233	“ Exploding Snap ’s got nothing to do with Defense Against the Dark Arts , Professor ! That ’s not information relating to your subject ! ”
50807	50824	50825	50825	he	116	“ If she catches yeh , it ’ll be all of our necks on the line , ”
51349	51359	51361	51361	Hermione	114	“ Maybe it ’s a bit like an illness , ”
51373	51389	51366	51366	Harry	112	“ A fever or something . It has to get worse before it gets better . ”
51390	51402	51404	51404	Harry	112	“ It ’s lessons with Snape that are making it worse , ”
51407	51429	51404	51404	Harry	112	“ I ’m getting sick of my scar hurting , and I ’m getting bored walking down that corridor every night . ”
51436	51454	51430	51430	He	112	“ I just wish the door would open , I ’m sick of standing staring at it — ”
51455	51461	51463	51463	Hermione	114	“ That ’s not funny , ”
51466	51508	51463	51463	Hermione	114	“ Dumbledore does n’t want you to have dreams about that corridor at all , or he would n’t have asked Snape to teach you Occlumency . You ’re just going to have to work a bit harder in your lessons . ”
51509	51514	51516	51516	Harry	112	“ I am working ! ”
51520	51545	51516	51516	Harry	112	“ You try it sometime , Snape trying to get inside your head , it ’s not a bundle of laughs , you know ! ”
51546	51549	51551	51551	Ron	113	“ Maybe ... ”
51554	51558	51560	51560	Hermione	114	“ Maybe what ? ”
51564	51579	51581	51581	Ron	113	“ Maybe it ’s not Harry ’s fault he ca n’t close his mind , ”
51584	51590	51592	51592	Hermione	114	“ What do you mean ? ”
51594	51607	51610	51610	Hermione	114	“ Well , maybe Snape is n’t really trying to help Harry ... ”
51626	51629	51630	51630	he	113	“ Maybe , ”
51638	51660	51630	51630	he	113	“ he ’s actually trying to open Harry ’s mind a bit wider ... make it easier for You - Know — ”
51661	51667	51669	51669	Hermione	114	“ Shut up , Ron , ”
51672	51705	51669	51669	Hermione	114	“ How many times have you suspected Snape , and when have you ever been right ? Dumbledore trusts him , he works for the Order , that ought to be enough . ”
51706	51715	51717	51717	Ron	113	“ He used to be a Death Eater , ”
51720	51733	51717	51717	Ron	113	“ And we ’ve never seen proof that he really swapped sides ... ”
51734	51739	51740	51740	Hermione	114	“ Dumbledore trusts him , ”
51743	51758	51740	51740	Hermione	114	“ And if we ca n’t trust Dumbledore , we ca n’t trust anyone . ”
51928	51940	51941	51941	she	114	“ And about time ! If it had n’t come today ... ”
51981	51986	51987	51987	she	114	“ Listen , Harry , ”
51995	52015	51987	51987	she	114	“ This is really important ... Do you think you could meet me in the Three Broomsticks around midday ? ”
52016	52022	52024	52024	Harry	112	“ Well ... I dunno , ”
52027	52051	52024	52024	Harry	112	“ Cho might be expecting me to spend the whole day with her . We never said what we were going to do . ”
52052	52062	52064	52064	Hermione	114	“ Well , bring her along if you must , ”
52067	52073	52064	52064	Hermione	114	“ But will you come ? ”
52074	52083	52024	52024	Harry	112	“ Well ... all right , but why ? ”
52084	52103	52064	52064	Hermione	114	“ I have n’t got time to tell you now , I ’ve got to answer this quickly — ”
52129	52134	52135	52135	Harry	112	“ Are you coming ? ”
52148	52200	52201	52201	He	113	“ I ca n’t come into Hogsmeade at all , Angelina wants a full day ’s training . Like it ’s going to help — we ’re the worst team I ’ve ever seen . You should see Sloper and Kirke , they ’re pathetic , even worse than I am . ”
52207	52219	52201	52201	He	113	“ I dunno why Angelina wo n’t just let me resign ... ”
52220	52237	52239	52239	Harry	112	“ It ’s because you ’re good when you ’re on form , that ’s why , ”
52427	52430	52432	52432	Cho	187	“ Hi , ”
52436	52439	52441	52441	Harry	112	“ Hi , ”
52456	52467	52453	52453	Harry	112	“ Well — er — shall we go , then ? ”
52468	52473	52453	52453	Harry	112	“ Oh — yes ... ”
52568	52578	52580	52580	Cho	187	“ You really miss it , do n’t you ? ”
52591	52594	52596	52596	Harry	112	“ Yeah , ”
52598	52602	52596	52596	Harry	112	“ I do . ”
52603	52614	52615	52615	she	187	“ Remember the first time we played against each other ? ”
52619	52622	52624	52624	Harry	112	“ Yeah , ”
52628	52634	52624	52624	Harry	112	“ You kept blocking me . ”
52635	52656	52658	52658	Cho	187	“ And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to , ”
52663	52679	52658	52658	Cho	187	“ I heard he got taken on by Pride of Portree , is that right ? ”
52680	52698	52624	52624	Harry	112	“ Nah , it was Puddlemere United , I saw him at the World Cup last year . ”
52699	52726	52658	52658	Cho	187	“ Oh , I saw you there too , remember ? We were on the same campsite . It was really good , was n’t it ? ”
52799	52804	52806	52806	Pansy	169	“ Potter and Chang ! ”
52814	52836	52806	52806	Pansy	169	“ Urgh , Chang , I do n’t think much of your taste ... At least Diggory was good - looking ! ”
52888	52897	52898	52898	Harry	112	“ So ... where d’you want to go ? ”
52930	52938	52940	52940	Cho	187	“ Oh ... I do n’t mind , ”
52944	52959	52940	52940	Cho	187	“ Um ... shall we just have a look in the shops or something ? ”

53048	53057	53059	53059	Cho	187	“ It ’s funny , is n’t it , ”
53076	53111	53059	53059	Cho	187	“ Remember when that Sirius Black escaped , and there were dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him ? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there are n’t dementors anywhere ... ”
53112	53115	53117	53117	Harry	112	“ Yeah , ”
53137	53144	53124	53125	Bellatrix Lestrange	240	“ Yeah , it is weird ... ”
53247	53257	53259	53259	Cho	187	“ Um ... d’you want to get a coffee ? ”
53271	53277	53279	53279	Harry	112	“ Yeah , all right , ”
53284	53288	53279	53279	Harry	112	“ Where — ? ”
53289	53312	53313	53313	she	187	“ Oh , there ’s a really nice place just up here , have n’t you ever been to Madam Puddifoot ’s ? ”
53367	53374	53376	53376	Cho	187	“ Cute , is n’t it ? ”
53379	53384	53386	53386	Harry	112	“ Er ... yeah , ”
53389	53401	53403	53403	Cho	187	“ Look , she ’s decorated it for Valentine ’s Day ! ”
53431	53434	53435	53435	They	1288	“ Aaah ... ”

53785	53794	53782	53782	her	187	“ You ’re meeting Hermione Granger ? Today ? ”
53795	53828	53782	53782	her	187	“ Yeah . Well , she asked me to , so I thought I would . D’you want to come with me ? She said it would n’t matter if you did . ”
53829	53840	53782	53782	her	187	“ Oh ... well ... that was nice of her . ”
54024	54033	54034	54034	she	187	“ He asked me out , you know , ”
54041	54057	54034	54034	she	187	“ A couple of weeks ago . Roger . I turned him down , though . ”
54146	54156	54158	54158	Cho	187	“ I came in here with Cedric last year , ”
54220	54248	54216	54216	she	187	“ I ’ve been meaning to ask you for ages ... Did Cedric — did he m - m - mention me at all before he died ? ”
54269	54274	54275	54275	he	295	“ Well — no — ”
54279	54317	54275	54275	he	295	“ There — there was n’t time for him to say anything . Erm ... so ... d’you ... d’you get to see a lot of Quidditch in the holidays ? You support the Tornados , right ? ”
54354	54357	54358	54358	he	295	“ Look , ”
54371	54388	54358	54358	he	295	“ let ’s not talk about Cedric right now ... Let ’s talk about something else ... ”
54402	54406	54407	54407	she	187	“ I thought , ”
54417	54461	54407	54407	she	187	“ I thought you ’d u - u - understand ! I need to talk about it ! Surely you n - need to talk about it t - too ! I mean , you saw it happen , d - didn’t you ? ”
54483	54492	54493	54493	Harry	112	“ Well — I have talked about it , ”
54499	54507	54493	54493	Harry	112	“ to Ron and Hermione , but — ”
54508	54518	54519	54519	she	187	“ Oh , you ’ll talk to Hermione Granger ! ”
54540	54582	54519	54519	she	187	“ But you wo n’t talk to me ! P - perhaps it would be best if we just ... just p - paid and you went and met up with Hermione G - Granger , like you obviously want to ! ”
54606	54609	54610	54610	he	112	“ Cho ? ”
54634	54640	54641	54641	she	187	“ Go on , leave ! ”
54650	54687	54641	54641	she	187	“ I do n’t know why you asked me out in the first place if you ’re going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me ... How many are you meeting after Hermione ? ”
54688	54695	54697	54697	Harry	112	“ It ’s not like that ! ”
54747	54756	54757	54757	she	187	“ I ’ll see you around , Harry , ”
54782	54785	54786	54786	Harry	112	“ Cho ! ”
54879	54882	54883	54883	he	112	“ Women ! ”
54901	54932	54883	54883	he	112	“ What did she want to talk about Cedric for anyway ? Why does she always want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe ? ”
55011	55016	55017	55017	he	116	“ Hi , Hagrid ! ”
55066	55075	55077	55077	Hagrid	116	“ Oh , it ’s you , Harry , ”
55079	55085	55077	55077	Hagrid	116	“ You all righ ’ ? ”
55086	55093	55095	55095	Harry	112	“ Yeah , I ’m fine , ”
55121	55128	55077	55077	Hagrid	116	“ Er — are you okay ? ”
55129	55132	55134	55134	Hagrid	116	“ Me ? ”
55136	55148	55134	55134	Hagrid	116	“ Oh yeah , I ’m grand , Harry , grand ... ”
55197	55214	55193	55193	Hagrid	116	“ In the same boat , you an ’ me , aren ’ we , Harry ? ”
55215	55218	55220	55220	Harry	112	“ Er — ”
55222	55236	55238	55238	Hagrid	116	“ Yeah ... I ’ve said it before ... Both outsiders , like , ”
55243	55254	55238	55238	Hagrid	116	“ An ’ both orphans . Yeah ... both orphans . ”
55264	55274	55275	55275	he	116	“ Makes a diff’rence , havin’ a decent family , ”
55278	55306	55275	55275	he	116	“ Me dad was decent . An ’ your mum an ’ dad were decent . If they ’d lived , life woulda bin diff’rent , eh ? ”
55307	55313	55315	55315	Harry	112	“ Yeah ... I s’pose , ”
55328	55331	55333	55333	Hagrid	116	“ Family , ”
55336	55345	55333	55333	Hagrid	116	“ Whatever yeh say , blood ’s important ... ”
55358	55361	55363	55363	Harry	112	“ Hagrid , ”
55370	55379	55363	55363	Harry	112	“ where are you getting all these injuries ? ”
55380	55383	55385	55385	Hagrid	116	“ Eh ? ”
55390	55395	55385	55385	Hagrid	116	“ Wha ’ injuries ? ”
55396	55400	55402	55402	Harry	112	“ All those ! ”
55410	55425	55427	55427	Hagrid	116	“ Oh ... tha ’s jus ’ normal bumps an ’ bruises , Harry , ”
55430	55437	55427	55427	Hagrid	116	“ I got a rough job . ”
55456	55470	55472	55472	he	116	“ I ’ll be seein ’ yeh , Harry ... Take care now ... ”
55538	55546	55547	55547	Hermione	114	“ Harry ! Harry , over here ! ”
55637	55642	55644	55644	Hermione	114	“ You ’re early ! ”
55656	55675	55644	55644	Hermione	114	“ I thought you were with Cho , I was n’t expecting you for another hour at least ! ”
55676	55679	55681	55681	Rita	270	“ Cho ? ”
55696	55700	55681	55681	Rita	270	“ A girl ? ”
55714	55730	55731	55731	Hermione	114	“ It ’s none of your business if Harry ’s been with a hundred girls , ”
55736	55746	55733	55733	Rita	270	“ So you can put that away right now . ”
55782	55789	55790	55790	Harry	112	“ What are you up to ? ”
55804	55818	55820	55820	Rita	270	“ Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived , ”
55830	55844	55845	55845	she	270	“ I suppose I ’m allowed to talk to him , am I ? ”
55850	55858	55860	55860	Hermione	114	“ Yes , I suppose you are , ”
55931	55940	55913	55913	She	270	“ Pretty girl , is she , Harry ? ”
55941	55961	55963	55963	Hermione	114	“ One more word about Harry ’s love life and the deal ’s off and that ’s a promise , ”
55966	55970	55972	55972	Rita	270	“ What deal ? ”
55984	56011	55972	55972	Rita	270	“ You have n’t mentioned a deal yet , Miss Prissy , you just told me to turn up . Oh , one of these days ... ”
56019	56039	56041	56041	Hermione	114	“ Yes , yes , one of these days you ’ll write more horrible stories about Harry and me , ”
56044	56055	56041	56041	Hermione	114	“ Find someone who cares , why do n’t you ? ”
56056	56072	56074	56074	Rita	270	“ They ’ve run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year without my help , ”
56095	56111	56074	56074	Rita	270	“ How has that made you feel , Harry ? Betrayed ? Distraught ? Misunderstood ? ”
56112	56120	56122	56122	Hermione	114	“ He feels angry , of course , ”
56130	56154	56122	56122	Hermione	114	“ Because he ’s told the Minister of Magic the truth and the Minister ’s too much of an idiot to believe him . ”
56155	56181	56183	56183	Rita	270	“ So you actually stick to it , do you , that He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named is back ? ”
56208	56235	56196	56196	her	270	“ You stand by all this garbage Dumbledore ’s been telling everybody about You - Know - Who returning and you being the sole witness — ? ”
56236	56244	56246	56246	Harry	112	“ I was n’t the sole witness , ”
56248	56265	56246	56246	Harry	112	“ There were a dozen - odd Death Eaters there as well . Want their names ? ”
56266	56272	56274	56274	Rita	270	“ I ’d love them , ”
56310	56310	56274	56274	Rita	270	”
56336	56341	56342	56342	she	270	“ But of course , ”
56354	56369	56342	56342	she	270	“ Little Miss Perfect would n’t want that story out there , would she ? ”
56370	56377	56379	56379	Hermione	114	“ As a matter of fact , ”
56382	56393	56379	56379	Hermione	114	“ that ’s exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want . ”
56412	56417	56420	56420	her	178	“ Weasley Is Our King ”
56434	56456	56457	56457	Rita	270	“ You want me to report what he says about He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named ? ”
56465	56471	56473	56473	Hermione	114	“ Yes , I do , ”
56475	56531	56532	56532	she	270	“ The true story . All the facts . Exactly as Harry reports them . He ’ll give you all the details , he ’ll tell you the names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there , he ’ll tell you what Voldemort looks like now — oh , get a grip on yourself , ”
56588	56632	56584	56584	she	270	“ The Prophet would n’t print it . In case you have n’t noticed , nobody believes his cock - and - bull story . Everyone thinks he ’s delusional . Now , if you let me write the story from that angle — ”
56633	56648	56650	56650	Hermione	114	“ We do n’t need another story about how Harry ’s lost his marbles ! ”
56653	56676	56584	56584	she	270	“ We ’ve had plenty of those already , thank you ! I want him given the opportunity to tell the truth ! ”
56677	56688	56690	56690	Rita	270	“ There ’s no market for a story like that , ”
56693	56709	56711	56711	Hermione	114	“ You mean the Prophet wo n’t print it because Fudge wo n’t let them , ”
56740	56812	56733	56733	she	270	“ All right , Fudge is leaning on the Prophet , but it comes to the same thing . They wo n’t print a story that shows Harry in a good light . Nobody wants to read it . It ’s against the public mood . This last Azkaban breakout has got people quite worried enough . People just do n’t want to believe You - Know - Who ’s back . ”
56813	56831	56833	56833	Hermione	114	“ So the Daily Prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear , does it ? ”
56853	56865	56866	56866	she	270	“ The Prophet exists to sell itself , you silly girl , ”
56870	56880	56882	56882	Luna	178	“ My dad thinks it ’s an awful paper , ”
56910	56932	56896	56896	she	178	“ He publishes important stories that he thinks the public needs to know . He does n’t care about making money . ”
56939	56952	56953	56953	she	178	“ I ’m guessing your father runs some stupid little village newsletter ? ”
56956	56980	56953	56953	she	178	“ ‘ Twenty - five Ways to Mingle with Muggles ’ and the dates of the next Bring - and - Fly Sale ? ”
56981	56984	56986	56986	Luna	178	“ No , ”
56996	57005	56986	56986	Luna	178	“ he ’s the editor of The Quibbler . ”
57021	57034	57035	57035	she	270	“ ‘ Important stories he thinks the public needs to know ’ ? ”
57039	57052	57035	57035	she	270	“ I could manure my garden with the contents of that rag . ”
57053	57073	57075	57075	Hermione	114	“ Well , this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit , is n’t it ? ”
57078	57100	57075	57075	Hermione	114	“ Luna says her father ’s quite happy to take Harry ’s interview . That ’s who ’ll be publishing it . ”
57119	57123	57124	57124	she	270	“ The Quibbler ! ”
57129	57145	57124	57124	she	270	“ You think people will take him seriously if he ’s published in The Quibbler ? ”
57146	57152	57154	57154	Hermione	114	“ Some people wo n’t , ”
57160	57214	57154	57154	Hermione	114	“ But the Daily Prophet ’s version of the Azkaban breakout had some gaping holes in it . I think a lot of people will be wondering whether there is n’t a better explanation of what happened , and if there ’s an alternative story available , even if it is published in a ”
57222	57243	57216	57216	she	270	“ in a — well , an unusual magazine — I think they might be rather keen to read it . ”
57266	57281	57282	57282	she	270	“ All right , let ’s say for a moment I ’ll do it , ”
57286	57297	57282	57282	she	270	“ What kind of fee am I going to get ? ”
57298	57313	57315	57315	Luna	178	“ I do n’t think Daddy exactly pays people to write for the magazine , ”
57318	57340	57315	57315	Luna	178	“ They do it because it ’s an honor , and , of course , to see their names in print . ”
57362	57372	57357	57357	she	270	“ I ’m supposed to do this for free ? ”
57373	57378	57380	57380	Hermione	114	“ Well , yes , ”
57390	57432	57380	57380	Hermione	114	“ Otherwise , as you very well know , I will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered Animagus . Of course , the Prophet might give you rather a lot for an insider ’s account of life in Azkaban ... ”
57462	57476	57478	57478	Rita	270	“ I do n’t suppose I ’ve got any choice , have I ? ”
57507	57513	57515	57515	Luna	178	“ Daddy will be pleased , ”
57526	57531	57533	57533	Hermione	114	“ Okay , Harry ? ”
57539	57548	57533	57533	Hermione	114	“ Ready to tell the public the truth ? ”
57549	57553	57555	57555	Harry	112	“ I suppose , ”
57574	57582	57584	57584	Hermione	114	“ Fire away , then , Rita , ”
57637	57663	57665	57665	Luna	178	“ And , of course , that ’ll be a very important story , so Harry ’s might have to wait for the following issue , ”
57792	57806	57808	57808	Dean	189	“ Ca n’t wait to see what Umbridge thinks of you going public , ”
57844	57855	57857	57857	Neville	161	“ It ’s the right thing to do , Harry , ”
57878	57893	57865	57865	He	161	“ It must have been ... tough ... talking about it ... Was it ? ”
57894	57897	57899	57899	Harry	112	“ Yeah , ”
57901	57918	57899	57899	Harry	112	“ but people have got to know what Voldemort ’s capable of , have n’t they ? ”
57919	57924	57926	57926	Neville	161	“ That ’s right , ”
57930	57941	57926	57926	Neville	161	“ and his Death Eaters too ... People should know ... ”
58049	58058	58060	58060	Hermione	114	“ Oh , I forgot to ask you , ”
58070	58087	58060	58060	Hermione	114	“ what happened on your date with Cho ? How come you were back so early ? ”
58088	58096	58098	58098	Harry	112	“ Er ... well , it was ... ”
58114	58124	58098	58098	Harry	112	“ a complete fiasco , now you mention it . ”
58139	58144	58145	58145	he	112	“ ... so then , ”
58159	58185	58186	58186	He	112	“ she jumps up , right , and says ‘ I ’ll see you around , Harry , ’ and runs out of the place ! ”
58196	58211	58186	58186	He	112	“ I mean , what was all that about ? What was going on ? ”
58225	58230	58231	58231	she	114	“ Oh , Harry , ”
58235	58249	58231	58231	she	114	“ Well , I ’m sorry , but you were a bit tactless . ”
58250	58255	58257	58257	Harry	112	“ Me , tactless ? ”
58261	58307	58257	58257	Harry	112	“ One minute we were getting on fine , next minute she was telling me that Roger Davies asked her out , and how she used to go and snog Cedric in that stupid tea shop — how was I supposed to feel about that ? ”
58308	58314	58316	58316	Hermione	114	“ Well , you see , ”
58336	58354	58316	58316	Hermione	114	“ you should n’t have told her that you wanted to meet me halfway through your date . ”
58355	58360	58362	58362	Harry	112	“ But , but , ”
58364	58393	58362	58362	Harry	112	“ but — you told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along , how was I supposed to do that without telling her — ? ”
58394	58402	58404	58404	Hermione	114	“ You should have told her differently , ”
58413	58508	58509	58509	Hermione	114	“ You should have said it was really annoying , but I ’d made you promise to come along to the Three Broomsticks , and you really did n’t want to go , you ’d much rather spend the whole day with her , but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please , please come along with you , and hopefully you ’d be able to get away more quickly ? And it might have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think I am too , ”
58515	58525	58527	58527	Harry	112	“ But I do n’t think you ’re ugly , ”
58534	58551	58552	58552	she	114	“ Harry , you ’re worse than Ron ... Well , no , you ’re not , ”
58570	58609	58556	58556	Ron	113	“ Look — you upset Cho when you said you were going to meet me , so she tried to make you jealous . It was her way of trying to find out how much you liked her . ”
58610	58618	58620	58620	Harry	112	“ Is that what she was doing ? ”
58638	58661	58622	58622	Ron	113	“ Well , would n’t it have been easier if she ’d just asked me whether I liked her better than you ? ”
58662	58672	58674	58674	Hermione	114	“ Girls do n’t often ask questions like that , ”
58676	58682	58684	58684	Harry	112	“ Well , they should ! ”
58687	58716	58684	58684	Harry	112	“ Then I could ’ve just told her I fancy her , and she would n’t have had to get herself all worked up again about Cedric dying ! ”
58717	58728	58730	58730	Hermione	114	“ I ’m not saying what she did was sensible , ”
58747	58764	58733	58733	Ginny	182	“ I ’m just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the time . ”
58765	58772	58773	58773	Ron	113	“ You should write a book , ”
58783	58795	58777	58777	he	113	“ translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them . ”
58796	58799	58801	58801	Harry	112	“ Yeah , ”
58841	58849	58837	58837	Ron	113	“ So , how was Quidditch practice ? ”
58850	58856	58858	58858	Ron	113	“ It was a nightmare , ”
58864	58869	58871	58871	Hermione	114	“ Oh come on , ”
58877	58886	58871	58871	Hermione	114	“ I ’m sure it was n’t that — ”
58887	58893	58895	58895	Ginny	182	“ Yes , it was , ”
58897	58913	58895	58895	Ginny	182	“ It was appalling . Angelina was nearly in tears by the end of it . ”
58963	58970	58972	58972	Fred	149	“ Ron and Ginny not here ? ”
58993	59016	58990	58990	he	112	“ Good . We were watching their practice . They ’re going to be slaughtered . They ’re complete rubbish without us . ”
59017	59026	59028	59028	George	150	“ Come on , Ginny ’s not bad , ”
59037	59058	59028	59028	George	150	“ Actually , I dunno how she got so good , seeing how we never let her play with us ... ”
59059	59091	59093	59093	Hermione	114	“ She ’s been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you were n’t looking , ”
59104	59107	59109	59109	George	150	“ Oh , ”
59115	59123	59109	59109	George	150	“ Well — that ’d explain it . ”
59124	59132	59134	59134	Hermione	114	“ Has Ron saved a goal yet ? ”
59146	59163	59165	59165	Fred	149	“ Well , he can do it if he does n’t think anyone ’s watching him , ”
59171	59201	59165	59165	Fred	149	“ So all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn their backs and talk among themselves every time the Quaffle goes up his end on Saturday . ”
59220	59237	59202	59202	He	149	“ You know , Quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth staying for . ”
59245	59252	59238	59238	Hermione	114	“ You ’ve got exams coming ! ”
59253	59265	59267	59267	Fred	149	“ Told you already , we ’re not fussed about N.E.W.T.s , ”
59269	59305	59267	59267	Fred	149	“ The Snackboxes are ready to roll , we found out how to get rid of those boils , just a couple of drops of murtlap essence sorts them , Lee put us onto it ... ”
59319	59343	59306	59306	George	150	“ I dunno if I even want to watch this match . If Zacharias Smith beats us I might have to kill myself . ”
59344	59351	59353	59353	Fred	149	“ Kill him , more like , ”
59356	59364	59366	59366	Hermione	114	“ That ’s the trouble with Quidditch , ”
59377	59390	59366	59366	Hermione	114	“ it creates all this bad feeling and tension between the Houses . ”
59424	59430	59431	59431	she	114	“ Well , it does ! ”
59435	59446	59431	59431	she	114	“ It ’s only a game , is n’t it ? ”
59447	59450	59452	59452	Harry	112	“ Hermione , ”
59458	59476	59452	59452	Harry	112	“ you ’re good on feelings and stuff , but you just do n’t understand about Quidditch . ”
59477	59481	59482	59482	she	114	“ Maybe not , ”
59492	59507	59482	59482	she	114	“ but at least my happiness does n’t depend on Ron ’s goalkeeping ability . ”
59683	59687	59688	59688	Harry	112	“ Good catch , ”
59709	59714	59715	59715	she	182	“ I was lucky , ”
59718	59755	59715	59715	she	182	“ It was n’t a very fast Snitch and Summerby ’s got a cold , he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong moment . Anyway , once you ’re back on the team — ”
59756	59766	59783	59783	him	112	“ Ginny , I ’ve got a lifelong ban . ”
59767	59780	59781	59781	Ginny	182	“ You ’re banned as long as Umbridge is in the school , ”
59785	59825	59781	59781	Ginny	182	“ There ’s a difference . Anyway , once you ’re back , I think I ’ll try out for Chaser . Angelina and Alicia are both leaving next year and I prefer goal - scoring to Seeking anyway . ”
59853	59862	59863	59863	Ginny	182	“ Angelina still wo n’t let him resign , ”
59873	59885	59863	59863	Ginny	182	“ She says she knows he ’s got it in him . ”
59926	59931	59916	59916	Ron	113	“ Weasley Is Our King ”
59956	59973	59975	59975	Fred	149	“ I have n’t got the heart to take the mickey out of him , even , ”
59985	59995	59975	59975	Fred	149	“ Mind you ... when he missed the fourteenth ... ”
60012	60024	59996	59996	He	113	“ Well , I ’ll save it for parties , eh ? ”
60746	60752	60753	60753	he	112	“ Who ’re you after ? ”
60835	60841	60842	60842	Ron	113	“ What ’s going on ? ”
60876	60879	60885	60885	her	114	“ Harry ! ”
60904	60918	60885	60885	her	114	“ I think I know what this means — open this one first ! ”
60968	60977	60979	60979	Luna	178	“ It ’s good , is n’t it ? ”
61001	61022	61023	61023	she	114	“ It came out yesterday , I asked Dad to send you a free copy . I expect all these , ”
61042	61048	61023	61023	she	114	“ are letters from readers . ”
61049	61056	61058	61058	Hermione	114	“ That ’s what I thought , ”
61061	61070	61058	61058	Hermione	114	“ Harry , d’you mind if we — ? ”
61071	61075	61077	61077	Harry	112	“ Help yourself , ”
61092	61107	61109	61109	Ron	113	“ This one ’s from a bloke who thinks you ’re off your rocker , ”
61116	61120	61109	61109	Ron	113	“ Ah well ... ”
61121	61138	61140	61140	Hermione	114	“ This woman recommends you try a good course of Shock Spells at St. Mungo ’s , ”
61150	61158	61160	61160	Harry	112	“ This one looks okay , though , ”
61173	61182	61160	61160	Harry	112	“ Hey , she says she believes me ! ”
61183	61191	61193	61193	Fred	149	“ This one ’s in two minds , ”
61206	61251	61193	61193	Fred	149	“ Says you do n’t come across as a mad person , but he really does n’t want to believe You - Know - Who ’s back so he does n’t know what to think now ... Blimey , what a waste of parchment ... ”
61252	61263	61265	61265	Hermione	114	“ Here ’s another one you ’ve convinced , Harry ! ”
61268	61332	61265	61265	Hermione	114	“ ‘ Having read your side of the story I am forced to the conclusion that the Daily Prophet has treated you very unfairly ... Little though I want to think that He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named has returned , I am forced to accept that you are telling the truth ... ’ Oh this is wonderful ! ”
61333	61342	61344	61344	Ron	113	“ Another one who thinks you ’re barking , ”
61354	61385	61344	61344	Ron	113	“ but this one says you ’ve got her converted , and she now thinks you ’re a real hero — she ’s put in a photograph too — wow — ”
61386	61393	61395	61400	a falsely sweet , girlish voice	1369	“ What is going on here ? ”
61453	61465	61466	61466	she	144	“ Why have you got all these letters , Mr. Potter ? ”
61470	61477	61479	61479	Fred	149	“ Is that a crime now ? ”
61482	61486	61479	61479	Fred	149	“ Getting mail ? ”
61487	61504	61506	61506	Umbridge	144	“ Be careful , Mr. Weasley , or I shall have to put you in detention , ”
61508	61514	61506	61506	Umbridge	144	“ Well , Mr. Potter ? ”
61553	61565	61567	61567	Harry	112	“ People have written to me because I gave an interview , ”
61569	61578	61567	61567	Harry	112	“ About what happened to me last June . ”
61625	61629	61633	61633	her	144	“ An interview ? ”
61641	61647	61633	61633	her	144	“ What do you mean ? ”
61648	61661	61663	61663	Harry	112	“ I mean a reporter asked me questions and I answered them , ”
61665	61668	61663	61663	Harry	112	“ Here — ”
61702	61709	61710	61710	she	144	“ When did you do this ? ”
61718	61723	61725	61725	Harry	112	“ Last Hogsmeade weekend , ”
61745	61759	61760	61760	she	144	“ There will be no more Hogsmeade trips for you , Mr. Potter , ”
61763	61772	61760	61760	she	144	“ How you dare ... how you could ... ”
61779	61817	61773	61773	She	144	“ I have tried again and again to teach you not to tell lies . The message , apparently , has still not sunk in . Fifty points from Gryffindor and another week ’s worth of detentions . ”
61921	61930	61931	61931	Harry	112	“ What exactly are you so happy about ? ”
61935	61944	61945	61945	Hermione	114	“ Oh Harry , do n’t you see ? ”
61948	61977	61945	61945	Hermione	114	“ If she could have done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this school will read your interview , it was banning it ! ”
62078	62101	62102	62102	Hermione	114	“ And then they spotted me , and obviously they know I know you , so they were bombarding me with questions , ”
62110	62133	62106	62106	her	114	“ and Harry , I think they believe you , I really do , I think you ’ve finally got them convinced ! ”
62294	62297	62276	62277	Professor Flitwick	132	“ Shh ! ”
62397	62416	62390	62390	she	309	“ I ’m really , really sorry . That interview was so brave ... it made me cry . ”
62487	62494	62495	62495	he	199	“ I just wanted to say , ”
62505	62523	62495	62495	he	199	“ I believe you . And I ’ve sent a copy of that magazine to me mam . ”
62630	62637	62639	62639	Hermione	114	“ And the best bit is , ”
62647	62665	62639	62639	Hermione	114	“ they ca n’t contradict you , because they ca n’t admit they ’ve read the article ! ”
62688	62693	62694	62694	she	114	“ Dad ’s reprinting ! ”
62703	62726	62694	62694	she	114	“ He ca n’t believe it , he says people seem even more interested in this than the Crumple - Horned Snorkacks ! ”
62779	62784	62765	62765	Harry	112	“ The Ministry are morons ”
62786	62791	62765	62765	Harry	112	“ Eat dung , Umbridge ”
62861	62863	62824	62824	Harry	112	“ Dung ”
62865	62867	62824	62824	Harry	112	“ Umbridge ”
63091	63101	63103	63103	Harry	112	“ I have been badly advised , it seems , ”
63116	63124	63126	63131	the man kneeling on the floor	1406	“ Master , I crave your pardon ... ”
63149	63158	63160	63160	Harry	112	“ I do not blame you , Rookwood , ”
63209	63219	63221	63221	Harry	112	“ You are sure of your facts , Rookwood ? ”
63223	63243	63190	63190	he	112	“ Yes , my Lord , yes ... I used to work in the department after — after all ... ”
63244	63256	63190	63190	he	112	“ Avery told me Bode would be able to remove it . ”
63257	63289	63190	63190	he	112	“ Bode could never have taken it , Master ... Bode would have known he could not ... Undoubtedly that is why he fought so hard against Malfoy ’s Imperius Curse ... ”
63290	63296	63298	63298	Harry	112	“ Stand up , Rookwood , ”
63353	63363	63365	63365	Harry	112	“ You have done well to tell me this , ”
63367	63402	63365	63365	Harry	112	“ Very well ... I have wasted months on fruitless schemes , it seems ... But no matter ... We begin again , from now . You have Lord Voldemort ’s gratitude , Rookwood ... ”
63403	63412	63414	63414	Rookwood	277	“ My Lord ... yes , my Lord , ”
63422	63440	63365	63365	Harry	112	“ I shall need your help . I shall need all the information you can give me . ”
63441	63453	63365	63365	Harry	112	“ Of course , my Lord , of course ... anything ... ”
63454	63467	63365	63365	Harry	112	“ Very well ... you may go . Send Avery to me . ”
63537	63540	63513	63513	His	112	“ NOOOOOOOOO ! ”
63541	63544	63513	63513	His	112	“ What ? ”
63615	63633	63606	63606	Ron	113	“ Will you stop acting like a maniac , and I can get you out of here ! ”
63685	63692	63694	63694	Ron	113	“ Has someone been attacked again ? ”
63703	63713	63694	63694	Ron	113	“ Is it Dad ? Is it that snake ? ”
63714	63721	63723	63723	Harry	112	“ No — everyone ’s fine — ”
63736	63760	63723	63723	Harry	112	“ Well ... Avery is n’t ... He ’s in trouble ... He gave him the wrong information ... He ’s really angry ... ”
63776	63794	63761	63761	Harry	112	“ But Rookwood ’s going to help him now ... He ’s on the right track again ... ”
63795	63802	63804	63804	Ron	113	“ What are you talking about ? ”
63809	63823	63804	63804	Ron	113	“ D’you mean ... did you just see You - Know - Who ? ”
63824	63833	63835	63835	Harry	112	“ I was You - Know - Who , ”
63867	63899	63838	63838	he	112	“ He was with Rookwood , he ’s one of the Death Eaters who escaped from Azkaban , remember ? Rookwood ’s just told him Bode could n’t have done it ... ”
63900	63904	63804	63804	Ron	113	“ Done what ? ”
63905	63941	63838	63838	he	112	“ Remove something ... He said Bode would have known he could n’t have done it ... Bode was under the Imperius Curse ... I think he said Malfoy ’s dad put it on him ... ”
63942	63950	63951	63951	Ron	113	“ Bode was bewitched to remove something ? ”
63954	63965	63951	63951	Ron	113	“ But — Harry , that ’s got to be — ”
63966	63970	63971	63971	Harry	112	“ The weapon , ”
63978	63982	63971	63971	Harry	112	“ I know . ”
64029	64034	64036	64036	Ron	113	“ Did you say , ”
64061	64071	64039	64039	his	113	“ that you were You - Know - Who ? ”
64072	64075	64077	64077	Harry	112	“ Yeah , ”
64100	64103	64104	64104	he	112	“ Harry , ”
64123	64130	64110	64110	Seamus	199	“ you ’ve got to tell — ”
64131	64140	64142	64142	Harry	112	“ I have n’t got to tell anyone , ”
64145	64178	64142	64142	Harry	112	“ I would n’t have seen it at all if I could do Occlumency . I ’m supposed to have learned to shut this stuff out . That ’s what they want . ”
64180	64182	64183	64183	he	112	“ they ”
64350	64359	64360	64360	she	114	“ So that ’s why they killed him , ”
64374	64537	64360	64360	she	114	“ When Bode tried to steal this weapon , something funny happened to him . I think there must be defensive spells on it , or around it , to stop people from touching it . That ’s why he was in St. Mungo ’s , his brain had gone all funny and he could n’t talk . But remember what the Healer told us ? He was recovering . And they could n’t risk him getting better , could they ? I mean , the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon probably made the Imperius Curse lift . Once he ’d got his voice back , he ’d explain what he ’d been doing , would n’t he ? They would have known he ’d been sent to steal the weapon . Of course , it would have been easy for Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him . Never out of the Ministry , is he ? ”
64538	64551	64553	64553	Harry	112	“ He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing , ”
64555	64562	64563	64563	he	112	“ In the — hang on ... ”
64567	64602	64563	64563	he	112	“ He was in the Department of Mysteries corridor that day ! Your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing , but what if — ”
64603	64606	64608	64608	Hermione	114	“ Sturgis , ”
64613	64616	64618	64618	Ron	113	“ Sorry ? ”
64623	64627	64629	64629	Hermione	114	“ Sturgis Podmore , ”
64633	64760	64629	64629	Hermione	114	“ Arrested for trying to get through a door . Lucius Malfoy got him too . I bet he did it the day you saw him there , Harry . Sturgis had Moody ’s Invisibility Cloak , right ? So what if he was standing guard by the door , invisible , and Malfoy heard him move , or guessed he was there , or just did the Imperius Curse on the off chance that a guard was there ? So when Sturgis next had an opportunity — probably when it was his turn on guard duty again — he tried to get into the department to steal the weapon for Voldemort — Ron , be quiet — but he got caught and sent to Azkaban ... ”
64766	64779	64761	64761	She	1416	“ And now Rookwood ’s told Voldemort how to get the weapon ? ”
64780	64797	64799	64799	Harry	112	“ I did n’t hear all the conversation , but that ’s what it sounded like , ”
64801	64816	64799	64799	Harry	112	“ Rookwood used to work there ... Maybe Voldemort’ll send Rookwood to do it ? ”
64834	64847	64831	64831	she	1416	“ But you should n’t have seen this at all , Harry . ”
64848	64851	64852	64852	he	112	“ What ? ”
64858	64876	64878	64878	Hermione	114	“ You ’re supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort of thing , ”
64883	64889	64891	64891	Harry	112	“ I know I am , ”
64893	64896	64891	64891	Harry	112	“ But — ”
64897	64912	64914	64914	Hermione	114	“ Well , I think we should just try and forget what you saw , ”
64917	64935	64914	64914	Hermione	114	“ And you ought to put in a bit more effort on your Occlumency from now on . ”
65060	65066	65091	65091	Snape	255	“ Get up , Potter . ”
65144	65149	65151	65151	Snape	255	“ That last memory , ”
65153	65158	65151	65151	Snape	255	“ What was it ? ”
65159	65165	65167	65167	Harry	112	“ I do n’t know , ”
65198	65215	65193	65193	Snape	255	“ You mean the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet ? ”
65216	65219	65221	65221	Snape	255	“ No , ”
65224	65241	65221	65221	Snape	255	“ I mean the one concerning a man kneeling in the middle of a darkened room ... ”
65242	65248	65250	65250	Harry	112	“ It ’s ... nothing , ”
65280	65297	65299	65299	Snape	255	“ How do that man and that room come to be inside your head , Potter ? ”
65301	65304	65306	65306	Harry	112	“ It — ”
65314	65324	65306	65306	Harry	112	“ it was — just a dream I had . ”
65325	65329	65331	65331	Snape	255	“ A dream , ”
65356	65371	65373	65373	Snape	255	“ You do know why we are here , do n’t you , Potter ? ”
65381	65397	65373	65373	Snape	255	“ You do know why I am giving up my evenings to this tedious job ? ”
65398	65401	65403	65403	Harry	112	“ Yes , ”
65406	65416	65373	65373	Snape	255	“ Remind me why we are here , Potter . ”
65417	65424	65426	65426	Harry	112	“ So I can learn Occlumency , ”
65435	65446	65448	65448	Harry	112	“ Correct , Potter . And dim though you may be ”
65457	65489	65448	65448	Harry	112	“ I would have thought that after two months ’ worth of lessons you might have made some progress . How many other dreams about the Dark Lord have you had ? ”
65490	65495	65497	65497	Harry	112	“ Just that one , ”
65499	65502	65504	65504	Snape	255	“ Perhaps , ”
65514	65536	65504	65504	Snape	255	“ perhaps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams , Potter . Maybe they make you feel special — important ? ”
65537	65544	65546	65546	Harry	112	“ No , they do n’t , ”
65563	65572	65574	65574	Snape	255	“ That is just as well , Potter , ”
65577	65607	65574	65574	Snape	255	“ because you are neither special nor important , and it is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is saying to his Death Eaters . ”
65608	65620	65621	65621	Harry	112	“ No — that ’s your job , is n’t it ? ”
65678	65683	65684	65684	he	255	“ Yes , Potter , ”
65691	65709	65684	65684	he	255	“ That is my job . Now , if you are ready , we will start again ... ”
65715	65724	65710	65710	He	255	“ One — two — three — Legilimens ! ”
65808	65811	65804	65804	his	112	“ Protego ! ”
65900	65903	65885	65886	A girl	3782	“ ENOUGH ! ”
65984	65987	65989	65989	Snape	255	“ Reparo ! ”
65999	66010	65989	65989	Snape	255	“ Well , Potter ... that was certainly an improvement ... ”
66043	66066	66020	66020	he	255	“ I do n’t remember telling you to use a Shield Charm ... but there is no doubt that it was effective ... ”
66136	66145	66147	66147	Snape	255	“ Let ’s try again , shall we ? ”
66201	66210	66212	66212	Snape	255	“ On the count of three , then , ”
66220	66225	66212	66212	Snape	255	“ One — two — ”
66247	66250	66243	66243	Snape	255	“ Legilimens ! ”
66367	66370	66371	66371	Harry	112	“ POTTER ! ”
66423	66427	66429	66429	Snape	255	“ Explain yourself ! ”
66440	66447	66449	66449	Harry	112	“ I ... dunno what happened , ”
66477	66506	66473	66473	he	112	“ I ’ve never seen that before . I mean , I told you , I ’ve dreamed about the door ... but it ’s never opened before ... ”
66507	66515	66525	66525	he	255	“ You are not working hard enough ! ”
66541	66559	66525	66525	he	255	“ You are lazy and sloppy , Potter , it is small wonder that the Dark Lord — ”
66560	66569	66571	66571	Harry	112	“ Can you tell me something , sir ? ”
66577	66598	66571	66571	Harry	112	“ Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord , I ’ve only ever heard Death Eaters call him that — ”
66630	66635	66636	66636	he	255	“ What the — ? ”
66664	66678	66656	66656	Snape	255	“ Did you see anything unusual on your way down here , Potter ? ”
66988	66991	66992	66992	she	147	“ No ! ”
66995	67014	66992	66992	she	147	“ NO ! This can not be happening ... It can not ... I refuse to accept it ! ”
67015	67024	66961	66962	Professor Trelawney	147	“ You did n’t realize this was coming ? ”
67057	67097	67054	67055	Professor Umbridge	144	“ Incapable though you are of predicting even tomorrow ’s weather , you must surely have realized that your pitiful performance during my inspections , and lack of any improvement , would make it inevitable you would be sacked ? ”
67098	67104	67106	67107	Professor Trelawney	147	“ You c - can’t ! ”
67120	67148	67112	67112	her	147	“ you c - can’t sack me ! I ’ve b - been here sixteen years ! H - Hogwarts is m - my h - home ! ”
67149	67155	67157	67158	Professor Umbridge	144	“ It was your home , ”
67188	67219	67175	67176	Professor Trelawney	147	“ until an hour ago , when the Minister of Magic countersigned the order for your dismissal . Now kindly remove yourself from this hall . You are embarrassing us . ”
67315	67352	67282	67283	Professor McGonagall	200	“ There , there , Sybill ... Calm down ... Blow your nose on this ... It ’s not as bad as you think , now ... You are not going to have to leave Hogwarts ... ”
67353	67360	67362	67362	Umbridge	144	“ Oh really , Professor McGonagall ? ”
67374	67384	67362	67362	Umbridge	144	“ And your authority for that statement is ... ? ”
67385	67391	67282	67283	Professor McGonagall	200	“ That would be mine , ”
67490	67496	67498	67498	Umbridge	144	“ Yours , Professor Dumbledore ? ”
67506	67520	67522	67522	she	147	“ I ’m afraid you do not understand the position . I have here ”
67532	67617	67522	67522	she	147	“ an Order of Dismissal signed by myself and the Minister of Magic . Under the terms of Educational Decree Number Twenty - three , the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts has the power to inspect , place upon probation , and sack any teacher she — that is to say , I — feel is not performing up to the standard required by the Ministry of Magic . I have decided that Professor Trelawney is not up to scratch . I have dismissed her . ”
67650	67695	67696	67696	he	133	“ You are quite right , of course , Professor Umbridge . As High Inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my teachers . You do not , however , have the authority to send them away from the castle . I am afraid , ”
67706	67733	67696	67696	he	133	“ that the power to do that still resides with the headmaster , and it is my wish that Professor Trelawney continue to live at Hogwarts . ”
67752	67781	67846	67847	the crowd	3452	“ No — no , I ’ll g - go , Dumbledore ! I sh - shall l - leave Hogwarts and s - seek my fortune elsewhere — ”
67782	67785	67787	67787	Dumbledore	133	“ No , ”
67790	67801	67787	67787	Dumbledore	133	“ It is my wish that you remain , Sybill . ”
67808	67822	67802	67802	He	133	“ Might I ask you to escort Sybill back upstairs , Professor McGonagall ? ”
67823	67827	67829	67829	McGonagall	200	“ Of course , ”
67831	67838	67829	67829	McGonagall	200	“ Up you get , Sybill ... ”
67885	67889	67882	67882	he	132	“ Locomotor trunks ! ”
67932	67936	67937	67937	she	147	“ And what , ”
67951	67971	67937	67937	she	147	“ are you going to do with her once I appoint a new Divination teacher who needs her lodgings ? ”
67972	67982	67984	67984	Dumbledore	133	“ Oh , that wo n’t be a problem , ”
67987	68011	67984	67984	Dumbledore	133	“ You see , I have already found us a new Divination teacher , and he will prefer lodgings on the ground floor . ”
68012	68018	68020	68020	Umbridge	144	“ You ’ve found — ? ”
68023	68043	68020	68020	Umbridge	144	“ You ’ve found ? Might I remind you , Dumbledore , that under Educational Decree Twenty - two — ”
68044	68070	68072	68072	Dumbledore	133	“ — the Ministry has the right to appoint a suitable candidate if — and only if — the headmaster is unable to find one , ”
68074	68094	68072	68072	Dumbledore	133	“ And I am happy to say that on this occasion I have succeeded . May I introduce you ? ”
68198	68203	68205	68205	Dumbledore	133	“ This is Firenze , ”
68212	68221	68205	68205	Dumbledore	133	“ I think you ’ll find him suitable . ”
68222	68242	68244	68244	Parvati	153	“ I ’ll bet you wish you had n’t given up Divination now , do n’t you , Hermione ? ”
68294	68298	68300	68300	Hermione	114	“ Not really , ”
68310	68318	68300	68300	Hermione	114	“ I ’ve never really liked horses . ”
68331	68343	68345	68345	Lavender	154	“ He ’s not a horse , he ’s a centaur ! ”
68350	68355	68357	68357	Parvati	153	“ A gorgeous centaur ... ”
68359	68370	68372	68372	Hermione	114	“ Either way , he ’s still got four legs , ”
68375	68390	68372	68372	Hermione	114	“ Anyway , I thought you two were all upset that Trelawney had gone ? ”
68391	68395	68396	68396	Lavender	154	“ We are ! ”
68400	68429	68396	68396	Lavender	154	“ We went up to her office to see her , we took her some daffodils — not the honking ones that Sprout ’s got , nice ones ... ”
68430	68435	68437	68437	Harry	112	“ How is she ? ”
68439	68447	68449	68449	Lavender	154	“ Not very good , poor thing , ”
68452	68491	68449	68449	Lavender	154	“ She was crying and saying she ’d rather leave the castle forever than stay here if Umbridge is still here , and I do n’t blame her . Umbridge was horrible to her , was n’t she ? ”
68492	68506	68508	68508	Hermione	114	“ I ’ve got a feeling Umbridge has only just started being horrible , ”
68511	68514	68516	68516	Ron	113	“ Impossible , ”
68530	68543	68516	68516	Ron	113	“ She ca n’t get any worse than she ’s been already . ”
68544	68567	68569	68569	Hermione	114	“ You mark my words , she ’s going to want revenge on Dumbledore for appointing a new teacher without consulting her , ”
68575	68594	68569	68569	Hermione	114	“ Especially another part - human . You saw the look on her face when she saw Firenze ... ”
68620	68630	68632	68632	Ron	113	“ Are n’t we going up to North Tower ? ”
68653	68678	68648	68648	her	153	“ How d’you expect Firenze to climb that ladder ? We ’re in classroom eleven now , it was on the notice board yesterday . ”
68759	68764	68739	68739	Ron	113	“ What the — ? ”
68861	68865	68866	68866	he	112	“ Harry Potter , ”
68877	68882	68884	68884	Harry	112	“ Er — hi , ”
68906	68914	68921	68922	the centaur	1483	“ Er — good to see you ... ”
68915	68919	68921	68922	the centaur	1483	“ And you , ”
68931	68941	68921	68922	the centaur	1483	“ It was foretold that we would meet again . ”
69032	69043	69045	69045	Firenze	320	“ Professor Dumbledore has kindly arranged this classroom for us , ”
69053	69088	69045	69045	Firenze	320	“ in imitation of my natural habitat . I would have preferred to teach you in the Forbidden Forest , which was — until Monday — my home ... but this is not possible . ”
69089	69096	69102	69102	her	153	“ Please — er — sir — ”
69105	69122	69102	69102	her	153	“ why not ? We ’ve been in there with Hagrid , we ’re not frightened ! ”
69123	69133	69135	69135	Firenze	320	“ It is not a question of your bravery , ”
69137	69158	69135	69135	Firenze	320	“ but of my position . I can no longer return to the forest . My herd has banished me . ”
69159	69162	69164	69164	Lavender	154	“ Herd ? ”
69179	69184	69173	69173	she	1489	“ What — oh ! ”
69191	69198	69199	69199	she	1489	“ There are more of you ? ”
69204	69214	69216	69216	Dean	189	“ Did Hagrid breed you , like the thestrals ? ”
69243	69253	69254	69254	he	320	“ I did n’t — I meant — sorry , ”
69261	69272	69274	69274	Firenze	320	“ Centaurs are not the servants or playthings of humans , ”
69289	69302	69285	69285	her	153	“ Please , sir ... why have the other centaurs banished you ? ”
69303	69314	69316	69316	Firenze	320	“ Because I have agreed to work for Professor Dumbledore , ”
69318	69329	69316	69316	Firenze	320	“ They see this as a betrayal of our kind . ”
69360	69364	69341	69341	Bane	322	“ common mule . ”
69380	69385	69387	69387	Firenze	320	“ Let us begin , ”
69455	69458	69451	69451	Ron	113	“ Blimey ! ”
69459	69466	69470	69470	his	320	“ Lie back upon the floor , ”
69474	69496	69468	69468	Firenze	320	“ and observe the heavens . Here is written , for those who can see , the fortune of our races . ”
69520	69538	69540	69540	Firenze	320	“ I know that you have learned the names of the planets and their moons in Astronomy , ”
69545	69586	69540	69540	Firenze	320	“ and that you have mapped the stars ’ progress through the heavens . Centaurs have unraveled the mysteries of these movements over centuries . Our findings teach us that the future may be glimpsed in the sky above us ... ”
69587	69595	69597	69597	Parvati	153	“ Professor Trelawney did Astrology with us ! ”
69622	69644	69646	69646	she	153	“ Mars causes accidents and burns and things like that , and when it makes an angle to Saturn , like now ”
69657	69672	69646	69646	she	153	“ that means that people need to be extra careful when handling hot things — ”
69673	69676	69678	69678	Firenze	320	“ That , ”
69681	69686	69678	69678	Firenze	320	“ is human nonsense . ”
69696	69704	69706	69706	Firenze	320	“ Trivial hurts , tiny human accidents , ”
69717	69741	69706	69706	Firenze	320	“ These are of no more significance than the scurryings of ants to the wide universe , and are unaffected by planetary movements . ”
69742	69746	69748	69748	Parvati	153	“ Professor Trelawney — ”
69757	69763	69765	69765	Firenze	320	“ — is a human , ”
69768	69782	69765	69765	Firenze	320	“ And is therefore blinkered and fettered by the limitations of your kind . ”
69808	69820	69822	69822	Firenze	320	“ Sybill Trelawney may have Seen , I do not know , ”
69842	69916	69834	69834	he	112	“ but she wastes her time , in the main , on the self - flattering nonsense humans call fortune - telling . I , however , am here to explain the wisdom of centaurs , which is impersonal and impartial . We watch the skies for the great tides of evil or change that are sometimes marked there . It may take ten years to be sure of what we are seeing . ”
69927	70000	69917	69917	Firenze	320	“ In the past decade , the indications have been that Wizard - kind is living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars . Mars , bringer of battle , shines brightly above us , suggesting that the fight must break out again soon . How soon , centaurs may attempt to divine by the burning of certain herbs and leaves , by the observation of fume and flame ... ”
70153	70165	70167	70167	Ron	113	“ He ’s not very definite on anything , is he ? ”
70181	70206	70167	70167	Ron	113	“ I mean , I could do with a few more details about this war we ’re about to have , could n’t you ? ”
70264	70273	70261	70261	Firenze	320	“ Harry Potter , a word , please . ”
70288	70293	70294	70294	Firenze	320	“ You may stay , ”
70298	70306	70294	70294	Firenze	320	“ But close the door , please . ”
70312	70328	70330	70331	the centaur	1483	“ Harry Potter , you are a friend of Hagrid ’s , are you not ? ”
70333	70336	70338	70338	Harry	112	“ Yes , ”
70340	70363	70330	70331	the centaur	1483	“ Then give him a warning from me . His attempt is not working . He would do better to abandon it . ”
70364	70371	70372	70372	Harry	112	“ His attempt is not working ? ”
70376	70386	70388	70388	Firenze	320	“ And he would do better to abandon it , ”
70392	70429	70388	70388	Firenze	320	“ I would warn Hagrid myself , but I am banished — it would be unwise for me to go too near the forest now — Hagrid has troubles enough , without a centaurs ’ battle . ”
70430	70440	70442	70442	Harry	112	“ But — what ’s Hagrid attempting to do ? ”
70451	70461	70463	70463	Firenze	320	“ Hagrid has recently rendered me a great service , ”
70465	70516	70463	70463	Firenze	320	“ and he has long since earned my respect for the care he shows all living creatures . I shall not betray his secret . But he must be brought to his senses . The attempt is not working . Tell him , Harry Potter . Good day to you . ”
70647	70653	70654	70654	he	116	“ Nice bloke , Firenze , ”
70658	70682	70654	70654	he	116	“ but he don ’ know what he ’s talkin ’ abou ’ on this . The attemp ’s comin ’ on fine . ”
70683	70692	70694	70694	Harry	112	“ Hagrid , what ’re you up to ? ”
70697	70733	70694	70694	Harry	112	“ Because you ’ve got to be careful , Umbridge has already sacked Trelawney and if you ask me , she ’s on a roll . If you ’re doing anything you should n’t be — ”
70734	70747	70749	70749	Hagrid	116	“ There ’s things more importan ’ than keepin ’ a job , ”
70772	70794	70752	70752	his	116	“ Don ’ worry abou ’ me , Harry , jus ’ get along now , there ’s a good lad ... ”
70982	70984	70969	70969	Umbridge	144	“ Outstanding ”
71049	71059	71061	71061	Cho	187	“ Oh , do n’t be such a killjoy , ”
71084	71090	71065	71065	her	187	“ They ’re so pretty ! ”
71091	71107	71109	71109	Harry	112	“ They ’re not supposed to be pretty , they ’re supposed to protect you , ”
71112	71145	71109	71109	Harry	112	“ What we really need is a boggart or something ; that ’s how I learned , I had to conjure a Patronus while the boggart was pretending to be a dementor — ”
71146	71154	71156	71156	Lavender	154	“ But that would be really scary ! ”
71173	71184	71185	71185	she	187	“ And I still — ca n’t — do it ! ”
71217	71227	71228	71228	Harry	112	“ You ’ve got to think of something happy , ”
71232	71237	71239	71239	Neville	161	“ I ’m trying , ”
71256	71266	71268	71268	Seamus	199	“ Harry , I think I ’m doing it ! ”
71284	71302	71268	71268	Seamus	199	“ Look — ah — it ’s gone ... But it was definitely something hairy , Harry ! ”
71317	71328	71329	71329	she	114	“ They are sort of nice , are n’t they ? ”
71432	71437	71438	71438	he	112	“ Hi , Dobby ! ”
71441	71450	71438	71438	he	112	“ What are you — what ’s wrong ? ”
71509	71515	71517	71518	the elf	549	“ Harry Potter , sir ... ”
71526	71551	71517	71518	the elf	549	“ Harry Potter , sir ... Dobby has come to warn you ... but the house - elves have been warned not to tell ... ”
71609	71616	71617	71617	Harry	112	“ What ’s happened , Dobby ? ”
71641	71649	71658	71658	his	173	“ Harry Potter ... she ... she ... ”
71667	71676	71662	71662	Harry	112	“ Who ’s ‘ she , ’ Dobby ? ”
71686	71688	71696	71697	The elf	549	“ she ”
71712	71715	71717	71717	Harry	112	“ Umbridge ? ”
71741	71763	71764	71764	He	112	“ What about her ? Dobby — she has n’t found out about this — about us — about the D.A. ? ”
71794	71799	71800	71800	Harry	112	“ Is she coming ? ”
71810	71818	71804	71804	Dobby	173	“ Yes , Harry Potter , yes ! ”
71837	71844	71845	71845	Harry	112	“ WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR ? ”
71848	71851	71845	71845	Harry	112	“ RUN ! ”
71924	71930	71932	71932	Hermione	114	“ Harry , come on ! ”
71978	72012	72014	72014	Harry	112	“ Dobby — this is an order — get back down to the kitchen with the other elves , and if she asks you whether you warned me , lie and say no ! ”
72016	72025	72026	72026	he	112	“ And I forbid you to hurt yourself ! ”
72048	72055	72060	72060	he	173	“ Thank you , Harry Potter ! ”
72128	72131	72110	72110	he	112	“ AAARGH ! ”
72184	72190	72191	72191	he	112	“ Trip Jinx , Potter ! ”
72194	72206	72191	72191	he	112	“ Hey , Professor — PROFESSOR ! I ’ve got one ! ”
72222	72227	72228	72228	she	144	“ It ’s him ! ”
72240	72269	72228	72228	she	144	“ Excellent , Draco , excellent , oh , very good — fifty points to Slytherin ! I ’ll take him from here ... Stand up , Potter ! ”
72309	72326	72327	72327	she	144	“ You hop along and see if you can round up anymore of them , Draco , ”
72330	72365	72366	72366	she	144	“ Tell the others to look in the library — anybody out of breath — check the bathrooms , Miss Parkinson can do the girls ’ ones — off you go — and you , ”
72381	72395	72366	72366	she	144	“ You can come with me to the headmaster ’s office , Potter . ”
72462	72466	72468	72468	Umbridge	144	“ Fizzing Whizbee , ”
72724	72727	72728	72728	he	280	“ Well , ”
72731	72738	72728	72728	he	280	“ Well , well , well ... ”
72765	72774	72776	72776	Umbridge	144	“ He was heading back to Gryffindor Tower , ”
72807	72814	72784	72784	her	144	“ The Malfoy boy cornered him . ”
72815	72822	72824	72824	Fudge	280	“ Did he , did he ? ”
72827	72848	72824	72824	Fudge	280	“ I must remember to tell Lucius . Well , Potter ... I expect you know why you are here ? ”
72857	72859	72849	72849	Harry	112	“ yes ”
72927	72932	72909	72909	his	133	“ Yeh — no . ”
72933	72939	72941	72941	Fudge	280	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
72943	72946	72948	72948	Harry	112	“ No , ”
72952	72962	72909	72909	his	133	“ You do n’t know why you are here ? ”
72963	72970	72972	72972	Harry	112	“ No , I do n’t , ”
73013	73020	73022	73022	Fudge	280	“ So you have no idea , ”
73031	73054	73022	73022	Fudge	280	“ why Professor Umbridge has brought you to this office ? You are not aware that you have broken any school rules ? ”
73055	73059	73061	73061	Harry	112	“ School rules ? ”
73063	73066	73061	73061	Harry	112	“ No . ”
73067	73072	73074	73074	Fudge	280	“ Or Ministry decrees ? ”
73077	73085	73087	73087	Harry	112	“ Not that I ’m aware of , ”
73153	73164	73166	73166	Fudge	280	“ So it ’s news to you , is it , ”
73175	73188	73166	73166	Fudge	280	“ that an illegal student organization has been discovered within this school ? ”
73189	73195	73197	73197	Harry	112	“ Yes , it is , ”
73210	73216	73218	73218	Umbridge	144	“ I think , Minister , ”
73224	73236	73218	73218	Umbridge	144	“ we might make better progress if I fetch our informant . ”
73237	73244	73246	73246	Fudge	280	“ Yes , yes , do , ”
73262	73276	73251	73251	he	280	“ There ’s nothing like a good witness , is there , Dumbledore ? ”
73277	73284	73286	73286	Dumbledore	133	“ Nothing at all , Cornelius , ”
73347	73360	73362	73363	Professor Umbridge	144	“ Do n’t be scared , dear , do n’t be frightened , ”
73372	73416	73417	73417	she	1576	“ it ’s quite all right , now . You have done the right thing . The Minister is very pleased with you . He ’ll be telling your mother what a good girl you ’ve been . Marietta ’s mother , Minister , ”
73425	73453	73417	73417	she	1576	“ is Madam Edgecombe from the Department of Magical Transportation . Floo Network office — she ’s been helping us police the Hogwarts fires , you know . ”
73454	73461	73463	73463	Fudge	280	“ Jolly good , jolly good ! ”
73466	73504	73463	73463	Fudge	280	“ Like mother , like daughter , eh ? Well , come on , now , dear , look up , do n’t be shy , let ’s hear what you ’ve got to — galloping gargoyles ! ”
73594	73597	73658	73658	She	190	“ SNEAK . ”
73598	73607	73609	73609	Umbridge	144	“ Never mind the spots now , dear , ”
73612	73626	73609	73609	Umbridge	144	“ just take your robes away from your mouth and tell the Minister — ”
73639	73654	73656	73656	Umbridge	144	“ Oh , very well , you silly girl , I ’ll tell him , ”
73670	73758	73759	73759	she	1578	“ Well , Minister , Miss Edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me . She said that if I proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor , sometimes known as the Room of Requirement , I would find out something to my advantage . I questioned her a little further and she admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there . Unfortunately at that point this hex , ”
73768	73793	73759	73759	she	1578	“ came into operation and upon catching sight of her face in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more . ”
73794	73799	73801	73801	Fudge	280	“ Well , now , ”
73817	73862	73801	73801	Fudge	280	“ It is very brave of you , my dear , coming to tell Professor Umbridge , you did exactly the right thing . Now , will you tell me what happened at this meeting ? What was its purpose ? Who was there ? ”
73882	73892	73893	73893	Fudge	280	“ Have n’t we got a counterjinx for this ? ”
73904	73911	73893	73893	Fudge	280	“ So she can speak freely ? ”
73912	73922	73923	73923	Umbridge	144	“ I have not yet managed to find one , ”
73940	73993	73935	73935	Hermione	114	“ But it does n’t matter if she wo n’t speak , I can take up the story from here . You will remember , Minister , that I sent you a report back in October that Potter had met a number of fellow students in the Hog ’s Head in Hogsmeade — ”
73994	74003	74006	74007	Professor McGonagall	200	“ And what is your evidence for that ? ”
74009	74045	74047	74047	Umbridge	144	“ I have testimony from Widdershins , Minerva , who happened to be in the bar at the time . He was heavily bandaged , it is true , but his hearing was quite unimpaired , ”
74050	74068	74047	74047	Umbridge	144	“ He heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me — ”
74069	74088	74090	74091	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Oh , so that ’s why he was n’t prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets ! ”
74097	74107	74094	74094	her	200	“ What an interesting insight into our justice system ! ”
74108	74112	74047	74047	Umbridge	144	“ Blatant corruption ! ”
74132	74153	74117	74130	the corpulent , red - nosed wizard on the wall behind Dumbledore ’s desk	1579	“ The Ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day , no sir , they did not ! ”
74154	74164	74166	74166	Dumbledore	133	“ Thank you , Fortescue , that will do , ”
74169	74180	74182	74183	Professor Umbridge	144	“ The purpose of Potter ’s meeting with these students , ”
74185	74215	74182	74183	Professor Umbridge	144	“ was to persuade them to join an illegal society , whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school - age — ”
74216	74229	74231	74231	Dumbledore	133	“ I think you ’ll find you ’re wrong there , Dolores , ”
74292	74295	74297	74297	Fudge	280	“ Oho ! ”
74311	74394	74297	74297	Fudge	280	“ Yes , do let ’s hear the latest cock - and - bull story designed to pull Potter out of trouble ! Go on , then , Dumbledore , go on — Widdershins was lying , was he ? Or was it Potter ’s identical twin in the Hog ’s Head that day ? Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time , a dead man coming back to life , and a couple of invisible dementors ? ”
74403	74414	74395	74396	Percy Weasley	239	“ Oh , very good , Minister , very good ! ”
74436	74546	74430	74430	Dumbledore	133	“ Cornelius , I do not deny — and nor , I am sure , does Harry — that he was in the Hog ’s Head that day , nor that he was trying to recruit students to a Defense Against the Dark Arts group . I am merely pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was , at that time , illegal . If you remember , the Ministry decree banning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after Harry ’s Hogsmeade meeting , so he was not breaking any rules in the Hog ’s Head at all . ”
74580	74589	74590	74590	she	144	“ That ’s all very fine , Headmaster , ”
74596	74634	74590	74590	she	144	“ But we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational Decree Number Twenty - four . If the first meeting was not illegal , all those that have happened since most certainly are . ”
74635	74638	74640	74640	Dumbledore	133	“ Well , ”
74655	74682	74640	74640	Dumbledore	133	“ they certainly would be , if they had continued after the decree came into effect . Do you have any evidence that these meetings continued ? ”
74732	74735	74737	74737	Umbridge	144	“ Evidence ? ”
74745	74763	74737	74737	Umbridge	144	“ Have you not been listening , Dumbledore ? Why do you think Miss Edgecombe is here ? ”
74764	74779	74781	74781	Dumbledore	133	“ Oh , can she tell us about six months ’ worth of meetings ? ”
74787	74802	74784	74784	his	133	“ I was under the impression that she was merely reporting a meeting tonight . ”
74803	74807	74809	74809	Umbridge	144	“ Miss Edgecombe , ”
74813	74858	74809	74809	Umbridge	144	“ tell us how long these meetings have been going on , dear . You can simply nod or shake your head , I ’m sure that wo n’t make the spots worse . Have they been happening regularly over the last six months ? ”
74892	74902	74903	74903	Umbridge	144	“ Just nod or shake your head , dear , ”
74909	74923	74903	74903	Umbridge	144	“ Come on , now , that wo n’t activate the jinx further ... ”
74994	75033	74983	74983	Umbridge	144	“ I do n’t think you understood the question , did you , dear ? I ’m asking whether you ’ve been going to these meetings for the past six months ? You have , have n’t you ? ”
75041	75053	75055	75055	Umbridge	144	“ What do you mean by shaking your head , dear ? ”
75061	75072	75074	75075	Professor McGonagall	200	“ I would have thought her meaning was quite clear , ”
75078	75098	75074	75075	Professor McGonagall	200	“ There have been no secret meetings for the past six months . Is that correct , Miss Edgecombe ? ”
75102	75110	75112	75112	Umbridge	144	“ But there was a meeting tonight ! ”
75115	75161	75112	75112	Umbridge	144	“ There was a meeting , Miss Edgecombe , you told me about it , in the Room of Requirement ! And Potter was the leader , was he not , Potter organized it , Potter — why are you shaking your head , girl ? ”
75162	75173	75175	75175	McGonagall	200	“ Well , usually when a person shakes their head , ”
75178	75202	75175	75175	McGonagall	200	“ they mean ‘ no . ’ So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of sign language as yet unknown to humans — ”
75259	75272	75282	75282	he	133	“ I can not allow you to manhandle my students , Dolores , ”
75286	75296	75298	75298	Kingsley	330	“ You want to calm yourself , Madam Umbridge , ”
75306	75318	75298	75298	Kingsley	330	“ You do n’t want to get yourself into trouble now . ”
75319	75322	75324	75324	Umbridge	144	“ No , ”
75336	75354	75334	75334	Kingsley	330	“ I mean , yes — you ’re right , Shacklebolt — I — I forgot myself . ”
75423	75426	75428	75428	Fudge	280	“ Dolores , ”
75443	75455	75428	75428	Fudge	280	“ the meeting tonight — the one we know definitely happened — ”
75456	75459	75461	75461	Umbridge	144	“ Yes , ”
75467	75572	75464	75464	herself	144	“ yes ... well , Miss Edgecombe tipped me off and I proceeded at once to the seventh floor , accompanied by certain trustworthy students , so as to catch those in the meeting red - handed . It appears that they were forewarned of my arrival , however , because when we reached the seventh floor they were running in every direction . It does not matter , however . I have all their names here , Miss Parkinson ran into the Room of Requirement for me to see if they had left anything behind ... We needed evidence and the room provided ... ”
75605	75625	75626	75626	she	144	“ The moment I saw Potter ’s name on the list , I knew what we were dealing with , ”
75630	75633	75635	75635	Fudge	280	“ Excellent , ”
75644	75654	75641	75641	his	280	“ Excellent , Dolores . And ... by thunder ... ”
75676	75684	75686	75686	Fudge	280	“ See what they ’ve named themselves ? ”
75689	75694	75686	75686	Fudge	280	“ Dumbledore ’s Army . ”
75733	75741	75742	75742	he	133	“ Well , the game is up , ”
75746	75767	75742	75742	he	133	“ Would you like a written confession from me , Cornelius — or will a statement before these witnesses suffice ? ”
75802	75805	75807	75807	Fudge	280	“ Statement ? ”
75810	75818	75807	75807	Fudge	280	“ What — I do n’t — ? ”
75819	75826	75833	75833	he	133	“ Dumbledore ’s Army , Cornelius , ”
75844	75854	75833	75833	he	133	“ Not Potter ’s Army . Dumbledore ’s Army . ”
75855	75860	75807	75807	Fudge	280	“ But — but — ”
75886	75889	75890	75890	he	280	“ You ? ”
75900	75905	75907	75907	Dumbledore	133	“ That ’s right , ”
75910	75915	75807	75807	Fudge	280	“ You organized this ? ”
75916	75920	75922	75922	Dumbledore	133	“ I did , ”
75924	75935	75807	75807	Fudge	280	“ You recruited these students for — for your army ? ”
75936	75946	75948	75948	Dumbledore	133	“ Tonight was supposed to be the first meeting , ”
75952	75981	75948	75948	Dumbledore	133	“ Merely to see whether they would be interested in joining me . I see now that it was a mistake to invite Miss Edgecombe , of course . ”
75996	76005	76006	76006	he	280	“ Then you have been plotting against me ! ”
76009	76014	76016	76016	Dumbledore	133	“ That ’s right , ”
76019	76022	76024	76024	Harry	112	“ NO ! ”
76063	76069	76037	76037	her	200	“ No — Professor Dumbledore ! ”
76070	76088	76090	76090	Dumbledore	133	“ Be quiet , Harry , or I am afraid you will have to leave my office , ”
76093	76101	76103	76103	Fudge	280	“ Yes , shut up , Potter ! ”
76117	76135	76103	76103	Fudge	280	“ Well , well , well — I came here tonight expecting to expel Potter and instead — ”
76136	76144	76146	76146	Dumbledore	133	“ Instead you get to arrest me , ”
76150	76166	76146	76146	Dumbledore	133	“ It ’s like losing a Knut and finding a Galleon , is n’t it ? ”
76167	76170	76172	76172	Fudge	280	“ Weasley ! ”
76180	76203	76172	76172	Fudge	280	“ Weasley , have you written it all down , everything he ’s said , his confession , have you got it ? ”
76204	76215	76217	76217	Percy	239	“ Yes , sir , I think so , sir ! ”
76235	76262	76146	76146	Dumbledore	133	“ The bit about how he ’s been trying to build up an army against the Ministry , how he ’s been working to destabilize me ? ”
76263	76275	76277	76277	Percy	239	“ Yes , sir , I ’ve got it , yes ! ”
76284	76290	76292	76292	Fudge	280	“ Very well , then , ”
76299	76330	76292	76292	Fudge	280	“ Duplicate your notes , Weasley , and send a copy to the Daily Prophet at once . If we send a fast owl we should make the morning edition ! ”
76350	76376	76344	76344	Fudge	280	“ You will now be escorted back to the Ministry , where you will be formally charged and then sent to Azkaban to await trial ! ”
76377	76380	76382	76382	Dumbledore	133	“ Ah , ”
76385	76399	76382	76382	Dumbledore	133	“ yes . Yes , I thought we might hit that little snag . ”
76400	76403	76405	76405	Fudge	280	“ Snag ? ”
76414	76422	76405	76405	Fudge	280	“ I see no snag , Dumbledore ! ”
76423	76426	76428	76428	Dumbledore	133	“ Well , ”
76431	76438	76428	76428	Dumbledore	133	“ I ’m afraid I do . ”
76439	76443	76405	76405	Fudge	280	“ Oh really ? ”
76444	76534	76428	76428	Dumbledore	133	“ Well — it ’s just that you seem to be laboring under the delusion that I am going to — what is the phrase ? ‘ Come quietly . ’ I am afraid I am not going to come quietly at all , Cornelius . I have absolutely no intention of being sent to Azkaban . I could break out , of course — but what a waste of time , and frankly , I can think of a whole host of things I would rather be doing . ”
76653	76661	76663	76663	Dumbledore	133	“ Do n’t be silly , Dawlish , ”
76666	76714	76663	76663	Dumbledore	133	“ I ’m sure you are an excellent Auror , I seem to remember that you achieved ‘ Outstanding ’ in all your N.E.W.T.s , but if you attempt to — er — ‘ bring me in ’ by force , I will have to hurt you . ”
76748	76751	76753	76753	Fudge	280	“ So , ”
76758	76781	76756	76756	himself	280	“ you intend to take on Dawlish , Shacklebolt , Dolores , and myself single - handed , do you , Dumbledore ? ”
76782	76789	76791	76791	Dumbledore	133	“ Merlin ’s beard , no , ”
76795	76807	76791	76791	Dumbledore	133	“ Not unless you are foolish enough to force me to . ”
76808	76817	76824	76824	her	200	“ He will not be single - handed ! ”
76830	76838	76840	76840	Dumbledore	133	“ Oh yes he will , Minerva ! ”
76843	76848	76840	76840	Dumbledore	133	“ Hogwarts needs you ! ”
76849	76855	76857	76857	Fudge	280	“ Enough of this rubbish ! ”
76865	76873	76861	76861	his	280	“ Dawlish ! Shacklebolt ! Take him ! ”
76972	76975	76969	76969	somebody	491	“ No ! ”
77050	77056	77058	77058	Dumbledore	133	“ Are you all right ? ”
77060	77063	77065	77066	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Yes ! ”
77144	77162	77164	77164	Dumbledore	133	“ Unfortunately , I had to hex Kingsley too , or it would have looked very suspicious , ”
77170	77255	77164	77164	Dumbledore	133	“ He was remarkably quick on the uptake , modifying Miss Edgecombe ’s memory like that while everyone was looking the other way — thank him for me , wo n’t you , Minerva ? Now , they will all awake very soon and it will be best if they do not know that we had time to communicate — you must act as though no time has passed , as though they were merely knocked to the ground , they will not remember — ”
77256	77264	77266	77267	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Where will you go , Dumbledore ? ”
77269	77273	77266	77267	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Grimmauld Place ? ”
77274	77278	77280	77280	Dumbledore	133	“ Oh no , ”
77286	77312	77280	77280	Dumbledore	133	“ I am not leaving to go into hiding . Fudge will soon wish he ’d never dislodged me from Hogwarts , I promise you ... ”
77313	77317	77318	77318	Harry	112	“ Professor Dumbledore ... ”
77377	77384	77385	77385	he	133	“ Listen to me , Harry , ”
77389	77443	77385	77385	he	133	“ you must study Occlumency as hard as you can , do you understand me ? Do everything Professor Snape tells you and practice it particularly every night before sleeping so that you can close your mind to bad dreams — you will understand why soon enough , but you must promise me — ”
77457	77464	77451	77451	Dumbledore	133	“ Remember — close your mind — ”
77507	77513	77515	77515	Dumbledore	133	“ — you will understand , ”
77558	77563	77565	77565	Fudge	280	“ Where is he ? ”
77574	77579	77565	77565	Fudge	280	“ Where is he ? ”
77580	77586	77588	77588	Kingsley	330	“ I do n’t know ! ”
77596	77605	77607	77607	Umbridge	144	“ Well , he ca n’t have Disapparated ! ”
77609	77617	77607	77607	Umbridge	144	“ You ca n’t inside this school — ”
77618	77622	77627	77627	he	336	“ The stairs ! ”
77672	77677	77679	77679	Fudge	280	“ Well , Minerva , ”
77687	77700	77679	77679	Fudge	280	“ I ’m afraid this is the end of your friend Dumbledore . ”
77701	77709	77711	77712	Professor McGonagall	200	“ You think so , do you ? ”
77749	77760	77762	77762	Fudge	280	“ You ’d better get those two off to bed , ”
77805	77829	77800	77801	Phineas Nigellus	210	“ You know , Minister , I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts ... but you can not deny he ’s got style ... ”
78049	78057	78059	78060	Ernie Macmillan	338	“ Dumbledore will be back before long , ”
78076	78103	78104	78104	He	338	“ They could n’t keep him away in our second year and they wo n’t be able to this time . The Fat Friar told me ... ”
78127	78168	78169	78169	Ernie	338	“ ... that Umbridge tried to get back into his office last night after they ’d searched the castle and grounds for him . Could n’t get past the gargoyle . The Head ’s office has sealed itself against her . ”
78172	78181	78169	78169	Ernie	338	“ Apparently she had a right little tantrum ... ”
78182	78200	78202	78202	Hermione	114	“ Oh , I expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the Head ’s office , ”
78217	78237	78202	78202	Hermione	114	“ Lording it over all the other teachers , the stupid puffed - up , power - crazy old — ”
78238	78252	78169	78169	Ernie	338	“ Now , do you really want to finish that sentence , Granger ? ”
78279	78296	78297	78297	he	166	“ Afraid I ’m going to have to dock a few points from Gryffindor and Hufflepuff , ”
78300	78312	78314	78314	Ernie	338	“ You ca n’t take points from fellow prefects , Malfoy , ”
78318	78330	78332	78332	Malfoy	166	“ I know prefects ca n’t dock points from each other , ”
78339	78347	78336	78336	Goyle	157	“ But members of the Inquisitorial Squad — ”
78348	78352	78354	78354	Hermione	114	“ The what ? ”
78357	78364	78366	78366	Malfoy	166	“ The Inquisitorial Squad , Granger , ”
78384	78490	78366	78366	Malfoy	166	“ A select group of students who are supportive of the Ministry of Magic , hand - picked by Professor Umbridge . Anyway , members of the Inquisitorial Squad do have the power to dock points ... So , Granger , I ’ll have five from you for being rude about our new headmistress ... Macmillan , five for contradicting me ... Five because I do n’t like you , Potter ... Weasley , your shirt ’s untucked , so I ’ll have another five for that ... Oh yeah , I forgot , you ’re a Mudblood , Granger , so ten for that ... ”
78505	78509	78498	78498	Hermione	114	“ Do n’t ! ”
78510	78516	78518	78518	Malfoy	166	“ Wise move , Granger , ”
78520	78536	78518	78518	Malfoy	166	“ New Head , new times ... Be good now , Potty ... Weasel King ... ”
78548	78553	78555	78555	Ernie	338	“ He was bluffing , ”
78560	78583	78555	78555	Ernie	338	“ He ca n’t be allowed to dock points ... that would be ridiculous ... It would completely undermine the prefect system ... ”
78662	78668	78670	78670	Fred	149	“ Noticed , have you ? ”
78700	78710	78712	78712	Harry	112	“ Malfoy just docked us all about fifty points , ”
78728	78739	78741	78741	George	150	“ Yeah , Montague tried to do us during break , ”
78743	78753	78755	78755	Ron	113	“ What do you mean , ‘ tried ’ ? ”
78758	78769	78771	78771	Fred	149	“ He never managed to get all the words out , ”
78773	78792	78771	78771	Fred	149	“ due to the fact that we forced him headfirst into that Vanishing Cabinet on the first floor . ”
78798	78807	78793	78793	Hermione	114	“ But you ’ll get into terrible trouble ! ”
78808	78827	78829	78829	Fred	149	“ Not until Montague reappears , and that could take weeks , I dunno where we sent him , ”
78832	78848	78829	78829	Fred	149	“ Anyway ... we ’ve decided we do n’t care about getting into trouble anymore . ”
78849	78854	78856	78856	Hermione	114	“ Have you ever ? ”
78858	78864	78866	78866	George	150	“ ’ Course we have , ”
78868	78876	78866	78866	George	150	“ Never been expelled , have we ? ”
78877	78888	78890	78890	Fred	149	“ We ’ve always known where to draw the line , ”
78892	78903	78905	78905	George	150	“ We might have put a toe across it occasionally , ”
78907	78919	78921	78921	Fred	149	“ But we ’ve always stopped short of causing real mayhem , ”
78923	78927	78929	78929	Ron	113	“ But now ? ”
78932	78937	78939	78939	George	150	“ Well , now — ”
78941	78948	78950	78950	Fred	149	“ — what with Dumbledore gone — ”
78952	78961	78963	78963	George	150	“ — we reckon a bit of mayhem — ”
78965	78976	78978	78978	Fred	149	“ — is exactly what our dear new Head deserves , ”
78980	78985	78987	78987	Hermione	114	“ You must n’t ! ”
78989	79004	78987	78987	Hermione	114	“ You really must n’t ! She ’d love a reason to expel you ! ”
79005	79017	79019	79019	Fred	149	“ You do n’t get it , Hermione , do you ? ”
79025	79056	79057	79057	he	149	“ We do n’t care about staying anymore . We ’d walk out right now if we were n’t determined to do our bit for Dumbledore first . So anyway , ”
79062	79101	79057	79057	he	149	“ phase one is about to begin . I ’d get in the Great Hall for lunch if I were you , that way the teachers will see you ca n’t have had anything to do with it . ”
79102	79109	79111	79111	Hermione	114	“ Anything to do with what ? ”
79114	79119	79121	79121	George	150	“ You ’ll see , ”
79123	79129	79121	79121	George	150	“ Run along , now . ”
79162	79175	79177	79177	Hermione	114	“ I think we should get out of here , you know , ”
79180	79185	79177	79177	Hermione	114	“ Just in case ... ”
79186	79192	79194	79194	Ron	113	“ Yeah , all right , ”
79261	79272	79273	79273	he	112	“ The headmistress would like to see you , Potter , ”
79276	79283	79285	79285	Harry	112	“ I did n’t do it , ”
79305	79311	79312	79312	he	172	“ Guilty conscience , eh ? ”
79315	79319	79312	79312	he	172	“ Follow me ... ”
79384	79393	79381	79381	he	172	“ Things are changing around here , Potter . ”
79394	79399	79401	79401	Harry	112	“ I ’ve noticed , ”
79404	79424	79426	79426	Filch	172	“ Yerse ... I ’ve been telling Dumbledore for years and years he ’s too soft with you all , ”
79431	79542	79426	79426	Filch	172	“ You filthy little beasts would never have dropped Stinkpellets if you ’d known I had it in my power to whip you raw , would you , now ? Nobody would have thought of throwing Fanged Frisbees down the corridors if I could ’ve strung you up by the ankles in my office , would they ? But when Educational Decree Twenty - nine comes in , Potter , I ’ll be allowed to do them things ... And she ’s asked the Minister to sign an order for the expulsion of Peeves ... Oh , things are going to be very different around here with her in charge ... ”
79595	79600	79601	79601	he	172	“ Here we are , ”
79623	79633	79601	79601	he	172	“ The Potter boy to see you , ma’am . ”
79736	79742	79743	79743	she	144	“ Thank you , Argus , ”
79747	79758	79760	79760	Filch	172	“ Not at all , ma’am , not at all , ”
79775	79778	79780	79780	Umbridge	144	“ Sit , ”
79827	79831	79832	79832	she	144	“ Well now , ”
79853	79861	79832	79832	she	144	“ What would you like to drink ? ”
79862	79865	79867	79867	Harry	112	“ What ? ”
79876	79883	79884	79884	she	144	“ To drink , Mr. Potter , ”
79892	79900	79884	79884	she	144	“ Tea ? Coffee ? Pumpkin juice ? ”
79927	79933	79935	79935	Harry	112	“ Nothing , thank you , ”
79937	79948	79949	79949	she	144	“ I wish you to have a drink with me , ”
79959	79963	79949	79949	she	144	“ Choose one . ”
79964	79970	79972	79972	Harry	112	“ Fine ... tea then , ”
80008	80011	80012	80012	she	144	“ There , ”
80020	80057	80012	80012	she	144	“ Drink it before it gets cold , wo n’t you ? Well , now , Mr. Potter ... I thought we ought to have a little chat , after the distressing events of last night . ”
80085	80092	80081	80081	she	144	“ You ’re not drinking up ! ”
80161	80167	80169	80169	Umbridge	144	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
80177	80183	80169	80169	Umbridge	144	“ Do you want sugar ? ”
80184	80187	80189	80189	Harry	112	“ No , ”
80218	80221	80222	80222	she	144	“ Good , ”
80225	80232	80222	80222	she	144	“ Very good . Now then ... ”
80239	80245	80233	80233	She	144	“ Where is Albus Dumbledore ? ”
80246	80250	80252	80252	Harry	112	“ No idea , ”
80255	80262	80263	80263	she	144	“ Drink up , drink up , ”
80269	80311	80263	80263	she	144	“ Now , Mr. Potter , let us not play childish games . I know that you know where he has gone . You and Dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning . Consider your position , Mr. Potter ... ”
80312	80321	80334	80334	Umbridge	144	“ I do n’t know where he is . ”
80328	80332	80334	80334	Umbridge	144	“ Very well , ”
80339	80355	80334	80334	Umbridge	144	“ In that case , you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black . ”
80403	80409	80410	80410	he	112	“ I do n’t know , ”
80417	80421	80423	80423	Umbridge	144	“ Mr. Potter , ”
80425	80488	80423	80423	Umbridge	144	“ let me remind you that it was I who almost caught the criminal Black in the Gryffindor fire in October . I know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if I had had any proof neither of you would be at large today , I promise you . I repeat , Mr. Potter ... Where is Sirius Black ? ”
80489	80493	80495	80495	Harry	112	“ No idea , ”
80498	80505	80495	80495	Harry	112	“ Have n’t got a clue . ”
80525	80627	80521	80521	she	1642	“ Very well , Potter , I will take your word for it this time , but be warned : The might of the Ministry stands behind me . All channels of communication in and out of this school are being monitored . A Floo Network Regulator is keeping watch over every fire in Hogwarts — except my own , of course . My Inquisitorial Squad is opening and reading all owl post entering and leaving the castle . And Mr. Filch is observing all secret passages in and out of the castle . If I find a shred of evidence ... ”
80651	80656	80657	80657	She	1642	“ What was — ? ”
80695	80704	80706	80706	Umbridge	144	“ Back to lunch with you , Potter ! ”
81003	81010	81012	81012	Umbridge	144	“ Hurry , Filch , hurry ! ”
81014	81029	81012	81012	Umbridge	144	“ They ’ll be all over the school unless we do something — Stupefy ! ”
81116	81124	81126	81126	Umbridge	144	“ Do n’t Stun them , Filch ! ”
81141	81148	81150	81150	Filch	343	“ Right you are , Headmistress ! ”
81256	81259	81260	81260	Harry	112	“ Impressive , ”
81266	81282	81260	81260	Harry	112	“ Very impressive ... You ’ll put Dr. Filibuster out of business , no problem ... ”
81283	81286	81288	81288	George	150	“ Cheers , ”
81298	81318	81288	81288	George	150	“ Oh , I hope she tries Vanishing them next ... They multiply by ten every time you try ... ”
81357	81362	81364	81365	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Dear , dear , ”
81385	81410	81364	81365	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Miss Brown , would you mind running along to the headmistress and informing her that we have an escaped firework in our classroom ? ”
81496	81504	81509	81509	his	132	“ Thank you so much , Professor ! ”
81514	81539	81509	81509	his	132	“ I could have got rid of the sparklers myself , of course , but I was n’t sure whether I had the authority ... ”
81580	81586	81587	81587	she	114	“ They were wonderful fireworks , ”
81591	81594	81596	81596	George	150	“ Thanks , ”

87231	87296	87192	87192	Lily	357	“ Messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you ’ve just got off your broomstick , showing off with that stupid Snitch , walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can — I ’m surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it . You make me SICK . ”
87306	87309	87310	87310	James	350	“ Evans ! ”
87315	87320	87310	87310	James	350	“ Hey , EVANS ! ”

87416	87428	87405	87405	Snape	255	“ Who wants to see me take off Snivelly ’s pants ? ”
87500	87504	87490	87490	Snape	255	“ Having fun ? ”
87591	87594	87596	87596	Snape	255	“ So , ”

87685	87691	87671	87671	Snape	255	“ I — did n’t — ”
87710	87720	87721	87721	Snape	255	“ You will not tell anybody what you saw ! ”

87953	87959	87960	87960	Harry	112	“ I ’ve told you , ”
87963	87979	87960	87960	Harry	112	“ Snape reckons I can carry on by myself now I ’ve got the basics ... ”
87980	87989	87991	87991	Hermione	114	“ So you ’ve stopped having funny dreams ? ”
87994	87998	88000	88000	Harry	112	“ Pretty much , ”
88007	88027	88029	88029	Hermione	114	“ Well , I do n’t think Snape should stop until you ’re absolutely sure you can control them ! ”
88032	88046	88029	88029	Hermione	114	“ Harry , I think you should go back to him and ask — ”
88047	88050	88052	88052	Harry	112	“ No , ”
88055	88064	88052	88052	Harry	112	“ Just drop it , Hermione , okay ? ”
88145	88154	88159	88159	she	114	“ How can that come as a shock ? ”
88183	88187	88189	88189	Ron	113	“ I dunno ... ”

88238	88249	88189	88189	Ron	113	“ You ’ve given me an evening off every week ! ”
88250	88257	88259	88259	Hermione	114	“ That ’s for Quidditch practice , ”
88269	88275	88276	88276	he	113	“ What ’s the point ? ”
88279	88304	88276	88276	he	113	“ We ’ve got about as much chance of winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dad ’s got of becoming Minister of Magic ... ”
88341	88348	88309	88309	She	114	“ What ’s wrong , Harry ? ”
88349	88352	88353	88353	he	113	“ What ? ”

88407	88423	88404	88404	Hermione	114	“ and she looked really miserable too ... Have you two had a row again ? ”
88424	88433	88435	88435	Harry	112	“ Wha — oh yeah , we have , ”
88443	88447	88404	88404	Hermione	114	“ What about ? ”
88448	88457	88459	88459	Harry	112	“ That sneak friend of hers , Marietta , ”
88461	88472	88474	88474	Ron	113	“ Yeah , well , I do n’t blame you ! ”
88483	88492	88474	88474	Ron	113	“ If it had n’t been for her ... ”

89107	89116	89098	89098	Harry	112	“ How come you ’re not at practice ? ”
89117	89122	89124	89124	Ginny	182	“ It ’s over , ”
89126	89139	89124	89124	Ginny	182	“ Ron had to take Jack Sloper up to the hospital wing . ”
89140	89143	89190	89190	She	182	“ Why ? ”
89144	89164	89165	89165	She	182	“ Well , we ’re not sure , but we think he knocked himself out with his own bat . ”
89169	89189	89165	89165	She	182	“ Anyway ... a package just arrived , it ’s only just got through Umbridge ’s new screening process ... ”
89233	89241	89243	89243	Ginny	182	“ It ’s Easter eggs from Mum , ”
89245	89256	89243	89243	Ginny	182	“ There ’s one for you ... There you go ... ”
89307	89314	89316	89316	Ginny	182	“ Are you okay , Harry ? ”
89319	89326	89328	89328	Harry	112	“ Yeah , I ’m fine , ”
89355	89362	89363	89363	Ginny	182	“ You seem really down lately , ”
89366	89380	89363	89363	Ginny	182	“ You know , I ’m sure if you just talked to Cho ... ”
89381	89392	89394	89394	Harry	112	“ It ’s not Cho I want to talk to , ”
89397	89404	89406	89406	Ginny	182	“ Who is it , then ? ”
89408	89411	89412	89412	He	112	“ I ... ”
89445	89454	89455	89455	he	112	“ I wish I could talk to Sirius , ”
89458	89466	89455	89455	he	112	“ But I know I ca n’t . ”
89500	89503	89505	89505	Ginny	182	“ Well , ”
89517	89539	89505	89505	Ginny	182	“ if you really want to talk to Sirius , I expect we could think of a way to do it ... ”
89540	89544	89546	89546	Harry	112	“ Come on , ”
89549	89561	89546	89546	Harry	112	“ With Umbridge policing the fires and reading all our mail ? ”
89562	89573	89575	89575	Ginny	182	“ The thing about growing up with Fred and George , ”
89578	89596	89575	89575	Ginny	182	“ is that you sort of start thinking anything ’s possible if you ’ve got enough nerve . ”
89650	89659	89643	89643	he	112	“ WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING ? ”
89660	89664	89666	89666	Ginny	182	“ Oh damn , ”
89673	89677	89666	89666	Ginny	182	“ I forgot — ”
89693	89699	89700	89700	she	273	“ Chocolate in the library ! ”
89703	89710	89700	89700	she	273	“ Out — out — OUT ! ”
89911	89920	89922	89922	Ron	113	“ Well , I do n’t fancy Healing , ”
89955	89997	89948	89949	St. Mungo	214	“ It says here you need at least an E at N.E.W.T. level in Potions , Herbology , Transfiguration , Charms , and Defense Against the Dark Arts . I mean ... blimey ... Do n’t want much , do they ? ”
89998	90012	90017	90017	She	114	“ Well , it ’s a very responsible job , is n’t it ? ”
90043	90085	90017	90017	She	114	“ You do n’t seem to need many qualifications to liaise with Muggles ... All they want is an O.W.L. in Muggle Studies ... ‘ Much more important is your enthusiasm , patience , and a good sense of fun ! ’ ”
90086	90103	90105	90105	Harry	112	“ You ’d need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle , ”
90108	90119	90120	90120	He	112	“ Good sense of when to duck , more like ... ”
90130	90191	90120	90120	He	112	“ Listen to this : ‘ Are you seeking a challenging career involving travel , adventure , and substantial , danger - related treasure bonuses ? Then consider a position with Gringotts Wizarding Bank , who are currently recruiting Curse - Breakers for thrilling opportunities abroad ... ’ They want Arithmancy , though ... You could do it , Hermione ! ”
90192	90200	90202	90202	Hermione	114	“ I do n’t much fancy banking , ”
90219	90222	90120	90120	He	112	“ Hey , ”
90244	90255	90257	90257	Fred	149	“ Ginny ’s had a word with us about you , ”
90288	90298	90257	90257	Fred	149	“ She says you need to talk to Sirius ? ”
90299	90302	90304	90304	Hermione	114	“ What ? ”
90327	90330	90332	90332	Harry	112	“ Yeah ... ”
90339	90348	90332	90332	Harry	112	“ yeah , I thought I ’d like — ”
90349	90356	90358	90358	Hermione	114	“ Do n’t be so ridiculous , ”
90375	90389	90358	90358	Hermione	114	“ With Umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls ? ”
90390	90403	90405	90405	George	150	“ Well , we think we can find a way around that , ”
90411	90443	90405	90405	George	150	“ It ’s a simple matter of causing a diversion . Now , you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem front during the Easter holidays ? ”
90444	90459	90461	90461	Fred	149	“ What was the point , we asked ourselves , of disrupting leisure time ? ”
90463	90500	90461	90461	Fred	149	“ No point at all , we answered ourselves . And of course , we ’d have messed up people ’s studying too , which would be the very last thing we ’d want to do . ”
90518	90528	90529	90529	Fred	149	“ But it ’s business as usual from tomorrow , ”
90533	90561	90529	90529	Fred	149	“ And if we ’re going to be causing a bit of uproar , why not do it so that Harry can have his chat with Sirius ? ”
90562	90568	90570	90570	Hermione	114	“ Yes , but still , ”
90584	90602	90570	90570	Hermione	114	“ even if you do cause a diversion , how is Harry supposed to talk to him ? ”
90603	90608	90610	90610	Harry	112	“ Umbridge ’s office , ”
90647	90654	90656	90656	Hermione	114	“ Are — you — insane ? ”
90681	90688	90690	90690	Harry	112	“ I do n’t think so , ”
90694	90709	90662	90662	Ron	113	“ And how are you going to get in there in the first place ? ”
90717	90722	90723	90723	he	112	“ Sirius ’s knife , ”
90726	90730	90662	90662	Ron	113	“ Excuse me ? ”
90731	90746	90748	90748	Harry	112	“ Christmas before last Sirius gave me a knife that ’ll open any lock , ”
90750	90771	90748	90748	Harry	112	“ So even if she ’s bewitched the door so Alohomora wo n’t work , which I bet she has — ”
90772	90780	90784	90784	Ron	113	“ What do you think about this ? ”
90807	90811	90813	90813	Ron	113	“ I dunno , ”
90825	90843	90813	90813	Ron	113	“ If Harry wants to do it , it ’s up to him , is n’t it ? ”
90844	90853	90855	90855	Fred	149	“ Spoken like a true friend and Weasley , ”
90864	90931	90932	90932	he	113	“ Right , then . We ’re thinking of doing it tomorrow , just after lessons , because it should cause maximum impact if everybody ’s in the corridors — Harry , we ’ll set it off in the east wing somewhere , draw her right away from her own office — I reckon we should be able to guarantee you , what , twenty minutes ? ”
90939	90942	90944	90944	George	150	“ Easy , ”
90946	90954	90956	90956	Ron	113	“ What sort of diversion is it ? ”
90958	90966	90968	90968	Fred	149	“ You ’ll see , little bro , ”
90978	91000	90971	90971	he	149	“ At least , you will if you trot along to Gregory the Smarmy ’s corridor round about five o’clock tomorrow . ”
91422	91466	91388	91388	she	114	“ ... and if she does catch you there , apart from being expelled , she ’ll be able to guess you ’ve been talking to Snuffles and this time I expect she ’ll force you to drink Veritaserum and answer her questions ... ”
91467	91470	91472	91472	Ron	113	“ Hermione , ”
91480	91505	91472	91472	Ron	113	“ are you going to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns , or am I going to have to take notes instead ? ”
91506	91520	91388	91388	she	114	“ You take notes for a change , it wo n’t kill you ! ”
91771	91774	91775	91775	he	255	“ Whoops , ”
91779	91787	91775	91775	he	255	“ Another zero , then , Potter ... ”
91828	91833	91837	91837	her	114	“ I ’m sorry ! ”
91843	91862	91837	91837	her	114	“ I ’m really sorry , Harry , I thought you ’d finished , so I cleared up ! ”
91972	91977	91978	91978	he	112	“ Sorry , Professor , ”
91987	91991	91978	91978	he	112	“ I forgot ... ”
91992	91998	91999	91999	she	114	“ No matter , Potter , ”
92052	92058	92060	92061	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Sit down , Potter , ”
92105	92139	92141	92142	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Well , Potter , this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have , and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into sixth and seventh years , ”
92144	92162	92141	92142	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave Hogwarts ? ”
92163	92166	92168	92168	Harry	112	“ Er , ”
92182	92185	92186	92187	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Yes ? ”
92191	92204	92205	92205	Harry	112	“ Well , I thought of , maybe , being an Auror , ”
92208	92217	92219	92220	Professor McGonagall	200	“ You ’d need top grades for that , ”
92239	92314	92219	92220	Professor McGonagall	200	“ They ask for a minimum of five N.E.W.T.s , and nothing under ‘ Exceeds Expectations ’ grade , I see . Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office . It ’s a difficult career path , Potter ; they only take the best . In fact , I do n’t think anybody has been taken on in the last three years . ”
92345	92361	92362	92362	she	144	“ You ’ll want to know which subjects you ought to take , I suppose ? ”
92374	92377	92379	92379	Harry	112	“ Yes , ”
92381	92391	92379	92379	Harry	112	“ Defense Against the Dark Arts , I suppose ? ”
92392	92395	92397	92398	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Naturally , ”
92401	92407	92397	92398	Professor McGonagall	200	“ I would also advise — ”
92442	92549	92550	92550	she	200	“ I would also advise Transfiguration , because Aurors frequently need to Transfigure or Untransfigure in their work . And I ought to tell you now , Potter , that I do not accept students into my N.E.W.T. classes unless they have achieved ‘ Exceeds Expectations ’ or higher at Ordinary Wizarding Level . I ’d say you ’re averaging ‘ Acceptable ’ at the moment , so you ’ll need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing . Then you ought to do Charms , always useful , and Potions . Yes , Potter , Potions , ”
92561	92598	92550	92550	she	200	“ Poisons and antidotes are essential study for Aurors . And I must tell you that Professor Snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than ‘ Outstanding ’ in their O.W.L.s , so — ”
92608	92619	92620	92621	Professor McGonagall	200	“ May I offer you a cough drop , Dolores ? ”
92631	92640	92642	92642	Umbridge	144	“ Oh no , thank you very much , ”
92653	92667	92642	92642	Umbridge	144	“ I just wondered whether I could make the teensiest interruption , Minerva ? ”
92668	92677	92679	92680	Professor McGonagall	200	“ I daresay you ’ll find you can , ”
92686	92702	92704	92705	Professor Umbridge	144	“ I was just wondering whether Mr. Potter has quite the temperament for an Auror ? ”
92708	92712	92714	92715	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Were you ? ”
92718	92723	92724	92724	she	144	“ Well , Potter , ”
92735	92826	92724	92724	she	144	“ if you are serious in this ambition , I would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch . I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between ‘ Acceptable ’ and ‘ Exceeds Expectations ’ for the last two years , so your Charm work seems satisfactory ; as for Defense Against the Dark Arts , your marks have been generally high , Professor Lupin in particular thought you — are you quite sure you would n’t like a cough drop , Dolores ? ”
92827	92838	92840	92841	Professor Umbridge	144	“ Oh , no need , thank you , Minerva , ”
92851	92886	92840	92841	Professor Umbridge	144	“ I was just concerned that you might not have Harry ’s most recent Defense Against the Dark Arts marks in front of you . I ’m quite sure I slipped in a note ... ”
92887	92893	92904	92904	she	200	“ What , this thing ? ”
92940	92968	92920	92920	She	200	“ Yes , as I was saying , Potter , Professor Lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the subject , and obviously for an Auror — ”
92969	92979	92981	92982	Professor Umbridge	144	“ Did you not understand my note , Minerva ? ”
92992	92999	93001	93002	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Of course I understood it , ”
93018	93045	93004	93004	her	200	“ Well , then , I am confused ... I ’m afraid I do n’t quite understand how you can give Mr. Potter false hope that — ”
93046	93050	93052	93053	Professor McGonagall	200	“ False hope ? ”
93064	93080	93052	93053	Professor McGonagall	200	“ He has achieved high marks in all his Defense Against the Dark Arts tests — ”
93081	93116	93004	93004	her	200	“ I ’m terribly sorry to have to contradict you , Minerva , but as you will see from my note , Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me — ”
93117	93126	93128	93129	Professor McGonagall	200	“ I should have made my meaning plainer , ”
93142	93162	93128	93129	Professor McGonagall	200	“ He has achieved high marks in all Defense Against the Dark Arts tests set by a competent teacher . ”
93221	93227	93212	93212	her	144	“ Any questions , Potter ? ”
93228	93231	93233	93233	Harry	112	“ Yes , ”
93235	93256	93233	93233	Harry	112	“ What sort of character and aptitude tests do the Ministry do on you , if you get enough N.E.W.T.s ? ”
93257	93276	93278	93279	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Well , you ’ll need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth , ”
93281	93326	93278	93279	Professor McGonagall	200	“ perseverance and dedication , because Auror training takes a further three years , not to mention very high skills in practical defense . It will mean a lot more study even after you ’ve left school , so unless you ’re prepared to — ”
93327	93335	93337	93337	Umbridge	144	“ I think you ’ll also find , ”
93345	93364	93339	93339	her	144	“ that the Ministry looks into the records of those applying to be Aurors . Their criminal records . ”
93365	93386	93339	93339	her	144	“ — unless you ’re prepared to take even more exams after Hogwarts , you should really look at another — ”
93387	93412	93339	93339	her	144	“ — which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an Auror as Dumbledore has of ever returning to this school . ”
93413	93421	93423	93424	Professor McGonagall	200	“ A very good chance , then , ”
93426	93433	93435	93435	Umbridge	144	“ Potter has a criminal record , ”
93438	93447	93449	93450	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Potter has been cleared of all charges , ”
93500	93511	93491	93491	her	144	“ Potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an Auror ! ”
93538	93541	93542	93542	she	200	“ Potter , ”
93548	93583	93542	93542	she	200	“ I will assist you to become an Auror if it is the last thing I do ! If I have to coach you nightly I will make sure you achieve the required results ! ”
93584	93595	93597	93597	Umbridge	144	“ The Minister of Magic will never employ Harry Potter ! ”
93604	93623	93625	93626	Professor McGonagall	200	“ There may well be a new Minister of Magic by the time Potter is ready to join ! ”
93628	93631	93633	93634	Professor Umbridge	144	“ Aha ! ”
93643	93700	93633	93634	Professor Umbridge	144	“ Yes ! Yes , yes , yes ! Of course ! That ’s what you want , is n’t it , Minerva McGonagall ? You want Cornelius Fudge replaced by Albus Dumbledore ! You think you ’ll be where I am , do n’t you , Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and headmistress to boot ! ”
93701	93706	93708	93709	Professor McGonagall	200	“ You are raving , ”
93714	93723	93708	93709	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Potter , that concludes our career consultation . ”
93793	93810	93811	93811	Hermione	114	“ I hope you ’ve thought better of what you were planning to do , Harry , ”
93827	93833	93811	93811	Hermione	114	“ Non - Retaliation and Negotiation ”
93836	93849	93811	93811	Hermione	114	“ Umbridge looks like she ’s in a really bad mood already ... ”
94025	94037	94042	94042	her	114	“ Dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school , Harry ! ”
94051	94067	94042	94042	her	114	“ And if you get thrown out today it will all have been for nothing ! ”
94113	94136	94102	94102	Sirius	142	“ You ’re less like your father than I thought ... The risk would ’ve been what made it fun for James ... ”
94148	94162	94163	94163	Hermione	114	“ Harry , do n’t do it , please do n’t do it ! ”
94231	94247	94224	94224	he	113	“ Give it a rest , okay ? He can make up his own mind . ”
94350	94355	94357	94357	Hermione	114	“ Harry — please ! ”
94657	94664	94665	94665	Harry	112	“ Number twelve , Grimmauld Place ! ”
94814	94817	94804	94805	a man	598	“ Sirius ? ”
94833	94836	94837	94837	he	599	“ Harry ! ”
94844	94858	94837	94837	he	599	“ What are you — what ’s happened , is everything all right ? ”
94859	94862	94864	94864	Harry	112	“ Yeah , ”
94866	94884	94864	94864	Harry	112	“ I just wondered — I mean , I just fancied a — a chat with Sirius . ”
94885	94891	94893	94893	Lupin	361	“ I ’ll call him , ”
94904	94923	94893	94893	Lupin	361	“ He went upstairs to look for Kreacher , he seems to be hiding in the attic again ... ”
94996	95001	95003	95003	Sirius	142	“ What is it ? ”
95045	95056	95036	95036	Lupin	361	“ Are you all right ? Do you need help ? ”
95057	95060	95062	95062	Harry	112	“ No , ”
95064	95081	95062	95062	Harry	112	“ it ’s nothing like that ... I just wanted to talk ... about my dad ... ”
95169	95192	95165	95165	Lupin	361	“ I would n’t like you to judge your father on what you saw there , Harry . He was only fifteen — ”
95193	95198	95200	95200	Harry	112	“ I ’m fifteen ! ”
95203	95208	95210	95210	Sirius	142	“ Look , Harry , ”
95213	95310	95210	95210	Sirius	142	“ James and Snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other , it was just one of those things , you can understand that , ca n’t you ? I think James was everything Snape wanted to be — he was popular , he was good at Quidditch , good at pretty much everything . And Snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the Dark Arts and James — whatever else he may have appeared to you , Harry — always hated the Dark Arts . ”
95311	95314	95316	95316	Harry	112	“ Yeah , ”
95318	95342	95343	95343	he	112	“ but he just attacked Snape for no good reason , just because — well , just because you said you were bored , ”
95354	95362	95364	95364	Sirius	142	“ I ’m not proud of it , ”
95376	95422	95367	95367	Lupin	361	“ Look , Harry , what you ’ve got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did — everyone thought they were the height of cool — if they sometimes got a bit carried away — ”
95423	95435	95437	95437	Sirius	142	“ If we were sometimes arrogant little berks , you mean , ”
95442	95450	95452	95452	Harry	112	“ He kept messing up his hair , ”
95463	95473	95475	95475	Sirius	142	“ I ’d forgotten he used to do that , ”
95478	95486	95488	95488	Lupin	361	“ Was he playing with the Snitch ? ”
95491	95494	95496	95496	Harry	112	“ Yeah , ”
95507	95520	95503	95503	Lupin	361	“ Well ... I thought he was a bit of an idiot . ”
95521	95532	95534	95534	Sirius	142	“ Of course he was a bit of an idiot ! ”
95537	95550	95551	95551	he	142	“ We were all idiots ! Well — not Moony so much , ”
95565	95576	95577	95577	he	361	“ Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape ? ”
95580	95598	95577	95577	he	361	“ Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order ? ”
95599	95604	95606	95606	Sirius	142	“ Yeah , well , ”
95608	95622	95606	95606	Sirius	142	“ you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes ... That was something ... ”
95623	95626	95628	95628	Harry	112	“ And , ”
95645	95663	95628	95628	Harry	112	“ he kept looking over at the girls by the lake , hoping they were watching him ! ”
95664	95681	95683	95683	Sirius	142	“ Oh , well , he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was around , ”
95687	95701	95683	95683	Sirius	142	“ He could n’t stop himself showing off whenever he got near her . ”
95702	95709	95710	95710	Harry	112	“ How come she married him ? ”
95714	95719	95710	95710	Harry	112	“ She hated him ! ”
95720	95727	95729	95729	Sirius	142	“ Nah , she did n’t , ”
95731	95742	95744	95744	Lupin	361	“ She started going out with him in seventh year , ”
95746	95756	95758	95758	Sirius	142	“ Once James had deflated his head a bit , ”
95760	95772	95774	95774	Lupin	361	“ And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it , ”
95776	95780	95782	95782	Harry	112	“ Even Snape ? ”
95784	95787	95789	95789	Lupin	361	“ Well , ”
95792	95827	95789	95789	Lupin	361	“ Snape was a special case . I mean , he never lost an opportunity to curse James , so you could n’t really expect James to take that lying down , could you ? ”
95828	95837	95789	95789	Lupin	361	“ And my mum was okay with that ? ”
95838	95854	95856	95856	Sirius	142	“ She did n’t know too much about it , to tell you the truth , ”
95858	95882	95856	95856	Sirius	142	“ I mean , James did n’t take Snape on dates with her and jinx him in front of her , did he ? ”
95894	95897	95898	95898	he	142	“ Look , ”
95901	95937	95898	95898	he	142	“ your father was the best friend I ever had , and he was a good person . A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen . He grew out of it . ”
95938	95943	95945	95945	Harry	112	“ Yeah , okay , ”
95948	95960	95945	95945	Harry	112	“ I just never thought I ’d feel sorry for Snape . ”
95961	95967	95969	95969	Lupin	361	“ Now you mention it , ”
95978	95992	95969	95969	Lupin	361	“ how did Snape react when he found you ’d seen all this ? ”
95993	96005	96007	96007	Harry	112	“ He told me he ’d never teach me Occlumency again , ”
96010	96018	96007	96007	Harry	112	“ like that ’s a big disappoint — ”
96019	96023	96025	96025	Sirius	142	“ He WHAT ? ”
96038	96045	96047	96047	Lupin	361	“ Are you serious , Harry ? ”
96050	96058	96047	96047	Lupin	361	“ He ’s stopped giving you lessons ? ”
96059	96062	96064	96064	Harry	112	“ Yeah , ”
96075	96098	96064	96064	Harry	112	“ But it ’s okay , I do n’t care , it ’s a bit of a relief to tell you the — ”
96099	96112	96114	96114	Sirius	142	“ I ’m coming up there to have a word with Snape ! ”
96132	96145	96146	96146	he	361	“ If anyone ’s going to tell Snape it will be me ! ”
96150	96184	96146	96146	he	361	“ But Harry , first of all , you ’re to go back to Snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessons — when Dumbledore hears — ”
96185	96198	96200	96200	Harry	112	“ I ca n’t tell him that , he ’d kill me ! ”
96204	96218	96200	96200	Harry	112	“ You did n’t see him when we got out of the Pensieve — ”
96219	96232	96234	96234	Lupin	361	“ Harry , there is nothing so important as you learning Occlumency ! ”
96237	96245	96234	96234	Lupin	361	“ Do you understand me ? Nothing ! ”
96246	96251	96253	96253	Harry	112	“ Okay , okay , ”
96263	96282	96253	96253	Harry	112	“ I ’ll ... I ’ll try and say something to him ... But it wo n’t be ... ”
96293	96300	96287	96287	He	112	“ Is that Kreacher coming downstairs ? ”
96301	96304	96306	96306	Sirius	142	“ No , ”
96312	96320	96306	96306	Sirius	142	“ It must be somebody your end ... ”
96328	96334	96335	96335	he	112	“ I ’d better go ! ”
96391	96396	96397	96397	he	112	“ Quickly , quickly ! ”
96409	96418	96455	96455	he	112	“ Ah , she ’s left it open ... ”
96478	96504	96455	96455	he	112	“ Approval for Whipping ... Approval for Whipping ... I can do it at last ... They ’ve had it coming to them for years ... ”
96754	96757	96759	96759	Umbridge	144	“ So ! ”
96784	96803	96759	96759	Umbridge	144	“ So ... you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp , do you ? ”
96804	96810	96812	96812	Fred	149	“ Pretty amusing , yeah , ”
96839	96848	96849	96849	he	343	“ I ’ve got the form , Headmistress , ”
96868	96890	96849	96849	he	343	“ I ’ve got the form and I ’ve got the whips waiting ... Oh , let me do it now ... ”
96891	96897	96898	96898	she	144	“ Very good , Argus , ”
96901	96905	96906	96906	she	144	“ You two , ”
96917	96930	96906	96906	she	144	“ are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school . ”
96931	96936	96938	96938	Fred	149	“ You know what ? ”
96940	96948	96938	96938	Fred	149	“ I do n’t think we are . ”
96955	96958	96960	96960	Fred	149	“ George , ”
96962	96973	96960	96960	Fred	149	“ I think we ’ve outgrown full - time education . ”
96974	96985	96987	96987	George	150	“ Yeah , I ’ve been feeling that way myself , ”
96990	97004	97006	97006	Fred	149	“ Time to test our talents in the real world , d’you reckon ? ”
97008	97011	97013	97013	George	150	“ Definitely , ”
97031	97035	97023	97023	they	1885	“ Accio Brooms ! ”
97118	97126	97127	97127	Fred	149	“ We wo n’t be seeing you , ”
97139	97150	97152	97152	George	150	“ Yeah , do n’t bother to keep in touch , ”
97174	97202	97203	97203	he	149	“ If anyone fancies buying a Portable Swamp , as demonstrated upstairs , come to number ninety - three , Diagon Alley — Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes , ”
97210	97215	97203	97203	he	149	“ Our new premises ! ”
97216	97239	97241	97241	George	150	“ Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they ’re going to use our products to get rid of this old bat , ”
97248	97252	97254	97254	Umbridge	144	“ STOP THEM ! ”
97308	97317	97292	97292	Fred	149	“ Give her hell from us , Peeves . ”
97472	97490	97467	97467	students	483	“ Honestly , some days I just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this place , ”
97494	97508	97467	97467	students	483	“ One more lesson like that and I might just do a Weasley ... ”
98031	98036	98023	98024	the students	3322	“ Umbridge - itis . ”
98301	98308	98298	98298	her	202	“ It unscrews the other way . ”
98350	98356	98358	98358	Hermione	114	“ Should we say something ? ”
98383	98399	98378	98379	Mrs. Montague	340	“ About what happened to him ? In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him ? ”
98400	98409	98411	98411	Ron	113	“ ’ Course not , he ’ll recover , ”
98414	98426	98428	98428	Harry	112	“ Anyway , more trouble for Umbridge , is n’t it ? ”
98506	98509	98511	98511	Hermione	114	“ Reparo ! ”
98525	98540	98522	98522	her	114	“ That ’s all very well , but what if Montague ’s permanently injured ? ”
98541	98545	98547	98547	Ron	113	“ Who cares ? ”
98563	98594	98522	98522	her	114	“ Montague should n’t have tried to take all those points from Gryffindor , should he ? If you want to worry about anyone , Hermione , worry about me ! ”
98595	98598	98599	98599	she	114	“ You ? ”
98629	98638	98599	98599	she	114	“ Why should I be worried about you ? ”
98639	98653	98655	98655	Ron	113	“ When Mum ’s next letter finally gets through Umbridge ’s screening process , ”
98674	98697	98655	98655	Ron	113	“ I ’m going to be in deep trouble . I would n’t be surprised if she ’s sent a Howler again . ”
98698	98701	98599	98599	she	114	“ But — ”
98702	98716	98718	98718	Ron	113	“ It ’ll be my fault Fred and George left , you wait , ”
98721	98756	98718	98718	Ron	113	“ She ’ll say I should ’ve stopped them leaving , I should ’ve grabbed the ends of their brooms and hung on or something ... Yeah , it ’ll be all my fault ... ”
98757	98812	98599	98599	she	114	“ Well , if she does say that it ’ll be very unfair , you could n’t have done anything ! But I ’m sure she wo n’t , I mean , if it ’s really true they ’ve got premises in Diagon Alley now , they must have been planning this for ages ... ”
98813	98828	98830	98830	Ron	113	“ Yeah , but that ’s another thing , how did they get premises ? ”
98852	98902	98599	98599	she	114	“ It ’s a bit dodgy , is n’t it ? They ’ll need loads of Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley , she ’ll want to know what they ’ve been up to , to get their hands on that sort of gold ... ”
98903	98914	98916	98916	Hermione	114	“ Well , yes , that occurred to me too , ”
98943	98961	98928	98928	Harry	112	“ I ’ve been wondering whether Mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful ... ”
98962	98967	98969	98969	Harry	112	“ He has n’t , ”
98972	98978	98980	98980	Ron	113	“ How do you know ? ”
98985	98988	98989	98989	Harry	112	“ Because — ”
99025	99043	99021	99021	George	150	“ Because they got the gold from me . I gave them my Triwizard winnings last June . ”
99068	99077	99078	99078	she	114	“ Oh , Harry , you did n’t ! ”
99081	99087	99089	99089	Harry	112	“ Yes , I did , ”
99092	99118	99089	99089	Harry	112	“ And I do n’t regret it either — I did n’t need the gold , and they ’ll be great at a joke shop ... ”
99119	99125	99127	99127	Ron	113	“ But this is excellent ! ”
99132	99154	99127	99127	Ron	113	“ It ’s all your fault , Harry — Mum ca n’t blame me at all ! Can I tell her ? ”
99155	99164	99166	99166	Harry	112	“ Yeah , I suppose you ’d better , ”
99169	99183	99166	99166	Harry	112	“ ’ Specially if she thinks they ’re receiving stolen cauldrons or something ... ”
99260	99272	99273	99273	he	112	“ It ’s no good nagging me , it ’s done , ”
99277	99323	99273	99273	he	112	“ Fred and George have got the gold — spent a good bit of it too , by the sounds of it — and I ca n’t get it back from them and I do n’t want to . So save your breath , Hermione . ”
99324	99337	99338	99338	she	114	“ I was n’t going to say anything about Fred and George ! ”
99357	99364	99365	99365	she	114	“ No , I was n’t ! ”
99369	99398	99365	99365	she	114	“ As a matter of fact , I was going to ask Harry when he ’s going to go back to Snape and ask for Occlumency lessons again ! ”
99512	99525	99526	99526	Hermione	114	“ You ca n’t tell me you ’ve stopped having funny dreams , ”
99530	99545	99526	99526	Hermione	114	“ because Ron told me last night you were muttering in your sleep again ... ”
99563	99571	99572	99572	he	113	“ You were only muttering a bit , ”
99576	99586	99572	99572	he	113	“ Something about ‘ just a bit farther . ’ ”
99587	99598	99599	99599	Harry	112	“ I dreamed I was watching you lot play Quidditch , ”
99603	99621	99599	99599	Harry	112	“ I was trying to get you to stretch out a bit farther to grab the Quaffle . ”
99780	99793	99795	99795	Hermione	114	“ You are trying to block your mind , are n’t you ? ”
99802	99811	99795	99795	Hermione	114	“ You are keeping going with your Occlumency ? ”
99812	99818	99820	99820	Harry	112	“ Of course I am , ”
99984	99988	99990	99990	Ron	113	“ You know , ”
99999	100022	99990	99990	Ron	113	“ if Montague does n’t recover before Slytherin play Hufflepuff , we might be in with a chance of winning the Cup . ”
100023	100030	100032	100032	Harry	112	“ Yeah , I s’pose so , ”
100041	100061	100032	100032	Harry	112	“ I mean , we ’ve won one , lost one — if Slytherin lose to Hufflepuff next Saturday — ”
100062	100069	100071	100071	Harry	112	“ Yeah , that ’s right , ”
100173	100187	100188	100188	he	112	“ I mean , I ca n’t get any worse , can I ? ”
100203	100212	100188	100188	he	112	“ Nothing to lose now , is there ? ”
100213	100217	100219	100219	Hermione	114	“ You know , ”
100242	100265	100222	100222	she	114	“ I think Ron might do better without Fred and George around . They never exactly gave him a lot of confidence ... ”
100285	100292	100294	100294	Hermione	114	“ Oh gosh , I forgot ! ”
100315	100325	100303	100303	Luna	178	“ Cho will be playing , wo n’t she ? ”
100385	100391	100373	100373	Ron	113	“ Weasley Is Our King . ”
100432	100440	100441	100441	he	112	“ ... Bradley ... Davies ... Chang , ”
100526	100532	100534	100534	Lee	152	“ And they ’re off ! ”
100536	100582	100583	100583	Lee	152	“ And Davies takes the Quaffle immediately , Ravenclaw Captain Davies with the Quaffle , he dodges Johnson , he dodges Bell , he dodges Spinnet as well ... He ’s going straight for goal ! He ’s going to shoot — and — and — ”
100588	100594	100583	100583	Lee	152	“ And he ’s scored . ”
100638	100641	100647	100647	Harry	112	“ Harry , ”
100651	100654	100647	100647	Harry	112	“ Hermione ... ”
100730	100733	100734	100734	he	116	“ Listen , ”
100737	100754	100734	100734	he	116	“ can yeh come with me ? Now ? While ev’ryone ’s watchin ’ the match ? ”
100755	100765	100767	100767	Harry	112	“ Er ... ca n’t it wait , Hagrid ? ”
100769	100776	100734	100734	he	116	“ Till the match is over ? ”
100777	100780	100782	100782	Hagrid	116	“ No , ”
100784	100807	100782	100782	Hagrid	116	“ No , Harry , it ’s got ta be now ... while ev’ryone ’s lookin ’ the other way ... Please ? ”

100905	100918	100920	100920	Hagrid	116	“ I ’ ppreciate this , you two , I really do , ”
100940	100952	100927	100927	He	116	“ I jus ’ hope she doesn ’ notice us goin’ ... ”

103430	103459	103427	103427	Hermione	114	“ Oh Hagrid , why did you bring him back if he did n’t want to come , would n’t he have been happier with his own people ? ”
103460	103476	103478	103478	Hagrid	116	“ They were all bullyin ’ him , Hermione , ’cause he ’s so small ! ”

103709	103713	103700	103700	Hermione	114	“ Absolutely minuscule ! ”
103714	103735	103620	103620	Hagrid	116	“ He was bein ’ kicked around by all o ’ them — I jus ’ couldn ’ leave him — ”
103736	103746	103748	103748	Harry	112	“ Did Madame Maxime want to bring him back ? ”
103750	103766	103768	103768	Hagrid	116	“ She — well , she could see it was right importan ’ ter me , ”
103775	103813	103768	103768	Hagrid	116	“ Bu ’ — bu ’ she got a bit tired of him after a while , I must admit ... so we split up on the journey home ... She promised not ter tell anyone though ... ”
103814	103827	103829	103829	Harry	112	“ How on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing ? ”
103831	103844	103846	103846	Hagrid	116	“ Well , tha ’s why it took so long , see , ”
103848	103888	103846	103846	Hagrid	116	“ Could on’y travel by nigh ’ an ’ through wild country an ’ stuff . ’ Course , he covers the ground pretty well when he wants ter , but he kep ’ wantin ’ ter go back ... ”
103889	103902	103904	103904	Hermione	114	“ Oh Hagrid , why on earth did n’t you let him ! ”
103922	103945	103904	103904	Hermione	114	“ What do you think you ’re going to do with a violent giant who does n’t even want to be here ! ”
103946	103961	103963	103963	Hagrid	116	“ Well , now — ‘ violent ’ — tha ’s a bit harsh , ”
103971	104009	103963	103963	Hagrid	116	“ I ’ll admit he mighta taken a couple o ’ swings at me when he ’s bin in a bad mood , but he ’s gettin ’ better , loads better , settlin ’ down well ... ”
104010	104019	104020	104020	Harry	112	“ What are those ropes for , then ? ”
104057	104066	104068	104068	Hermione	114	“ You have to keep him tied up ? ”

104144	104149	104151	104151	Hagrid	116	“ Look after him , ”
104154	104160	104151	104151	Hagrid	116	“ After I ’m gone . ”

104199	104206	104208	104208	Hagrid	116	“ Not food or anythin ’ ! ”
104211	104263	104208	104208	Hagrid	116	“ He can get his own food , no problem . Birds an ’ deer an ’ stuff ... No , it ’s company he needs . If I jus ’ knew someone was carryin ’ on tryin ’ ter help him a bit ... teachin ’ him , yeh know ... ”
104490	104498	104499	104499	Harry	112	“ You want us to teach him , ”

104572	104602	104569	104569	Hagrid	116	“ ’Cause I reckon , if he can talk ter people , he ’ll understand more that we all like him really , an ’ want him to stay ... ”
104621	104636	104637	104637	he	112	“ Kind of makes you wish we had Norbert back , does n’t it ? ”

105912	105924	105926	105926	Hagrid	116	“ Well , I reckon tha ’s enough fer one day , ”
105928	105943	105926	105926	Hagrid	116	“ We ’ll — er — we ’ll go back now , shall we ? ”
106089	106093	106095	106095	Hagrid	116	“ Hold it , ”
106154	106158	106160	106160	Hagrid	116	“ Oh blimey , ”
106163	106173	106190	106191	A man	598	“ I thought that we told you , Hagrid , ”
106180	106189	106190	106191	A man	598	“ that you are no longer welcome here ? ”
106263	106270	106272	106272	Hagrid	116	“ How are yeh , Magorian ? ”
106329	106332	106333	106333	he	322	“ So , ”
106350	106372	106333	106333	he	322	“ We agreed , I think , what we would do if this human showed his face in the forest again ? ”
106373	106383	106385	106385	Hagrid	116	“ ‘ This human ’ now , am I ? ”
106388	106401	106385	106385	Hagrid	116	“ Jus ’ fer stoppin ’ all of yeh committin ’ murder ? ”
106402	106412	106414	106414	Magorian	372	“ You ought not to have meddled , Hagrid , ”
106416	106435	106414	106414	Magorian	372	“ Our ways are not yours , nor are our laws . Firenze has betrayed and dishonored us . ”
106436	106445	106447	106447	Hagrid	116	“ I dunno how yeh work that out , ”
106450	106460	106447	106447	Hagrid	116	“ He ’s done nothin’ except help Albus Dumbledore — ”
106461	106470	106472	106481	a gray centaur with a hard , deeply lined face	2046	“ Firenze has entered into servitude to humans , ”
106483	106486	106488	106488	Hagrid	116	“ Servitude ! ”
106491	106501	106488	106488	Hagrid	116	“ He ’s doin’ Dumbledore a favor is all — ”
106502	106513	106515	106515	Magorian	372	“ He is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans , ”
106518	106528	106515	106515	Magorian	372	“ There can be no return from such disgrace . ”
106529	106535	106537	106537	Hagrid	116	“ If yeh say so , ”
106541	106553	106537	106537	Hagrid	116	“ but personally I think yeh’re makin ’ a big mistake — ”
106554	106561	106563	106563	Bane	322	“ As are you , human , ”
106565	106576	106563	106563	Bane	322	“ coming back into our forest when we warned you — ”
106577	106585	106587	106587	Hagrid	116	“ Now , you listen ter me , ”
106590	106625	106587	106587	Hagrid	116	“ I ’ll have less of the ‘ our ’ forest , if it ’s all the same ter you . It ’s not up ter you who comes an ’ goes in here — ”
106626	106637	106639	106639	Magorian	372	“ No more is it up to you , Hagrid , ”
106642	106657	106639	106639	Magorian	372	“ I shall let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young — ”
106658	106664	106666	106666	Bane	322	“ They ’re not his ! ”
106669	106692	106666	106666	Bane	322	“ Students , Magorian , from up at the school ! They have probably already profited from the traitor Firenze ’s teachings ... ”
106693	106696	106698	106698	Magorian	372	“ Nevertheless , ”
106701	106749	106698	106698	Magorian	372	“ the slaughter of foals is a terrible crime ... We do not touch the innocent . Today , Hagrid , you pass . Henceforth , stay away from this place . You forfeited the friendship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor Firenze escape us . ”
106750	106768	106770	106770	Hagrid	116	“ I won ’ be kept outta the fores ’ by a bunch of mules like you ! ”
106773	106776	106778	106778	Hermione	114	“ Hagrid , ”
106800	106810	106792	106794	the gray centaur	2047	“ let ’s go , please let ’s go ! ”
106831	106844	106845	106845	Magorian	372	“ We know what you are keeping in the forest , Hagrid ! ”
106858	106865	106845	106845	Magorian	372	“ And our tolerance is waning ! ”
106882	106903	106904	106904	he	116	“ You ’ll tolerate him as long as he ’s here , it ’s as much his forest as yours ! ”
106961	106968	106969	106969	he	116	“ Calm down , you two , ”
106983	106991	106969	106969	he	116	“ Ruddy old nags though , eh ? ”
106992	106995	106997	106997	Hermione	114	“ Hagrid , ”
107013	107039	106997	106997	Hermione	114	“ if the centaurs do n’t want humans in the forest , it does n’t really look as though Harry and I will be able — ”
107040	107049	107051	107051	Hagrid	116	“ Ah , you heard what they said , ”
107054	107080	107051	107051	Hagrid	116	“ They would n’t hurt foals — I mean , kids . Anyway , we can ’ let ourselves be pushed around by that lot ... ”
107081	107085	107086	107086	Harry	112	“ Nice try , ”
107139	107145	107147	107147	Hagrid	116	“ Was that another goal ? ”
107164	107173	107147	107147	Hagrid	116	“ Or d’you reckon the match is over ? ”
107174	107180	107182	107182	Hermione	114	“ I do n’t know , ”
107233	107243	107245	107245	Hagrid	116	“ I reckon it ’s over , yeh know ! ”
107253	107287	107245	107245	Hagrid	116	“ Look — there ’s people comin ’ out already — if you two hurry yeh’ll be able ter blend in with the crowd an ’ no one’ll know you were n’t there ! ”
107288	107292	107294	107294	Harry	112	“ Good idea , ”
107296	107307	107294	107294	Harry	112	“ Well ... see you later , then , Hagrid ... ”
107308	107315	107317	107317	Hermione	114	“ I do n’t believe him , ”
107334	107348	107317	107317	Hermione	114	“ I do n’t believe him . I really do n’t believe him ... ”
107349	107353	107355	107355	Harry	112	“ Calm down , ”
107357	107361	107362	107362	she	114	“ Calm down ! ”
107366	107417	107362	107362	she	114	“ A giant ! A giant in the forest ! And we ’re supposed to give him English lessons ! Always assuming , of course , we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in and out ! I — do n’t — believe — him ! ”
107418	107428	107429	107429	Harry	112	“ We have n’t got to do anything yet ! ”
107453	107474	107429	107429	Harry	112	“ He ’s not asking us to do anything unless he gets chucked out and that might not even happen — ”
107475	107483	107485	107485	Hermione	114	“ Oh come off it , Harry ! ”
107506	107534	107485	107485	Hermione	114	“ Of course he ’s going to be chucked out and to be perfectly honest , after what we ’ve just seen , who can blame Umbridge ? ”
107554	107561	107563	107563	Harry	112	“ You did n’t mean that , ”
107566	107578	107579	107579	she	114	“ No ... well ... all right ... I did n’t , ”
107587	107604	107579	107579	she	114	“ But why does he have to make life so difficult for himself — for us ? ”
107605	107609	107667	107667	Hermione	114	“ I dunno — ”
107610	107622	107624	107624	Hermione	114	“ And I wish they ’d stop singing that stupid song , ”
107627	107634	107624	107624	Hermione	114	“ have n’t they gloated enough ? ”
107650	107665	107667	107667	Hermione	114	“ Oh , let ’s get in before we have to meet the Slytherins , ”
107669	107672	107674	107674	Harry	112	“ Hermione ... ”
107726	107729	107731	107731	Hermione	114	“ No ! ”
107737	107740	107742	107742	Harry	112	“ YES ! ”
107745	107750	107752	107752	Ron	113	“ HARRY ! HERMIONE ! ”
107768	107776	107766	107766	himself	113	“ WE DID IT ! WE WON ! ”
107849	107854	107836	107836	Hermione	114	“ Weasley Is Our King ”
107869	107881	107883	107883	Harry	112	“ We ’ll save our news till tomorrow , shall we ? ”
107885	107891	107893	107893	Hermione	114	“ Yes , all right , ”
107896	107904	107893	107893	Hermione	114	“ I ’m not in any hurry ... ”
108133	108139	108120	108120	Gryffindors	159	“ Weasley Is Our King , ”
108188	108309	108310	108310	he	2071	“ Well , I mean , I ’d already let in that one of Davies ’s , so I was n’t feeling that confident , but I dunno , when Bradley came toward me , just out of nowhere , I thought — you can do this ! And I had about a second to decide which way to fly , you know , because he looked like he was aiming for the right goal hoop — my right , obviously , his left — but I had a funny feeling that he was feinting , and so I took the chance and flew left — his right , I mean — and — well — you saw what happened , ”
108351	108367	108368	108368	Ron	113	“ And then , when Chambers came at me about five minutes later — what ? ”
108383	108389	108368	108368	Ron	113	“ Why are you grinning ? ”
108390	108395	108397	108397	Harry	112	“ I ’m not , ”
108440	108452	108424	108438	another Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree	2075	“ I ’m just glad we won , that ’s all . ”
108453	108456	108458	108458	Ron	113	“ Yeah , ”
108465	108490	108458	108458	Ron	113	“ we won . Did you see the look on Chang ’s face when Ginny got the Snitch right out from under her nose ? ”
108491	108500	108502	108502	Harry	112	“ I suppose she cried , did she ? ”
108505	108519	108520	108520	Ron	113	“ Well , yeah — more out of temper than anything , though ... ”
108524	108545	108520	108520	Ron	113	“ But you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground , did n’t you ? ”
108546	108549	108551	108551	Harry	112	“ Er — ”
108553	108562	108564	108564	Hermione	114	“ Well , actually ... no , Ron , ”
108580	108603	108564	108564	Hermione	114	“ As a matter of fact , the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was Davies ’s first goal . ”
108615	108621	108622	108622	he	113	“ You did n’t watch ? ”
108633	108645	108622	108622	he	113	“ You did n’t see me make any of those saves ? ”
108646	108651	108653	108653	Hermione	114	“ Well — no , ”
108663	108678	108653	108653	Hermione	114	“ But Ron , we did n’t want to leave — we had to ! ”
108679	108682	108684	108684	Ron	113	“ Yeah ? ”
108693	108697	108684	108684	Ron	113	“ How come ? ”
108698	108703	108705	108705	Harry	112	“ It was Hagrid , ”
108707	108753	108705	108705	Harry	112	“ He decided to tell us why he ’s been covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants . He wanted us to go into the forest with him , we had no choice , you know how he gets ... Anyway ... ”
108780	108792	108836	108836	Hermione	114	“ He brought one back and hid it in the forest ? ”
108793	108796	108798	108798	Harry	112	“ Yep , ”
108801	108804	108806	108806	Ron	113	“ No , ”
108819	108827	108806	108806	Ron	113	“ No , he ca n’t have ... ”
108828	108834	108836	108836	Hermione	114	“ Well , he has , ”
108839	108860	108861	108861	she	114	“ Grawp ’s about sixteen feet tall , enjoys ripping up twenty - foot pine trees , and knows me , ”
108864	108868	108861	108861	she	114	“ as Hermy . ”
108875	108883	108869	108869	Ron	113	“ And Hagrid wants us to ... ? ”
108884	108891	108893	108893	Harry	112	“ Teach him English , yeah , ”
108895	108902	108904	108904	Ron	113	“ He ’s lost his mind , ”
108911	108914	108916	108916	Hermione	114	“ Yes , ”
108943	108964	108916	108916	Hermione	114	“ Yes , I ’m starting to think he has . But unfortunately , he made Harry and me promise . ”
108965	108983	108985	108985	Ron	113	“ Well , you ’re just going to have to break your promise , that ’s all , ”
108988	109006	109007	109007	he	113	“ I mean , come on ... We ’ve got exams and we ’re about that far , ”
109021	109055	109007	109007	he	113	“ from being chucked out as it is . And anyway ... remember Norbert ? Remember Aragog ? Have we ever come off better for mixing with any of Hagrid ’s monster mates ? ”
109056	109068	109070	109070	Hermione	114	“ I know , it ’s just that — we promised , ”
109086	109089	109090	109090	he	113	“ Well , ”
109093	109133	109090	109090	he	113	“ Hagrid has n’t been sacked yet , has he ? He ’s hung on this long , maybe he ’ll hang on till the end of term and we wo n’t have to go near Grawp at all . ”
109366	109378	109379	109379	he	338	“ How many hours d’you think you ’re doing a day ? ”
109398	109402	109404	109404	Ron	113	“ I dunno , ”
109406	109410	109404	109404	Ron	113	“ A few ... ”
109411	109418	109395	109395	his	338	“ More or less than eight ? ”
109419	109425	109427	109427	Ron	113	“ Less , I s’pose , ”
109433	109439	109441	109441	Ernie	338	“ I ’m doing eight , ”
109448	109504	109441	109441	Ernie	338	“ Eight or nine . I ’m getting an hour in before breakfast every day . Eight ’s my average . I can do ten on a good weekend day . I did nine and a half on Monday . Not so good on Tuesday — only seven and a quarter . Then on Wednesday — ”
109540	109551	109552	109552	he	166	“ Of course , it ’s not what you know , ”
109573	109611	109552	109552	he	166	“ it ’s who you know . Now , Father ’s been friendly with the head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years — old Griselda Marchbanks — we ’ve had her round for dinner and everything ... ”
109612	109620	109621	109621	Hermione	114	“ Do you think that ’s true ? ”
109631	109642	109644	109644	Ron	113	“ Nothing we can do about it if it is , ”
109647	109656	109658	109658	Neville	161	“ I do n’t think it ’s true , ”
109664	109684	109658	109658	Neville	161	“ Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran ’s , and she ’s never mentioned the Malfoys . ”
109685	109693	109695	109695	Hermione	114	“ What ’s she like , Neville ? ”
109699	109704	109695	109695	Hermione	114	“ Is she strict ? ”
109705	109712	109714	109714	Neville	161	“ Bit like Gran , really , ”
109720	109733	109734	109734	Ron	113	“ Knowing her wo n’t hurt your chances though , will it ? ”
109739	109752	109754	109754	Neville	161	“ Oh , I do n’t think it will make any difference , ”
109760	109789	109754	109754	Neville	161	“ Gran ’s always telling Professor Marchbanks I ’m not as good as my dad ... Well ... you saw what she ’s like at St. Mungo ’s ... ”
109894	109896	109916	109916	Ron	113	“ Outstanding ”
109959	109968	109970	109970	Ron	113	“ Hermione , we wanted to buy that ! ”
109972	109978	109979	109979	she	114	“ Do n’t be stupid , ”
109982	109999	109979	109979	she	114	“ You might as well take Dingle ’s powdered dragon claw and have done with it . ”
110000	110008	110010	110010	Ron	113	“ Dingle ’s got powdered dragon claw ? ”
110013	110017	110019	110019	Hermione	114	“ Not anymore , ”
110021	110036	110019	110019	Hermione	114	“ I confiscated that too . None of these things actually works you know — ”
110037	110043	110045	110045	Ron	113	“ Dragon claw does work ! ”
110047	110088	110045	110045	Ron	113	“ It ’s supposed to be incredible , really gives your brain a boost , you come over all cunning for a few hours — Hermione , let me have a pinch , go on , it ca n’t hurt — ”
110089	110094	110096	110096	Hermione	114	“ This stuff can , ”
110099	110116	110096	110096	Hermione	114	“ I ’ve had a look at it , and it ’s actually dried doxy droppings . ”
110150	110156	110157	110158	Professor McGonagall	200	“ As you can see , ”
110177	110311	110157	110158	Professor McGonagall	200	“ your O.W.L.s are spread over two successive weeks . You will sit the theory exams in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons . Your practical Astronomy examination will , of course , take place at night . Now , I must warn you that the most stringent Anti - Cheating Charms have been applied to your examination papers . Auto - Answer Quills are banned from the examination hall , as are Remembralls , Detachable Cribbing Cuffs , and Self - Correcting Ink . Every year , I am afraid to say , seems to harbor at least one student who thinks that he or she can get around the Wizarding Examinations Authority ’s rules . I can only hope that it is nobody in Gryffindor . Our new — headmistress ”
110340	110379	110323	110323	her	200	“ has asked the Heads of House to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severely — because , of course , your examination results will reflect upon the headmistress ’s new regime at the school ... ”
110397	110420	110392	110392	her	200	“ However , that is no reason not to do your very best . You have your own futures to think about . ”
110421	110426	110430	110430	her	114	“ Please , Professor , ”
110436	110445	110430	110430	her	114	“ when will we find out our results ? ”
110446	110459	110461	110462	Professor McGonagall	200	“ An owl will be sent to you some time in July , ”
110464	110467	110469	110470	Dean Thomas	189	“ Excellent , ”
110476	110490	110469	110470	Dean Thomas	189	“ so we do n’t have to worry about it till the holidays ... ”
110600	110610	110611	110611	he	112	“ Why do n’t you just do it yourself ? ”
110808	110814	110815	110815	she	114	“ Oh , my goodness , ”
110825	110835	110815	110815	she	114	“ Is that them ? Is that the examiners ? ”
110881	110891	110893	110893	Ron	113	“ Shall we go and have a closer look ? ”
110985	111003	111004	111004	she	2099	“ Journey was fine , journey was fine , we ’ve made it plenty of times before ! ”
111008	111019	111020	111020	she	2099	“ Now , I have n’t heard from Dumbledore lately ! ”
111039	111049	111020	111020	she	2099	“ No idea where he is , I suppose ? ”
111050	111055	111057	111057	Umbridge	144	“ None at all , ”
111090	111105	111082	111082	Ron	113	“ But I daresay the Ministry of Magic will track him down soon enough ... ”
111106	111111	111113	111115	tiny Professor Marchbanks	377	“ I doubt it , ”
111117	111155	111113	111115	tiny Professor Marchbanks	377	“ not if Dumbledore does n’t want to be found ! I should know ... Examined him personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did N.E.W.T.s ... Did things with a wand I ’d never seen before ... ”
111156	111161	111163	111164	Professor Umbridge	144	“ Yes ... well ... ”
111185	111207	111171	111171	Hermione	114	“ let me show you to the staffroom ... I daresay you ’d like a cup of tea after your journey ... ”
111501	111506	111498	111498	she	114	“ You may begin , ”
111625	111637	111639	111639	Hermione	114	“ Well , it was n’t too bad , was it ? ”
111655	111706	111639	111639	Hermione	114	“ I ’m not sure I did myself justice on Cheering Charms , I just ran out of time — did you put in the countercharm for hiccups ? I was n’t sure whether I ought to , it felt like too much — and on question twenty - three — ”
111707	111710	111712	111712	Ron	113	“ Hermione , ”
111715	111740	111712	111712	Ron	113	“ we ’ve been through this before ... We ’re not going through every exam afterward , it ’s bad enough doing them once . ”
111868	111889	111891	111891	Ron	113	“ She ’ll be fine — remember she got a hundred and twelve percent on one of our Charms tests ? ”
111901	111905	111907	111907	Ron	113	“ Good luck , ”
111926	111934	111936	111937	Professor Flitwick	132	“ Professor Tofty is free , Potter , ”
111988	111994	112000	112000	his	385	“ Potter , is it ? ”
112015	112020	112000	112000	his	385	“ The famous Potter ? ”
112070	112075	112076	112076	he	385	“ That ’s it , ”
112084	112111	112076	112076	he	385	“ no need to be nervous ... Now , if I could ask you to take this eggcup and make it do some cartwheels for me ... ”
112456	112460	112462	112463	Professor Tofty	385	“ Oh bravo ! ”
112480	112497	112472	112472	Harry	112	“ Very good indeed ! Well , I think that ’s all , Potter ... unless ... ”
112504	112528	112498	112498	He	385	“ I heard , from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden , that you can produce a Patronus ? For a bonus point ... ? ”
112545	112549	112531	112531	his	112	“ Expecto Patronum ! ”
112596	112599	112600	112600	he	385	“ Excellent ! ”
112603	112613	112600	112600	he	385	“ Very well , Potter , you may go ! ”
112673	112675	112668	112668	he	112	“ Outstanding ”
112804	112810	112812	112812	Ron	113	“ How were the runes ? ”
112818	112825	112827	112827	Hermione	114	“ I mistranslated ‘ ehwaz , ’ ”
112830	112851	112827	112827	Hermione	114	“ It means ‘ partnership , ’ not ‘ defense , ’ I mixed it up with ‘ eihwaz . ’ ”
112852	112856	112858	112858	Ron	113	“ Ah well , ”
112861	112877	112858	112858	Ron	113	“ that ’s only one mistake , is n’t it , you ’ll still get — ”
112878	112883	112885	112885	Hermione	114	“ Oh shut up , ”
112888	112965	112885	112885	Hermione	114	“ it could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail . And what ’s more , someone ’s put another niffler in Umbridge ’s office , I do n’t know how they got it through that new door , but I just walked past there and Umbridge is shrieking her head off — by the sound of it , it tried to take a chunk out of her leg — ”
112966	112969	112971	112971	Harry	112	“ Good , ”
112976	112982	112984	112984	Hermione	114	“ It is not good ! ”
112987	113007	112984	112984	Hermione	114	“ She thinks it ’s Hagrid doing it , remember ? And we do not want Hagrid chucked out ! ”
113008	113022	113024	113024	Harry	112	“ He ’s teaching at the moment , she ca n’t blame him , ”
113032	113052	113054	113054	Hermione	114	“ Oh , you ’re so naive sometimes , Harry , you really think Umbridge will wait for proof ? ”
113082	113092	113094	113094	Ron	113	“ Such a lovely , sweet - tempered girl , ”
113290	113304	113286	113287	Professor Marchbanks	377	“ Step away from your cauldrons , please , the examination is over , ”
113332	113338	113340	113341	Parvati Patil	153	“ Only four exams left , ”
113352	113355	113357	113357	Hermione	114	“ Only ! ”
113360	113375	113357	113357	Hermione	114	“ I ’ve got Arithmancy and it ’s probably the toughest subject there is ! ”
113756	113768	113770	113770	Ron	113	“ Well , we were always going to fail that one , ”
113827	113841	113843	113843	Harry	112	“ We should n’t have taken the stupid subject in the first place , ”
113845	113857	113818	113818	he	113	“ Still , at least we can give it up now . ”
113858	113861	113863	113863	Harry	112	“ Yeah , ”
113865	113881	113863	113863	Harry	112	“ No more pretending we care what happens when Jupiter and Uranus get too friendly ... ”
113882	113915	113818	113818	he	113	“ And from now on , I do n’t care if my tea leaves spell die , Ron , die — I ’m just chucking them in the bin where they belong . ”
113939	113952	113953	113953	she	114	“ Well , I think I ’ve done all right in Arithmancy , ”
113965	113981	113959	113959	Ron	113	“ Just time for a quick look over our star charts before dinner , then ... ”
114701	114712	114713	114713	he	385	“ Try and concentrate , now , boys and girls , ”
114738	114746	114748	114749	Professor Tofty	385	“ Ahem — twenty minutes to go , ”
114796	114799	114793	114794	Several people	519	“ Ouch ! ”
114885	114888	114890	114890	Hermione	114	“ No ! ”
114892	114896	114898	114899	Professor Tofty	385	“ My dear ! ”
114905	114911	114898	114899	Professor Tofty	385	“ This is an examination ! ”
114975	114981	114971	114972	a man	598	“ Be reasonable , Hagrid ! ”
114986	115001	114983	114983	Hagrid	116	“ Reasonable be damned , yeh won ’ take me like this , Dawlish ! ”
115105	115108	115110	115110	Parvati	153	“ Look ! ”
115158	115163	115165	115166	Professor Tofty	385	“ Now , really ! ”
115169	115178	115165	115166	Professor Tofty	385	“ Only sixteen minutes left , you know ! ”
115202	115207	115208	115209	the figure	2222	“ How dare you ! ”
115215	115220	115208	115209	the figure	2222	“ How dare you ! ”
115221	115226	115228	115228	Hermione	114	“ It ’s McGonagall ! ”
115230	115240	115242	115243	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Leave him alone ! Alone , I say ! ”
115250	115269	115242	115243	Professor McGonagall	200	“ On what grounds are you attacking him ? He has done nothing , nothing to warrant such — ”
115341	115345	115347	115348	Professor Tofty	385	“ Galloping gargoyles ! ”
115359	115370	115347	115348	Professor Tofty	385	“ Not so much as a warning ! Outrageous behavior ! ”
115371	115374	115376	115376	Hagrid	116	“ COWARDS ! ”
115399	115413	115378	115378	his	116	“ RUDDY COWARDS ! HAVE SOME O ’ THAT — AN ’ THAT — ”
115414	115418	115420	115420	Hermione	114	“ Oh my — ”
115500	115507	115509	115509	Umbridge	144	“ Get him , get him ! ”
115615	115625	115608	115609	Professor Tofty	385	“ Um ... five minutes to go , everybody ... ”
115704	115709	115711	115711	Hermione	114	“ That evil woman ! ”
115724	115737	115711	115711	Hermione	114	“ Trying to sneak up on Hagrid in the dead of night ! ”
115738	115750	115752	115753	Ernie Macmillan	338	“ She clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawney ’s , ”
115762	115771	115773	115773	Ron	113	“ Hagrid did well , did n’t he ? ”
115782	115792	115773	115773	Ron	113	“ How come all the spells bounced off him ? ”
115793	115801	115803	115803	Hermione	114	“ It ’ll be his giant blood , ”
115806	115846	115803	115803	Hermione	114	“ It ’s very hard to Stun a giant , they ’re like trolls , really tough ... But poor Professor McGonagall ... Four Stunners straight in the chest , and she ’s not exactly young , is she ? ”
115847	115852	115854	115854	Ernie	338	“ Dreadful , dreadful , ”
115861	115875	115854	115854	Ernie	338	“ Well , I ’m off to bed ... ’ Night , all ... ”
115893	115907	115909	115909	Ron	113	“ At least they did n’t get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban , ”
115911	115926	115909	115909	Ron	113	“ I ’ spect he ’s gone to join Dumbledore , has n’t he ? ”
115927	115932	115934	115934	Hermione	114	“ I suppose so , ”
115940	115965	115934	115934	Hermione	114	“ Oh , this is awful , I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long , but now we ’ve lost Hagrid too ... ”
116030	116037	116039	116040	Angelina Johnson	179	“ But why sack Hagrid now ? ”
116046	116064	116039	116040	Angelina Johnson	179	“ It ’s not like Trelawney , he ’s been teaching much better than usual this year ! ”
116065	116072	116074	116074	Hermione	114	“ Umbridge hates part - humans , ”
116083	116095	116074	116074	Hermione	114	“ She was always going to try and get Hagrid out . ”
116096	116108	116111	116112	Katie Bell	180	“ And she thought Hagrid was putting nifflers in her office , ”
116114	116118	116120	116121	Lee Jordan	152	“ Oh blimey , ”
116127	116158	116120	116121	Lee Jordan	152	“ It ’s me ’s been putting the nifflers in her office , Fred and George left me a couple , I ’ve been levitating them in through her window ... ”
116159	116167	116169	116169	Dean	189	“ She ’d have sacked him anyway , ”
116171	116179	116169	116169	Dean	189	“ He was too close to Dumbledore . ”
116180	116185	116187	116187	Harry	112	“ That ’s true , ”
116197	116207	116209	116209	Lavender	154	“ I just hope Professor McGonagall ’s all right , ”
116212	116229	116231	116232	Colin Creevey	394	“ They carried her back up to the castle , we watched through the dormitory window , ”
116234	116242	116231	116232	Colin Creevey	394	“ She did n’t look very well ... ”
116243	116251	116253	116254	Alicia Spinnet	365	“ Madam Pomfrey will sort her out , ”
116257	116264	116253	116254	Alicia Spinnet	365	“ She ’s never failed yet . ”
116521	116527	116529	116530	Professor Marchbanks	377	“ Turn over your papers , ”
116544	116549	116529	116530	Professor Marchbanks	377	“ You may begin ... ”
117443	117465	117428	117428	his	112	“ Take it for me ... Lift it down , now ... I can not touch it ... but you can ... ”
117504	117507	117535	117535	his	112	“ Crucio ! ”
117550	117556	117533	117533	He	112	“ Lord Voldemort is waiting ... ”
117595	117603	117605	117605	Sirius	142	“ You ’ll have to kill me , ”
117607	117615	117617	117619	the cold voice	2278	“ Undoubtedly I shall in the end , ”
117621	117658	117617	117619	the cold voice	2278	“ But you will fetch it for me first , Black ... You think you have felt pain thus far ? Think again ... We have hours ahead of us and nobody to hear you scream ... ”
117708	117727	117728	117728	He	112	“ I ’m not going ... I do n’t need the hospital wing ... I do n’t want ... ”
117768	117778	117779	117779	Harry	112	“ I ’m — I ’m fine , sir , ”
117789	117801	117779	117779	Harry	112	“ Really ... I just fell asleep ... Had a nightmare ... ”
117802	117807	117809	117811	the old wizard	2284	“ Pressure of examinations ! ”
117821	117871	117809	117811	the old wizard	2284	“ It happens , young man , it happens ! Now , a cooling drink of water , and perhaps you will be ready to return to the Great Hall ? The examination is nearly over , but you may be able to round off your last answer nicely ? ”
117872	117875	117877	117877	Harry	112	“ Yes , ”
117880	117900	117877	117877	Harry	112	“ I mean ... no ... I ’ve done — done as much as I can , I think ... ”
117901	117908	117910	117912	the old wizard	2284	“ Very well , very well , ”
117915	117938	117910	117912	the old wizard	2284	“ I shall go and collect your examination paper , and I suggest that you go and have a nice lie down ... ”
117939	117945	117947	117947	Harry	112	“ I ’ll do that , ”
117952	117957	117947	117947	Harry	112	“ Thanks very much . ”
118040	118051	118018	118019	Madam Pomfrey	120	“ Potter , what do you think you ’re doing ? ”
118052	118060	118062	118062	Harry	112	“ I need to see Professor McGonagall , ”
118070	118077	118062	118062	Harry	112	“ Now ... It ’s urgent ... ”
118078	118086	118088	118089	Madam Pomfrey	120	“ She ’s not here , Potter , ”
118092	118124	118088	118089	Madam Pomfrey	120	“ She was transferred to St. Mungo ’s this morning . Four Stunning Spells straight to the chest at her age ? It ’s a wonder they did n’t kill her . ”
118125	118131	118133	118133	Harry	112	“ She ’s ... gone ? ”
118221	118232	118234	118235	Madam Pomfrey	120	“ I do n’t wonder you ’re shocked , Potter , ”
118246	118293	118243	118243	her	120	“ As if one of them could have Stunned Minerva McGonagall face on by daylight ! Cowardice , that ’s what it was ... Despicable cowardice ... If I was n’t worried what would happen to you students without me , I ’d resign in protest ... ”
118294	118297	118299	118299	Harry	112	“ Yes , ”
118398	118401	118403	118403	Hermione	114	“ Harry ! ”
118411	118424	118403	118403	Hermione	114	“ What happened ? Are you all right ? Are you ill ? ”
118425	118431	118433	118433	Ron	113	“ Where have you been ? ”
118435	118440	118441	118441	Harry	112	“ Come with me , ”
118445	118457	118441	118441	Harry	112	“ Come on , I ’ve got to tell you something ... ”
118504	118510	118458	118458	He	112	“ Voldemort ’s got Sirius . ”
118511	118514	118458	118458	He	112	“ What ? ”
118515	118520	118458	118458	He	112	“ How d’you — ? ”
118521	118536	118458	118458	He	112	“ Saw it . Just now . When I fell asleep in the exam . ”
118537	118545	118547	118547	Hermione	114	“ But — but where ? How ? ”
118554	118559	118561	118561	Harry	112	“ I dunno how , ”
118563	118631	118561	118561	Harry	112	“ But I know exactly where . There ’s a room in the Department of Mysteries full of shelves covered in these little glass balls , and they ’re at the end of row ninety - seven ... He ’s trying to use Sirius to get whatever it is he wants from in there ... He ’s torturing him ... Says he ’ll end by killing him ... ”
118661	118670	118671	118671	he	112	“ How ’re we going to get there ? ”
118686	118692	118683	118683	Ron	113	“ G - get there ? ”
118693	118707	118708	118708	Harry	112	“ Get to the Department of Mysteries , so we can rescue Sirius ! ”
118712	118717	118719	118719	Ron	113	“ But — Harry ... ”
118722	118727	118729	118729	Harry	112	“ What ? What ? ”
118751	118754	118756	118756	Hermione	114	“ Harry , ”
118763	118784	118756	118756	Hermione	114	“ er ... how ... how did Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without anybody realizing he was there ? ”
118785	118791	118793	118793	Harry	112	“ How do I know ? ”
118795	118808	118793	118793	Harry	112	“ The question is how we ’re going to get in there ! ”
118809	118818	118820	118820	Hermione	114	“ But ... Harry , think about this , ”
118828	118886	118820	118820	Hermione	114	“ it ’s five o’clock in the afternoon ... The Ministry of Magic must be full of workers ... How would Voldemort and Sirius have got in without being seen ? Harry ... they ’re probably the two most wanted wizards in the world ... You think they could get into a building full of Aurors undetected ? ”
118887	118899	118900	118900	Harry	112	“ I dunno , Voldemort used an Invisibility Cloak or something ! ”
118903	118920	118900	118900	Harry	112	“ Anyway , the Department of Mysteries has always been completely empty whenever I ’ve been — ”
118921	118930	118932	118932	Hermione	114	“ You ’ve never been there , Harry , ”
118935	118947	118932	118932	Hermione	114	“ You ’ve dreamed about the place , that ’s all . ”
118948	118955	118956	118956	Harry	112	“ They ’re not normal dreams ! ”
118980	119005	118974	118974	He	112	“ How d’you explain Ron ’s dad then , what was all that about , how come I knew what had happened to him ? ”
119006	119013	119015	119015	Ron	113	“ He ’s got a point , ”
119022	119032	119034	119034	Hermione	114	“ But this is just — just so unlikely ! ”
119037	119061	119034	119034	Hermione	114	“ Harry , how on earth could Voldemort have got hold of Sirius when he ’s been in Grimmauld Place all the time ? ”
119062	119074	119076	119076	Ron	113	“ Sirius might ’ve cracked and just wanted some fresh air , ”
119081	119095	119076	119076	Ron	113	“ He ’s been desperate to get out of that house for ages — ”
119096	119100	119101	119101	Hermione	114	“ But why , ”
119104	119125	119101	119101	Hermione	114	“ why on earth would Voldemort want to use Sirius to get the weapon , or whatever the thing is ? ”
119126	119137	119138	119138	Harry	112	“ I dunno , there could be loads of reasons ! ”
119143	119157	119138	119138	Harry	112	“ Maybe Sirius is just someone Voldemort does n’t care about seeing hurt — ”
119158	119170	119172	119172	Ron	113	“ You know what , I ’ve just thought of something , ”
119178	119204	119172	119172	Ron	113	“ Sirius ’s brother was a Death Eater , was n’t he ? Maybe he told Sirius the secret of how to get the weapon ! ”
119205	119226	119228	119228	Harry	112	“ Yeah — and that ’s why Dumbledore ’s been so keen to keep Sirius locked up all the time ! ”
119230	119237	119239	119239	Hermione	114	“ Look , I ’m sorry , ”
119241	119270	119239	119239	Hermione	114	“ but neither of you are making sense , and we ’ve got no proof for any of this , no proof Voldemort and Sirius are even there — ”
119271	119279	119281	119281	Ron	113	“ Hermione , Harry ’s seen them ! ”
119287	119290	119291	119291	she	114	“ Okay , ”
119299	119308	119291	119291	she	114	“ I ’ve just got to say this ... ”
119309	119312	119239	119239	Hermione	114	“ What ? ”
119313	119354	119355	119355	she	114	“ You ... This is n’t a criticism , Harry ! But you do ... sort of ... I mean — do n’t you think you ’ve got a bit of a — a — saving - people - thing ? ”
119363	119381	119358	119358	He	113	“ And what ’s that supposed to mean , a ‘ saving - people - thing ’ ? ”
119382	119387	119388	119388	She	114	“ Well ... you ... ”
119395	119440	119388	119388	She	114	“ I mean ... last year , for instance ... in the lake ... during the Tournament ... you should n’t have ... I mean , you did n’t need to save that little Delacour girl ... You got a bit ... carried away ... ”
119463	119477	119479	119479	Hermione	114	“ ... I mean , it was really great of you and everything , ”
119493	119504	119479	119479	Hermione	114	“ Everyone thought it was a wonderful thing to do — ”
119505	119510	119512	119512	Harry	112	“ That ’s funny , ”
119518	119551	119512	119512	Harry	112	“ because I definitely remember Ron saying I ’d wasted time acting the hero ... Is that what you think this is ? You reckon I want to act the hero again ? ”
119552	119559	119561	119561	Hermione	114	“ No , no , no ! ”
119566	119576	119561	119561	Hermione	114	“ That ’s not what I mean at all ! ”
119577	119596	119597	119597	Harry	112	“ Well , spit out what you ’ve got to say , because we ’re wasting time here ! ”
119600	119670	119561	119561	Hermione	114	“ I ’m trying to say — Voldemort knows you , Harry ! He took Ginny down into the Chamber of Secrets to lure you there , it ’s the kind of thing he does , he knows you ’re the — the sort of person who ’d go to Sirius ’s aid ! What if he ’s just trying to get you into the Department of Myst — ? ”
119671	119725	119561	119561	Hermione	114	“ Hermione , it does n’t matter if he ’s done it to get me there or not — they ’ve taken McGonagall to St. Mungo ’s , there is n’t anyone left from the Order at Hogwarts who we can tell , and if we do n’t go , Sirius is dead ! ”
119726	119743	119561	119561	Hermione	114	“ But Harry — what if your dream was — was just that , a dream ? ”
119762	119769	119770	119770	Harry	112	“ You do n’t get it ! ”
119775	119899	119901	119901	he	2307	“ I ’m not having nightmares , I ’m not just dreaming ! What d’you think all the Occlumency was for , why d’you think Dumbledore wanted me prevented from seeing these things ? Because they ’re REAL , Hermione — Sirius is trapped — I ’ve seen him — Voldemort ’s got him , and no one else knows , and that means we ’re the only ones who can save him , and if you do n’t want to do it , fine , but I ’m going , understand ? And if I remember rightly , you did n’t have a problem with my saving - people - thing when it was you I was saving from the dementors , or ”
119906	119919	119901	119901	he	2307	“ when it was your sister I was saving from the basilisk — ”
119920	119929	119931	119931	Ron	113	“ I never said I had a problem ! ”
119934	119944	119946	119946	Hermione	114	“ But Harry , you ’ve just said it , ”
119949	119977	119946	119946	Hermione	114	“ Dumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind , if you ’d done Occlumency properly you ’d never have seen this — ”
119978	119992	119901	119901	he	2307	“ IF YOU THINK I’M JUST GOING TO ACT LIKE I HAVEN’T SEEN — ”
119993	120010	119946	119946	Hermione	114	“ Sirius told you there was nothing more important than you learning to close your mind ! ”
120011	120027	119901	119901	he	2307	“ WELL , I EXPECT HE’D SAY SOMETHING DIFFERENT IF HE KNEW WHAT I’D JUST — ”
120065	120068	120070	120070	Ginny	182	“ Hi , ”
120073	120086	120070	120070	Ginny	182	“ We recognized Harry ’s voice — what are you yelling about ? ”
120087	120092	120094	120094	Harry	112	“ Never you mind , ”
120102	120114	120115	120115	she	182	“ There ’s no need to take that tone with me , ”
120119	120129	120115	120115	she	182	“ I was only wondering whether I could help . ”
120130	120137	120139	120139	Harry	112	“ Well , you ca n’t , ”
120142	120152	120154	120154	Luna	178	“ You ’re being rather rude , you know , ”
120177	120180	120182	120182	Hermione	114	“ Wait , ”
120185	120194	120182	120182	Hermione	114	“ Wait ... Harry , they can help . ”
120202	120205	120206	120206	she	114	“ Listen , ”
120210	120224	120206	120206	she	114	“ Harry , we need to establish whether Sirius really has left headquarters — ”
120225	120234	120197	120197	Ron	113	“ I ’ve told you , I saw — ”
120235	120245	120247	120247	Hermione	114	“ Harry , I ’m begging you , please ! ”
120250	120307	120247	120247	Hermione	114	“ Please let ’s just check that Sirius is n’t at home before we go charging off to London — if we find out he ’s not there then I swear I wo n’t try and stop you , I ’ll come , I ’ll d - do whatever it takes to try and save him — ”
120308	120315	120317	120317	Harry	112	“ Sirius is being tortured NOW ! ”
120319	120328	120317	120317	Harry	112	“ We have n’t got time to waste — ”
120329	120355	120197	120197	Ron	113	“ But if this is a trick of V - Voldemort ’s — Harry , we ’ve got to check , we ’ve got to — ”
120356	120359	120360	120360	Harry	112	“ How ? ”
120363	120371	120360	120360	Harry	112	“ How ’re we going to check ? ”
120372	120389	120391	120391	Hermione	114	“ We ’ll have to use Umbridge ’s fire and see if we can contact him , ”
120401	120426	120391	120391	Hermione	114	“ We ’ll draw Umbridge away again , but we ’ll need lookouts , and that ’s where we can use Ginny and Luna . ”
120441	120449	120437	120437	Ginny	182	“ Yeah , we ’ll do it , ”
120454	120469	120451	120451	Luna	178	“ When you say ‘ Sirius , ’ are you talking about Stubby Boardman ? ”
120474	120477	120478	120478	Harry	112	“ Okay , ”
120484	120516	120478	120478	Harry	112	“ Okay , if you can think of a way of doing this quickly , I ’m with you , otherwise I ’m going to the Department of Mysteries right now — ”
120517	120523	120525	120525	Luna	178	“ The Department of Mysteries ? ”
120531	120541	120525	120525	Luna	178	“ But how are you going to get there ? ”
120548	120551	120556	120556	her	114	“ Right , ”
120568	120620	120556	120556	her	114	“ Right ... well ... One of us has to go and find Umbridge and — and send her off in the wrong direction , keep her away from her office . They could tell her — I do n’t know — that Peeves is up to something awful as usual ... ”
120621	120627	120629	120629	Ron	113	“ I ’ll do it , ”
120633	120678	120629	120629	Ron	113	“ I ’ll tell her Peeves is smashing up the Transfiguration department or something , it ’s miles away from her office . Come to think of it , I could probably persuade Peeves to do it if I met him on the way ... ”
120703	120706	120707	120707	she	114	“ Okay , ”
120719	120748	120707	120707	she	114	“ Now , we need to keep students away from her office while we force entry , or some Slytherin ’s bound to go and tip her off ... ”
120749	120762	120764	120764	Ginny	182	“ Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor , ”
120767	120787	120764	120764	Ginny	182	“ and warn people not to go down there because someone ’s let off a load of Garroting Gas . ”
120809	120822	120804	120804	Ginny	182	“ Fred and George were planning to do it before they left . ”
120823	120826	120828	120828	Hermione	114	“ Okay , ”
120830	120860	120828	120828	Hermione	114	“ well then , Harry , you and I will be under the Invisibility Cloak , and we ’ll sneak into the office and you can talk to Sirius — ”
120861	120869	120804	120804	Ginny	182	“ He ’s not there , Hermione ! ”
120870	120919	120828	120828	Hermione	114	“ I mean , you can — can check whether Sirius is at home or not while I keep watch , I do n’t think you should be in there alone , Lee ’s already proved the window ’s a weak spot , sending those nifflers through it . ”
120946	120953	120954	120954	he	112	“ I ... okay , thanks , ”
120957	120988	120990	120990	Hermione	114	“ Right , well , even if we do all of that , I do n’t think we ’re going to be able to bank on more than five minutes , ”
121003	121015	120990	120990	Hermione	114	“ not with Filch and the wretched Inquisitorial Squad floating around . ”
121016	121022	121024	121024	Harry	112	“ Five minutes’ll be enough , ”
121026	121034	121024	121024	Harry	112	“ C’m on , let ’s go — ”
121035	121038	121040	121040	Hermione	114	“ Now ? ”
121045	121050	121052	121052	Harry	112	“ Of course now ! ”
121055	121081	121052	121052	Harry	112	“ What did you think , we ’re going to wait until after dinner or something ? Hermione , Sirius is being tortured right now ! ”
121082	121089	121090	121090	she	114	“ I — oh all right , ”
121094	121117	121090	121090	she	114	“ You go and get the Invisibility Cloak and we ’ll meet you at the end of Umbridge ’s corridor , okay ? ”
121232	121254	121225	121225	they	2314	“ Harry , d’you want to chip in a couple of Galleons ? Dingle reckons he could sell us some firewhisky ... ”
121301	121305	121306	121306	he	112	“ Got it , ”
121309	121316	121306	121306	he	112	“ Ready to go , then ? ”
121317	121321	121323	121323	Hermione	114	“ All right , ”
121334	121376	121323	121323	Hermione	114	“ So Ron — you go and head Umbridge off ... Ginny , Luna , if you can start moving people out of the corridor ... Harry and I will get the Cloak on and wait until the coast is clear ... ”
121420	121425	121427	121427	Hermione	114	“ Get over here , ”
121458	121476	121447	121449	a medieval wizard	904	“ Are — are you sure you ’re okay , Harry ? You ’re still very pale ... ”
121477	121482	121483	121483	he	112	“ I ’m fine , ”
121535	121538	121539	121539	he	112	“ Here , ”
121568	121576	121577	121577	Ginny	182	“ You ca n’t come down here ! ”
121584	121612	121577	121577	Ginny	182	“ No , sorry , you ’re going to have to go round by the swiveling staircase , someone ’s let off Garroting Gas just along here — ”
121624	121632	121619	121621	one surly voice	2327	“ I ca n’t see no gas ... ”
121633	121641	121643	121643	Ginny	182	“ That ’s because it ’s colorless , ”
121650	121681	121643	121643	Ginny	182	“ but if you want to walk through it , carry on , then we ’ll have your body as proof for the next idiot who did n’t believe us ... ”
121720	121744	121716	121716	Hermione	114	“ I think that ’s as good as we ’re going to get , Harry — come on , let ’s do it . ”
121779	121789	121776	121776	Hermione	114	“ Good one ... do n’t forget the signal ... ”
121790	121796	121798	121798	Harry	112	“ What ’s the signal ? ”
121807	121824	121826	121826	Hermione	114	“ A loud chorus of ‘ Weasley Is Our King ’ if they see Umbridge coming , ”
121890	121904	121883	121883	Hermione	114	“ I thought she might have added extra security after the second niffler ... ”
121980	121987	121964	121964	He	112	“ Number twelve , Grimmauld Place ! ”
122088	122091	122092	122092	he	112	“ Sirius ? ”
122095	122102	122092	122092	he	112	“ Sirius , are you there ? ”
122127	122132	122133	122133	he	112	“ Who ’s there ? ”
122180	122192	122193	122193	Kreacher	176	“ It ’s the Potter boy ’s head in the fire , ”
122208	122218	122193	122193	Kreacher	176	“ What has he come for , Kreacher wonders ? ”
122219	122226	122227	122227	Harry	112	“ Where ’s Sirius , Kreacher ? ”
122239	122248	122230	122233	The house - elf	980	“ Master has gone out , Harry Potter . ”
122249	122262	122193	122193	Kreacher	176	“ Where ’s he gone ? Where ’s he gone , Kreacher ? ”
122267	122273	122275	122275	Harry	112	“ I ’m warning you ! ”
122294	122313	122286	122286	Kreacher	176	“ What about Lupin ? Mad - Eye ? Any of them , are any of them here ? ”
122314	122320	122322	122323	the elf	549	“ Nobody here but Kreacher ! ”
122346	122384	122331	122331	he	549	“ Kreacher thinks he will have a little chat with his Mistress now , yes , he has n’t had a chance in a long time , Kreacher ’s Master has been keeping him away from her — ”
122385	122391	122392	122392	Harry	112	“ Where has Sirius gone ? ”
122398	122410	122392	122392	Harry	112	“ Kreacher , has he gone to the Department of Mysteries ? ”
122437	122449	122451	122452	the elf	549	“ Master does not tell poor Kreacher where he is going , ”
122455	122460	122462	122462	Harry	112	“ But you know ! ”
122464	122475	122462	122462	Harry	112	“ Do n’t you ? You know where he is ! ”
122493	122505	122506	122506	he	549	“ Master will not come back from the Department of Mysteries ! ”
122510	122519	122506	122506	he	549	“ Kreacher and his Mistress are alone again ! ”
122533	122537	122540	122540	he	112	“ You — ! ”
122635	122639	122640	122640	she	144	“ You think , ”
122663	122712	122713	122713	she	144	“ that after two nifflers I was going to let one more foul , scavenging little creature enter my office without my knowledge ? I had Stealth Sensoring Spells placed all around my doorway after the last one got in , you foolish boy . Take his wand , ”
122740	122744	122713	122713	she	144	“ Hers too ... ”
122768	122780	122782	122782	Umbridge	144	“ I want to know why you are in my office , ”
122795	122805	122806	122806	Harry	112	“ I was — trying to get my Firebolt ! ”
122809	122812	122813	122813	She	144	“ Liar . ”
122819	122853	122813	122813	She	144	“ Your Firebolt is under strict guard in the dungeons , as you very well know , Potter . You had your head in my fire . With whom have you been communicating ? ”
122854	122858	122860	122860	Harry	112	“ No one — ”
122879	122882	122884	122884	Umbridge	144	“ Liar ! ”
122990	122995	122997	122997	Warrington	402	“ Got ’em all , ”
123007	123011	123012	123012	he	112	“ That one , ”
123020	123028	123029	123029	he	112	“ tried to stop me taking her , ”
123049	123057	123029	123029	he	112	“ so I brought him along too . ”
123058	123063	123065	123065	Umbridge	144	“ Good , good , ”
123072	123093	123065	123065	Umbridge	144	“ Well , it looks as though Hogwarts will shortly be a Weasley - free zone , does n’t it ? ”
123129	123134	123135	123135	she	144	“ So , Potter , ”
123138	123151	123152	123152	she	144	“ You stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon , ”
123163	123249	123158	123158	Malfoy	166	“ to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes , Mr. Filch having just informed me so . Clearly , it was very important for you to talk to somebody . Was it Albus Dumbledore ? Or the half - breed , Hagrid ? I doubt it was Minerva McGonagall , I hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone ... ”
123282	123294	123295	123295	he	112	“ It ’s none of your business who I talk to , ”
123306	123310	123311	123311	she	144	“ Very well , ”
123322	123357	123311	123311	she	144	“ Very well , Mr. Potter ... I offered you the chance to tell me freely . You refused . I have no alternative but to force you . Draco — fetch Professor Snape . ”
123612	123621	123623	123623	Snape	255	“ You wanted to see me , Headmistress ? ”
123641	123647	123649	123649	Umbridge	144	“ Ah , Professor Snape , ”
123658	123677	123649	123649	Umbridge	144	“ Yes , I would like another bottle of Veritaserum , as quick as you can , please . ”
123678	123688	123689	123689	he	255	“ You took my last bottle to interrogate Potter , ”
123703	123722	123689	123689	he	255	“ Surely you did not use it all ? I told you that three drops would be sufficient . ”
123726	123737	123738	123738	she	144	“ You can make some more , ca n’t you ? ”
123756	123759	123761	123761	Snape	255	“ Certainly , ”
123767	123790	123761	123761	Snape	255	“ It takes a full moon cycle to mature , so I should have it ready for you in around a month . ”
123791	123795	123797	123797	Umbridge	144	“ A month ? ”
123802	123832	123797	123797	Umbridge	144	“ A month ? But I need it this evening , Snape ! I have just found Potter using my fire to communicate with a person or persons unknown ! ”
123833	123836	123838	123838	Snape	255	“ Really ? ”
123855	123875	123849	123849	he	255	“ Well , it does n’t surprise me . Potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules . ”
123916	123923	123925	123925	Umbridge	144	“ I wish to interrogate him ! ”
123941	123961	123929	123929	Snape	255	“ I wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him to tell me the truth ! ”
123962	123969	123971	123971	Snape	255	“ I have already told you , ”
123974	124034	123971	123971	Snape	255	“ that I have no further stocks of Veritaserum . Unless you wish to poison Potter — and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy with you if you did — I can not help you . The only trouble is that most venoms act too fast to give the victim much time for truth - telling ... ”
124071	124077	124079	124080	Professor Umbridge	144	“ You are on probation ! ”
124094	124121	124083	124083	Snape	255	“ You are being deliberately unhelpful ! I expected better , Lucius Malfoy always speaks most highly of you ! Now get out of my office ! ”
124154	124160	124161	124161	he	112	“ He ’s got Padfoot ! ”
124164	124177	124161	124161	he	112	“ He ’s got Padfoot at the place where it ’s hidden ! ”
124190	124193	124195	124196	Professor Umbridge	144	“ Padfoot ? ”
124205	124222	124195	124196	Professor Umbridge	144	“ What is Padfoot ? Where what is hidden ? What does he mean , Snape ? ”
124258	124264	124266	124266	Snape	255	“ I have no idea , ”
124269	124329	124266	124266	Snape	255	“ Potter , when I want nonsense shouted at me I shall give you a Babbling Beverage . And Crabbe , loosen your hold a little , if Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork , and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job . ”
124382	124386	124387	124387	she	144	“ Very well , ”
124397	124430	124391	124391	she	144	“ Very well ... I am left with no alternative ... This is more than a matter of school discipline ... This is an issue of Ministry security ... Yes ... yes ... ”
124479	124493	124495	124495	Umbridge	144	“ You are forcing me , Potter ... I do not want to , ”
124504	124525	124495	124495	Umbridge	144	“ but sometimes circumstances justify the use ... I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no choice ... ”
124538	124548	124550	124550	Umbridge	144	“ The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue , ”
124553	124556	124558	124558	Hermione	114	“ No ! ”
124560	124567	124558	124558	Hermione	114	“ Professor Umbridge — it ’s illegal ”
124599	124614	124616	124616	Hermione	114	“ The Minister would n’t want you to break the law , Professor Umbridge ! ”
124618	124629	124631	124631	Umbridge	144	“ What Cornelius does n’t know wo n’t hurt him , ”
124663	124692	124639	124639	she	144	“ He never knew I ordered dementors after Potter last summer , but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him , all the same ... ”
124693	124698	124700	124700	Harry	112	“ It was you ? ”
124702	124710	124700	124700	Harry	112	“ You sent the dementors after me ? ”
124711	124717	124719	124719	Umbridge	144	“ Somebody had to act , ”
124734	124781	124722	124722	her	144	“ They were all bleating about silencing you somehow — discrediting you — but I was the one who actually did something about it ... Only you wriggled out of that one , did n’t you , Potter ? Not today , though , not now ... ”
124791	124794	124788	124788	she	144	“ Cruc — ”
124795	124798	124800	124800	Hermione	114	“ NO ! ”
124810	124824	124807	124808	Millicent Bulstrode	401	“ No — Harry — Harry , we ’ll have to tell her ! ”
124825	124829	124831	124831	Harry	112	“ No way ! ”
124843	124869	124807	124808	Millicent Bulstrode	401	“ We ’ll have to , Harry , she ’ll force it out of you anyway , what ’s ... what ’s the point ... ? ”
124904	124911	124913	124913	Umbridge	144	“ Well , well , well ! ”
124918	124941	124913	124913	Umbridge	144	“ Little Miss Question - All is going to give us some answers ! Come on then , girl , come on ! ”
124942	124951	124953	124953	Ron	113	“ Er — my — nee — no ! ”
125009	125018	125020	125020	Hermione	114	“ I ’m — I ’m sorry everyone , ”
125022	125031	125020	125020	Hermione	114	“ But — I ca n’t stand it — ”
125032	125043	125045	125045	Umbridge	144	“ That ’s right , that ’s right , girl ! ”
125065	125077	125045	125045	Umbridge	144	“ Now then ... with whom was Potter communicating just now ? ”
125078	125081	125083	125083	Hermione	114	“ Well , ”
125088	125100	125083	125083	Hermione	114	“ well , he was trying to speak to Professor Dumbledore ... ”
125147	125150	125152	125152	Umbridge	144	“ Dumbledore ? ”
125155	125164	125152	125152	Umbridge	144	“ You know where Dumbledore is , then ? ”
125165	125170	125172	125172	Hermione	114	“ Well ... no ! ”
125174	125195	125172	125172	Hermione	114	“ We ’ve tried the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley and the Three Broomsticks and even the Hog ’s Head — ”
125196	125217	125219	125219	Umbridge	144	“ Idiot girl , Dumbledore wo n’t be sitting in a pub when the whole Ministry ’s looking for him ! ”
125231	125243	125245	125245	Hermione	114	“ But — but we needed to tell him something important ! ”
125274	125277	125279	125279	Umbridge	144	“ Yes ? ”
125287	125297	125279	125279	Umbridge	144	“ What was it you wanted to tell him ? ”
125298	125312	125314	125314	Hermione	114	“ We ... we wanted to tell him it ’s r - ready ! ”
125316	125321	125323	125323	Umbridge	144	“ What ’s ready ? ”
125338	125345	125327	125327	she	144	“ What ’s ready , girl ? ”
125346	125352	125354	125354	Hermione	114	“ The ... the weapon , ”
125356	125361	125363	125363	Umbridge	144	“ Weapon ? Weapon ? ”
125374	125402	125366	125366	her	144	“ You have been developing some method of resistance ? A weapon you could use against the Ministry ? On Professor Dumbledore ’s orders , of course ? ”
125403	125410	125412	125412	Hermione	114	“ Y - y - yes , ”
125414	125454	125412	125412	Hermione	114	“ But he had to leave before it was finished and n - n - now we ’ve finished it for him , and we c - c - can’t find him t - t - to tell him ! ”
125455	125463	125465	125465	Umbridge	144	“ What kind of weapon is it ? ”
125478	125490	125492	125492	Hermione	114	“ We do n’t r - r - really understand it , ”
125497	125521	125492	125492	Hermione	114	“ We j - j - just did what P - P - Professor Dumbledore told us t - t - to do ... ”
125529	125536	125537	125537	she	144	“ Lead me to the weapon , ”
125540	125548	125550	125550	Hermione	114	“ I ’m not showing ... them , ”
125562	125572	125574	125575	Professor Umbridge	144	“ It is not for you to set conditions , ”
125578	125581	125583	125583	Hermione	114	“ Fine , ”
125592	125678	125583	125583	Hermione	114	“ fine ... let them see it , I hope they use it on you ! In fact , I wish you ’d invite loads and loads of people to come and see ! Th - that would serve you right — oh , I ’d love it if the wh - whole school knew where it was , and how to u - use it , and then if you annoy any of them they ’ll be able to s - sort you out ! ”
125748	125778	125740	125740	she	144	“ All right , dear , let ’s make it just you and me ... and we ’ll take Potter too , shall we ? Get up , now — ”
125779	125782	125784	125784	Malfoy	155	“ Professor , ”
125787	125805	125784	125784	Malfoy	155	“ Professor Umbridge , I think some of the squad should come with you to look after — ”
125806	125830	125832	125832	Umbridge	144	“ I am a fully qualified Ministry official , Malfoy , do you really think I can not manage two wandless teenagers alone ? ”
125835	125868	125870	125870	she	2374	“ In any case , it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see . You will remain here until I return and make sure none of these ”
125883	125886	125870	125870	she	2374	“ escape . ”
125887	125891	125893	125893	Malfoy	155	“ All right , ”
125900	125915	125917	125917	Umbridge	144	“ And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way , ”
125928	125932	125925	125925	her	2374	“ Lead on ... ”
126137	126149	126151	126151	Umbridge	144	“ It ’s hidden in Hagrid ’s hut , is it ? ”
126158	126163	126165	126165	Hermione	114	“ Of course not , ”
126168	126177	126165	126165	Hermione	114	“ Hagrid might have set it off accidentally . ”
126178	126181	126183	126183	Umbridge	144	“ Yes , ”
126192	126210	126183	126183	Umbridge	144	“ Yes , he would have done , of course , the great half - breed oaf ... ”
126265	126272	126274	126274	Umbridge	144	“ Then ... where is it ? ”
126293	126300	126302	126302	Hermione	114	“ In there , of course , ”
126310	126330	126302	126302	Hermione	114	“ It had to be somewhere that students were n’t going to find it accidentally , did n’t it ? ”
126331	126335	126337	126337	Umbridge	144	“ Of course , ”
126347	126363	126340	126340	she	144	“ Of course ... very well , then ... you two stay ahead of me . ”
126364	126379	126380	126380	Harry	112	“ Can we have your wand , then , if we ’re going first ? ”
126384	126396	126398	126398	Umbridge	144	“ No , I do n’t think so , Mr. Potter , ”
126409	126427	126398	126398	Umbridge	144	“ The Ministry places a rather higher value on my life than yours , I ’m afraid . ”
126506	126513	126514	126514	Umbridge	144	“ Is it very far in ? ”
126525	126529	126531	126531	Hermione	114	“ Oh yes , ”
126533	126541	126531	126531	Hermione	114	“ Yes , it ’s well hidden . ”
126602	126614	126615	126615	he	112	“ Er — are you sure this is the right way ? ”
126620	126624	126625	126625	she	114	“ Oh yes , ”
126679	126687	126676	126676	her	114	“ It ’s a bit further in ! ”
126688	126696	126697	126697	Harry	112	“ Hermione , keep your voice down , ”
126707	126715	126697	126697	Harry	112	“ Anything could be listening in here — ”
126716	126722	126723	126723	she	114	“ I want us heard , ”
126734	126739	126728	126728	Umbridge	144	“ You ’ll see ... ”
126790	126795	126797	126797	Umbridge	144	“ How much further ? ”
126803	126808	126810	126810	Hermione	114	“ Not far now ! ”
126822	126828	126810	126810	Hermione	114	“ Just a little bit — ”
126948	126953	126939	126939	Hermione	114	“ Who are you ? ”
127012	127022	127024	127024	Magorian	372	“ I asked you who are you , human , ”
127027	127033	127035	127035	Umbridge	144	“ I am Dolores Umbridge ! ”
127045	127061	127035	127035	Umbridge	144	“ Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic and Headmistress and High Inquisitor of Hogwarts ! ”
127062	127071	127073	127073	Magorian	372	“ You are from the Ministry of Magic ? ”
127087	127092	127094	127094	Umbridge	144	“ That ’s right ! ”
127101	127137	127094	127094	Umbridge	144	“ So be very careful ! By the laws laid down by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures , any attack by half - breeds such as yourselves on a human — ”
127138	127145	127158	127158	Bane	322	“ What did you call us ? ”
127175	127182	127183	127183	Hermione	114	“ Do n’t call them that ! ”
127208	127241	127205	127205	she	114	“ Law Fifteen B states clearly that ‘ Any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have near - human intelligence , and therefore considered responsible for its actions — ’ ”
127242	127250	127252	127252	Magorian	372	“ ‘ Near - human intelligence ’ ? ”
127267	127287	127255	127255	Bane	322	“ We consider that a great insult , human ! Our intelligence , thankfully , far outstrips your own — ”
127288	127297	127299	127317	the hard - faced gray centaur whom Harry and Hermione had seen on their last trip into the forest	2401	“ What are you doing in our forest ? ”
127319	127325	127299	127317	the hard - faced gray centaur whom Harry and Hermione had seen on their last trip into the forest	2401	“ Why are you here ? ”
127326	127330	127332	127332	Umbridge	144	“ Your forest ? ”
127349	127371	127332	127332	Umbridge	144	“ I would remind you that you live here only because the Ministry of Magic permits you certain areas of land — ”

129321	129335	129337	129337	Harry	112	“ By the time we ’ve done that , Sirius’ll probably be dead ! ”
129371	129382	129384	129384	Hermione	114	“ Well , we ca n’t do anything without wands , ”
129392	129410	129384	129384	Hermione	114	“ Anyway , Harry , how exactly were you planning to get all the way to London ? ”

129559	129578	129580	129580	Ron	113	“ Couple of Stunners , a Disarming Charm , Neville brought off a really nice little Impediment Jinx , ”
129591	129644	129580	129580	Ron	113	“ But Ginny was best , she got Malfoy — Bat - Bogey Hex — it was superb , his whole face was covered in the great flapping things . Anyway , we saw you heading into the forest out of the window and followed . What ’ve you done with Umbridge ? ”
129645	129651	129653	129653	Harry	112	“ She got carried away , ”
129655	129662	129653	129653	Harry	112	“ By a herd of centaurs . ”
129663	129670	129672	129672	Ginny	182	“ And they left you behind ? ”
129677	129687	129689	129689	Harry	112	“ No , they got chased off by Grawp , ”
129691	129696	129697	129697	Luna	178	“ Who ’s Grawp ? ”
129701	129707	129709	129709	Ron	113	“ Hagrid ’s little brother , ”
129712	129742	129709	129709	Ron	113	“ Anyway , never mind that now . Harry , what did you find out in the fire ? Has You - Know - Who got Sirius or — ? ”
129743	129746	129748	129748	Harry	112	“ Yes , ”
129758	129784	129748	129748	Harry	112	“ and I ’m sure Sirius is still alive , but I ca n’t see how we ’re going to get there to help him . ”
129801	129814	129816	129816	Luna	178	“ Well , we ’ll have to fly , wo n’t we ? ”
129836	129839	129841	129841	Harry	112	“ Okay , ”
129848	129893	129841	129841	Harry	112	“ first of all , ‘ we ’ are n’t doing anything if you ’re including yourself in that , and second of all , Ron ’s the only one with a broomstick that is n’t being guarded by a security troll , so — ”
129894	129901	129903	129903	Ginny	182	“ I ’ve got a broom ! ”
129905	129914	129916	129916	Ron	113	“ Yeah , but you ’re not coming , ”
129919	129936	129938	129938	Ginny	182	“ Excuse me , but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do ! ”
129955	129960	129961	129961	Harry	112	“ You ’re too — ”
129964	129987	129988	129988	she	182	“ I ’m three years older than you were when you fought You - Know - Who over the Sorcerer ’s Stone , ”
129992	130014	129988	129988	she	182	“ and it ’s because of me Malfoy ’s stuck back in Umbridge ’s office with giant flying bogeys attacking him — ”
130015	130020	129945	129945	her	182	“ Yeah , but — ”
130021	130030	130032	130032	Neville	161	“ We were all in the D.A. together , ”
130035	130078	130032	130032	Neville	161	“ It was all supposed to be about fighting You - Know - Who , was n’t it ? And this is the first chance we ’ve had to do something real — or was that all just a game or something ? ”
130079	130088	130090	130090	Harry	112	“ No — of course it was n’t — ”
130093	130100	130102	130102	Neville	161	“ Then we should come too , ”
130105	130111	130102	130102	Neville	161	“ We want to help . ”
130112	130117	130119	130119	Luna	178	“ That ’s right , ”
130183	130192	130194	130194	Harry	112	“ Well , it does n’t matter anyway , ”
130197	130209	130194	130194	Harry	112	“ because we still do n’t know how to get there — ”
130210	130218	130220	130220	Luna	178	“ I thought we ’d settled that ? ”
130223	130228	130220	130220	Luna	178	“ We ’re flying ! ”
130229	130232	130234	130234	Ron	113	“ Look , ”
130241	130263	130234	130234	Ron	113	“ you might be able to fly without a broomstick but the rest of us ca n’t sprout wings whenever we — ”
130264	130275	130277	130277	Luna	178	“ There are other ways of flying than with broomsticks , ”
130280	130300	130301	130301	Ron	113	“ I s’pose we ’re going to ride on the back of the Kacky Snorgle or whatever it is ? ”
130304	130314	130316	130316	Luna	178	“ The Crumple - Horned Snorkack ca n’t fly , ”
130322	130343	130316	130316	Luna	178	“ but they can , and Hagrid says they ’re very good at finding places their riders are looking for . ”
130374	130377	130378	130378	he	112	“ Yes ! ”
130422	130430	130432	130432	Ron	113	“ Is it those mad horse things ? ”
130450	130465	130432	130432	Ron	113	“ Those ones you ca n’t see unless you ’ve watched someone snuff it ? ”
130466	130469	130471	130471	Harry	112	“ Yeah , ”
130473	130477	130432	130432	Ron	113	“ How many ? ”
130478	130482	130432	130432	Ron	113	“ Just two . ”
130483	130490	130492	130492	Hermione	114	“ Well , we need three , ”
130508	130513	130515	130515	Ginny	182	“ Four , Hermione , ”
130519	130530	130532	130532	Luna	178	“ I think there are six of us , actually , ”
130537	130549	130551	130551	Harry	112	“ Do n’t be stupid , we ca n’t all go ! ”
130554	130559	130561	130561	he	112	“ Look , you three ”
130571	130583	130561	130561	he	112	“ you ’re not involved in this , you ’re not — ”
130615	130625	130626	130626	he	112	“ Okay , fine , it ’s your choice , ”
130630	130646	130626	130626	he	112	“ But unless we can find more thestrals you ’re not going to be able — ”
130647	130656	130658	130658	Ginny	182	“ Oh , more of them will come , ”
130684	130691	130677	130677	she	182	“ What makes you think that ? ”
130692	130710	130711	130711	she	182	“ Because in case you had n’t noticed , you and Hermione are both covered in blood , ”
130715	130740	130711	130711	she	182	“ and we know Hagrid lures thestrals with raw meat , so that ’s probably why these two turned up in the first place ... ”
130772	130777	130778	130778	he	112	“ Okay , then , ”
130786	130813	130778	130778	he	112	“ Ron and I will take these two and go ahead , and Hermione can stay here with you three and she ’ll attract more thestrals — ”
130814	130821	130823	130823	Hermione	114	“ I ’m not staying behind ! ”
130826	130832	130834	130834	Luna	178	“ There ’s no need , ”
130838	130852	130834	130834	Luna	178	“ Look , here come more now ... You two must really smell ... ”
130895	130899	130900	130900	he	112	“ All right , ”
130904	130913	130900	130900	he	112	“ pick one and get on , then . ”
131063	131066	131067	131067	he	112	“ What ? ”
131070	131079	131081	131081	Ron	113	“ How ’re we supposed to get on ? ”
131084	131093	131081	131081	Ron	113	“ When we ca n’t see the things ? ”
131094	131100	131102	131102	Luna	178	“ Oh it ’s easy , ”
131120	131124	131125	131125	She	178	“ Come here ... ”
131179	131184	131185	131185	Ron	113	“ This is mad , ”
131202	131212	131185	131185	Ron	113	“ Mad ... if I could just see it — ”
131213	131222	131224	131224	Harry	112	“ You ’d better hope it stays invisible , ”
131227	131234	131224	131224	Harry	112	“ We all ready , then ? ”
131250	131253	131235	131235	They	2451	“ Okay ... ”

132069	132073	132074	132074	he	113	“ Never again , ”

139150	139157	139101	139101	Harry	112	“ — when I say go — ”
139158	139193	139126	139126	Malfoy	155	“ — you did n’t come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams . He thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording ... ”
139194	139198	139200	139200	Harry	112	“ Did he ? ”
139229	139245	139217	139217	he	112	“ So he wanted me to come and get it , did he ? Why ? ”
139246	139249	139250	139250	Malfoy	155	“ Why ? ”
139255	139300	139250	139250	Malfoy	155	“ Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries , Potter , are those about whom it was made , as the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him . ”
139301	139314	139217	139217	he	112	“ And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me ? ”
139315	139345	139250	139250	Malfoy	155	“ About both of you , Potter , about both of you ... Have n’t you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby ? ”
139394	139404	139405	139405	he	112	“ Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me ? ”
139439	139462	139405	139405	he	112	“ And he ’s made me come and get it for him ? Why could n’t he come and get it himself ? ”
139463	139468	139470	139470	Bellatrix	240	“ Get it himself ? ”
139478	139523	139470	139470	Bellatrix	240	“ The Dark Lord , walk into the Ministry of Magic , when they are so sweetly ignoring his return ? The Dark Lord , reveal himself to the Aurors , when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin ? ”
139524	139540	139542	139542	Harry	112	“ So he ’s got you doing his dirty work for him , has he ? ”
139544	139558	139542	139542	Harry	112	“ Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it — and Bode ? ”
139559	139568	139570	139570	Malfoy	155	“ Very good , Potter , very good ... ”
139573	139584	139570	139570	Malfoy	155	“ But the Dark Lord knows you are not unintell — ”
139585	139588	139590	139590	Harry	112	“ NOW ! ”
139598	139601	139542	139542	Harry	112	“ REDUCTO ! ”

140048	140161	140044	140045	Lucius Malfoy	155	“ Leave Nott , leave him , I say , the Dark Lord will not care for Nott ’s injuries as much as losing that prophecy — Jugson , come back here , we need to organize ! We ’ll split into pairs and search , and do n’t forget , be gentle with Potter until we ’ve got the prophecy , you can kill the others if necessary — Bellatrix , Rodolphus , you take the left , Crabbe , Rabastan , go right — Jugson , Dolohov , the door straight ahead — Macnair and Avery , through here — Rookwood , over there — Mulciber , come with me ! ”

153148	153169	153074	153074	Harry	112	“ Harry , suffering like this proves you are still a man ! This pain is part of being human — ”
153170	153185	153186	153186	Harry	112	“ THEN — I — DON’T — WANT — TO — BE — HUMAN ! ”
153244	153247	153240	153241	Armando Dippet	211	“ Really ! ”
153248	153253	153254	153254	Harry	112	“ I DON’T CARE ! ”
153270	153294	153254	153254	Harry	112	“ I’VE HAD ENOUGH , I’VE SEEN ENOUGH , I WANT OUT , I WANT IT TO END , I DON’T CARE ANYMORE — ”
153325	153330	153334	153334	He	133	“ You do care , ”
153358	153378	153350	153350	His	133	“ You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it . ”
153379	153384	153385	153385	Harry	112	“ I — DON’T ! ”
153437	153444	153446	153446	Dumbledore	133	“ Oh yes , you do , ”
153452	153480	153446	153446	Dumbledore	133	“ You have now lost your mother , your father , and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known . Of course you care . ”
153481	153489	153490	153490	Harry	112	“ YOU DON’T KNOW HOW I FEEL ! ”
153493	153501	153490	153490	Harry	112	“ YOU — STANDING THERE — YOU — ”
153583	153588	153589	153589	he	112	“ Let me out , ”
153600	153603	153605	153605	Dumbledore	133	“ No , ”
153618	153623	153624	153624	Harry	112	“ Let me out , ”
153628	153631	153632	153632	Dumbledore	133	“ No , ”
153635	153655	153682	153682	his	133	“ If you do n’t — if you keep me in here — if you do n’t let me — ”
153656	153665	153667	153667	Dumbledore	133	“ By all means continue destroying my possessions , ”
153670	153678	153667	153667	Dumbledore	133	“ I daresay I have too many . ”
153693	153698	153699	153699	Harry	112	“ Let me out , ”
153718	153727	153729	153729	Dumbledore	133	“ Not until I have had my say , ”
153731	153758	153759	153759	Harry	112	“ Do you — do you think I want to — do you think I give a — I DON’T CARE WHAT YOU’VE GOT TO SAY ! ”
153762	153776	153759	153759	Harry	112	“ I do n’t want to hear anything you ’ve got to say ! ”
153777	153781	153783	153783	Dumbledore	133	“ You will , ”
153786	153827	153783	153783	Dumbledore	133	“ Because you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be . If you are to attack me , as I know you are close to doing , I would like to have thoroughly earned it . ”
153863	153868	153870	153870	Dumbledore	133	“ Please sit down , ”
153910	153916	153918	153919	Phineas Nigellus	210	“ Am I to understand , ”
153926	153944	153918	153919	Phineas Nigellus	210	“ that my great - great - grandson — the last of the Blacks — is dead ? ”
153945	153950	153952	153952	Dumbledore	133	“ Yes , Phineas , ”
153954	153961	153963	153963	Phineas	210	“ I do n’t believe it , ”
154013	154022	154024	154024	Dumbledore	133	“ Harry , I owe you an explanation , ”
154026	154098	154024	154024	Dumbledore	133	“ An explanation of an old man ’s mistakes . For I see now that what I have done , and not done , with regard to you , bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age . Youth can not know how age thinks and feels . But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young ... and I seem to have forgotten lately ... ”
154151	154159	154161	154161	Dumbledore	133	“ I guessed , fifteen years ago , ”
154163	154195	154161	154161	Dumbledore	133	“ when I saw the scar upon your forehead , what it might mean . I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort . ”
154196	154206	154208	154208	Harry	112	“ You ’ve told me this before , Professor , ”
154229	154232	154234	154234	Dumbledore	133	“ Yes , ”
154237	154292	154234	154234	Dumbledore	133	“ Yes , but you see — it is necessary to start with your scar . For it became apparent , shortly after you rejoined the magical world , that I was correct , and that your scar was giving you warnings when Voldemort was close to you , or else feeling powerful emotion . ”
154293	154297	154299	154299	Harry	112	“ I know , ”
154302	154352	154234	154234	Dumbledore	133	“ And this ability of yours — to detect Voldemort ’s presence , even when he is disguised , and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are roused — has become more and more pronounced since Voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers . ”
154367	154371	154373	154373	Dumbledore	133	“ More recently , ”
154375	154432	154373	154373	Dumbledore	133	“ I became concerned that Voldemort might realize that this connection between you exists . Sure enough , there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence . I am speaking , of course , of the night when you witnessed the attack on Mr. Weasley . ”
154433	154440	154441	154441	Harry	112	“ Yeah , Snape told me , ”
154444	154450	154451	154451	Dumbledore	133	“ Professor Snape , Harry , ”
154456	154494	154451	154451	Dumbledore	133	“ But did you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you ? Why I did not teach you Occlumency ? Why I had not so much as looked at you for months ? ”
154538	154589	154590	154590	He	112	“ Voldemort ’s aim in possessing you , as he demonstrated tonight , would not have been my destruction . It would have been yours . He hoped , when he possessed you briefly a short while ago , that I would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him . ”
154642	154711	154712	154712	He	112	“ Sirius told me that you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of Arthur Weasley ’s attack . I knew at once that my worst fears were correct : Voldemort from that point had realized he could use you . In an attempt to arm you against Voldemort ’s assaults on your mind , I arranged Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape . ”
154786	154792	154794	154794	Harry	112	“ But I did n’t , ”
154826	154880	154796	154796	He	112	“ I did n’t practice , I did n’t bother , I could ’ve stopped myself having those dreams , Hermione kept telling me to do it , if I had he ’d never have been able to show me where to go , and — Sirius would n’t — Sirius would n’t — ”
154898	154938	155042	155042	Dumbledore	133	“ I tried to check he ’d really taken Sirius , I went to Umbridge ’s office , I spoke to Kreacher in the fire , and he said Sirius was n’t there , he said he ’d gone ! ”
154939	154943	154945	154945	Dumbledore	133	“ Kreacher lied , ”
154948	154978	154945	154945	Dumbledore	133	“ You are not his master , he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself . Kreacher intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic . ”
154979	154988	155042	155042	Dumbledore	133	“ He — he sent me on purpose ? ”
154989	155009	154945	154945	Dumbledore	133	“ Oh yes . Kreacher , I am afraid , has been serving more than one master for months . ”
155010	155013	155015	155015	Harry	112	“ How ? ”
155018	155030	155015	155015	Harry	112	“ He has n’t been out of Grimmauld Place for years . ”
155031	155040	155042	155042	Dumbledore	133	“ Kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before Christmas , ”
155044	155106	155042	155042	Dumbledore	133	“ when Sirius , apparently , shouted at him to ‘ get out . ’ He took Sirius at his word and interpreted this as an order to leave the house . He went to the only Black family member for whom he had any respect left ... Black ’s cousin Narcissa , sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius Malfoy . ”
155107	155115	155116	155116	Harry	112	“ How do you know all this ? ”
155150	155155	155157	155157	Harry	112	“ He was laughing ? ”
155163	155167	155169	155169	Dumbledore	133	“ Oh yes , ”
155171	155281	155169	155169	Dumbledore	133	“ You see , Kreacher was not able to betray us totally . He is not Secret - Keeper for the Order , he could not give the Malfoys our whereabouts or tell them any of the Order ’s confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal . He was bound by the enchantments of his kind , which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master , Sirius . But he gave Narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to Voldemort , yet must have seemed much too trivial for Sirius to think of banning him from repeating it . ”
155282	155286	155288	155288	Harry	112	“ Like what ? ”
155290	155307	155309	155309	Dumbledore	133	“ Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world was you , ”
155312	155376	155309	155309	Dumbledore	133	“ Like the fact that you were coming to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother . Voldemort knew already , of course , that Sirius was in the Order , that you knew where he was — but Kreacher ’s information made him realize that the one person whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was Sirius Black . ”
155385	155399	155169	155169	Dumbledore	133	“ So ... when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night ... ”
155400	155490	155536	155536	Dumbledore	133	“ The Malfoys — undoubtedly on Voldemort ’s instructions — had told him he must find a way of keeping Sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of Sirius being tortured . Then , if you decided to check whether Sirius was at home or not , Kreacher would be able to pretend he was not . Kreacher injured Buckbeak the hippogriff yesterday , and at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire , Sirius was upstairs trying to tend to him . ”
155510	155521	155522	155522	he	112	“ And Kreacher told you all this ... and laughed ? ”
155525	155534	155536	155536	Dumbledore	133	“ He did not wish to tell me , ”
155538	155577	155536	155536	Dumbledore	133	“ But I am a sufficiently accomplished Legilimens myself to know when I am being lied to and I — persuaded him — to tell me the full story , before I left for the Department of Mysteries . ”
155578	155581	155583	155583	Harry	112	“ And , ”
155595	155607	155583	155583	Harry	112	“ and Hermione kept telling us to be nice to him — ”
155608	155616	155618	155618	Dumbledore	133	“ She was quite right , Harry , ”
155620	155684	155618	155618	Dumbledore	133	“ I warned Sirius when we adopted twelve Grimmauld Place as our headquarters that Kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect . I also told him that Kreacher could be dangerous to us . I do not think that Sirius took me very seriously , or that he ever saw Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human ’s — ”
155685	155701	155702	155702	Harry	112	“ Do n’t you blame — do n’t you — talk — about Sirius like — ”
155739	155750	155735	155735	Dumbledore	133	“ Kreacher ’s a lying — foul — he deserved — ”
155751	155764	155766	155766	Dumbledore	133	“ Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards , Harry , ”
155768	155842	155766	155766	Dumbledore	133	“ Yes , he is to be pitied . His existence has been as miserable as your friend Dobby ’s . He was forced to do Sirius ’s bidding , because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved , but he felt no true loyalty to him . And whatever Kreacher ’s faults , it must be admitted that Sirius did nothing to make Kreacher ’s lot easier — ”
155843	155851	155852	155852	Harry	112	“ DON’T TALK ABOUT SIRIUS LIKE THAT ! ”
155890	155895	155896	155896	Harry	112	“ What about Snape ? ”
155899	155925	155896	155896	Harry	112	“ You ’re not talking about him , are you ? When I told him Voldemort had Sirius he just sneered at me as usual — ”
155961	155983	156004	156004	Dumbledore	133	“ Snape — Snape g - goaded Sirius about staying in the house — he made out Sirius was a coward — ”
155984	156002	156004	156004	Dumbledore	133	“ Sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him , ”
156006	156014	156015	156015	Harry	112	“ Snape stopped giving me Occlumency lessons ! ”
156018	156027	156015	156015	Harry	112	“ He threw me out of his office ! ”
156028	156035	156037	156037	Dumbledore	133	“ I am aware of it , ”
156040	156088	156037	156037	Dumbledore	133	“ I have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself , though I was sure , at the time , that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to Voldemort while in my presence — ”
156089	156105	156106	156106	Harry	112	“ Snape made it worse , my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him — ”
156118	156144	156108	156108	Ron	113	“ How do you know he was n’t trying to soften me up for Voldemort , make it easier for him to get inside my — ”
156145	156151	156153	156153	Dumbledore	133	“ I trust Severus Snape , ”
156156	156193	156153	156153	Dumbledore	133	“ But I forgot — another old man ’s mistake — that some wounds run too deep for the healing . I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about your father — I was wrong . ”
156194	156203	156205	156205	Harry	112	“ But that ’s okay , is it ? ”
156221	156243	156108	156108	Ron	113	“ It ’s okay for Snape to hate my dad , but it ’s not okay for Sirius to hate Kreacher ? ”
156244	156251	156253	156253	Dumbledore	133	“ Sirius did not hate Kreacher , ”
156255	156310	156253	156253	Dumbledore	133	“ He regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice . Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike ... The fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie . We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long , and we are now reaping our reward . ”
156311	156322	156323	156323	Harry	112	“ SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT , DID HE ? ”
156326	156342	156343	156343	Dumbledore	133	“ I did not say that , nor will you ever hear me say it , ”
156347	156385	156343	156343	Dumbledore	133	“ Sirius was not a cruel man , he was kind to house - elves in general . He had no love for Kreacher , because Kreacher was a living reminder of the home Sirius had hated . ”
156386	156394	156396	156396	Harry	112	“ Yeah , he did hate it ! ”
156447	156473	156485	156485	Dumbledore	133	“ You made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it , that ’s why he wanted to get out last night — ”
156474	156483	156485	156485	Dumbledore	133	“ I was trying to keep Sirius alive , ”
156488	156497	156498	156498	Harry	112	“ People do n’t like being locked up ! ”
156506	156516	156498	156498	Harry	112	“ You did it to me all last summer — ”
156604	156609	156610	156610	he	133	“ It is time , ”
156613	156677	156610	156610	he	133	“ for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago , Harry . Please sit down . I am going to tell you everything . I ask only a little patience . You will have your chance to rage at me — to do whatever you like — when I have finished . I will not stop you . ”
156719	156780	156698	156698	Dumbledore	133	“ Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts , Harry , safe and whole , as I had planned and intended . Well — not quite whole . You had suffered . I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle ’s doorstep . I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years . ”
156788	156795	156797	156797	Harry	112	“ She does n’t love me , ”
156801	156809	156797	156797	Harry	112	“ She does n’t give a damn — ”
156810	156816	156817	156817	Dumbledore	133	“ But she took you , ”
156822	156873	156817	156817	Dumbledore	133	“ She may have taken you grudgingly , furiously , unwillingly , bitterly , yet still she took you , and in doing so , she sealed the charm I placed upon you . Your mother ’s sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you . ”
156874	156880	156797	156797	Harry	112	“ I still do n’t — ”
156881	156998	156817	156817	Dumbledore	133	“ While you can still call home the place where your mother ’s blood dwells , there you can not be touched or harmed by Voldemort . He shed her blood , but it lives on in you and her sister . Her blood became your refuge . You need return there only once a year , but as long as you can still call it home , there he can not hurt you . Your aunt knows this . I explained what I had done in the letter I left , with you , on her doorstep . She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years . ”
156999	157002	157004	157004	Harry	112	“ Wait , ”
157006	157011	157004	157004	Harry	112	“ Wait a moment . ”
157024	157041	156817	156817	Dumbledore	133	“ You sent that Howler . You told her to remember — it was your voice — ”
157042	157046	157048	157048	Dumbledore	133	“ I thought , ”
157055	157091	157051	157051	his	133	“ that she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you . I suspected the dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of having you as a surrogate son . ”
157092	157096	157098	157098	Harry	112	“ It did , ”
157101	157131	157098	157098	Harry	112	“ Well — my uncle more than her . He wanted to chuck me out , but after the Howler came she — she said I had to stay . ”
157144	157154	157155	157155	He	112	“ But what ’s this got to do with ... ”
157163	157173	157175	157175	Harry	112	“ I do n’t understand what you ’re saying , ”
157177	157206	157241	157241	Dumbledore	133	“ Do n’t you remember asking me , as you lay in the hospital wing , why Voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby ? ”
157210	157219	157241	157241	Dumbledore	133	“ Ought I to have told you then ? ”
157309	157315	157316	157316	Harry	112	“ The prophecy ’s smashed , ”
157320	157347	157316	157316	Harry	112	“ I was pulling Neville up those benches in the — the room where the archway was , and I ripped his robes and it fell ... ”
157348	157386	157405	157405	Dumbledore	133	“ The thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the Department of Mysteries . But the prophecy was made to somebody , and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly . ”
157387	157392	157394	157394	Harry	112	“ Who heard it ? ”
157654	157658	157659	157659	Harry	112	“ Professor Dumbledore ? ”
157679	157691	157665	157665	Dumbledore	133	“ It ... did that mean ... What did that mean ? ”
157692	157696	157698	157698	Dumbledore	133	“ It meant , ”
157700	157743	157698	157698	Dumbledore	133	“ that the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end of July , nearly sixteen years ago . This boy would be born to parents who had already defied Voldemort three times . ”
157761	157767	157755	157755	His	112	“ It means — me ? ”
157774	157782	157783	157783	he	133	“ The odd thing is , Harry , ”
157787	157856	157783	157783	he	133	“ that it may not have meant you at all . Sybill ’s prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys , both born at the end of July that year , both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix , both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times . One , of course , was you . The other was Neville Longbottom . ”
157857	157877	157755	157755	His	112	“ But then ... but then , why was it my name on the prophecy and not Neville ’s ? ”
157878	157894	157896	157896	Dumbledore	133	“ The official record was relabeled after Voldemort ’s attack on you as a child , ”
157898	157933	157896	157896	Dumbledore	133	“ It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of Prophecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom Sybill was referring . ”
157934	157943	157945	157945	Harry	112	“ Then — it might not be me ? ”
157947	157952	157954	157954	Dumbledore	133	“ I am afraid , ”
157968	157979	157954	157954	Dumbledore	133	“ that there is no doubt that it is you . ”
157980	158001	157896	157896	Dumbledore	133	“ But you said — Neville was born at the end of July too — and his mum and dad — ”
158002	158063	157954	157954	Dumbledore	133	“ You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy , the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort ... Voldemort himself would ‘ mark him as his equal . ’ And so he did , Harry . He chose you , not Neville . He gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse . ”
158064	158072	158074	158074	Harry	112	“ But he might have chosen wrong ! ”
158076	158085	158074	158074	Harry	112	“ He might have marked the wrong person ! ”
158086	158102	158104	158104	Dumbledore	133	“ He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him , ”
158106	158217	158104	158104	Dumbledore	133	“ And notice this , Harry . He chose , not the pureblood ( which , according to his creed , is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing ) , but the half - blood , like himself . He saw himself in you before he had ever seen you , and in marking you with that scar , he did not kill you , as he intended , but gave you powers , and a future , which have fitted you to escape him not once , but four times so far — something that neither your parents , nor Neville ’s parents , ever achieved . ”
158218	158227	158229	158229	Harry	112	“ Why did he do it , then ? ”
158237	158275	158229	158229	Harry	112	“ Why did he try and kill me as a baby ? He should have waited to see whether Neville or I looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was then — ”
158276	158289	158291	158291	Dumbledore	133	“ That might , indeed , have been the more practical course , ”
158293	158423	158291	158291	Dumbledore	133	“ except that Voldemort ’s information about the prophecy was incomplete . The Hog ’s Head Inn , which Sybill chose for its cheapness , has long attracted , shall we say , a more interesting clientele than the Three Broomsticks . As you and your friends found out to your cost , and I to mine that night , it is a place where it is never safe to assume you are not being overheard . Of course , I had not dreamed , when I set out to meet Sybill Trelawney , that I would hear anything worth overhearing . My — our — one stroke of good fortune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into the prophecy and thrown from the building . ”
158424	158431	158229	158229	Harry	112	“ So he only heard ... ? ”
158432	158528	158291	158291	Dumbledore	133	“ He heard only the first part , the part foretelling the birth of a boy in July to parents who had thrice defied Voldemort . Consequently , he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you — again marking you as his equal . So Voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you , that it might be wise to wait or to learn more . He did not know that you would have ‘ power the Dark Lord knows not ’ — ”
158529	158535	158537	158537	Harry	112	“ But I do n’t ! ”
158543	158575	158537	158537	Harry	112	“ I have n’t any powers he has n’t got , I could n’t fight the way he did tonight , I ca n’t possess people or — or kill them — ”
158576	158587	158589	158589	Dumbledore	133	“ There is a room in the Department of Mysteries , ”
158591	158726	158589	158589	Dumbledore	133	“ that is kept locked at all times . It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death , than human intelligence , than forces of nature . It is also , perhaps , the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there . It is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which Voldemort has not at all . That power took you to save Sirius tonight . That power also saved you from possession by Voldemort , because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests . In the end , it mattered not that you could not close your mind . It was your heart that saved you . ”
158773	158791	158763	158763	Harry	112	“ The end of the prophecy ... it was something about ... ‘ neither can live ... ’ ”
158792	158801	158803	158803	Dumbledore	133	“ ‘ ... while the other survives , ’ ”
158805	158808	158810	158810	Harry	112	“ So , ”
158828	158851	158810	158810	Harry	112	“ so does that mean that ... that one of us has got to kill the other one ... in the end ? ”
158852	158855	158857	158857	Dumbledore	133	“ Yes , ”
158977	158988	158990	158990	Dumbledore	133	“ I feel I owe you another explanation , Harry , ”
158993	159029	158990	158990	Dumbledore	133	“ You may , perhaps , have wondered why I never chose you as a prefect ? I must confess ... that I rather thought ... you had enough responsibility to be going on with . ”
159086	159118	159120	159120	Fudge	280	“ It is with great regret that I must confirm that the wizard styling himself Lord — well , you know who I mean — is alive and among us again , ”
159131	159212	159127	159127	he	280	“ It is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the dementors of Azkaban , who have shown themselves averse to continuing in the Ministry ’s employ . We believe that the dementors are currently taking direction from Lord — Thingy . We urge the magical population to remain vigilant . The Ministry is currently publishing guides to elementary home and personal defense that will be delivered free to all Wizarding homes within the coming month . ”
159241	159262	159127	159127	he	280	“ no truth whatsoever in these persistent rumors that You - Know - Who is operating amongst us once more . ”
159397	159414	159416	159416	Hermione	114	“ There you are , Harry , I knew they ’d drag you into it somehow , ”
159544	159562	159564	159564	Ron	113	“ He ’s ‘ the Boy Who Lived ’ again now , though , is n’t he ? ”
159567	159579	159564	159564	Ron	113	“ Not such a show - off maniac anymore , eh ? ”
159676	159689	159691	159691	Hermione	114	“ Yes , they ’re very complimentary about you now , Harry , ”
159699	159728	159730	159730	Hermione	114	“ ‘ A lone voice of truth ... perceived as unbalanced , yet never wavered in his story ... forced to bear ridicule and slander ... ’ Hmmm , ”
159734	159756	159730	159730	Hermione	114	“ I notice they do n’t mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing and slandering , though ... ”
159804	159814	159799	159800	Madam Pomfrey	120	“ quite enough damage to be going on with . ”
159842	159896	159898	159898	Hermione	114	“ ‘ You - Know - Who ’s Last Attempt to Take Over , pages two to four , What the Ministry Should Have Told Us , page five , Why Nobody Listened to Albus Dumbledore , pages six to eight , Exclusive Interview with Harry Potter , page nine ... ’ Well , ”
159909	159941	159898	159898	Hermione	114	“ it ’s certainly given them lots to write about . And that interview with Harry is n’t exclusive , it ’s the one that was in The Quibbler months ago ... ”
159942	159949	159951	159951	Luna	178	“ Daddy sold it to them , ”
159961	159997	159951	159951	Luna	178	“ He got a very good price for it too , so we ’re going to go on an expedition to Sweden this summer and see if we can catch a Crumple - Horned Snorkack . ”
160011	160016	160003	160003	herself	114	“ That sounds lovely . ”
160029	160033	160035	160035	Hermione	114	“ So anyway , ”
160046	160054	160035	160035	Hermione	114	“ what ’s going on in school ? ”
160055	160069	160071	160071	Ginny	182	“ Well , Flitwick ’s got rid of Fred and George ’s swamp , ”
160073	160098	160071	160071	Ginny	182	“ He did it in about three seconds . But he left a tiny patch under the window and he ’s roped it off — ”
160099	160102	160104	160104	Hermione	114	“ Why ? ”
160109	160124	160126	160126	Ginny	182	“ Oh , he just says it was a really good bit of magic , ”
160130	160144	160146	160146	Ron	113	“ I think he left it as a monument to Fred and George , ”
160153	160163	160164	160164	he	113	“ They sent me all these , you know , ”
160178	160192	160164	160164	he	113	“ Must be doing all right out of that joke shop , eh ? ”
160200	160212	160193	160193	Hermione	114	“ So has all the trouble stopped now Dumbledore ’s back ? ”
160213	160216	160218	160218	Neville	161	“ Yes , ”
160220	160229	160218	160218	Neville	161	“ everything ’s settled right back down again . ”
160230	160240	160242	160242	Ron	113	“ I s’pose Filch is happy , is he ? ”
160256	160261	160263	160263	Ginny	182	“ Not at all , ”
160265	160275	160276	160276	She	182	“ He ’s really , really miserable , actually ... ”
160284	160299	160278	160278	her	182	“ He keeps saying Umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to Hogwarts ... ”
160434	160444	160446	160446	Hermione	114	“ Madam Pomfrey says she ’s just in shock , ”
160448	160454	160456	160456	Ginny	182	“ Sulking , more like , ”
160458	160471	160473	160473	Ron	113	“ Yeah , she shows signs of life if you do this , ”
160496	160502	160508	160508	her	120	“ Anything wrong , Professor ? ”
160515	160520	160522	160522	Umbridge	144	“ No ... no ... ”
160530	160539	160522	160522	Umbridge	144	“ no , I must have been dreaming ... ”
160550	160555	160557	160557	Hermione	114	“ Speaking of centaurs , ”
160566	160577	160557	160557	Hermione	114	“ who ’s Divination teacher now ? Is Firenze staying ? ”
160578	160584	160586	160586	Harry	112	“ He ’s got to , ”
160588	160601	160586	160586	Harry	112	“ the other centaurs wo n’t take him back , will they ? ”
160602	160615	160617	160617	Ginny	182	“ It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach , ”
160619	160633	160635	160635	Ron	113	“ Bet Dumbledore wishes he could ’ve got rid of Trelawney for good , ”
160644	160665	160635	160635	Ron	113	“ Mind you , the whole subject ’s useless if you ask me , Firenze is n’t a lot better ... ”
160666	160673	160674	160674	Hermione	114	“ How can you say that ? ”
160677	160690	160674	160674	Hermione	114	“ After we ’ve just found out that there are real prophecies ? ”
160771	160779	160785	160785	her	114	“ It is a pity it broke , ”
160788	160794	160796	160796	Ron	113	“ Yeah , it is , ”
160798	160822	160823	160823	he	113	“ Still , at least You - Know - Who never found out what was in it either — where are you going ? ”
160836	160842	160844	160844	Harry	112	“ Er — Hagrid ’s , ”
160846	160872	160844	160844	Harry	112	“ You know , he just got back and I promised I ’d go down and see him and tell him how you two are ... ”
160873	160879	160881	160881	Ron	113	“ Oh all right then , ”
160899	160905	160881	160881	Ron	113	“ Wish we could come ... ”
160906	160914	160916	160916	Hermione	114	“ Say hello to him for us ! ”
160925	160939	160919	160919	Harry	112	“ And ask him what ’s happening about ... about his little friend ! ”
161214	161221	161202	161202	he	155	“ You ’re dead , Potter . ”
161227	161230	161231	161231	he	112	“ Funny , ”
161234	161245	161231	161231	he	112	“ you ’d think I ’d have stopped walking around ... ”
161276	161283	161285	161285	Malfoy	155	“ You ’re going to pay , ”
161295	161312	161285	161285	Malfoy	155	“ I ’m going to make you pay for what you ’ve done to my father ... ”
161313	161321	161323	161323	Harry	112	“ Well , I ’m terrified now , ”
161326	161348	161349	161349	he	112	“ I s’pose Lord Voldemort ’s just a warm - up act compared to you three — what ’s the matter ? ”
161370	161390	161358	161358	Goyle	157	“ He ’s your dad ’s mate , is n’t he ? Not scared of him , are you ? ”
161391	161403	161405	161405	Malfoy	155	“ You think you ’re such a big man , Potter , ”
161416	161434	161412	161412	Goyle	157	“ You wait . I ’ll have you . You ca n’t land my father in prison — ”
161435	161442	161444	161444	Harry	112	“ I thought I just had , ”
161446	161453	161455	161455	Malfoy	155	“ The dementors have left Azkaban , ”
161458	161469	161455	161455	Malfoy	155	“ Dad and the others’ll be out in no time ... ”
161470	161478	161480	161480	Harry	112	“ Yeah , I expect they will , ”
161482	161495	161480	161480	Harry	112	“ Still , at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now — ”
161531	161534	161512	161512	He	112	“ Potter ! ”
161587	161595	161597	161597	Snape	255	“ What are you doing , Potter ? ”
161612	161627	161629	161629	Harry	112	“ I ’m trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy , sir , ”
161637	161645	161646	161646	he	255	“ Put that wand away at once , ”
161650	161656	161646	161646	he	255	“ Ten points from Gryff — ”
161672	161704	161657	161657	Snape	255	“ Ah . I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hourglass to take away . In that case , Potter , we will simply have to — ”
161705	161710	161657	161657	Snape	255	“ Add some more ? ”
161750	161754	161756	161756	Snape	255	“ Professor McGonagall ! ”
161761	161771	161756	161756	Snape	255	“ Out of St. Mungo ’s , I see ! ”
161772	161778	161780	161781	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Yes , Professor Snape , ”
161789	161805	161780	161781	Professor McGonagall	200	“ I ’m quite as good as new . You two — Crabbe — Goyle — ”
161823	161826	161828	161829	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Here , ”
161845	161855	161842	161842	Goyle	157	“ take these up to my office for me . ”
161866	161870	161872	161873	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Right then , ”
161884	161920	161872	161873	Professor McGonagall	200	“ well , I think Potter and his friends ought to have fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of You - Know - Who ! What say you , Professor Snape ? ”
161921	161924	161926	161926	Snape	255	“ What ? ”
161937	161945	161926	161926	Snape	255	“ Oh — well — I suppose ... ”
161946	161965	161967	161968	Professor McGonagall	200	“ So that ’s fifty each for Potter , the two Weasleys , Longbottom , and Miss Granger , ”
161989	162001	162002	162002	she	200	“ Oh — and fifty for Miss Lovegood , I suppose , ”
162016	162039	162002	162002	she	200	“ Now , you wanted to take ten from Mr. Potter , I think , Professor Snape — so there we are ... ”
162056	162077	162078	162079	Professor McGonagall	200	“ Well , Potter , Malfoy , I think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this , ”
162277	162284	162285	162285	he	116	“ All righ ’ , Harry ! ”
162296	162317	162320	162320	him	112	“ Come in , come in , we ’ll have a cup o ’ dandelion juice ... How ’s things ? ”
162338	162352	162318	162318	Hagrid	116	“ You — er — feelin ’ all righ ’ , are yeh ? ”
162377	162382	162383	162383	Harry	112	“ I ’m fine , ”
162405	162413	162383	162383	Harry	112	“ So , where ’ve you been ? ”
162414	162423	162425	162425	Hagrid	116	“ Bin hidin ’ out in the mountains , ”
162427	162439	162425	162425	Hagrid	116	“ Up in a cave , like Sirius did when he — ”
162461	162467	162468	162468	he	116	“ Anyway , back now , ”
162472	162479	162481	162481	Harry	112	“ You — you look better , ”
162495	162499	162501	162501	Hagrid	116	“ Wha ’ ? ”
162512	162572	162501	162501	Hagrid	116	“ Oh — oh yeah . Well , Grawpy ’s loads better behaved now , loads . Seemed right pleased ter see me when I got back , ter tell yeh the truth . He ’s a good lad , really ... I ’ve bin thinkin ’ abou ’ tryin ’ ter find him a lady friend , actually ... ”
162661	162675	162677	162677	Hagrid	116	“ Ev’ryone knows you ’ve bin tellin ’ the truth now , Harry , ”
162682	162694	162677	162677	Hagrid	116	“ Tha ’s got ta be better , hasn ’ it ? ”
162698	162701	162702	162702	Hagrid	116	“ Look ... ”
162710	162738	162702	162702	Hagrid	116	“ I knew Sirius longer ’ n you did ... He died in battle , an ’ tha ’s the way he ’d ’ve wanted ter go — ”
162739	162749	162751	162751	Harry	112	“ He did n’t want to go at all ! ”
162761	162771	162772	162772	he	116	“ Nah , I don ’ reckon he did , ”
162776	162816	162772	162772	he	116	“ But still , Harry ... he was never one ter sit around at home an ’ let other people do the fightin ’ . He couldn ’ have lived with himself if he hadn ’ gone ter help — ”
162822	162838	162839	162839	he	112	“ I ’ve got to go and visit Ron and Hermione in the hospital wing , ”
162843	162846	162848	162848	Hagrid	116	“ Oh , ”
162854	162881	162848	162848	Hagrid	116	“ Oh ... all righ ’ then , Harry ... Take care of yerself then , an ’ drop back in if yeh’ve got a mo ... ”
162882	162887	162928	162928	people	3280	“ Yeah ... right ... ”
163624	163630	163632	163632	Ron	113	“ Just do it tomorrow ! ”
163644	163652	163632	163632	Ron	113	“ Come on , I ’m starving ... ”
163653	163666	163674	163674	Ron	113	“ I wo n’t be long ... Look , you go ahead ... ”
164047	164050	164022	164022	He	112	“ Sirius . ”
164106	164110	164087	164087	He	112	“ Sirius Black ! ”
164324	164342	164315	164322	the Fat Lady , who called after him	3010	“ The feast is about to start , you know , you ’re cutting it very fine ! ”
164455	164463	164444	164453	a translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor	3018	“ Hey — hey Nick ! NICK ! ”
164492	164496	164497	164497	he	112	“ Good evening , ”
164515	164530	164531	164531	he	112	“ I am not the only one who is late , then ? Though , ”
164534	164543	164531	164531	he	112	“ in rather different senses , of course ... ”
164544	164553	164566	164566	he	442	“ Nick , can I ask you something ? ”
164606	164613	164615	164615	Nick	442	“ Er — now , Harry ? ”
164620	164630	164615	164615	Nick	442	“ Ca n’t it wait until after the feast ? ”
164631	164638	164640	164640	Harry	112	“ No — Nick — please , ”
164642	164657	164640	164640	Harry	112	“ I really need to talk to you . Can we go in here ? ”
164672	164677	164678	164678	he	112	“ Oh very well , ”
164684	164696	164678	164678	he	112	“ I ca n’t pretend I have n’t been expecting it . ”
164714	164718	164719	164719	Harry	112	“ Expecting what ? ”
164728	164736	164738	164738	Nick	115	“ You to come and find me , ”
164754	164768	164738	164738	Nick	115	“ It happens , sometimes ... when somebody has suffered a ... loss . ”
164769	164772	164774	164774	Harry	112	“ Well , ”
164781	164796	164774	164774	Harry	112	“ You were right , I ’ve — I ’ve come to find you . ”
164801	164805	164807	164807	Harry	112	“ It ’s — ”
164820	164839	164807	164807	Harry	112	“ it ’s just — you ’re dead . But you ’re still here , are n’t you ? ”
164851	164860	164861	164861	Harry	112	“ That ’s right , is n’t it ? ”
164865	164888	164861	164861	Harry	112	“ You died , but I ’m talking to you ... You can walk around Hogwarts and everything , ca n’t you ? ”
164889	164892	164894	164896	Nearly Headless Nick	115	“ Yes , ”
164899	164907	164894	164896	Nearly Headless Nick	115	“ I walk and talk , yes . ”
164908	164919	164921	164921	Harry	112	“ So , you came back , did n’t you ? ”
164924	164945	164946	164946	he	112	“ People can come back , right ? As ghosts . They do n’t have to disappear completely . Well ? ”
164965	164975	164957	164959	Nearly Headless Nick	115	“ Not everyone can come back as a ghost . ”
164976	164981	164983	164983	Harry	112	“ What d’you mean ? ”
164986	164992	164957	164959	Nearly Headless Nick	115	“ Only ... only wizards . ”
164993	164996	164998	164998	Harry	112	“ Oh , ”
165007	165033	165001	165001	he	112	“ Well , that ’s okay then , the person I ’m asking about is a wizard . So he can come back , right ? ”
165046	165053	165034	165034	Nick	115	“ He wo n’t come back . ”
165054	165057	165001	165001	he	112	“ Who ? ”
165058	165062	165064	165064	Nick	115	“ Sirius Black , ”
165066	165071	165073	165073	Harry	112	“ But you did ! ”
165076	165090	165073	165073	Harry	112	“ You came back — you ’re dead and you did n’t disappear — ”
165091	165113	165115	165115	Nick	115	“ Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth , to walk palely where their living selves once trod , ”
165118	165127	165115	165115	Nick	115	“ But very few wizards choose that path . ”
165128	165132	165134	165134	Harry	112	“ Why not ? ”
165136	165163	165134	165134	Harry	112	“ Anyway — it does n’t matter — Sirius wo n’t care if it ’s unusual , he ’ll come back , I know he will ! ”
165209	165216	165218	165218	Nick	115	“ He will not come back , ”
165221	165229	165218	165218	Nick	115	“ He will have ... gone on . ”
165230	165240	165242	165242	Harry	112	“ What d’you mean , ‘ gone on ’ ? ”
165245	165284	165242	165242	Harry	112	“ Gone on where ? Listen — what happens when you die , anyway ? Where do you go ? Why does n’t everyone come back ? Why is n’t this place full of ghosts ? Why — ? ”
165285	165291	165293	165293	Nick	115	“ I can not answer , ”
165295	165304	165306	165306	Harry	112	“ You ’re dead , are n’t you ? ”
165309	165317	165306	165306	Harry	112	“ Who can answer better than you ? ”
165318	165325	165327	165327	Nick	115	“ I was afraid of death , ”
165329	165365	165327	165327	Nick	115	“ I chose to remain behind . I sometimes wonder whether I ought n’t to have ... Well , that is neither here nor there ... In fact , I am neither here nor there ... ”
165373	165408	165366	165366	He	115	“ I know nothing of the secrets of death , Harry , for I chose my feeble imitation of life instead . I believe learned wizards study the matter in the Department of Mysteries — ”
165409	165419	165421	165421	Harry	112	“ Do n’t talk to me about that place ! ”
165424	165435	165437	165437	Nick	115	“ I am sorry not to have been more help , ”
165440	165455	165437	165437	Nick	115	“ Well ... well , do excuse me ... the feast , you know ... ”
165602	165605	165607	165607	Luna	178	“ Hello , ”
165622	165632	165633	165633	Harry	112	“ How come you ’re not at the feast ? ”
165636	165647	165649	165649	Luna	178	“ Well , I ’ve lost most of my possessions , ”
165652	165686	165649	165649	Luna	178	“ People take them and hide them , you know . But as it ’s the last night , I really do need them back , so I ’ve been putting up signs . ”
165761	165769	165770	165770	he	112	“ How come people hide your stuff ? ”
165776	165781	165782	165782	She	178	“ Oh ... well ... ”
165785	165810	165782	165782	She	178	“ I think they think I ’m a bit odd , you know . Some people call me ‘ Loony ’ Lovegood , actually . ”
165825	165837	165838	165838	he	112	“ That ’s no reason for them to take your things , ”
165842	165849	165838	165838	he	112	“ D’you want help finding them ? ”
165850	165854	165855	165855	she	178	“ Oh no , ”
165862	165895	165855	165855	she	178	“ They ’ll come back , they always do in the end . It was just that I wanted to pack tonight . Anyway ... why are n’t you at the feast ? ”
165899	165907	165896	165896	Harry	112	“ Just did n’t feel like it . ”
165908	165911	165913	165913	Luna	178	“ No , ”
165925	165951	165913	165913	Luna	178	“ I do n’t suppose you do . That man the Death Eaters killed was your godfather , was n’t he ? Ginny told me . ”
165982	165986	165987	165987	he	112	“ Have you ... ”
165990	166004	165987	165987	he	112	“ I mean , who ... has anyone you ’ve known ever died ? ”
166005	166008	166010	166010	Luna	178	“ Yes , ”
166013	166049	166010	166010	Luna	178	“ my mother . She was a quite extraordinary witch , you know , but she did like to experiment and one of her spells went rather badly wrong one day . I was nine . ”
166050	166055	166056	166056	Harry	112	“ I ’m sorry , ”
166059	166067	166069	166069	Luna	178	“ Yes , it was rather horrible , ”
166072	166107	166069	166069	Luna	178	“ I still feel very sad about it sometimes . But I ’ve still got Dad . And anyway , it ’s not as though I ’ll never see Mum again , is it ? ”
166108	166115	166117	166117	Harry	112	“ Er — is n’t it ? ”
166127	166146	166122	166122	her	178	“ Oh , come on . You heard them , just behind the veil , did n’t you ? ”
166147	166151	166069	166069	Luna	178	“ You mean ... ”
166152	166176	166122	166122	her	178	“ In that room with the archway . They were just lurking out of sight , that ’s all . You heard them . ”
166221	166238	166239	166239	he	112	“ Are you sure you do n’t want me to help you look for your stuff ? ”
166242	166246	166248	166248	Luna	178	“ Oh no , ”
166250	166289	166248	166248	Luna	178	“ No , I think I ’ll just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up ... It always does in the end ... Well , have a nice holiday , Harry . ”
166290	166298	166299	166299	She	178	“ Yeah ... yeah , you too . ”
166510	166533	166535	166535	Ernie	338	“ I must say , I ’m looking forward to seeing Malfoy ’s mother ’s face when he gets off the train , ”
166574	166584	166586	166586	Ron	113	“ Goyle ’s mum’ll be really pleased , though , ”
166599	166623	166586	166586	Ron	113	“ He ’s loads better - looking now ... Anyway , Harry , the food trolley ’s just stopped if you want anything ... ”
166754	166762	166764	166764	Hermione	114	“ It has n’t really started yet , ”
166773	166782	166764	166764	Hermione	114	“ But it wo n’t be long now ... ”
166783	166788	166790	166790	Ron	113	“ Hey , Harry , ”
166861	166875	166876	166876	Ron	113	“ What ’s — er — going on with you and her anyway ? ”
166880	166883	166885	166885	Harry	112	“ Nothing , ”
166888	166903	166905	166905	Hermione	114	“ I — er — heard she ’s going out with someone else now , ”
166996	167006	167008	167008	Ron	113	“ You ’re well out of it , mate , ”
167011	167034	167008	167008	Ron	113	“ I mean , she ’s quite good - looking and all that , but you want someone a bit more cheerful . ”
167035	167045	167047	167047	Harry	112	“ She ’s probably cheerful enough with someone else , ”
167051	167059	167060	167060	Ron	113	“ Who ’s she with now anyway ? ”
167071	167075	167076	167076	she	182	“ Michael Corner , ”
167079	167084	167086	167086	Ron	113	“ Michael — but — ”
167098	167107	167086	167086	Ron	113	“ But you were going out with him ! ”
167108	167112	167114	167114	Ginny	182	“ Not anymore , ”
167117	167145	167146	167146	She	182	“ He did n’t like Gryffindor beating Ravenclaw at Quidditch and got really sulky , so I ditched him and he ran off to comfort Cho instead . ”
167175	167189	167190	167190	he	113	“ Well , I always thought he was a bit of an idiot , ”
167203	167217	167190	167190	he	113	“ Good for you . Just choose someone — better — next time . ”
167230	167246	167248	167248	Ginny	182	“ Well , I ’ve chosen Dean Thomas , would you say he ’s better ? ”
167251	167254	167256	167256	Ron	113	“ WHAT ? ”
167579	167584	167586	167587	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ Ron , Ginny ! ”
167597	167608	167586	167587	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ Oh , and Harry dear — how are you ? ”
167609	167612	167614	167614	Harry	112	“ Fine , ”
167639	167647	167648	167648	he	113	“ What are they supposed to be ? ”
167656	167664	167666	167666	Fred	149	“ Finest dragon skin , little bro , ”
167675	167687	167666	167666	Fred	149	“ Business is booming and we thought we ’d treat ourselves . ”
167688	167693	167695	167695	Lupin	361	“ Hello , Harry , ”
167710	167713	167715	167715	Harry	112	“ Hi , ”
167717	167730	167715	167715	Harry	112	“ I did n’t expect ... what are you all doing here ? ”
167731	167734	167736	167736	Lupin	361	“ Well , ”
167742	167763	167736	167736	Lupin	361	“ we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home . ”
167764	167774	167776	167776	Harry	112	“ I dunno if that ’s a good idea , ”
167780	167788	167790	167790	Moody	221	“ Oh , I think it is , ”
167799	167810	167790	167790	Moody	221	“ That ’ll be them , will it , Potter ? ”
167876	167881	167883	167884	Mr. Weasley	201	“ Ah , Harry ! ”
167910	167920	167883	167884	Mr. Weasley	201	“ Well — shall we do it , then ? ”
167921	167930	167932	167932	Moody	221	“ Yeah , I reckon so , Arthur , ”
167970	167974	167976	167977	Mr. Weasley	201	“ Good afternoon , ”
167993	168005	167976	167977	Mr. Weasley	201	“ You might remember me , my name ’s Arthur Weasley . ”
168122	168137	168139	168140	Mr. Weasley	201	“ We thought we ’d just have a few words with you about Harry , ”
168145	168148	168150	168150	Moody	221	“ Yeah , ”
168152	168165	168150	168150	Moody	221	“ About how he ’s treated when he ’s at your place . ”
168202	168221	168196	168196	he	221	“ I am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my house — ”
168222	168238	168240	168240	Moody	221	“ I expect what you ’re not aware of would fill several books , Dursley , ”
168242	168251	168253	168253	Tonks	220	“ Anyway , that ’s not the point , ”
168282	168298	168272	168272	she	220	“ The point is , if we find out you ’ve been horrible to Harry — ”
168299	168312	168314	168314	Lupin	361	“ — and make no mistake , we ’ll hear about it , ”
168317	168320	168322	168323	Mr. Weasley	201	“ Yes , ”
168325	168337	168322	168323	Mr. Weasley	201	“ even if you wo n’t let Harry use the fellytone — ”
168338	168341	168343	168343	Hermione	114	“ Telephone , ”
168345	168370	168372	168372	Moody	221	“ Yeah , if we get any hint that Potter ’s been mistreated in any way , you ’ll have us to answer to , ”
168395	168403	168404	168404	he	272	“ Are you threatening me , sir ? ”
168416	168422	168424	168426	Mad - Eye	221	“ Yes , I am , ”
168442	168457	168459	168460	Uncle Vernon	272	“ And do I look like the kind of man who can be intimidated ? ”
168462	168465	168467	168467	Moody	221	“ Well ... ”
168496	168509	168482	168483	Uncle Vernon	272	“ Yes , I ’d have to say you do , Dursley . ”
168518	168552	168510	168510	He	221	“ So , Potter ... give us a shout if you need us . If we do n’t hear from you for three days in a row , we ’ll send someone along ... ”
168587	168595	168597	168597	Moody	221	“ ’ Bye , then , Potter , ”
168611	168617	168619	168619	Lupin	361	“ Take care , Harry , ”
168622	168627	168619	168619	Lupin	361	“ Keep in touch . ”
168628	168644	168645	168646	Mrs. Weasley	175	“ Harry , we ’ll have you away from there as soon as we can , ”
168653	168662	168664	168664	Ron	113	“ We ’ll see you soon , mate , ”
168672	168678	168680	168680	Hermione	114	“ Really soon , Harry , ”
168683	168687	168680	168680	Hermione	114	“ We promise . ”
