1084	1098	1080	1080	they	423	“ The Potters , that ’s right , that ’s what I heard — ”
1099	1108	1080	1080	they	423	“ — yes , their son , Harry — ”
1340	1343	1344	1344	he	98	“ Sorry , ”
1413	1457	1402	1402	he	443	“ Do n’t be sorry , my dear sir , for nothing could upset me today ! Rejoice , for You - Know - Who has gone at last ! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating , this happy , happy day ! ”
1600	1603	1605	1606	Mr. Dursley	98	“ Shoo ! ”
1692	1696	1668	1668	She	97	“ Wo n’t ! ”
1732	1798	1714	1714	he	98	“ And finally , bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation ’s owls have been behaving very unusually today . Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight , there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise . Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern . ”
1806	1833	1802	1802	himself	98	“ Most mysterious . And now , over to Jim McGuffin with the weather . Going to be any more showers of owls tonight , Jim ? ”
1834	1839	1841	1842	the weatherman	456	“ Well , Ted , ”
1844	1928	1841	1842	the weatherman	456	“ I do n’t know about that , but it ’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today . Viewers as far apart as Kent , Yorkshire , and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday , they ’ve had a downpour of shootingstars ! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it ’s not until next week , folks ! But I can promise a wet night tonight . ”
2000	2019	1994	1994	He	98	“ Er — Petunia , dear — you have n’t heard from your sister lately , have you ? ”
2045	2048	2049	2049	she	97	“ No , ”
2053	2056	2049	2049	she	97	“ Why ? ”
2057	2064	2065	2066	Mr. Dursley	98	“ Funny stuff on the news , ”
2069	2088	2065	2066	Mr. Dursley	98	“ Owls … shooting stars … and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today … ”
2089	2092	2094	2095	Mrs. Dursley	97	“ So ? ”
2097	2119	2094	2095	Mrs. Dursley	97	“ Well , I just thought … maybe … it was something to do with … you know … her crowd . ”
2142	2145	2133	2133	he	98	“ Potter . ”
2163	2179	2154	2154	he	98	“ Their son — he’d be about Dudley ’s age now , would n’t he ? ”
2180	2185	2187	2188	Mrs. Dursley	97	“ I suppose so , ”
2191	2204	2187	2188	Mrs. Dursley	97	“ What ’s his name again ? Howard , is n’t it ? ”
2205	2218	2160	2160	he	98	“ Harry . Nasty , common name , if you ask me . ”
2219	2224	2226	2227	Mr. Dursley	98	“ Oh , yes , ”
2234	2241	2242	2242	He	98	“ Yes , I quite agree . ”
2774	2780	2769	2769	He	112	“ I should have known . ”
2954	2963	2949	2949	he	112	“ Fancy seeing you here , Professor McGonagall . ”
3034	3043	3044	3044	she	482	“ How did you know it was me ? ”
3047	3062	3044	3044	she	482	“ My dear Professor , I ’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly . ”
3063	3080	3082	3083	Professor McGonagall	113	“ You ’d be stiff if you ’d been sitting on a brick wall all day , ”
3085	3110	3082	3083	Professor McGonagall	113	“ All day ? When you could have been celebrating ? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here . ”
3116	3127	3128	3128	she	482	“ Oh yes , everyone ’s celebrating , all right , ”
3132	3163	3128	3128	she	482	“ You ’d think they ’d be a bit more careful , but no — even the Muggles have noticed something ’s going on . It was on their news . ”
3178	3224	3164	3164	She	482	“ I heard it . Flocks of owls … shooting stars … Well , they ’re not completely stupid . They were bound to notice something . Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle . He never had much sense . ”
3225	3232	3234	3234	Dumbledore	112	“ You ca n’t blame them , ”
3237	3249	3234	3234	Dumbledore	112	“ We ’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years . ”
3250	3255	3257	3258	Professor McGonagall	113	“ I know that , ”
3261	3296	3257	3258	Professor McGonagall	113	“ But that ’s no reason to lose our heads . People are being downright careless , out on the streets in broad daylight , not even dressed in Muggle clothes , swapping rumors . ”
3329	3370	3325	3325	she	482	“ A fine thing it would be if , on the very day You - Know - Who seems to have disappeared at last , the Muggles found out about us all . I suppose he reallyhas gone , Dumbledore ? ”
3371	3377	3379	3379	Dumbledore	112	“ It certainly seems so , ”
3381	3398	3379	3379	Dumbledore	112	“ We have much to be thankful for . Would you care for a lemon drop ? ”
3399	3402	3325	3325	she	482	“ Awhat ? ”
3403	3421	3436	3436	she	482	“ A lemon drop . They ’re a kind of Muggle sweet I ’m rather fond of . ”
3422	3428	3430	3431	Professor McGonagall	113	“ No , thank you , ”
3448	3462	3436	3436	she	482	“ As I say , even if You - Know - Whohas gone — ”
3463	3512	3513	3514	Professor McGonagall	113	“ My dear Professor , surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name ? All this ‘ You - Know - Who ’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name : Voldemort . ”
3532	3564	3518	3518	Dumbledore	112	“It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘ You - Know - Who . ’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort ’s name . ”
3565	3571	3574	3575	Professor McGonagall	113	“ I know you have n’t ”
3584	3611	3574	3575	Professor McGonagall	113	“ But you ’re different . Everyone knows you ’re the only one You Know — oh , all right , Voldemort , was frightened of . ”
3612	3617	3619	3619	Dumbledore	112	“ You flatter me , ”
3622	3631	3619	3619	Dumbledore	112	“ Voldemort had powers I will never have . ”
3632	3646	3518	3518	Dumbledore	112	“ Only because you ’re too — well — noble to use them . ”
3647	3672	3673	3674	Professor McGonagall	113	“ It ’s lucky it ’s dark . I have n’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs . ”
3682	3713	3673	3674	Professor McGonagall	113	said,“The owls are nothing next to therumors that are flying around . You know what everyone ’s saying ? About why he ’s disappeared ? About what finally stopped him ? ”
3773	3774	3756	3756	she	113	whatever“everyone ”
3807	3811	3812	3812	she	113	“ What they’resaying , ”
3814	3850	3851	3851	Dumbledore	112	on,“is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric ’s Hollow . He went to find the Potters . The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that they’re — dead . ”
3860	3883	3856	3857	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Lily and James … I ca n’t believe it … I did n’t want to believe it … Oh , Albus … ”
3894	3900	3901	3901	he	112	“I know … I know … ”
3915	3984	3905	3906	Professor McGonagall	113	“ That ’s not all . They ’re saying he tried to kill the Potter ’s son , Harry . But — he could n’t . He could n’t kill that little boy . No one knows why , or how , but they ’re saying that when he could n’t kill Harry Potter , Voldemort ’s power somehow broke — and that ’s why he ’s gone . ”
3989	3994	3996	3997	Professor McGonagall	113	“ It’s — it’strue ? ”
3999	4044	3996	3997	Professor McGonagall	113	“After all he ’s done … all the people he ’s killed … he could n’t kill a little boy ? It ’s just astounding … of all the things to stop him … but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive ? ”
4045	4051	4053	4053	Dumbledore	112	“ We can only guess , ”
4055	4061	4053	4053	Dumbledore	112	“ We may never know . ”
4140	4161	4132	4132	he	112	said,“Hagrid ’s late . I suppose it was he who told you I ’d be here , by the way ? ”
4162	4165	4167	4168	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Yes , ”
4170	4190	4167	4168	Professor McGonagall	113	“ And I do n’t suppose you ’re going to tell mewhy you ’re here , of all places ? ”
4191	4214	4132	4132	he	112	“ I ’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle . They ’re the only family he has left now . ”
4215	4228	4230	4231	Professor McGonagall	113	“ You do n’t mean — youcan’t mean the people who livehere ? ”
4243	4300	4230	4231	Professor McGonagall	113	“Dumbledore — you ca n’t . I ’ve been watching them all day . You could n’t find two people who are less like us . And they ’ve got this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street , screaming for sweets . Harry Potter come and live here ! ”
4301	4310	4312	4312	Dumbledore	112	“ It ’s the best place for him , ”
4315	4340	4312	4312	Dumbledore	112	“ His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he ’s older . I ’ve written them a letter . ”
4341	4345	4347	4348	Professor McGonagall	113	“ A letter ? ”
4358	4423	4347	4348	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Really , Dumbledore , you think you can explain all this in a letter ? These people will never understand him ! He ’ll be famous — a legend — I would n’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in thefuture — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know his name ! ”
4424	4427	4429	4429	Dumbledore	112	“ Exactly , ”
4443	4498	4429	4429	Dumbledore	112	“ It would be enough to turn any boy ’s head . Famous before he can walk and talk ! Famous for something he wo n’t even remember ! Ca n’t you see how much better off he ’ll be , growing up away from all that until he ’s ready to take it ? ”
4513	4534	4535	4535	She	113	said,“Yes — yes , you ’re right , of course . But how is the boy getting here , Dumbledore ? ”
4552	4558	4542	4542	she	113	“ Hagrid ’s bringing him . ”
4559	4576	4542	4542	she	113	“ You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this ? ”
4577	4586	4588	4588	Dumbledore	112	“ I would trust Hagrid with my life , ”
4590	4604	4606	4607	Professor McGonagall	113	“ I ’m not saying his heart is n’t in the right place , ”
4610	4630	4606	4607	Professor McGonagall	113	“ but you ca n’t pretend he ’s not careless . He does tend to — what was that ? ”
4790	4793	4795	4795	Dumbledore	112	“ Hagrid , ”
4800	4812	4795	4795	Dumbledore	112	“ At last . And where did you get that motorcycle ? ”
4813	4822	4824	4825	the giant	492	“ Borrowed it , Professor Dumbledore , sir , ”
4836	4852	4824	4825	the giant	492	“ Young Sirius Black lent it to me . I ’ve got him , sir . ”
4853	4860	4795	4795	Dumbledore	112	“ No problems , were there ? ”
4861	4897	4898	4898	Dumbledore	112	“ No , sir — house was almost destroyed , but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin ’ around . He fell asleep as we was flyin ’ over Bristol . ”
4947	4953	4955	4956	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Is that where — ? ”
4958	4961	4963	4963	Dumbledore	112	“ Yes , ”
4965	4973	4963	4963	Dumbledore	112	“ He ’ll have that scar forever . ”
4974	4985	5036	5036	Dumbledore	112	“ Could n’t you do something about it , Dumbledore ? ”
4986	5035	5036	5036	Dumbledore	112	“ Even if I could , I would n’t . Scars can come in handy . I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground . Well — give him here , Hagrid — we’d better get this over with . ”
5050	5064	5066	5066	Hagrid	121	“ Could I — could I say good bye to him , sir ? ”
5105	5108	5095	5095	Hagrid	121	“ Shhh ! ”
5113	5120	5110	5111	Professor McGonagall	113	“ you ’ll wake the Muggles ! ”
5121	5128	5130	5130	Hagrid	121	“ S - s - sorry , ”
5146	5174	5130	5130	Hagrid	121	“ But I c - c - can’t stand it — Lily an ’ James dead — an ’ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles — ”
5175	5201	5202	5203	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Yes , yes , it ’s all very sad , but get a grip on yourself , Hagrid , or we ’ll be found , ”
5301	5304	5306	5306	Dumbledore	112	“ Well , ”
5309	5331	5306	5306	Dumbledore	112	“ that ’s that . We ’ve no business staying here . We may as well go and join the celebrations . ”
5332	5335	5337	5337	Hagrid	121	“ Yeah , ”
5344	5365	5337	5337	Hagrid	121	“ I ’ll be takin ’ Sirius his bike back . G’night , Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore , sir . ”
5402	5415	5417	5417	Dumbledore	122	“ I shall see you soon , I expect , Professor McGonagall , ”
5512	5518	5519	5519	he	122	“ Good luck , Harry , ”
5684	5694	5666	5673	people meeting in secret all over the country	509	“ To Harry Potter — the boy who lived ! ”
5917	5925	5905	5905	her	109	“ Up ! Get up ! Now ! ”
5940	5943	5944	5944	she	2307	“ Up ! ”

6031	6034	6036	6036	Harry	104	“ Nearly , ”
6038	6073	6074	6074	Harry	104	“ Well , get a move on , I want you to look after the bacon . And do n’t you dare let it burn , I want everything perfect on Duddy ’s birthday . ”
6077	6083	6084	6085	his aunt	2307	“ What did you say ? ”
6091	6096	6084	6085	his aunt	2307	“ Nothing , nothing … ”
6429	6439	6440	6440	she	109	“ In the car crash when your parents died , ”
6444	6451	6440	6440	she	109	“ And do n’t ask questions . ”
6483	6488	6489	6489	he	125	“ Comb your hair ! ”
6672	6676	6677	6677	he	100	“ Thirty six , ”

6783	6809	6781	6781	she	109	quickly,“And we ’ll buy you anothertwo presents while we ’re out today . How ’s that , popkin?Two more presents . Is that all right ? ”
6825	6833	6823	6823	he	100	slowly,“So I ’ll have thirty … thirty … ”
6834	6840	6842	6843	Aunt Petunia	109	“ Thirty nine , sweetums , ”
6845	6848	6842	6843	Aunt Petunia	109	“ Oh . ”
6859	6864	6849	6849	Dudley	100	“ All right then . ”

6961	6967	6968	6968	she	109	“ Bad news , Vernon , ”

7329	7340	7342	7343	Aunt Petunia	109	“ I suppose we could take him to the zoo , ”
7346	7355	7342	7343	Aunt Petunia	109	“ … and leave him in the car … ”
7356	7370	7371	7371	Dudley	100	“ That car ’s new , he ’s not sitting in it alone … ”

17344	17616	17341	17341	Hagrid	121	“Don’t make me say it again . Anyway , this — this wizard , about twenty years ago now , started lookin ’ fer followers . Got ’em , too — some were afraid , some just wanted a bit o ’ his power , ’cause he was gettin ’ himself power , all right . Dark days , Harry . Did n’t know who ter trust , did n’t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches … terrible things happened . He was takin ’ over . ’ Course , some stood up to him — an ’ he killed ’em . Horribly . One o ’ the only safe places left was Hogwarts . Reckon Dumbledore ’s the only one You - Know - Who was afraid of . Did n’t dare trytakin ’ the school , not jus ’ then , anyway . Now , yer mum an ’ dad were as good a witch an ’ wizard as I ever knew . Head boy an ’ girl at Hogwarts in their day ! Suppose the myst’ry is why You - Know - Who never tried to get ’em on his side before … probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin ’ ter do with the Dark Side . Maybe he thought he could persuade ’em … maybe he just wanted ’em outta the way . All anyone knows is , he turned up in the village where you was all living , on Halloween ten years ago . You was just a year old . He came ter yer house an’—an ’ — ”
17638	17641	17642	17642	he	121	“ Sorry , ”
17645	17851	17642	17642	he	121	“ But it ’s that sad — knew yer mum an ’ dad , an ’ nicer people yeh could n’t find — anyway … You - Know - Who killed ’em . An ’ then — an ’ this is the real myst’ry of the thing — he tried to kill you , too . Wanted ter make a clean job of it , I suppose , or maybe he just liked killin ’ by then . But he could n’t do it . Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead ? That was no ordinary cut . That ’s what yeh get when a powerful , evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an ’ dad an ’ yer house , even — but it did n’t work on you , an ’ that ’s why yer famous , Harry . No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ‘ em , no one except you , an ’ he ’d killed some o ’ the best witches an ’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons , the Bones , the Prewetts — an ’ you was only a baby , an ’ you lived . ”
17920	17940	17914	17914	Hagrid	121	“ Took yeh from the ruined house myself , on Dumbledore ’s orders . Brought yeh ter this lot … ”
17941	17947	17949	17950	Uncle Vernon	125	“ Load of old tosh , ”
17987	17996	17997	17997	he	125	“ Now , you listen here , boy , ”
18000	18079	17997	17997	he	125	“ I accept there ’s something strange about you , probably nothing a good beating would n’t have cured — and as for all this about your parents , well , they were weirdos , no denying it , and the world ’s better off without them in my opinion — asked forall they got , getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I expected , always knew they ’d come to a sticky end — ”
18111	18125	18085	18085	Hagrid	121	said,“I’m warning you , Dursley — I’m warning you — one more word … ”
18159	18164	18166	18166	Hagrid	121	“ That ’s better , ”
18202	18221	18188	18188	Harry	104	“ But what happened to Vol — , sorry — I mean , You - Know - Who ? ”
18222	18409	18410	18410	Hagrid	121	“ Good question , Harry . Disappeared . Vanished . Same night he tried ter kill you . Makes yeh even more famous . That ’s the biggest myst’ry , see … he was gettin ’ more an ’ more powerful — why’d he go ? Some say he died . Codswallop , in my opinion . Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die . Some say he ’s still out there , bidin ’ his time , like , but I don ’ believe it . People who was on his side came back ter ours . Some of ’em came outta kinda trances . Don ’ reckon they could ’ve done if he was comin ’ back . Most of us reckon he ’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers . Too weak to carry on . ’Cause somethin’ about you finished him , Harry . There was somethin’ goin’ on that night he had n’t counted on — I dunno what it was , no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped him , all right . ”
18527	18530	18531	18531	he	2407	“ Hagrid , ”
18535	18555	18531	18531	he	2407	“ I think you must have made a mistake . I do n’t think I can be a wizard . ”
18563	18581	18560	18560	Hagrid	121	“ Not a wizard , eh ? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry ? ”
18710	18713	18715	18715	Hagrid	121	“ See ? ”
18717	18736	18715	18715	Hagrid	121	“ Harry Potter , not a wizard — you wait , you ’ll be right famous at Hogwarts . ”
18750	18761	18762	18762	he	125	“ Have n’t I told you he ’s not going ? ”
18765	18799	18762	18762	he	125	“ He ’s going to Stonewall High and he ’ll be grateful for it . I ’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and — ”
18800	18817	18819	18819	Hagrid	121	“ If he wants ter go , a great Muggle like you wo n’t stop him , ”
18821	18902	18819	18819	Hagrid	121	“ Stop Lily an ’ James Potter ’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts ! Yer mad . His name ’s been down ever since he was born . He ’s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world . Seven years there and he wo n’t know himself . He ’ll be with youngsters of his own sort , fer a change , an ’ he ’ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled — ”
18903	18919	18921	18922	Uncle Vernon	125	“ I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS ! ”
18941	18943	18944	18944	he	121	head,“NEVER , ”
18947	18963	18944	18944	he	121	“ — INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME ! ”
19083	19089	19090	19090	he	121	“ Shouldn’ta lost me temper , ”
19094	19129	19090	19090	he	121	“ but it did n’t work anyway . Meant ter turn him into a pig , but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there was n’t much left ter do . ”
19142	19156	19157	19157	he	121	“ Be grateful if yeh did n’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts , ”
19160	19211	19157	19157	he	121	“ I’m — er — not supposed ter do magic , strictly speakin ’ . I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an ’ get yer letters to yeh an ’ stuff — one o ’ the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job — ”
19212	19222	19224	19224	Harry	104	“ Why are n’t you supposed to do magic ? ”
19226	19279	19224	19224	Harry	104	“ Oh , well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — got expelled , ter tell yeh the truth . In me third year . They snapped me wand in half an ’ everything . But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper . Great man , Dumbledore . ”
19280	19286	19157	19157	he	121	“ Why were you expelled ? ”
19287	19302	19304	19304	Hagrid	121	“ It ’s gettin ’ late and we ’ve got lots ter do tomorrow , ”
19307	19323	19324	19324	He	121	“ Got ta get up ter town , get all yer books an ’ that . ”
19337	19344	19345	19345	he	121	“ You can kip under that , ”
19348	19375	19345	19345	he	121	“ Don ’ mind if it wriggles a bit , I think I still got a couple o ’ dormice in one o ’ the pockets . ”
19398	19404	19405	19405	he	104	“ It was a dream , ”
19410	19444	19405	19405	he	104	“ I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards . When I open my eyes I ’ll be at home in my cupboard . ”
19493	19497	19498	19498	Harry	104	“ All right , ”
19501	19507	19498	19498	Harry	104	“ I ’m getting up . ”
19625	19631	19632	19632	Harry	104	“ Do n’t do that . ”
19658	19661	19663	19663	Harry	104	“ Hagrid ! ”
19666	19672	19663	19663	Harry	104	“ There ’s an owl — ”
19673	19677	19678	19678	Hagrid	121	“ Pay him , ”
19684	19687	19678	19678	Hagrid	121	“ What ? ”
19688	19704	19705	19705	Hagrid	121	“ He wants payin ’ fer deliverin ’ the paper . Look in the pockets . ”
19744	19750	19752	19752	Hagrid	121	“ Give him five Knuts , ”
19755	19758	19752	19752	Hagrid	121	“ Knuts ? ”
19759	19765	19766	19766	Harry	104	“ The little bronze ones . ”
19815	19842	19843	19843	Harry	104	“ Best be off , Harry , lots ter do today , got ta get up ter London an ’ buy all yer stuff fer school . ”
19877	19882	19855	19855	He	104	“ Um — Hagrid ? ”
19883	19886	19888	19888	Hagrid	121	“ Mm ? ”
19898	19926	19888	19888	Hagrid	121	“ I have n’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night … he wo n’t pay for me to go and learn magic . ”
19927	19934	19936	19936	Hagrid	121	“ Do n’t worry about that , ”
19945	19956	19936	19936	Hagrid	121	“ D’yeh think yer parents did n’t leave yeh anything ? ”
19957	19965	19888	19888	Hagrid	121	“ But if their house was destroyed — ”
19966	20020	19888	19888	Hagrid	121	“ They didn ’ keep their gold in the house , boy ! Nah , first stop fer us is Gringotts . Wizards ’ bank . Have a sausage , they ’re not bad cold — an ’ I wouldn ’ say no teh a bit o ’ yer birthday cake , neither . ”
20021	20025	19936	19936	Hagrid	121	“ Wizards havebanks ? ”
20026	20037	19888	19888	Hagrid	121	“ Just the one . Gringotts . Run by goblins . ”
20048	20051	20038	20038	Harry	104	“ Goblins ? ”
20052	20117	20118	20118	Hagrid	121	“ Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an ’ rob it , I ’ll tell yeh that . Never mess with goblins , Harry . Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe—’cept maybe Hogwarts . As a matter o ’ fact , I got ta visit Gringotts anyway . Fer Dumbledore . Hogwarts business . ”
20124	20162	20120	20120	himself	121	“ He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him . Fetchin ’ you gettin ’ things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me , see . Got everythin ’ ? Come on , then . ”
20207	20214	20215	20215	Harry	104	“ How did you get here ? ”
20224	20227	20229	20229	Hagrid	121	“ Flew , ”
20231	20234	20229	20229	Hagrid	121	“ Flew ? ”
20235	20257	20258	20258	They	832	“ Yeah — but we ’ll go back in this . Not s’pposed ter use magic now I ’ve got yeh . ”
20277	20286	20288	20288	Hagrid	121	“ Seems a shame ter row , though , ”
20298	20322	20288	20288	Hagrid	121	“ If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit , would yeh mind not mentionin ’ it at Hogwarts ? ”
20323	20328	20330	20330	Harry	104	“ Of course not , ”
20363	20375	20376	20376	Harry	104	“ Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts ? ”
20379	20384	20386	20386	Hagrid	121	“ Spells — enchantments , ”
20395	20453	20386	20386	Hagrid	121	“ They say there ’s dragons guardin ’ the highsecurity vaults . And then yeh got ta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London , see . Deep under the Underground . Yeh’d die of hunger tryin ’ ter get out , even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat . ”
20504	20516	20517	20517	Hagrid	121	“ Ministry o ’ Magic messin ’ things up as usual , ”
20524	20532	20533	20533	Harry	104	“ There ’s a Ministry of Magic ? ”
20542	20546	20548	20548	Hagrid	121	“ ’ Course , ”
20550	20597	20548	20548	Hagrid	121	“ They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister , o ’ course , but he ’d never leave Hogwarts , so old Cornelius Fudge got the job . Bungler if ever there was one . So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning , askin ’ fer advice . ”
20598	20607	20548	20548	Hagrid	121	“ But what does a Ministry of Magicdo ? ”
20608	20636	20548	20548	Hagrid	121	“ Well , their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there ’s still witches an ’ wizards up an ’ down the country . ”
20637	20640	20548	20548	Hagrid	121	“ Why ? ”
20641	20666	20548	20548	Hagrid	121	“ Why ? Blimey , Harry , everyone’d be wantin ’ magic solutions to their problems . Nah , we ’re best left alone . ”
20744	20758	20730	20730	he	121	“ See that , Harry ? Things these Muggles dream up , eh ? ”
20759	20762	20764	20764	Harry	104	“ Hagrid , ”
20776	20785	20764	20764	Harry	104	“ did you say there aredragons at Gringotts ? ”
20786	20793	20795	20795	Hagrid	121	“ Well , so they say , ”
20797	20806	20795	20795	Hagrid	121	“ Crikey , I ’d like a dragon . ”

20853	20857	20859	20859	he	121	“ Muggle money , ”
20901	20909	20910	20910	he	121	“ Still got yer letter , Harry ? ”
20927	20930	20932	20932	Hagrid	121	“ Good , ”
20934	20945	20946	20946	Harry	104	“ There ’s a list there of everything yeh need . ”
21171	21180	21181	21181	Harry	104	“ Can we buy all this in London ? ”
21185	21193	21195	21195	Hagrid	121	“ If yeh know where to go , ”
21254	21266	21267	21267	he	121	“ I do n’t know how the Muggles manage without magic , ”
21428	21433	21435	21435	Hagrid	121	“ This is it , ”
21442	21453	21435	21435	Hagrid	121	“ the Leaky Cauldron . It ’s a famous place . ”
21644	21649	21637	21638	the bartender	888	saying,“The usual , Hagrid ? ”

He was fine while he was studyin ’ outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience … They say he met vampires in the Black Forest , and there was a nasty bit o ’ trouble with a hag — never been the same since . Scared of the students , scared of his own subject now , where ’s me umbrella ? ”

23583	23595	23572	23572	Harry	104	“ what ’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite ? ”
23596	23607	23609	23609	Hagrid	121	“ Stalagmite ’s got an ‘ m ’ in it , ”
23611	23631	23609	23609	Hagrid	121	“ An ’ don ’ ask me questions just now , I think I ’m gon na be sick . ”
23710	23714	23716	23716	Hagrid	121	“ All yours , ”
23788	23795	23796	23796	he	121	“ The gold ones are Galleons , ”
23799	23841	23842	23842	He	121	“ Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty nine Knuts to a Sickle , it ’s easy enough . Right , that should be enough fer a couple o ’ terms , we ’ll keep the rest safe for yeh . ”
23847	23864	23842	23842	He	121	“ Vault seven hundred and thirteen now , please , and can we go more slowly ? ”
23865	23870	23872	23872	Griphook	179	“ One speed only , ”
23946	23950	23952	23952	Griphook	179	“ Stand back , ”
23972	23994	23996	23996	Griphook	179	“ If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that , they ’d be sucked through the door and trapped in there , ”
23998	24011	24012	24012	Harry	104	“ How often do you check to see if anyone ’s inside ? ”
24015	24022	24024	24024	Griphook	179	“ About once every ten years , ”
24116	24147	24149	24149	Hagrid	121	“ Come on , back in this infernal cart , and do n’t talk to me on the way back , it ’s best if I keep me mouth shut , ”
24223	24231	24233	24233	Hagrid	121	“ Might as well get yer uniform , ”
24245	24273	24274	24274	He	104	“ Listen , Harry , would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick me up in the Leaky Cauldron ? I hate them Gringotts carts . ”
24307	24312	24313	24313	she	954	“ Hogwarts , dear ? ”
24322	24340	24313	24313	she	954	“ Got the lot here — another young man being fitted up just now , in fact . ”
24401	24404	24406	24407	the boy	436	“ Hello , ”
24409	24414	24406	24407	the boy	436	“ Hogwarts , too ? ”
24415	24418	24420	24420	Harry	104	“ Yes , ”
24422	24441	24443	24444	the boy	436	“ My father ’s next door buying my books and mother ’s up the street looking at wands , ”
24454	24499	24446	24446	He	436	“ Then I ’m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms . I do n’t see why first years ca n’t have their own . I think I ’ll bully father into getting meone and I ’ll smuggle it in somehow . ”
24507	24514	24515	24516	the boy	436	“ Haveyou got your own broom ? ”
24520	24523	24525	24525	Harry	104	“ No , ”
24527	24533	24515	24516	the boy	436	“ Play Quidditch at all ? ”
24534	24537	24538	24538	Harry	104	“ No , ”
24550	24588	24538	24538	Harry	104	“ I do — Father says it ’s a crime if I ’m not picked to play for my house , and I must say , I agree . Know what house you ’ll be in yet ? ”
24589	24592	24594	24594	Harry	104	“ No , ”
24603	24648	24594	24594	Harry	104	“ Well , no one really knows until they get there , do they , but I know I ’ll be in Slytherin , all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff , I think I ’d leave , would n’t you ? ”
24649	24652	24654	24654	Harry	104	“ Mmm , ”
24666	24675	24677	24678	the boy	436	“ I say , look at that man ! ”
24710	24715	24717	24717	Harry	104	“ That ’s Hagrid , ”
24728	24734	24717	24717	Harry	104	“ He works at Hogwarts . ”
24735	24738	24740	24741	the boy	436	“ Oh , ”
24743	24761	24740	24741	the boy	436	“ I ’ve heard of him . He ’s a sort of servant , is n’t he ? ”
24762	24768	24770	24770	Harry	104	“ He ’s the gamekeeper , ”
24783	24827	24772	24772	He	104	“ Yes , exactly . I heard he ’s a sort ofsavage — lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk , tries to do magic , and ends up setting fire to his bed . ”
24828	24835	24837	24837	Harry	104	“ I think he ’s brilliant , ”
24840	24844	24846	24847	the boy	436	“ Do you ? ”
24854	24866	24846	24847	the boy	436	“ Why is he with you ? Where are your parents ? ”
24867	24872	24874	24874	Harry	104	“ They ’re dead , ”
24891	24896	24898	24899	the other	967	“ Oh , sorry , ”
24907	24917	24898	24899	the other	967	“ But they wereour kind , were n’t they ? ”
24918	24933	24846	24847	the boy	436	“ They were a witch and wizard , if that ’s what you mean . ”
24934	25005	24898	24899	the other	967	“ I really do n’t think they should let the other sort in , do you ? They ’re just not the same , they ’ve never been brought up to know our ways . Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter , imagine . I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families . What ’s your surname , anyway ? ”
25014	25022	25024	25024	Harry	104	said,“That ’s you done , my dear , ”
25044	25057	25059	25061	the drawling boy	969	“ Well , I ’ll see you at Hogwarts , I suppose , ”
25086	25091	25093	25093	Hagrid	121	“ What ’s up ? ”
25095	25098	25099	25099	Harry	104	“ Nothing , ”
25139	25146	25136	25136	he	104	“ Hagrid , what ’s Quidditch ? ”
25147	25167	25136	25136	he	104	“ Blimey , Harry , I keep forgettin ’ how little yeh know — not knowin ’ about Quidditch ! ”
25168	25176	25178	25178	Harry	104	“ Do n’t make me feel worse , ”
25192	25208	25180	25180	He	104	“ — and he said people from Muggle families should n’t even be allowed in . ”
25209	25300	25136	25136	he	104	“ Yernot from a Muggle family . If he ’d known who yehwere — he ’s grown up knowin ’ yer name if his parents are wizardin ’ folk . You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh . Anyway , what does he know about it , some o ’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a long line o ’ Muggles — look at yer mum ! Look what she had fer a sister ! ”
25301	25306	25180	25180	He	104	“ So whatis Quidditch ? ”
25307	25351	25180	25180	He	104	“ It ’s our sport . Wizard sport . It ’s like — like soccer in the Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the air on broomsticks and there ’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain the rules . ”
25352	25360	25136	25136	he	104	“ And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff ? ”
25361	25381	25180	25180	He	104	“ School houses . There ’s four . Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o ’ duffers , but — ”
25382	25390	25392	25392	Harry	104	“ I bet I ’m in Hufflepuff , ”
25395	25401	25403	25403	Hagrid	121	“ Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin , ”
25406	25432	25403	25403	Hagrid	121	“ There ’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who was n’t in Slytherin . You - Know - Who was one . ”
25433	25447	25180	25180	He	104	“ Vol — sorry — You - Know - Who was at Hogwarts ? ”
25448	25455	25457	25457	Hagrid	121	“ Years an ’ years ago , ”
25582	25594	25578	25580	Professor Vindictus Viridian	187	“ I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley . ”
25595	25624	25626	25626	Hagrid	121	“ I ’m not sayin ’ that ’s not a good idea , but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances , ”
25628	25656	25626	25626	Hagrid	121	“ An ’ anyway , yeh couldn ’ work any of the curses yet , yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level . ”
25670	25677	25578	25580	Professor Vindictus Viridian	187	“ It says pewter on yer list ”
25819	25840	25812	25812	Hagrid	121	“ Just yer wand left — A yeah , an ’ I still have n’t got yeh a birthday present . ”
25847	25854	25812	25812	Hagrid	121	“ You do n’t have to — ”
25855	25929	25812	25812	Hagrid	121	“ I know I do n’t have to . Tell yeh what , I ’ll get yer animal . Not a toad , toads went outta fashion years ago , yeh’d be laughed at — an ’ I don ’ like cats , they make me sneeze . I ’ll get yer an owl . All the kids want owls , they ’re dead useful , carry yer mail an ’ everythin ’ . ”
25991	25997	25999	25999	Hagrid	121	“ Don ’ mention it , ”
26002	26039	25999	25999	Hagrid	121	“ Don ’ expect you ’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys . Just Ollivander ’s left now — only place fer wands , Ollivander ’s , and yeh got ta have the best wand . ”
26198	26202	26208	26208	Harry	104	“ Good afternoon , ”
26257	26260	26262	26262	Harry	104	“ Hello , ”
26265	26269	26271	26272	the man	443	“ Ah yes , ”
26274	26291	26271	26272	the man	443	“ Yes , yes . I thought I ’d be seeing you soon . Harry Potter . ”
26298	26340	26341	26342	Mr. Ollivander	188	“ You have your mother ’s eyes . It seems only yesterday she was in here herself , buying her first wand . Ten and a quarter inches long , swishy , made of willow . Nice wand for charm work . ”
26362	26412	26413	26414	Mr. Ollivander	188	“ Your father , on the other hand , favored a mahogany wand . Eleven inches . Pliable . A little more power and excellent for transfiguration . Well , I say your father favored it — it ’s really the wand that chooses the wizard , of course . ”
26439	26445	26432	26432	himself	104	“ And that ’s where … ”
26463	26477	26478	26478	he	188	“ I ’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it , ”
26482	26521	26478	26478	he	188	“ Thirteen and a half inches . Yew . Powerful wand , very powerful , and in the wrong hands … well , if I ’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do … ”
26537	26562	26535	26535	Hagrid	121	“ Rubeus ! Rubeus Hagrid ! How nice to see you again … Oak , sixteen inches , rather bendy , was n’t it ? ”
26563	26571	26573	26573	Hagrid	121	“ It was , sir , yes , ”
26575	26595	26597	26598	Mr. Ollivander	188	“ Good wand , that one . But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled ? ”
26603	26613	26615	26615	Hagrid	121	“ Er — yes , they did , yes , ”
26621	26631	26632	26632	he	121	“ I ’ve still got the pieces , though , ”
26636	26642	26644	26645	Mr. Ollivander	188	“ But you don’tuse them ? ”
26648	26655	26657	26657	Hagrid	121	“ Oh , no , sir , ”
26673	26676	26678	26679	Mr. Ollivander	188	“ Hmmm , ”
26687	26699	26700	26700	He	104	“ Well , now — Mr. Potter . Let me see . ”
26714	26721	26700	26700	He	104	“ Which is your wand arm ? ”
26722	26732	26734	26734	Harry	104	“ Er — well , I ’m right handed , ”
26736	26746	26747	26747	He	104	“ Hold out your arm . That ’s it . ”
26779	26850	26776	26776	he	104	“ Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance , Mr. Potter . We use unicorn hairs , phoenix tail feathers , and the heartstrings of dragons . No two Ollivander wands are the same , just as no two unicorns , dragons , or phoenixes are quite the same . And of course , you will never get such good results with another wizard ’s wand . ”
26885	26890	26891	26891	he	104	“ That will do , ”
26906	26938	26891	26891	he	104	“ Right then , Mr. Potter . Try this one . Beechwood and dragon heartstring . Nine inches . Nice and flexible . Just take it and give it a wave . ”
26967	26981	26982	26982	Harry	104	“ Maple and phoenix feather . Seven inches . Quite whippy . Try — ”
27004	27033	27034	27034	Harry	104	“ No , no here , ebony and unicorn hair , eight and a half inches , springy . Go on , go on , try it out . ”
27084	27128	27129	27129	Harry	104	“ Tricky customer , eh ? Not to worry , we ’ll find the perfect match here somewhere — I wonder , now — yes , why not — unusual combination — holly and phoenix feather , eleven inches , nice and supple . ”
27192	27218	27219	27219	He	188	cried,“Oh , bravo ! Yes , indeed , oh , very good . Well , well , well … how curious … how very curious … ”
27238	27243	27219	27219	He	188	“ Curious … curious … ”
27244	27247	27249	27249	Harry	104	“ Sorry , ”
27251	27256	27249	27249	Harry	104	“ butwhat ’s curious ? ”
27266	27333	27262	27262	his	188	“ I remember every wand I ’ve ever sold , Mr. Potter . Every single wand . It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand , gave another feather — just one other . It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when it ’s brother — why , it ’s brother gave you that scar . ”
27337	27401	27334	27334	Harry	104	“ Yes , thirteen and a half inches . Yew . Curious indeed how these things happen . The wand chooses the wizard , remember … I think we must expect great things from you , Mr. Potter … After all , He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named did great things — terrible , yes , but great . ”
27545	27558	27559	27559	he	121	“ Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves , ”
27590	27601	27603	27603	Hagrid	121	“ You all right , Harry ? Yer very quiet , ”
27638	27645	27646	27646	he	121	“ Everyone thinks I ’m special , ”
27651	27719	27646	27646	he	121	“ All those people in the Leaky Cauldron , Professor Quirrell , Mr. Ollivander … but I do n’t know anything about magic at all . How can they expect great things ? I ’m famous and I ca n’t even remember what I ’m famous for . I do n’t know what happened when Vol — sorry — I mean , the night my parents died . ”
27739	27809	27810	27810	Hagrid	121	“ Don ’ you worry , Harry . You ’ll learn fast enough . Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts , you ’ll be just fine . Just be yerself . I know it ’s hard . Yeh’ve been singled out , an ’ that ’s always hard . But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do , ’ smatter of fact . ”
27832	27838	27839	27839	he	121	“ Yer ticket fer Hogwarts , ”
27842	27887	27839	27839	he	121	“ First o ’ September — King ’s Cross — it ’s all on yer ticket . Any problems with the Dursleys , send me a letter with yer owl , she ’ll know where to find me … See yeh soon , Harry . ”
28216	28222	28208	28208	Dudley	100	“ Er — Uncle Vernon ? ”
28232	28251	28223	28224	Uncle Vernon	125	“ Er — I need to be at King ’s Cross tomorrow to — to go to Hogwarts . ”
28257	28270	28271	28271	Grunt	192	“ Would it be all right if you gave me a lift ? ”
28279	28283	28284	28284	He	104	“ Thank you . ”
28297	28320	28292	28293	Uncle Vernon	125	“ Funny way to get to a wizards ’ school , the train . Magic carpets all got punctures , have they ? ”
28327	28335	28321	28321	Harry	104	“ Where is this school , anyway ? ”
28336	28342	28344	28344	Harry	104	“ I do n’t know , ”
28366	28383	28384	28384	he	104	“ I just take the train from platform nine and three - quarters at eleven o’clock , ”
28393	28397	28390	28390	uncle	2308	“ Platform what ? ”
28398	28405	28414	28415	Uncle Vernon	125	“ Nine and three - quarters . ”
28406	28412	28414	28415	Uncle Vernon	125	“ Do n’t talk rubbish , ”
28417	28428	28414	28415	Uncle Vernon	125	“ There is no platform nine and three - quarters . ”
28429	28436	28414	28415	Uncle Vernon	125	“ It ’s on my ticket . ”
28437	28440	28442	28443	Uncle Vernon	125	“ Barking , ”
28445	28489	28442	28443	Uncle Vernon	125	“ howling mad , the lot of them . You ’ll see . You just wait . All right , we ’ll take you to King ’s Cross . We ’re going up to London tomorrow anyway , or I would n’t bother . ”
28490	28498	28499	28499	Harry	104	“ Why are you going to London ? ”
28508	28515	28517	28518	Uncle Vernon	125	“ Taking Dudley to the hospital , ”
28520	28534	28517	28518	Uncle Vernon	125	“ Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings . ”
28712	28750	28709	28709	his	125	“ Well , there you are , boy . Platform nine — platform ten . Your platform should be somewhere in the middle , but they do n’t seem to have built it yet , do they ? ”
28791	28797	28799	28800	Uncle Vernon	125	“ Have a good term , ”
29101	29110	29111	29111	Harry	104	“ — packed with Muggles , of course — ”
29181	29190	29192	29195	the boys ’ mother	1047	“ Now , what ’s the platform number ? ”
29197	29204	29206	29208	a small girl	1048	“ Nine and three - quarters ! ”
29220	29228	29206	29208	a small girl	1048	“ Mom , ca n’t I go … ”
29229	29251	29206	29208	a small girl	1048	“ You ’re not old enough , Ginny , now be quiet . All right , Percy , you go first . ”
29319	29325	29326	29328	the plump woman	1055	“ Fred , you next , ”
29331	29341	29343	29344	the boy	436	“ I ’m not Fred , I ’m George , ”
29346	29364	29343	29344	the boy	436	“ Honestly , woman , you call yourself our mother ? Ca n’t youtell I ’m George ? ”
29365	29372	29326	29328	the plump woman	1055	“ Sorry , George , dear . ”
29373	29381	29383	29384	the boy	436	“ Only joking , I am Fred , ”
29456	29460	29461	29461	Harry	104	“ Excuse me , ”
29468	29473	29474	29474	she	1055	“ Hello , dear , ”
29477	29489	29490	29490	She	1055	“ First time at Hogwarts ? Ron ’s new , too . ”
29523	29526	29528	29528	Harry	104	“ Yes , ”
29530	29546	29528	29528	Harry	104	“ The thing is — the thing is , I do n’t know how to — ”
29547	29555	29556	29556	she	1055	“ How to get onto the platform ? ”

29573	29632	29570	29570	she	1055	“ All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten . Do n’t stop and do n’t be scared you ’ll crash into it , that ’s very important . Best do it at a bit of a run if you ’re nervous . Go on , go now before Ron . ”
29633	29638	29640	29640	Harry	104	“ Er — okay , ”

30537	30541	30490	30491	the twins	1089	“ Or twice — ”

30564	30574	30576	30579	one of the twins	1091	“ How come Percy gets new robes , anyway ? ”
30581	30587	30589	30590	their mother	1102	“ Because he ’s aprefect , ”
30593	30615	30589	30590	their mother	1102	“ All right , dear , well , have a good term — send me an owl when you get there . ”
30633	30663	30627	30627	she	1102	“ Now , you two — this year , you behave yourselves . If I get one more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up a toilet or — ”
30664	30678	30627	30627	she	1102	“ Blown up a toilet ? We ’ve never blown up a toilet . ”
30679	30688	30627	30627	she	1102	“ Great idea though , thanks , Mom . ”
30689	30698	30627	30627	she	1102	“ It’snot funny . And look after Ron . ”
30699	30711	30718	30718	Ron	198	“ Do n’t worry , ickle Ronniekins is safe with us . ”
30712	30716	30718	30718	Ron	198	“ Shut up , ”
30743	30760	30761	30761	Harry	104	“ Hey , Mom , guess what ? Guess who we just met on the train ? ”
30773	30793	30761	30761	Harry	104	“ You know that black haired boy who was near us in the station ? Know who he is ? ”
30794	30797	30761	30761	Harry	104	“ Who ? ”

30832	30866	30761	30761	Harry	104	“ You ’ve already seen him , Ginny , and the poor boy is n’t something you goggle at in a zoo . Is he really , Fred ? How do you know ? ”
30867	30883	30761	30761	Harry	104	“ Asked him . Saw his scar . It ’s really there — like lightning . ”
30884	30912	30805	30807	the little girl	1118	“ Poor dear — no wonder he was alone , I wondered . He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform . ”
30913	30932	30933	30934	Their mother	1102	“ Never mind that , do you think he remembers what You - Know - Who looks like ? ”
30940	30971	30933	30934	Their mother	1102	“ I forbid you to ask him , Fred . No , do n’t you dare . As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school . ”
30972	30981	30933	30934	Their mother	1102	“ All right , keep your hair on . ”
30986	30990	30991	30992	their mother	1102	“ Hurry up ! ”
31026	31040	31019	31021	their younger sister	1124	“ Do n’t , Ginny , we ’ll send you loads of owls . ”
31041	31051	31071	31074	the boys ’ mother	1047	“ We ’ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat . ”
31052	31055	31019	31021	their younger sister	1124	“ George ! ”
31056	31062	31019	31021	their younger sister	1124	“ Only joking , Mom . ”
31173	31178	31179	31179	he	1134	“ Anyone sitting there ? ”
31189	31195	31196	31196	Harry	104	“ Everywhere else is full . ”
31237	31242	31227	31227	he	104	“ Hey , Ron . ”
31248	31271	31227	31227	he	104	“ Listen , we ’re going down the middle of the train — Lee Jordan ’s got a giant tarantula down there . ”
31272	31275	31277	31277	Ron	198	“ Right , ”
31279	31282	31284	31286	the other twin	1093	“ Harry , ”
31288	31313	31284	31286	the other twin	1093	“ did we introduce ourselves ? Fred and George Weasley . And this is Ron , our brother . See you later , then . ”
31314	31317	31319	31319	Harry	104	“ Bye , ”
31333	31340	31341	31341	Ron	198	“ Are you really Harry Potter ? ”
31348	31365	31367	31367	Ron	198	“ Oh well , I thought it might be one of Fred and George ’s jokes , ”
31369	31379	31380	31380	He	198	“ And have you really got — you know … ”
31401	31413	31398	31398	Ron	198	“ So that ’s where You - Know - Who — ? ”
31414	31417	31419	31419	Harry	104	“ Yes , ”
31421	31429	31419	31419	Harry	104	“ but I ca n’t remember it . ”
31430	31433	31435	31435	Ron	198	“ Nothing ? ”
31438	31453	31435	31435	Ron	198	“ Well — I remember a lot of green light , but nothing else . ”
31454	31457	31459	31459	Ron	198	“ Wow , ”
31494	31501	31503	31503	Harry	104	“ Are all your family wizards ? ”
31516	31525	31527	31527	Ron	198	“ Er — Yes , I think so , ”
31529	31550	31527	31527	Ron	198	“ I think Mom ’s got a second cousin who ’s an accountant , but we never talk about him . ”
31551	31561	31562	31563	The Weasleys	204	“ So you must know loads of magic already . ”
31582	31592	31594	31594	Ron	198	“ I heard you went to live with Muggles , ”
31596	31602	31594	31594	Ron	198	“ What are they like ? ”
31603	31631	31527	31527	Ron	198	“ Horrible — well , not all of them . My aunt and uncle and cousin are , though . Wish I ’d had three wizard brothers . ”
31632	31635	31637	31637	Ron	198	“ Five , ”
31648	31780	31781	31781	Ron	198	“ I ’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts . You could say I ’ve got a lot to live up to . Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch . Now Percy ’s a prefect . Fred and George mess around a lot , but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they ’re really funny . Everyone expects me to do as well as the others , but if I do , it ’s no big deal , because they did it first . You never get anything new , either , with five brothers . I ’ve got Bill ’s old robes , Charlie ’s old wand , and Percy ’s old rat . ”
31798	31841	31781	31781	Ron	198	“ His name ’s Scabbers and he ’s useless , he hardly ever wakes up . Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect , but they could n’t aff — I mean , I got Scabbers instead . ”
31932	31956	31957	31957	Ron	198	“ … and until Hagrid told me , I did n’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort — ”
31960	31963	31965	31965	Harry	104	“ What ? ”
31967	31978	31980	31980	Ron	198	“ You said You - Know - Who ’s name ! ”
31988	31997	31980	31980	Ron	198	“I’d have thought you , of all people — ”
31998	32012	32014	32014	Harry	104	“ I ’m not trying to bebrave or anything , saying the name , ”
32016	32040	32041	32041	he	104	“ I just never knew you should n’t . See what I mean ? I ’ve got loads to learn … I bet , ”
32059	32070	32041	32041	he	104	“ I bet I ’m the worst in the class . ”
32071	32093	32041	32041	he	104	“ You wo n’t be . There ’s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough . ”
32160	32167	32150	32154	a smiling , dimpled woman	1146	said,“Anything off the cart , dears ? ”
32339	32345	32322	32322	Harry	104	“ Hungry , are you ? ”
32346	32349	32351	32351	Harry	104	“ Starving , ”
32387	32397	32380	32380	He	198	said,“She always forgets I do n’t like corned beef . ”
32398	32406	32408	32408	Harry	104	“ Swap you for one of these , ”
32415	32419	32408	32408	Harry	104	“ Go on — ”
32420	32432	32434	32434	Ron	198	“ You do n’t want this , it ’s all dry , ”
32436	32444	32445	32445	he	198	“ She has n’t got much time , ”
32449	32458	32445	32445	he	198	“ you know , with five of us . ”
32459	32467	32469	32469	Harry	104	“ Go on , have a pasty , ”
32520	32525	32526	32526	Harry	104	“ What are these ? ”
32538	32547	32526	32526	Harry	104	“ They ’re notreally frogs , are they ? ”
32559	32562	32564	32564	Ron	198	“ No , ”
32566	32579	32564	32564	Ron	198	“ But see what the card is . I ’m missing Agrippa . ”
32580	32583	32528	32528	Ron	198	“ What ? ”
32584	32630	32631	32631	Harry	104	“ Oh , of course , you would n’t know — Chocolate Frogs have cards , inside them , you know , to collect — famous witches and wizards . I ’ve got about five hundred , but I have n’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy . ”
32682	32687	32689	32689	Harry	104	“ Sothis is Dumbledore ! ”
32691	32703	32705	32705	Ron	198	“ Do n’t tell me you ’d never heard of Dumbledore ! ”
32707	32721	32705	32705	Ron	198	“ Can I have a frog ? I might get Agrippa — thanks — ”
32815	32820	32809	32809	Dumbledore	122	“ He ’s gone ! ”
32821	32835	32837	32837	Ron	198	“ Well , you ca n’t expect him to hang around all day , ”
32839	32871	32872	32872	Ron	198	“ He ’ll be back . No , I ’ve got Morgana again and I ’ve got about six of her … do you want it ? You can start collecting . ”
32887	32891	32893	32893	Harry	104	“ Help yourself , ”
32895	32913	32893	32893	Harry	104	“ But in , you know , the Muggle world , people just stay put in photos . ”
32914	32927	32928	32928	Ron	198	“ Do they ? What , they do n’t move at all ? ”
32932	32934	32928	32928	Ron	198	“Weird ! ”
33035	33044	33045	33045	Ron	198	“ You want to be careful with those , ”
33049	33098	33099	33099	Ron	198	“ When they say every flavor , theymean every flavor — you know , you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade , but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe . George reckons he had a booger - flavored one once . ”
33117	33124	33099	33099	Ron	198	“ Bleaaargh — see ? Sprouts . ”
33241	33244	33245	33245	he	1165	“ Sorry , ”
33248	33258	33245	33245	he	1165	“ but have you seen a toad at all ? ”
33266	33277	33265	33265	he	1165	wailed,“I’ve lost him ! He keeps getting away from me ! ”
33278	33284	33286	33286	Harry	104	“ He ’ll turn up , ”
33288	33291	33293	33294	the boy	436	“ Yes , ”
33297	33305	33306	33306	He	1165	“ Well , if you see him … ”
33309	33319	33321	33321	Ron	198	“ Do n’t know why he ’s so bothered , ”
33323	33353	33321	33321	Ron	198	“ If I ’d brought a toad I ’d lose it as quick as I could . Mind you , I brought Scabbers , so I ca n’t talk . ”
33364	33377	33379	33379	Ron	198	“ He might have died and you would n’t know the difference , ”
33383	33411	33379	33379	Ron	198	“ I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting , but the spell did n’t work . I ’ll show you , look … ”
33441	33451	33452	33452	He	198	“ Unicorn hair ’s nearly poking out . Anyway — ”
33491	33503	33504	33504	she	1168	“ Has anyone seen a toad ? Neville ’s lost one , ”
33527	33539	33541	33541	Ron	198	“ We ’ve already told him we have n’t seen it , ”
33560	33575	33576	33576	She	1130	“ Oh , are you doing magic ? Let ’s see it , then . ”
33585	33591	33592	33592	He	198	“ Er — all right . ”
33597	33612	33594	33594	his	198	“Sunshine , daisies , butter mellow , Turn this stupid , fat rat yellow . ”
33629	33639	33641	33642	the girl	1130	“ Are you sure that ’s a real spell ? ”
33644	33755	33756	33756	She	1130	“ Well , it ’s not very good , is it ? I ’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it ’s all worked for me . Nobody in my family ’s magic at all , it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter , but I was ever so pleased , of course , I mean , it ’s the very best school of witchcraft there is , I ’ve heard — I’ve learned all our course books by heart , of course , I just hope it will be enough — I’m Hermione Granger , by the way , who are you ? ”
33790	33796	33797	33797	Ron	198	“ I ’m Ron Weasley , ”
33800	33804	33806	33806	Harry	104	“ Harry Potter , ”
33808	33813	33815	33815	Hermione	221	“ Are you really ? ”
33817	33859	33815	33815	Hermione	221	“ I know all about you , of course — I got a few extra books for background reading , and you ’re inModern Magical History andThe Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts andGreat Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century . ”
33860	33864	33866	33866	Harry	104	“ Am I ? ”
33871	33892	33894	33894	Hermione	221	“ Goodness , did n’t you know , I ’d have found out everything I could if it was me , ”
33896	33978	33980	33980	she	221	“ Do either of you know what house you ’ll be in ? I ’ve been asking around , and I hope I ’m in Gryffindor , it sounds by far the best ; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it , but I suppose Ravenclaw would n’t be too bad … Anyway , we ’d better go and look for Neville ’s toad . You two had better change , you know , I expect we ’ll be there soon . ”
33990	34005	34007	34007	Ron	198	“ Whatever house I ’m in , I hope she ’s not in it , ”
34018	34036	34009	34009	He	198	“ Stupid spell — George gave it to me , bet he knew it was a dud . ”
34037	34045	34047	34047	Harry	104	“ What house are your brothers in ? ”
34049	34052	34054	34054	Ron	198	“ Gryffindor , ”
34065	34106	34056	34056	Gloom	222	“ Mom and Dad were in it , too . I do n’t know what they ’ll say if I ’m not . I do n’t suppose Ravenclawwould be too bad , but imagine if they put me in Slytherin . ”
34107	34126	34163	34163	Harry	104	“ That ’s the house Vol — , I mean , You - Know - Who was in ? ”
34127	34130	34132	34132	Ron	198	“ Yeah , ”
34144	34161	34163	34163	Harry	104	“ You know , I think the ends of Scabbers ’ whiskers are a bit lighter , ”
34174	34190	34163	34163	Harry	104	“ So what do your oldest brothers do now that they ’ve left , anyway ? ”
34204	34222	34224	34224	Ron	198	“ Charlie ’s in Romania studying dragons , and Bill ’s in Africa doing something for Gringotts , ”
34226	34262	34224	34224	Ron	198	“ Did you hear about Gringotts ? It ’s been all over theDaily Prophet , but I do n’t suppose you get that with the Muggles — someone tried to rob a high security vault . ”
34266	34274	34224	34224	Ron	198	“ Really ? What happened to them ? ”
34275	34346	34347	34347	Harry	104	“ Nothing , that ’s why it ’s such big news . They have n’t been caught . My dad says it must ’ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts , but they do n’t think they took anything , that ’s what ’s odd . ’ Course , everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You - Know - Who ’s behind it . ”
34395	34396	34347	34347	Harry	104	saying“Voldemort ”
34400	34408	34409	34409	Ron	198	“ What ’s your favorite Quidditch team ? ”
34412	34421	34422	34422	Harry	104	“ Er — I do n’t know any , ”
34425	34428	34422	34422	Harry	104	“ What ! ”
34433	34448	34450	34450	he	198	“ Oh , you wait , it ’s the best game in the world — ”
34572	34577	34578	34578	he	104	“ Is it true ? ”
34581	34605	34578	34578	he	104	“ They ’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter ’s in this compartment . So it ’s you , is it ? ”
34606	34609	34611	34611	Harry	104	“ Yes , ”
34645	34656	34658	34660	the pale boy	1185	“ Oh , this is Crabbe and this is Goyle , ”
34669	34679	34658	34660	the pale boy	1185	“ And my name ’s Malfoy , Draco Malfoy . ”
34700	34739	34740	34740	He	225	“ Think my name ’s funny , do you ? No need to ask who you are . My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair , freckles , and more children than they can afford . ”
34746	34780	34781	34781	He	225	“You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others , Potter . You do n’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort . I can help you there . ”
34798	34814	34815	34815	he	225	“ I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself , thanks , ”
34836	34848	34849	34849	he	225	“ I ’d be careful if I were you , Potter , ”
34853	34902	34849	34849	he	225	“ Unless you ’re a bit politer you ’ll go the same way as your parents . They did n’t know what was good for them , either . You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid , and it ’ll rub off on you . ”
34910	34915	34916	34916	Ron	198	“ Say that again , ”
34927	34940	34941	34941	Malfoy	225	“ Oh , you ’re going to fight us , are you ? ”
34944	34951	34953	34953	Harry	104	“ Unless you get out now , ”
34974	35002	35003	35003	Goyle	224	“ But we do n’t feet like leaving , do we , boys ? We ’ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some . ”

35144	35153	35154	35154	Ron	198	“ I think he ’s been knocked out , ”
35165	35181	35159	35159	He	198	“ No — I do n’t believe it — he ’s gone back to sleep — ”
35187	35194	35195	35195	Harry	104	“ You ’ve met Malfoy before ? ”
35204	35212	35214	35214	Ron	198	“ I ’ve heard of his family , ”
35217	35269	35270	35270	He	198	“ They were some of the first to come back to our side after You - Know - Who disappeared . Said they ’d been bewitched . My dad does n’t believe it . He says Malfoy ’s father did n’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side . ”
35275	35283	35270	35270	He	198	“ Can we help you with something ? ”
35284	35337	35349	35349	Ron	198	“ You ’d better hurry up and put your robes on , I ’ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor , and he says we ’re nearly there . You have n’t been fighting , have you ? You ’ll be in trouble before we even get there ! ”
35338	35347	35349	35349	Ron	198	“ Scabbers has been fighting , not us , ”
35355	35364	35349	35349	Ron	198	“ Would you mind leaving while we change ? ”
35365	35389	35391	35391	Hermione	221	“ All right — I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly , racing up and down the corridors , ”
35397	35415	35416	35416	Ron	198	“ And you ’ve got dirt on your nose , by the way , did you know ? ”

36322	36528	36319	36320	Professor McGonagall	113	“ The start of term banquet will begin shortly , but before you take your seats in the Great Hall , you will be sorted into your houses . The Sorting is a very important ceremony because , while you are here , your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts . You will have classes with the rest of your house , sleep in your house dormitory , and spend free time in your house common room . The four houses are called Gryffindor , Hufflepuff , Ravenclaw , and Slytherin . Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards . While you are at Hogwarts , your triumphs will earn your house points , while any rulebreaking will lose house points . At the endof the year , the house with the most points is awarded the house cup , a great honor . I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours . The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school . I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting . ”
36563	36574	36576	36577	Professor McGonagall	113	“ I shall return when we are ready for you , ”

36593	36603	36604	36604	he	104	“ How exactly do they sort us into houses ? ”
36608	36631	36604	36604	he	104	“ Some sort of test , I think . Fred said it hurts a lot , but I think he was joking . ”

36877	36893	36872	36875	a fat little monk	1253	saying:“Forgive and forget , I say , we ought to give him a second chance — ”
36894	36939	36940	36946	A ghost wearing a ruff and tights	1254	“ My dear Friar , have n’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves ? He gives us all a bad name and you know , he ’s not really even a ghost — I say , what are you all doing here ? ”
36957	36961	36963	36965	the Fat Friar	1256	“ New students ! ”
36972	36981	36963	36965	the Fat Friar	1256	“ About to be Sorted , I suppose ? ”

37021	37030	36963	36965	the Fat Friar	1256	“ The Sorting Ceremony ’s about to start . ”
37049	37056	37057	37058	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Now , form a line , ”
37064	37069	37057	37058	Professor McGonagall	113	“ and follow me . ”

You can keep your bowlers black , Your top hats sleek and tall , For I ’m the Hogwarts Sorting HatAnd I can cap them all . There ’s nothing hidden in your headThe Sorting Hat ca n’t see , So try me on and I will tell youWhere you ought to be . You might belong in Gryffindor , Where dwell the brave at heart , Their daring , nerve , and chivalrySet Gryffindors apart;You might belong in Hufflepuff , Where they are just and loyal , Those patient Hufflepuffs are trueAnd unafraid of toil;Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw , If you ’ve a ready mind , Where those of wit and learning , Will always find their kind;Or perhaps in SlytherinYou’ll make your real friends , Those cunning folk use any meansTo achieve their ends . So put me on ! Do n’t be afraid!And do n’t get in a flap!You’re in safe hands ( though I have none)For I ’m a Thinking Cap ! ”

39427	39434	39436	39436	Ron	198	“ I know who you are ! ”
39439	39452	39436	39436	Ron	198	“ My brothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless Nick ! ”

Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row ! The Bloody Baron ’s becoming almost unbearable — he ’s the Slytherin ghost . ”
39694	39703	39705	39705	Seamus	245	“ How did he get covered in blood ? ”
39710	39716	39718	39720	Nearly Headless Nick	260	“ I ’ve never asked , ”
39792	39809	39810	39810	I	0	” As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart , the talk turned to their families . “
39818	39822	39810	39810	I	0	” said Seamus . “
39853	39858	39851	39851	him	1328	” The others laughed . “
39865	39869	39863	39863	Neville	199	” said Ron . “
39883	39887	39878	39878	she	1333	” said Neville , “
40048	40064	40042	40042	he	263	” On Harry ’s other side , Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons ( “
40105	40107	40108	40108	You	1340	” ; “
40124	40223	40108	40108	You	1340	” ) . Harry , who was starting to feel warm and sleepy , looked up at the High Table again . Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet . Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore . Professor Quirrell , in his absurd turban , was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair , a hooked nose , and sallow skin . It happened very suddenly . The hook nosed teacher looked past Quirrell ’s turban straight into Harry ’s eyes — and a sharp , hot pain shot across the scar on Harry ’s forehead . “
40226	40235	40108	40108	You	1340	” Harry clapped a hand to his head . “
40240	40244	40108	40108	You	1340	” asked Percy . “
40249	40288	40108	40108	You	1340	” The pain had gone as quickly as it had come . Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher ’s look — a feeling that he did n’t like Harry at all . “
40298	40303	40291	40292	that teacher	1343	” he asked Percy . “
40358	40397	40356	40356	Snape	266	” Harry watched Snape for a while , but Snape did n’t look at him again . At last , the desserts too disappeared , and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again . The hall fell silent . “
40458	40472	40473	40473	I	0	” Dumbledore ’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins . “
40564	40578	40579	40579	He	0	” Harry laughed , but he was one of the few who did . “
40584	40590	40579	40579	He	0	” he muttered to Percy . “
40594	40602	40579	40579	He	0	” said Percy , frowning at Dumbledore . “
40648	40649	40638	40638	he	0	” “
40666	40729	40660	40660	us	1358	” cried Dumbledore . Harry noticed that the other teachers ’ smiles had become rather fixed . Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick , as if he was trying to get a fly off the end , and a long golden ribbon flew out of it , which rose high above the tables and twisted itself , snakelike , into words . “
40736	40740	40732	40732	their	2285	” said Dumbledore , “
40746	40886	40660	40660	us	1358	” And the school bellowed : Hogwarts , Hogwarts , Hoggy Warty Hogwarts , Teach us something please , Whether we be old and baldOr young with scabby knees , Our heads could do with fillingWith some interesting stuff , For now they ’re bare and full of air , Dead flies and bits of fluff , So teach us things worth knowing , Bring back what we ’ve forgot , Just do your best , we ’ll do the rest , And learn until our brains all rot . Everybody finished the song at different times . At last , only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march . Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished , he was one of those who clapped loudest . “
40891	40899	40660	40660	us	1358	” he said , wiping his eyes . “
40917	41059	41060	41060	Peeves	231	” The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds , out of the Great Hall , and up the marble staircase . Harry ’s legs were like lead again , but only because he was so tired and full of food . He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed , or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hangingtapestries . They climbed more staircases , yawning and dragging their feet , and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt . A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them , and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him . “
41062	41070	41060	41060	Peeves	231	” Percy whispered to the first years . “
41074	41080	41081	41081	Peeves	231	” He raised his voice , “
41086	41105	41084	41084	yourself	231	” A loud , rude sound , like the air being let out of a balloon , answered . “
41117	41151	41107	41107	you	231	” There was a pop , and a little man with wicked , dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared , floating cross - legged in the air , clutching the walking sticks . “
41154	41163	41107	41107	you	231	” he said , with an evil cackle . “
41170	41181	41185	41185	Peeves	231	” He swooped suddenly at them . They all ducked . “
41198	41233	41188	41189	the Baron’ll	271	” barked Percy . Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished , dropping the walking sticks on Neville ’s head . They heard him zooming away , rattling coats of armor as he passed . “
41242	41252	41234	41234	You	231	” said Percy , as they set off again . “
41278	41300	41301	41301	Password	272	” At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress . “
41303	41307	41301	41301	Password	272	” she said . “
41311	41435	41308	41309	Caput Draconis	273	” said Percy , and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall . They all scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room , a cozy , round room full of squashy armchairs . Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another . At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the towers — they found their beds at last : five four posters hung with deep red , velvet curtains . Their trunks had already been brought up . Too tired to talk much , they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed . “
41443	41452	41301	41301	Password	272	” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings . “
41463	41634	41457	41457	He	1368	” Harry was going to ask Ron if he ’d had any of the treacle tart , but he fell asleep almost at once . Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much , because he had a very strange dream . He was wearing Professor Quirrell ’s turban , which kept talking to him , telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once , because it was his destiny . Harry told the turban he did n’t want to be in Slytherin ; it got heavier and heavier ; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy , laughing at him ashe struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher , Snape , whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke , sweating and shaking . He rolled over and fell asleep again , and when he woke next day , he did n’t remember the dream at all .
41635	41640	41723	41723	they	1370	“ There , look . ”
41641	41644	41457	41457	He	1368	“ Where ? ”
41645	41656	41457	41457	He	1368	“ Next to the tall kid with the red hair . ”
41657	41662	41723	41723	they	1370	“ Wearing the glasses ? ”
41663	41670	41457	41457	He	1368	“ Did you see his face ? ”
41671	41678	41679	41679	Whispers	274	“ Did you see his scar ? ”
41972	41977	41989	41990	the caretaker	1352	“ GOT YOUR CONK ! ”
42498	42515	42516	42516	she	113	“ Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts , ”
42519	42538	42516	42516	she	113	“ Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back . You have been warned . ”
42906	42913	42914	42914	Harry	104	“ What have we got today ? ”
42925	42932	42934	42934	Ron	198	“ Double Potions with the Slytherins , ”
42936	42961	42934	42934	Ron	198	“ Snape ’s Head of Slytherin House . They say he always favors them — we’ll be able to see if it ’s true . ”
42962	42968	42970	42970	Harry	104	“ Wish McGonagall favored us , ”
43139	43187	43130	43130	It	1420	“ Dear Harry , I know you get Friday afternoons off , so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three ? I want to hear all about your first week . Send us an answer back with Hedwig . Hagrid ”
43197	43217	43189	43189	Harry	282	“ Yes , please , see you later on the back of the note , and sent Hedwig off again ”
43364	43369	43370	43370	he	266	“ Ah , Yes , ”
43374	43383	43370	43370	he	266	“ Harry Potter . Our new — celebrity . ”
43439	43454	43455	43455	he	266	“ You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking , ”
43489	43581	43477	43477	Snape	266	“ As there is little foolish wand waving here , many of you will hardly believe this is magic . I do n’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes , the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins , bewitching the mind , ensnaring the senses … I can teach you how to bottle fame , brew glory , even stopper death — if you are n’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach . ”
43620	43623	43625	43625	Snape	266	“ Potter ! ”
43628	43646	43625	43625	Snape	266	“ What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood ? ”
43679	43687	43689	43689	Harry	104	“ I do n’t know , sir , ”
43699	43710	43711	43711	He	266	“ Tut , tut — fame clearly is n’t everything . ”
43717	43739	43711	43711	He	266	“ Let ’s try again . Potter , where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar ? ”
43791	43799	43783	43783	Goyle	224	“ I do n’t know , sir . ”
43800	43815	43816	43816	Harry	104	“ Thought you would n’t open a book before coming , eh , Potter ? ”
43863	43876	43854	43854	Snape	266	“ What is the difference , Potter , between monkshood and wolfsbane ? ”
43892	43898	43900	43900	Harry	104	“ I do n’t know , ”
43903	43918	43900	43900	Harry	104	“ I think Hermione does , though , why do n’t you try her ? ”
43942	43946	43947	43947	he	266	“ Sit down , ”
43952	44031	43947	43947	he	266	“ For your information , Potter , asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death . A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons . As for monkshood and wolfsbane , they are the same plant , which also goes by the name of aconite . Well ? Why are n’t you all copying that down ? ”
44047	44062	44046	44046	Snape	266	said,“And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek , Potter . ”
44230	44234	44236	44236	Snape	266	“ Idiot boy ! ”
44250	44266	44267	44267	Neville	199	“ I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire ? ”
44280	44289	44290	44290	Snape	266	“ Take him up to the hospital wing , ”
44311	44354	44301	44301	Ron	198	“ You — Potter — why did n’t you tell him not to add the quills ? Thought he ’d make you look good if he got it wrong , did you ? That ’s another point you ’ve lost for Gryffindor . ”
44375	44381	44382	44382	he	198	“ Do n’t push it , ”
44385	44395	44382	44382	he	198	“ I ’ve heard Snape can turn very nasty . ”
44441	44445	44447	44447	Ron	198	“ Cheer up , ”
44449	44469	44447	44447	Ron	198	“ Snape ’s always taking points off Fred and George . Can I come and meet Hagrid with you ? ”
44536	44542	44530	44530	Hagrid	121	saying,“Back , Fang — back . ”
44560	44564	44565	44565	he	121	“ Hang on , ”
44568	44572	44565	44565	he	121	“Back , Fang . ”
44633	44639	44641	44641	Hagrid	121	“ Make yerselves at home , ”
44672	44677	44678	44678	Harry	104	“ This is Ron , ”
44699	44705	44707	44707	Hagrid	121	“ Another Weasley , eh ? ”
44715	44731	44707	44707	Hagrid	121	“ I spent half me life chasin ’ yer twin brothers away from the forest . ”
44789	44793	44787	44787	Hagrid	121	Fitch“that old git . ”
44794	44846	44847	44847	Harry	104	“ An ’ as fer that cat , Mrs. Norris , I ’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime . D’yeh know , every time I go up ter the school , she follows me everywhere ? Ca n’t get rid of her — Fitch puts her up to it . ”
44877	44885	44855	44855	Hagrid	121	“ But he seemed to reallyhate me . ”
44886	44889	44891	44891	Hagrid	121	“ Rubbish ! ”
44893	44898	44891	44891	Hagrid	121	“ Why should he ? ”
44918	44925	44926	44926	Hagrid	121	“ How ’s yer brother Charlie ? ”
44930	44941	44926	44926	Hagrid	121	“ I liked him a lot — great with animals . ”
45045	45071	45073	45075	a Gringotts spokesgoblin	164	“ But we ’re not telling you what was in there , so keep your noses out if you know what ’s good for you , ”
45103	45106	45108	45108	Harry	104	“ Hagrid ! ”
45110	45130	45108	45108	Harry	104	“ that Gringotts break in happened on my birthday ! It might ’ve been happening while we were there ! ”
45384	45387	45389	45389	Harry	104	“ Typical , ”
45392	45413	45389	45389	Harry	104	“ Just what I always wanted . To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy . ”
45428	45442	45444	45444	Ron	198	“ You do n’t know that you ’ll make a fool of yourself , ”
45447	45473	45444	45444	Ron	198	“ Anyway , I know Malfoy ’s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch , but I bet that ’s all talk . ”
45874	45880	45881	45881	he	1484	“ It ’s a Remembrall ! ”
45884	45920	45881	45881	he	1484	“ Gran knows I forget things — this tells you if there ’s something you ’ve forgotten to do . Look , you hold it tight like this and if it turns red — oh … ”
45933	45940	45941	45941	Neville	199	“ … you ’ve forgotten something … ”
46010	46016	45989	45990	Professor McGonagall	113	“ What ’s going on ? ”
46017	46026	46029	46029	Malfoy	225	“ Malfoy ’s got my Remembrall , Professor . ”
46039	46043	46044	46044	he	225	“ Just looking , ”
46211	46221	46222	46222	she	1494	“ Well , what are you all waiting for ? ”
46225	46238	46239	46239	Harry	104	“ Everyone stand by a broomstick . Come on , hurry up . ”
46260	46270	46272	46273	Madam Hooch	268	“ Stick out your right hand over your broom , ”
46278	46285	46272	46273	Madam Hooch	268	“ and say ‘ Up ! ’ ”
46286	46289	46290	46290	everyone	2285	“ UP ! ”
46418	46436	46438	46439	Madam Hooch	268	“ Now , when I blow my whistle , you kick off from the ground , hard , ”
46441	46471	46438	46439	Madam Hooch	268	“ Keep your brooms steady , rise a few feet , and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly . On my whistle — three — two — ”
46500	46506	46507	46507	she	268	“ Come back , boy ! ”
46612	46616	46619	46619	her	268	“ Broken wrist , ”
46622	46637	46619	46619	her	268	“ Come on , boy — it ’s all right , up you get . ”
46647	46691	46638	46638	She	268	“ None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing ! You leave those brooms where they are or you ’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘ Quidditch . ’ Come on , dear . ”
46729	46740	46724	46724	Malfoy	225	“ Did you see his face , the great lump ? ”
46747	46753	46741	46743	The other Slytherins	262	“ Shut up , Malfoy , ”
46758	46766	46768	46769	Pansy Parkinson	249	“ Ooh , sticking up for Longbottom ? ”
46777	46787	46771	46775	a hard faced Slytherin girl	1499	“ Never thoughtyou’d like fat little crybabies , Parvati . ”
46788	46791	46793	46793	Malfoy	225	“ Look ! ”
46805	46817	46793	46793	Malfoy	225	“ It ’s that stupid thing Longbottom ’s gran sent him . ”
46830	46837	46839	46839	Harry	104	“ Give that here , Malfoy , ”
46852	46872	46848	46848	Malfoy	225	“ I think I ’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up a tree ? ”
46873	46877	46878	46878	Harry	104	“ Give ithere ! ”
46912	46919	46920	46920	Harry	104	called,“Come and get it , Potter ! ”
46925	46928	46920	46920	Harry	104	“ No ! ”
46933	46948	46951	46951	her	221	“Madam Hooch told us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble . ”
47063	47068	47069	47069	Harry	104	“ Give it here , ”
47072	47082	47069	47069	Harry	104	“ or I ’ll knock you off that broom ! ”
47083	47088	47090	47090	Malfoy	225	“ Oh , yeah ? ”
47160	47174	47175	47175	Harry	104	“ No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck , Malfoy , ”
47187	47196	47197	47197	he	104	“ Catch it if you can , then ! ”
47318	47322	47303	47303	he	104	“ HARRY POTTER ! ”
47348	47358	47340	47340	He	104	“ Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ”
47371	47380	47368	47368	her	113	furiously,“—howdare you — might have broken your neck — ”
47381	47390	47340	47340	He	104	“ It was n’t his fault , Professor — ”
47391	47398	47340	47340	He	104	“ Be quiet , Miss Patil . ”
47399	47403	47368	47368	her	113	“ But Malfoy — ”
47404	47417	47418	47418	Harry	104	“ That’senough , Mr. Weasley . Potter , follow me , now . ”
47649	47664	47645	47645	her	113	“ Excuse me , Professor Flitwick , could I borrow Wood for a moment ? ”
47708	47715	47717	47718	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Follow me , you two , ”
47734	47738	47739	47740	Professor McGonagall	113	“ In here . ”
47763	47768	47769	47769	she	113	“ Out , Peeves ! ”
47805	47821	47790	47791	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Potter , this is Oliver Wood . Wood — I’ve found you a Seeker . ”
47831	47838	47822	47822	Wood	289	“ Are you serious , Professor ? ”
47839	47842	47844	47845	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Absolutely , ”
47848	47874	47844	47845	Professor McGonagall	113	“ The boy ’s a natural . I ’ve never seen anything like it . Was that your first time on a broomstick , Potter ? ”
47912	47926	47927	47928	Professor McGonagall	113	“ He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty foot dive , ”
47932	47947	47948	47948	Wood	289	“ Did n’t even scratch himself . Charlie Weasley could n’t have done it . ”
47963	47973	47974	47974	he	289	“ Ever seen a game of Quidditch , Potter ? ”
47978	47987	47974	47974	he	289	“ Wood ’s captain of the Gryffindor team , ”
47992	48004	48006	48006	Wood	289	“ He ’s just the build for a Seeker , too , ”
48017	48046	48006	48006	Wood	289	“ Light — speedy — we’ll have to get him a decent broom , Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven , I ’d say . ”
48047	48098	48099	48100	Professor McGonagall	113	“ I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we ca n’t bend the first year rule . Heaven knows , we need a better team than last year . Flattened in that last match by Slytherin , I could n’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks … ”
48109	48131	48099	48100	Professor McGonagall	113	“ I want to hear you ’re training hard , Potter , or I may change my mind about punishing you . ”
48137	48145	48146	48146	she	113	“ Your father would have been proud , ”
48149	48158	48133	48133	she	113	“ He was an excellent Quidditch player himself . ”
48162	48165	48186	48187	Professor McGonagall	113	“ You’rejoking . ”
48211	48214	48215	48215	he	198	“ Seeker ? ”
48218	48232	48215	48215	he	198	“But first yearsnever — you must be the youngest house player in about — ”
48233	48238	48240	48240	Harry	104	“ — a century , ”
48259	48264	48265	48265	Ron	198	“ Wood told me . ”
48281	48288	48290	48290	Harry	104	“ I start training next week , ”
48292	48307	48290	48290	Harry	104	“ Only do n’t tell anyone , Wood wants to keep it a secret . ”
48325	48329	48331	48331	George	197	“ Well done , ”
48337	48351	48331	48331	George	197	“ Wood told us . We ’re on the team too — Beaters . ”
48352	48370	48372	48372	Fred	196	“ I tell you , we ’re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year , ”
48374	48410	48372	48372	Fred	196	“ We have n’t won since Charlie left , but this year ’s team is going to be brilliant . You must be good , Harry , Wood was almost skipping when he told us . ”
48411	48435	48331	48331	George	197	“ Anyway , we ’ve got to go , Lee Jordan reckons he ’s found a new secret passageway out of the school . ”
48436	48460	48461	48461	Fred	196	“ Bet it ’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week . See you . ”
48483	48502	48481	48481	Goyle	224	“ Having a last meal , Potter ? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles ? ”
48503	48527	48529	48529	Harry	104	“ You ’re a lot braver now that you ’re back on the ground and you ’ve got your little friends with you , ”
48568	48579	48581	48581	Malfoy	225	“ I ’d take you on anytime on my own , ”
48583	48617	48581	48581	Malfoy	225	“ Tonight , if you want . Wizard ’s duel . Wands only — no contact . What ’s the matter ? Never heard of a wizard ’s duel before , I suppose ? ”
48618	48624	48626	48626	Ron	198	“ Of course he has , ”
48631	48641	48626	48626	Ron	198	“ I ’m his second , who ’s yours ? ”
48653	48656	48657	48657	he	225	“ Crabbe , ”
48660	48679	48657	48657	he	225	“ Midnight all right ? We ’ll meet you in the trophy room ; that ’s always unlocked . ”
48693	48700	48702	48702	Harry	104	“What is a wizard ’s duel ? ”
48704	48716	48702	48702	Harry	104	“ And what do you mean , you ’re my second ? ”
48717	48731	48733	48733	Ron	198	“ Well , a second ’s there to take over if you die , ”
48757	48811	48753	48753	he	198	“ But people only die in proper duels , you know , with real wizards . The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other . Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage . I bet he expected you to refuse , anyway . ”
48812	48824	48753	48753	he	198	“ And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens ? ”
48825	48836	48837	48837	Ron	198	“ Throw it away and punch him on the nose , ”
48840	48844	48837	48837	Ron	198	“ Excuse me . ”
48855	48867	48869	48869	Ron	198	“ Ca n’t a person eat in peace in this place ? ”
48879	48892	48871	48871	Hermione	221	“ I could n’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying — ”
48893	48898	48899	48899	Ron	198	“ Bet you could , ”
48902	48942	48899	48899	Ron	198	“ — and youmustn’t go wandering around the school at night , think of the points you ’ll lose Gryffindor if you ’re caught , and you ’re bound to be . It ’s really very selfish of you . ”
48943	48953	48955	48955	Harry	104	“ And it ’s really none of your business , ”
48957	48962	48964	48964	Ron	198	“ Good - bye , ”
49021	49045	49011	49011	Ron	198	“ If he tries to curse you , you ’d better dodge it , because I ca n’t remember how to block them . ”
49114	49119	49120	49120	Ron	198	“ Half past eleven , ”
49125	49131	49120	49120	Ron	198	“ we ’d better go . ”
49196	49209	49285	49285	he	104	them,“I ca n’t believe you ’re going to do this , Harry . ”
49228	49231	49233	49233	Ron	198	“ You ! ”
49236	49241	49233	49233	Ron	198	“Go back to bed ! ”
49242	49249	49250	49250	Hermione	221	“ I almost told your brother , ”
49253	49269	49250	49250	Hermione	221	“ Percy — he ’s a prefect , he ’d put a stop to this . ”
49280	49284	49285	49285	he	104	“ Come on , ”
49331	49373	49315	49315	She	221	“ Do n’t youcare about Gryffindor , do youonly care about yourselves , I do n’t want Slytherin to win the house cup , and you ’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells . ”
49374	49378	49315	49315	She	221	“ Go away . ”
49379	49407	49315	49315	She	221	“ All right , but I warned you , you just remember what I said when you ’re on the train home tomorrow , you ’re so — ”
49459	49468	49469	49469	she	221	“ Now what am I going to do ? ”
49473	49479	49481	49481	Ron	198	“ That ’s your problem , ”
49483	49497	49481	49481	Ron	198	“ We ’ve got to go , we ’re going to be late . ”
49515	49522	49523	49523	she	221	“ I ’m coming with you , ”
49526	49531	49523	49523	she	221	“ You are not . ”
49532	49579	49481	49481	Ron	198	“ D’you think I ’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me ? If he finds all three of us I ’ll tell him the truth , that I was trying to stop you , and you can back me up . ”
49580	49587	49589	49589	Ron	198	“ You ’ve got some nerve — ”
49592	49600	49602	49602	Harry	104	“ Shut up , both of you ! ”
49605	49610	49602	49602	Harry	104	“ I heard something . ”
49618	49622	49624	49624	Ron	198	“ Mrs. Norris ? ”
49661	49689	49641	49641	He	199	“ Thank goodness you found me ! I ’ve been out here for hours , I could n’t remember the new password to get in to bed . ”
49690	49721	49730	49730	Harry	104	“ Keep your voice down , Neville . The password ’s ‘ Pig snout ’ but it wo n’t help you now , the Fat Lady ’s gone off somewhere . ”
49722	49728	49730	49730	Harry	104	“ How ’s your arm ? ”
49732	49735	49737	49737	Neville	199	“ Fine , ”
49742	49752	49737	49737	Neville	199	“ Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute . ”
49753	49775	49730	49730	Harry	104	“ Good — well , look , Neville , we ’ve got to be somewhere , we ’ll see you later — ”
49776	49782	49784	49784	Neville	199	“ Do n’t leave me ! ”
49791	49810	49784	49784	Neville	199	“ I do n’t want to stay here alone , the Bloody Baron ’s been past twice already . ”
49825	49858	49811	49811	Ron	198	“ If either of you get us caught , I ’ll never rest until I ’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about , and used it on you . ”
50014	50025	50026	50026	Ron	198	“ He ’s late , maybe he ’s chickened out , ”
50058	50073	50050	50050	someone	708	“ Sniff around , my sweet , they might be lurking in a corner . ”
50131	50138	50141	50141	him	275	“ They ’re in here somewhere , ”
50144	50148	50141	50141	him	275	“ probably hiding . ”
50149	50153	50154	50154	Harry	104	“ This way ! ”
50230	50233	50234	50234	Harry	104	“ RUN ! ”
50321	50329	50330	50330	Harry	104	“ I think we ’ve lost him , ”
50352	50359	50343	50343	Neville	199	“ I — told — you , ”
50371	50378	50343	50343	Neville	199	“ I — told — you . ”
50379	50390	50392	50392	Ron	198	“ We ’ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower , ”
50394	50399	50392	50392	Ron	198	“ quickly as possible . ”
50400	50405	50406	50406	Hermione	221	“ Malfoy tricked you , ”
50411	50447	50406	50406	Hermione	221	“ You realize that , do n’t you ? He was never going to meet you — Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room , Malfoy must have tipped him off . ”
50465	50470	50456	50456	he	104	“ Let ’s go . ”
50522	50536	50537	50537	Peeves	231	“ Shut up , Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown out . ”
50540	50564	50537	50537	Peeves	231	“ Wandering around at midnight , Ickle Firsties ? Tut , tut , tut . Naughty , naughty , you ’ll get caughty . ”
50565	50579	50510	50510	He	231	“ Not if you do n’t give us away , Peeves , please . ”
50580	50588	50590	50590	Peeves	231	“ Should tell Filch , I should , ”
50602	50613	50597	50597	his	231	“ It ’s for your own good , you know . ”
50614	50621	50623	50623	Ron	198	“ Get out of the way , ”
50636	50642	50643	50643	Peeves	231	“ STUDENTS OUT OF BED ! ”
50646	50656	50643	50643	Peeves	231	“ STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR — ”
50686	50691	50692	50692	Ron	198	“ This is it ! ”
50703	50714	50692	50692	Ron	198	“ We ’re done for ! This is the end ! ”
50732	50738	50725	50725	he	275	“ Oh , move over , ”
50753	50755	50742	50742	She	221	whispered,“Alohomora ! ”
50783	50792	50793	50793	Filch	275	“ Which way did they go , Peeves ? ”
50797	50803	50793	50793	Filch	275	“ Quick , tell me . ”
50804	50810	50842	50842	his	231	“ Say ‘ please . ’ ”
50811	50825	50842	50842	his	231	“ Do n’t mess with me , Peeves , nowwhere did they go ? ”
50826	50838	50840	50840	Peeves	231	“ Sha n’t say nothing if you do n’t say please , ”
50847	50853	50840	50840	Peeves	231	“ All right — please . ”
50854	50879	50842	50842	his	231	“ NOTHING ! Ha haaa ! Told you I would n’t say nothing if you did n’t say please ! Ha ha ! Haaaaaa ! ”
50895	50903	50904	50904	Harry	104	“ He thinks this door is locked , ”
50907	50919	50904	50904	Harry	104	“ I think we ’ll be okay — getoff , Neville ! ”
50937	50939	50921	50921	Neville	199	“What ? ”
51231	51240	51241	51241	she	1573	“ Where on earth have you all been ? ”
51259	51270	51272	51272	Harry	104	“ Never mind that — pig snout , pig snout , ”
51318	51338	51340	51340	Ron	198	“ What do they think they ’re doing , keeping a thing like that locked up in a school ? ”
51343	51354	51340	51340	Ron	198	“ If any dog needs exercise , that one does . ”
51368	51382	51383	51383	she	221	“You do n’t use your eyes , any of you , do you ? ”
51386	51397	51383	51383	she	221	“ Did n’t you see what it was standing on . ”
51398	51402	51403	51403	Harry	104	“ The floor ? ”
51406	51423	51403	51403	Harry	104	“ I was n’t looking at its feet , I was too busy with its heads . ”
51424	51444	51445	51445	She	221	“ No , not the floor . It was standing on a trapdoor . It ’s obviously guarding something . ”
51453	51488	51445	51445	She	221	“ I hope you ’re pleased with yourselves . We could all have been killed — or worse , expelled . Now , if you do n’t mind , I ’m going to bed . ”
51498	51506	51507	51507	he	198	“ No , we do n’t mind , ”
51510	51523	51507	51507	he	198	“ You ’d think we dragged her along , would n’t you . ”
51689	51699	51701	51701	Ron	198	“ It ’s either really valuable or really dangerous , ”
51703	51707	51709	51709	Harry	104	“ Or both , ”
51945	52003	52012	52012	he	104	“ DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE . It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand , but I do n’t want everybody knowing you ’ve got a broomstick or they ’ll all want one . Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session . Professor McGonagall ”
52021	52027	52028	52028	Ron	198	“ A Nimbus Two Thousand ! ”
52032	52039	52028	52028	Ron	198	“ I ’ve never eventouched one . ”
52085	52091	52092	52092	he	225	“ That ’s a broomstick , ”
52111	52130	52092	52092	he	225	“ You ’ll be in for it this time , Potter , first years are n’t allowed them . ”
52137	52145	52146	52146	he	198	“ It ’s not any old broomstick , ”
52149	52174	52175	52175	Ron	198	“ it ’s a Nimbus Two Thousand . What did you say you ’ve got at home , Malfoy , a Comet Two Sixty ? ”
52180	52197	52175	52175	Ron	198	“ Comets look flashy , but they ’re not in the same league as the Nimbus . ”
52198	52216	52217	52217	Malfoy	225	“ What would you know about it , Weasley , you could n’t afford half the handle , ”
52221	52236	52217	52217	Malfoy	225	“ I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig . ”
52250	52259	52260	52260	he	281	“ Not arguing , I hope , boys ? ”
52263	52273	52275	52275	Malfoy	225	“ Potter ’s been sent a broomstick , Professor , ”
52278	52287	52289	52290	Professor Flitwick	281	“ Yes , yes , that ’s right , ”
52296	52315	52289	52290	Professor Flitwick	281	“ Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances , Potter . And what model is it ? ”
52316	52324	52326	52326	Harry	104	“ A Nimbus Two Thousand , sir , ”
52342	52357	52358	52358	he	104	“ And it ’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I ’ve got it , ”
52378	52385	52386	52386	Harry	104	“ Well , it ’s true , ”
52398	52414	52386	52386	Harry	104	“ If he had n’t stolen Neville ’s Remembrall I wouln’t be on the team … ”
52415	52429	52439	52439	Hermione	221	“ So I suppose you think that ’s a reward for breaking rules ? ”
52456	52466	52468	52468	Harry	104	“ I thought you were n’t speaking to us ? ”
52470	52478	52480	52480	Ron	198	“ Yes , do n’t stop now , ”
52482	52491	52480	52480	Ron	198	“ it ’s doing us so much good . ”
52579	52582	52583	52583	Ron	198	“ Wow , ”
52789	52797	52798	52799	Oliver Wood	289	“ Hey , Potter , come down ! ”
52820	52824	52826	52826	Wood	289	“ Very nice , ”
52832	52869	52870	52870	He	289	“ I see what McGonagall meant … you really are a natural . I ’m just going to teach you the rules this evening , then you ’ll be joining team practice three times a week . ”
52882	52885	52887	52887	Wood	289	“ Right , ”
52889	52924	52887	52887	Wood	289	“ Now , Quidditch is easy enough to understand , even if it ’s not too easy to play . There are seven players on each side . Three of them are called Chasers . ”
52925	52929	52930	52930	Harry	104	“ Three Chasers , ”
52949	52957	52959	52959	Wood	289	“ This ball ’s called the Quaffle , ”
52961	53001	52959	52959	Wood	289	“ The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal . Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops . Follow me ? ”
53002	53017	53018	53018	Harry	104	“ The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score , ”
53021	53040	53018	53018	Harry	104	“ So — that ’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops , is n’t it ? ”
53041	53046	53048	53048	Wood	289	“ What ’s basketball ? ”
53051	53055	53057	53057	Harry	104	“ Never mind , ”
53060	53097	53057	53057	Harry	104	“ Now , there ’s another player on each side who ’s called the Keeper . I ’m Keeper for Gryffindor . I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring . ”
53098	53105	53107	53107	Harry	104	“ Three Chasers , one Keeper , ”
53117	53136	53137	53137	He	289	“ And they play with the Quaffle . Okay , got that . So what are they for ? ”
53148	53155	53157	53157	Wood	289	“ I ’ll show you now , ”
53159	53163	53164	53164	He	289	“ Take this . ”
53179	53191	53192	53192	Wood	289	“ I ’m going to show you what the Bludgers do , ”
53195	53202	53203	53203	He	289	“ These two are the Bludgers . ”
53238	53242	53243	53243	Wood	289	“ Stand back , ”
53327	53330	53331	53331	Wood	289	“ See ? ”
53348	53408	53331	53331	Wood	289	“ The Bludgers rocket around , trying to knock players off their brooms . That ’s why you have two Beaters on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it ’s their job to protect their side fromthe Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team . So — think you ’ve got all that ? ”
53409	53436	53437	53437	Harry	104	“ Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle ; the Keeper guards the goal posts ; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team , ”
53441	53445	53447	53447	Wood	289	“ Very good , ”
53449	53459	53464	53464	he	104	“ Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone ? ”
53468	53517	53464	53464	he	104	“ Never at Hogwarts . We ’ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that . Now , the last member of the team is the Seeker . That ’s you . And you do n’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers — ”
53518	53527	53464	53464	he	104	“ — unless they crack my head open . ”
53528	53557	53558	53558	Wood	289	“ Do n’t worry , the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean , they ’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves . ”
53603	53606	53464	53464	he	104	“ This , ”
53608	53761	53762	53762	Harry	104	Wood,“is the Golden Snitch , and it ’s the most important ball of the lot . It ’s very hard to catch because it ’s so fast and difficult to see . It ’s the Seeker ’s job to catch it . You ’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers , Beaters , Bludgers , and Quaffle to get it before the other team ’s Seeker , because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points , so they nearly always win . That ’s why Seekers get fouled so much . A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught , so it can go on for ages — I think the record is three months , they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep . Well , that ’s it — any questions ? ”
53789	53799	53801	53801	Wood	289	“ We wo n’t practice with the Snitch yet , ”
53811	53833	53834	53834	He	289	“ it ’s too dark , we might lose it . Let ’s try you out with a few of these . ”
53908	53920	53922	53922	Wood	289	“ That Quidditch cup’ll have our name on it this year , ”
53933	53964	53922	53922	Wood	289	“ I would n’t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley , and he could have played for England if he had n’t gone off chasing dragons . ”
54174	54189	54157	54157	She	221	“ Now , do n’t forget that nice wrist movement we ’ve been practicing ! ”
54205	54255	54191	54192	Professor Flitwick	281	“ Swish and flick , remember , swish and flick . And saying the magic words properly is very important , too — never forget Wizard Baruffio , who said ‘s ’ instead of ‘ f ’ and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest . ”
54325	54329	54330	54330	he	198	“ Wingardium Leviosa ! ”
54341	54348	54330	54330	he	198	“ You ’re saying it wrong , ”
54354	54375	54330	54330	he	198	“ It ’s Wing - gar - dium Levi - o - sa , make the‘gar ’ nice and long . ”
54376	54389	54390	54390	Ron	198	“ You do it , then , if you ’re so clever , ”
54407	54410	54403	54403	her	221	said,“Wingardium Leviosa ! ”
54426	54432	54434	54435	Professor Flitwick	281	“ Oh , well done ! ”
54439	54450	54434	54435	Professor Flitwick	281	“ Everyone see here , Miss Granger ’s done it ! ”
54465	54476	54477	54477	he	198	“ It ’s no wonder no one can stand her , ”

54555	54566	54549	54549	he	198	“ She must ’ve noticed she ’s got no friends . ”
54747	54760	54761	54761	He	175	“ Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know . ”
54795	54798	54799	54799	he	175	“ Prefects , ”
54802	54812	54799	54799	he	175	“ lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately ! ”
54819	54864	54799	54799	he	175	“ Follow me ! Stick together , first years ! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders ! Stay close behind me , now . Make way , first years coming through ! Excuse me , I ’m a prefect ! ”
54865	54873	54874	54874	Harry	104	“ How could a troll get in ? ”
54882	54896	54898	54898	Ron	198	“ Do n’t ask me , they ’re supposed to be really stupid , ”
54900	54911	54898	54898	Ron	198	“ Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke . ”
54942	54950	54935	54935	Harry	104	“ I ’ve just thought — Hermione . ”
54951	54956	54935	54935	Harry	104	“ What about her ? ”
54957	54966	54967	54967	Ron	198	“ She does n’t know about the troll . ”
54972	54978	54979	54979	he	198	“ Oh , all right , ”
54982	54990	54979	54979	he	198	“ But Percy’d better not see us . ”

55070	55076	55077	55077	Harry	104	“ What ’s he doing ? ”
55080	55096	55077	55077	Harry	104	“ Why is n’t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers ? ”
55097	55101	55113	55113	Snape	293	“ Search me . ”
55118	55127	55128	55128	Harry	104	“ He ’s heading for the third floor , ”
55138	55144	55132	55132	Ron	198	“ Can you smell something ? ”
55336	55343	55344	55344	Harry	104	“ The keys in the lock , ”
55347	55354	55344	55344	Harry	104	“ We could lock it in . ”
55355	55359	55361	55361	Ron	198	“ Good idea , ”
55406	55409	55391	55391	Harry	104	“ Yes ! ”

55574	55578	55579	55579	Harry	104	“ Confuse it ! ”
55650	55656	55658	55658	Ron	198	“ Oy , pea brain ! ”

56073	56083	56071	56071	Harry	104	“ I think it ’s just been knocked out . ”
56109	56115	56116	56116	He	104	“ Urgh — troll boogers . ”
56262	56271	56280	56280	her	113	“ What on earth were you thinking of ? ”
56299	56316	56286	56286	Ron	198	“ You ’re lucky you were n’t killed . Why are n’t you in your dormitory ? ”
56351	56363	56317	56317	Snape	293	“ Please , Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me . ”
56364	56368	56369	56369	Hermione	221	“ Miss Granger ! ”
56380	56412	56413	56413	Ron	198	“ I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I could deal with it on my own — you know , because I ’ve read all about them . ”
56429	56482	56483	56483	Harry	104	“ If they had n’t found me , I ’d be dead now . Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club . They did n’t have time to come and fetch anyone . It was about to finish me off when they arrived . ”
56499	56506	56508	56509	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Well — in that case … ”
56518	56539	56508	56509	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Miss Granger , you foolish girl , how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own ? ”
56588	56602	56604	56605	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Miss Granger , five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this , ”
56607	56641	56642	56642	Hermione	221	“ I ’m very disappointed in you . If you ’re not hurt at all , you ’d better get off to Gryffindor tower . Students are finishing the feast in their houses . ”
56653	56697	56645	56646	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Well , I still say you were lucky , but not many first years could have taken on a full grown mountain troll . You each win Gryffindor five points . Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this . You may go . ”
56738	56748	56749	56749	Ron	198	“ We should have gotten more than ten points , ”
56752	56766	56749	56749	Ron	198	“ Five , you mean , once she ’s taken off Hermione ’s . ”
56767	56780	56781	56781	Ron	198	“ Good of her to get us out of trouble like that , ”
56784	56792	56781	56781	Ron	198	“ Mind you , wedid save her . ”
56793	56811	56812	56812	Harry	104	“ She might not have needed saving if we had n’t locked the thing in with her , ”
56826	56830	56831	56831	they	1670	“ Pig snout , ”
56888	56890	56886	56886	they	1670	said“Thanks , ”
57415	57426	57401	57401	he	293	“ What ’s that you ’ve got there , Potter ? ”
57437	57449	57451	57451	Snape	293	“ Library books are not to be taken outside the school , ”
57453	57464	57451	57451	Snape	293	“ Give it to me . Five points from Gryffindor . ”
57465	57474	57475	57475	Harry	104	“ He ’s just made that rule up , ”
57483	57492	57475	57475	Harry	104	“ Wonder what ’s wrong with his leg ? ”
57493	57505	57507	57507	Ron	198	“ Dunno , but I hope it ’s really hurting him , ”
57552	57558	57545	57545	She	221	“ How will you learn ? ”
57626	57632	57633	57633	they	1695	“ Better you than me , ”
57740	57744	57745	57745	Snape	293	“ Blasted thing , ”
57749	57765	57745	57745	Snape	293	“ How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once ? ”
57776	57779	57766	57766	Harry	104	“ POTTER ! ”
57801	57813	57798	57798	Harry	104	“ I just wondered if I could have my book back . ”
57814	57818	57819	57819	Harry	104	“ GET OUT!OUT ! ”
57837	57843	57844	57844	Ron	198	“ Did you get it ? ”
57851	57857	57847	57847	Harry	104	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
57871	57878	57879	57879	he	104	“ You know what this means ? ”
57883	57931	57879	57879	he	104	“ He tried to get past that three headed dog at Halloween ! That ’s where he was going when we saw him — he ’s after whatever it ’s guarding ! And I ’d bet my broomstickhe let that troll in , to make a diversion ! ”
57938	57945	57946	57946	she	221	“ No — he would n’t , ”
57949	57971	57946	57946	she	221	“ I know he ’s not very nice , but he would n’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe . ”
57972	57986	57988	57988	Ron	198	“ Honestly , Hermione , you think all teachers are saints or something , ”
57990	58016	57988	57988	Ron	198	“ I ’m with Harry . I would n’t put anything past Snape . But what ’s he after ? What ’s that dog guarding ? ”
58122	58131	58113	58113	everyone	2285	“ You ’ve got to eat some breakfast . ”
58132	58139	58072	58072	Snape	293	“ I do n’t want anything . ”
58140	58147	58149	58149	Hermione	221	“ Just a bit of toast , ”
58151	58157	58149	58149	Hermione	221	“ I ’m not hungry . ”
58175	58183	58185	58186	Seamus Finnigan	245	“ Harry , you need your strength , ”
58188	58202	58185	58186	Seamus Finnigan	245	“ Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team . ”
58203	58208	58210	58210	Harry	104	“ Thanks , Seamus , ”
58382	58387	58388	58388	he	289	“ Okay , men , ”
58391	58395	58397	58399	Chaser Angelina Johnson	314	“ And women , ”
58401	58405	58406	58406	Wood	289	“ And women , ”
58409	58414	58406	58406	Wood	289	“ This is it . ”
58415	58420	58422	58423	Fred Weasley	196	“ The big one , ”
58425	58435	58437	58437	George	197	“ The one we ’ve all been waiting for , ”
58439	58448	58449	58449	Fred	196	“ We know Oliver ’s speech by heart , ”
58453	58462	58449	58449	Fred	196	“ we were on the team last year . ”
58463	58470	58472	58472	Wood	289	“ Shut up , you two , ”
58474	58496	58497	58497	He	289	“ This is the best team Gryffindor ’s had in years . We ’re going to win . I know it . ”

58509	58523	58524	58524	Harry	104	“ Right . It ’s time . Good luck , all of you . ”
58579	58593	58594	58594	she	268	“ Now , I want a nice fair game , all of you , ”
58670	58677	58678	58678	Harry	104	“ Mount your brooms , please . ”
58713	58740	58693	58693	her	268	“ And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is , and rather attractive , too — ”
58741	58744	58693	58693	her	268	“ JORDAN ! ”
58745	58750	58751	58753	The Weasley twins	1308	“ Sorry , Professor . ”
58774	58999	58771	58772	Professor McGonagall	113	“ And she ’s really belting along up there , a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet , a good find of Oliver Wood ’s , last year only a reserve — back to Johnson and — no , the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle , Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — he ’s going to sc — no , stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that ’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there , nice dive around Flint , off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt , hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that ’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts , but he ’s blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley , ca n’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater , anyway , and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle , a clear field ahead andoff she goes — she ’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on , now , Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE ! ”
59015	59023	59012	59013	the Slytherins	262	“ Budge up there , move along . ”
59024	59027	59028	59028	Ron	198	“ Hagrid ! ”
59042	59050	59052	59052	Hagrid	121	“ Bin watchin ’ from me hut , ”
59064	59087	59052	59052	Hagrid	121	“ But it is n’t the same as bein ’ in the crowd . No sign of the Snitch yet , eh ? ”
59088	59091	59093	59093	Ron	198	“ Nope , ”
59095	59105	59093	59093	Ron	198	“ Harry has n’t had much to do yet . ”
59106	59117	59119	59119	Hagrid	121	“ Kept outta trouble , though , that ’s somethin’ , ”
59166	59180	59181	59181	Wood	317	“ Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch , ”
59185	59198	59181	59181	Wood	317	“ We do n’t want you attacked before you have to be . ”
59284	59291	59292	59292	he	104	“ All right there , Harry ? ”
59308	59313	59299	59299	he	104	“ Slytherin in possession , ”
59319	59347	59314	59315	Lee Jordan	200	“ Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers , two Weasleys , and Chaser Bell , and speeds toward the — wait a moment — was that the Snitch ? ”
59503	59506	59508	59509	the Gryffindors	261	“ Foul ! ”
59556	59565	59553	59554	Dean Thomas	173	yelling,“Send him off , ref ! Red card ! ”
59566	59575	59577	59577	Ron	198	“ What are you talking about , Dean ? ”
59579	59583	59585	59585	Dean	173	“ Red card ! ”
59588	59605	59585	59585	Dean	173	“ In soccer you get shown the red card and you ’re out of the game ! ”
59606	59615	59616	59616	Ron	198	“ But this is n’t soccer , Dean , ”
59630	59645	59620	59620	Hagrid	121	“ They oughta change the rules . Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air . ”
59657	59669	59646	59647	Lee Jordan	200	“ So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating — ”
59670	59673	59675	59676	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Jordan ! ”
59678	59689	59675	59676	Professor McGonagall	113	“ I mean , after that open and revolting foul — ”
59690	59698	59646	59647	Lee Jordan	200	“ Jordan , I ’m warning you — ”
59699	59751	59646	59647	Lee Jordan	200	“ All right , all right . Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker , which could happen to anyone , I ’m sure , so a penalty to Gryffindor , taken by Spinnet , who puts it away , no trouble , and we continue play , Gryffindor still in possession . ”
59924	59966	59919	59919	Lee	200	“ Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face by a Bludger , hope it broke his nose — only joking , Professor — Slytherins score — A no … ”
60005	60014	59986	59986	It	1729	“ Dunno what Harry thinks he ’s doing , ”
60024	60049	60018	60018	He	121	“ If I didn ’ know better , I ’d say he ’d lost control of his broom … but he ca n’t have … ”
60116	60127	60128	60128	Seamus	245	“ Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him ? ”
60131	60136	60128	60128	Seamus	245	“ Ca n’t have , ”
60144	60168	60140	60140	his	121	“ Ca n’t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand . ”
60195	60201	60203	60203	Ron	198	“ What are you doing ? ”
60208	60213	60203	60203	Ron	198	“ I knew it , ”
60217	60222	60223	60223	Ron	198	“ Snape — look . ”
60254	60264	60266	60266	Hermione	221	“ He ’s doing something — jinxing the broom , ”
60268	60274	60266	60266	Hermione	221	“ What should we do ? ”
60275	60281	60251	60251	his	293	“ Leave it to me . ”
60399	60405	60406	60406	Ron	198	“ Come on , Hermione , ”
60565	60572	60573	60573	Ron	198	“ Neville , you can look ! ”
60634	60641	60642	60642	he	104	“ I ’ve got the Snitch ! ”
60659	60668	60669	60669	Flint	184	“ He didn’tcatch it , he nearlyswallowed it , ”
60739	60744	60745	60745	Ron	198	“ It was Snape , ”
60749	60773	60745	60745	Ron	198	“ Hermione and I saw him . He was cursing your broomstick , muttering , he would n’t take his eyes off you . ”
60774	60777	60779	60779	Hagrid	121	“ Rubbish , ”
60799	60808	60809	60809	Harry	104	“ Why would Snape do somethin’ like that ? ”
60832	60840	60841	60841	he	104	“ I found out something about him , ”
60845	60874	60841	60841	he	104	“ He tried to get past that three headed dog on Halloween . It bit him . We think he was trying to steal whatever it ’s guarding . ”
60880	60888	60889	60889	he	121	“ How do you know about Fluffy ? ”
60892	60895	60889	60889	he	121	“ Fluffy ? ”
60896	60927	60841	60841	he	104	“ Yeah — he ’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las ’ year — I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the — ”
60928	60931	60933	60933	Harry	104	“ Yes ? ”
60936	60945	60947	60947	Hagrid	121	“ Now , do n’t ask me anymore , ”
60950	60959	60947	60947	Hagrid	121	“ That ’s top secret , that is . ”
60960	60968	60841	60841	he	104	“ But Snape ’s trying tosteal it . ”
60969	60972	60974	60974	Hagrid	121	“ Rubbish , ”
60977	60992	60974	60974	Hagrid	121	“ Snape ’s a Hogwarts teacher , he ’d do nothin’ of the sort . ”
60993	61004	61006	61006	Hermione	221	“ So why did he just try to kill Harry ? ”
61022	61061	61020	61020	Snape	293	“ I know a jinx when I see one , Hagrid , I ’ve read all about them ! You ’ve got to keep eye contact , and Snape was n’t blinking at all , I saw him ! ”
61062	61072	61074	61074	Hagrid	121	“ I ’m tellin ’ yeh , yer wrong ! ”
61077	61152	61074	61074	Hagrid	121	“ I don ’ know why Harry ’s broom acted like that , but Snape wouldn ’ try an ’ kill a student ! Now , listen to me , all three of yeh — yer meddlin ’ in things that don ’ concern yeh . It ’s dangerous . You forget that dog , an ’ you forget what it ’s guardin ’ , that ’s between Professor Dumbledore an ’ Nicolas Flamel — ”
61153	61156	61158	61158	Harry	104	“ Aha ! ”
61160	61173	61158	61158	Harry	104	“ so there ’s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved , is there ? ”
61337	61344	61346	61347	Draco Malfoy	225	“ I do feel so sorry , ”
61353	61374	61375	61375	He	225	“ for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they ’re not wanted at home . ”
61626	61635	61636	61636	Ron	198	“ Hi , Hagrid , want any help ? ”
61646	61658	61640	61640	his	198	“ Nah , I ’m all right , thanks , Ron . ”
61659	61669	61671	61671	Malfoy	225	“ Would you mind moving out of the way ? ”
61679	61723	61724	61724	Ron	198	“ Are you trying to earn some extra money , Weasley ? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose — that hut of Hagrid ’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family ’s used to . ”
61736	61739	61740	61740	Ron	198	“ WEASLEY ! ”
61751	61759	61761	61761	Hagrid	121	“ He was provoked , Professor Snape , ”
61774	61782	61764	61764	his	121	“ Malfoy was insultin ’ his family . ”
61783	61798	61800	61800	Snape	266	“ Be that as it may , fighting is against Hogwarts rules , Hagrid , ”
61803	61826	61800	61800	Snape	266	“ Five points from Gryffindor , Weasley , and be grateful it is n’t more . Move along , all of you . ”
61845	61851	61853	61853	Ron	198	“ I ’ll get him , ”
61863	61874	61856	61856	his	198	“ one of these days , I ’ll get him — ”
61875	61881	61883	61883	Harry	104	“ I hate them both , ”
61885	61890	61883	61883	Harry	104	“ Malfoy and Snape . ”
61891	61903	61905	61905	Hagrid	121	“ Come on , cheer up , it ’s nearly Christmas , ”
61907	61926	61905	61905	Hagrid	121	“ Tell yeh what , come with me an ’ see the Great Hall , looks a treat . ”
61956	61975	62030	62030	Hagrid	121	“ Ah , Hagrid , the last tree — put it in the far corner , would you ? ”
62018	62029	62030	62030	Hagrid	121	“ How many days you got left until yer holidays ? ”
62033	62037	62039	62039	Hermione	221	“ Just one , ”
62041	62067	62039	62039	Hermione	221	“ And that reminds me — Harry , Ron , we ’ve got half an hour before lunch , we should be in the library . ”
62068	62076	62078	62078	Ron	198	“ Oh yeah , you ’re right , ”
62109	62113	62115	62115	Hagrid	121	“ The library ? ”
62124	62137	62115	62115	Hagrid	121	“ Just before the holidays ? Bit keen , are n’t yeh ? ”
62138	62146	62147	62147	Harry	104	“ Oh , we ’re not working , ”
62152	62170	62147	62147	Harry	104	“ Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we ’ve been trying to find out who he is . ”
62171	62174	62175	62175	Hagrid	121	“ Youwhat ? ”
62179	62201	62175	62175	Hagrid	121	“Listen here — I’ve told yeh — drop it . It ’s nothin’ to you what that dog ’s guardin ’ . ”
62202	62217	62219	62219	Hermione	221	“ We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is , that ’s all , ”
62221	62235	62236	62236	Harry	104	“ Unless you ’d like to tell us and save us the trouble ? ”
62239	62272	62236	62236	Harry	104	“ We must ’ve been through hundreds of books already and we ca n’t find him anywhere — just give us a hint — I know I ’ve read his name somewhere . ”
62273	62280	62282	62282	Hagrid	121	“ I ’m sayin ’ nothin’ , ”
62285	62296	62298	62298	Ron	198	“ Just have to find out for ourselves , then , ”
62555	62564	62572	62573	Madam Pince	328	“ What are you looking for , boy ? ”
62565	62568	62570	62570	Harry	104	“ Nothing , ”
62583	62597	62574	62575	the librarian	1783	“ You ’d better get out , then . Go on — out ! ”
62751	62765	62767	62767	Hermione	221	“ You will keep looking while I ’m away , wo n’t you ? ”
62769	62780	62767	62767	Hermione	221	“ And send me an owl if you find anything . ”
62781	62795	62797	62797	Ron	198	“ And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is , ”
62799	62808	62797	62797	Ron	198	“ It ’d be safe to ask them . ”
62809	62819	62821	62821	Hermione	221	“ Very safe , as they ’re both dentists , ”
63051	63073	63037	63037	they	1795	“ Do n’t send me there , ca n’t you see his knight ? Sendhim , we can afford to losehim . ”
63131	63135	63137	63137	Ron	198	“ Merry Christmas , ”
63151	63156	63158	63158	Harry	104	“ You , too , ”
63160	63173	63158	63158	Harry	104	“ Will you look at this ? I ’ve got some presents ! ”
63174	63182	63184	63184	Ron	198	“ What did you expect , turnips ? ”
63289	63294	63296	63296	Harry	104	“ That ’s friendly , ”
63306	63309	63310	63310	he	198	“ Weird ! ”
63311	63318	63296	63296	Harry	104	said,“What a shape ! This ismoney ? ”
63319	63325	63327	63327	Harry	104	“ You can keep it , ”
63336	63349	63327	63327	Harry	104	“ Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these ? ”
63350	63361	63363	63363	Ron	198	“ I think I know who that one ’s from , ”
63377	63396	63397	63397	he	198	“ My mom . I told her you did n’t expect any presents and — oh , no , ”
63400	63409	63397	63397	he	198	“ she ’s made you a Weasley sweater . ”
63435	63444	63446	63446	Ron	198	“ Every year she makes us a sweater , ”
63452	63457	63446	63446	Ron	198	“ and mine’salways maroon . ”
63458	63466	63468	63468	Harry	104	“ That ’s really nice of her , ”
63538	63545	63546	63546	he	198	“ I ’ve heard of those , ”
63566	63583	63546	63546	he	198	“ If that ’s what I think it is — they’re really rare , andreally valuable . ”
63584	63589	63590	63590	Harry	104	“ What is it ? ”
63614	63621	63623	63623	Ron	198	“ It ’s an Invisibility Cloak , ”
63633	63644	63623	63623	Ron	198	“ I ’m sure it is — try it on . ”
63658	63664	63653	63653	Ron	198	“ Itis ! Look down ! ”
63718	63724	63726	63726	Ron	198	“ There ’s a note ! ”
63729	63737	63726	63726	Ron	198	“ A note fell out of it ! ”
63812	63821	63822	63822	he	198	“ I ’d giveanything for one of these , ”
63825	63832	63822	63822	he	198	“Anything . What ’s the matter ? ”
63833	63836	63838	63838	Harry	104	“ Nothing , ”
63904	63908	63892	63892	He	104	“ Merry Christmas ! ”
63909	63923	63924	63924	Fred	196	“ Hey , look — Harry ’s got a Weasley sweater , too ! ”
63943	63953	63955	63955	Fred	196	“ Harry ’s is better than ours , though , ”
63963	63977	63955	63955	Fred	196	“ She obviously makes more of an effort if you ’re not family . ”
63978	63988	63989	63989	George	197	“ Why are n’t you wearing yours , Ron ? ”
63992	64006	63989	63989	George	197	“ Come on , get it on , they ’re lovely and warm . ”
64007	64012	64013	64013	Ron	198	“ I hate maroon , ”
64024	64034	64035	64035	George	197	“ You have n’t got a letter on yours , ”
64038	64065	64035	64035	George	197	“ I suppose she thinks you do n’t forget your name . But we ’re not stupid — we know we ’re called Gred and Forge . ”
64066	64073	64077	64077	his	195	“ What ’s all this noise . ”
64112	64137	64109	64109	Fred	196	“ P for prefect ! Get it on , Percy , come on , we ’re all wearing ours , even Harry got one . ”
64138	64145	64147	64147	Percy	195	“ I — don’t — want , ”
64165	64178	64180	64180	George	197	“ And you ’re not sitting with the prefects today , either , ”
64182	64190	64180	64180	George	197	“ Christmas is a time for family . ”
64921	64926	64928	64930	the Fat Lady	1538	“ Who ’s there ? ”
65444	65474	65436	65436	he	104	“ You asked me to come directly to you , Professor , if anyone was wandering around at night , and somebody ’s been in the library Restricted Section . ”
65514	65531	65496	65496	his	275	replied,“The Restricted Section ? Well , they ca n’t be far , we ’ll catch them . ”
66170	66173	66174	66174	he	104	“ Mom ? ”
66177	66180	66174	66174	he	104	“ Dad ? ”
66365	66371	66352	66352	He	104	“ I ’ll come back , ”
66378	66386	66388	66388	Ron	198	“ You could have woken me up , ”
66392	66411	66388	66388	Ron	198	“ You can come tonight , I ’m going back , I want to show you the mirror . ”
66412	66423	66424	66424	Ron	198	“ I ’d like to see your mom and dad , ”
66428	66455	66424	66424	Ron	198	“ And I want to see all your family , all the Weasleys , you ’ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone . ”
66456	66465	66467	66467	Ron	198	“ You can see them any old time , ”
66469	66508	66467	66467	Ron	198	“ Just come round my house this summer . Anyway , maybe it only shows dead people . Shame about not finding Flamel , though . Have some bacon or something , why are n’t you eating anything ? ”
66563	66569	66571	66571	Ron	198	“ Are you all right ? ”
66573	66578	66571	66571	Ron	198	“ You look odd . ”
66637	66642	66644	66644	Ron	198	“ I ’m freezing , ”
66646	66655	66644	66644	Ron	198	“ Let ’s forget it and go back . ”
66656	66659	66660	66660	Harry	104	“ No ! ”
66663	66671	66660	66660	Harry	104	“ I know it ’s here somewhere . ”
66712	66722	66723	66723	They	543	“ It ’s here — just here — yes ! ”
66758	66761	66762	66762	Harry	104	“ See ? ”
66765	66772	66762	66762	Harry	104	“ I ca n’t see anything . ”
66773	66787	66750	66750	father	540	“ Look ! Look at them all … there are loads of them … ”
66788	66795	66762	66762	Harry	104	“ I can only see you . ”
66796	66810	66750	66750	father	540	“ Look in it properly , go on , stand where I am . ”
66850	66855	66856	66856	he	198	“ Look at me ! ”
66859	66870	66856	66856	he	198	“ Can you see all your family standing around you ? ”
66871	66892	66929	66929	Ron	198	“ No — I’m alone — but I ’m different — I look older — and I ’m head boy ! ”
66893	66896	66856	66856	he	198	“ What ? ”
66897	66928	66929	66929	Ron	198	“ I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I ’m holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup — I’m Quidditch captain , too . ”
66944	66954	66942	66942	Harry	104	“ Do you think this mirror shows the future ? ”
66955	66972	66856	66856	he	198	“ How can it ? All my family are dead — let me have another look — ”
66973	66990	66929	66929	Ron	198	“ You had it to yourself all last night , give me a bit more time . ”
66991	67013	66856	66856	he	198	“ You ’re only holding the Quidditch cup , what ’s interesting about that ? I want to see my parents . ”
67014	67020	66929	66929	Ron	198	“ Do n’t push me — ”
67046	67049	67050	67050	Ron	198	“ Quick ! ”
67100	67122	67124	67124	Ron	198	“ This is n’t safe — she might have gone for Filch , I bet she heard us . Come on . ”
67142	67150	67152	67152	Ron	198	“ Want to play chess , Harry ? ”
67154	67157	67152	67152	Ron	198	“ No . ”
67158	67169	67124	67124	Ron	198	“ Why do n’t we go down and visit Hagrid ? ”
67170	67176	67124	67124	Ron	198	“ No … you go … ”
67177	67197	67152	67152	Ron	198	“ I know what you ’re thinking about , Harry , that mirror . Do n’t go back tonight . ”
67198	67202	67124	67124	Ron	198	“ Why not ? ”
67203	67263	67124	67124	Ron	198	“ I dunno , I ’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway , you ’ve had too many close shaves already . Filch , Snape , and Mrs. Norris are wandering around . So what if they ca n’t see you ? What if they walk into you ? What if you knock something over ? ”
67264	67270	67124	67124	Ron	198	“ You sound like Hermione . ”
67271	67282	67124	67124	Ron	198	“ I ’m serious , Harry , do n’t go . ”
67403	67411	67412	67412	Harry	104	“ So — back again , Harry ? ”
67465	67475	67497	67497	he	112	“ — I did n’t see you , sir . ”
67476	67486	67488	67488	Dumbledore	112	“ Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you , ”
67501	67504	67506	67506	Dumbledore	112	“ So , ”
67520	67538	67506	67506	Dumbledore	112	“ you , like hundreds before you , have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised . ”
67539	67551	67497	67497	he	112	“ I did n’t know it was called that , sir . ”
67552	67565	67506	67506	Dumbledore	112	“ But I expect you ’ve realized by now what it does ? ”
67566	67577	67506	67506	Dumbledore	112	“ It — well — it shows me my family — ”
67578	67590	67497	67497	he	112	“ And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy . ”
67591	67598	67506	67506	Dumbledore	112	“ How did you know — ? ”
67599	67610	67612	67612	Dumbledore	112	“ I do n’t need a cloak to become invisible , ”
67615	67630	67612	67612	Dumbledore	112	“ Now , can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all ? ”
67636	67680	67633	67633	his	104	“ Let me explain . The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror , that is , he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is . Does that help ? ”
67687	67698	67685	67685	he	104	slowly,“It shows us what we want … whatever we want … ”
67699	67704	67706	67706	Dumbledore	112	“ Yes and no , ”
67709	67883	67706	67706	Dumbledore	112	“ It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest , most desperate desire of our hearts . You , who have never known your family , see them standing around you . Ronald Weasley , who has always been overshadowed by his brothers , sees himself standing alone , the best of all of them . However , this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth . Men have wasted away before it , entranced by what they have seen , or been driven mad , not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible . The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow , Harry , and I ask you not to go looking for it again . If you ever do run across it , you will now be prepared . It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live , remember that . Now , why do n’t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed ? ”
67888	67900	67884	67884	Harry	104	“ Sir — Professor Dumbledore ? Can I ask you something ? ”
67901	67910	67911	67911	Dumbledore	122	“ Obviously , you ’ve just done so , ”
67914	67925	67911	67911	Dumbledore	122	“ You may ask me one more thing , however . ”
67926	67938	67884	67884	Harry	104	“ What do you see when you look in the mirror ? ”
67939	67954	67955	67955	Harry	104	“ I ? I see myself holding a pair of thick , woolen socks . ”
67958	67966	67968	67968	Dumbledore	122	“ One can never have enough socks , ”
67970	67994	67968	67968	Dumbledore	122	“ Another Christmas has come and gone and I did n’t get a single pair . People will insist on giving me books . ”
68124	68139	68141	68141	Ron	198	“ You see , Dumbledore was right , that mirror could drive you mad , ”
68193	68200	68169	68169	She	221	“ If Filch had caught you ! ”
68417	68424	68425	68425	he	317	“ Will you stop messing around ! ”
68428	68463	68425	68425	he	317	“ That ’s exactly the sort of thing that ’ll lose us the match ! Snape ’s refereeing this time , and he ’ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor ! ”
68476	68481	68482	68482	he	317	“ Snape ’s refereeing ? ”
68490	68513	68482	68482	he	317	“ When ’s he ever refereed a Quidditch match ? He ’s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin . ”
68528	68534	68536	68536	Wood	317	“ It ’s notmy fault , ”
68538	68564	68536	68536	Wood	317	“ We ’ve just got to make sure we play a clean game , so Snape has n’t got an excuse to pick on us . ”
68652	68662	68664	68664	Ron	198	“ Do n’t talk to me for a moment , ”
68673	68679	68680	68680	He	198	“ I need to concen — ”
68688	68700	68684	68684	Harry	104	“ What ’s the matter with you ? You look terrible . ”
68729	68734	68736	68736	Hermione	221	“ Do n’t play , ”
68740	68746	68748	68748	Ron	198	“ Say you ’re ill , ”
68750	68757	68758	68758	Hermione	221	“ Pretend to break your leg , ”
68761	68767	68769	68769	Ron	198	“ Really break your leg , ”
68771	68776	68778	68778	Harry	104	“ I ca n’t , ”
68780	68800	68778	68778	Harry	104	“ There is n’t a reserve Seeker . If I back out , Gryffindor ca n’t play at all . ”
68889	68893	68896	68896	him	199	“ What happened ? ”
68908	68911	68913	68913	Neville	199	“ Malfoy , ”
68916	68937	68913	68913	Neville	199	“ I met him outside the library . He said he ’d been looking for someone to practice that on . ”
68938	68944	68945	68945	Hermione	221	“ Go to Professor McGonagall ! ”
68949	68953	68945	68945	Hermione	221	“ Report him ! ”
68959	68967	68968	68968	he	199	“ I do n’t want more trouble , ”
68971	68983	68985	68985	Ron	198	“ You ’ve got to stand up to him , Neville ! ”
68987	69014	68985	68985	Ron	198	“ He ’s used to walking all over people , but that ’s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier . ”
69015	69039	69040	69040	Neville	199	“ There ’s no need to tell me I ’m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor , Malfoy ’s already done that , ”
69087	69095	69096	69096	Harry	104	“ You ’re worth twelve of Malfoy , ”
69099	69121	69096	69096	Harry	104	“ The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor , did n’t it ? And where ’s Malfoy ? In stinking Slytherin . ”
69136	69162	69131	69131	he	199	“ Thanks , Harry … I think I ’ll go to bed … D’you want the card , you collect them , do n’t you ? ”
69176	69180	69181	69181	he	104	“ Dumbledore again , ”
69184	69193	69194	69194	He	104	“ He was the first one I ever — ”
69215	69221	69222	69222	he	104	“ I ’ve found him ! ”
69225	69293	69222	69222	he	104	“I’ve found Flamel ! Itold you I ’d read the name somewhere before , I read it on the train coming here — listen to this : ‘ Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945 , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon ’s blood , and his work on alchemy with his partner , Nicolas Flamel ’ ! ”
69321	69325	69326	69326	she	221	“ Stay there ! ”
69365	69374	69375	69375	she	221	“ I never thought to look in here ! ”
69379	69396	69375	69375	she	221	“ I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading . ”
69397	69400	69402	69402	Ron	198	“ Light ? ”
69440	69448	69432	69432	she	221	“ I knew it ! Iknew it ! ”
69449	69457	69459	69459	Ron	198	“ Are we allowed to speak yet ? ”
69466	69470	69471	69471	she	221	“ Nicolas Flamel , ”
69473	69484	69471	69471	she	221	dramatically,“is the only known maker of the Sorcerer ’s Stone ! ”
69496	69500	69502	69502	Harry	104	“ The what ? ”
69506	69524	69504	69504	Ron	198	“ Oh , honestly , do n’t you two read ? Look — read that , there . ”
69652	69655	69657	69657	Hermione	221	“ See ? ”
69666	69714	69662	69662	Ron	198	“ The dog must be guarding Flamel ’s Sorcerer ’s Stone ! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him , because they ’re friends and he knew someone was after it , that ’s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts ! ”
69715	69728	69730	69730	Harry	104	“ A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying ! ”
69732	69743	69730	69730	Harry	104	“ No wonder Snape ’s after it!Anyone would want it . ”
69744	69761	69763	69763	Ron	198	“ And no wonder we could n’t find Flamel in thatStudy of Recent Developments in Wizardry , ”
69765	69782	69763	69763	Ron	198	“He ’s not exactly recent if he ’s six hundred and sixty five , is he ? ”
69846	69853	69854	69854	he	104	“ I ’m going to play , ”
69860	69898	69854	69854	he	104	“ If I do n’t , all the Slytherins will think I ’m just too scared to face Snape . I ’ll show them … it ’ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win . ”
69899	69913	69915	69915	Hermione	221	“ Just as long as we ’re not wiping you off the field , ”
70237	70247	70248	70248	Hermione	221	“ Now , do n’t forget , it’sLocomotor Mortis , ”
70259	70263	70264	70264	Ron	198	“ I know , ”
70267	70272	70264	70264	Ron	198	“ Do n’t nag . ”
70285	70321	70279	70279	Wood	317	“ Do n’t want to pressure you , Potter , but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it ’s now . Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much . ”
70322	70330	70332	70333	Fred Weasley	196	“ The whole school ’s out there ! ”
70341	70352	70332	70333	Fred Weasley	196	“ Even — blimey — Dumbledore ’s come to watch ! ”
70360	70363	70364	70364	he	104	“ Dumbledore ? ”
70443	70453	70454	70454	he	198	“ I ’ve never seen Snape look so mean , ”
70458	70466	70454	70454	he	198	“ Look they ’re off — Ouch ! ”
70482	70495	70480	70480	Malfoy	225	“ Oh , sorry , Weasley , did n’t see you there . ”
70504	70530	70531	70531	Ron	198	“ Wonder how long Potter ’s going to stay on his broom this time ? Anyone want a bet ? What about you , Weasley ? ”
70585	70599	70601	70601	Malfoy	225	“ You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team ? ”
70620	70666	70667	70667	Neville	199	“ It ’s people they feel sorry for . See , there ’s Potter , who ’s got no parents , then there ’s the Weasleys , who’vegot no money — you should be on the team , Longbottom , you ’ve got no brains . ”
70680	70690	70691	70691	he	199	“ I ’m worth twelve of you , Malfoy , ”
70718	70724	70705	70705	Ron	198	said,“You tell him , Neville . ”
70725	70745	70705	70705	Ron	198	“ Longbottom , if brains were gold you ’d be poorer than Weasley , and that ’s saying something . ”
70761	70773	70705	70705	Ron	198	“ I ’m warning you , Malfoy — one more word — ”
70774	70777	70779	70779	Hermione	221	“ Ron ! ”
70782	70785	70779	70779	Hermione	221	“ Harry — ”
70786	70791	70792	70792	Harry	104	“ What ? Where ? ”
70831	70849	70851	70851	Malfoy	225	“ You ’re in luck , Weasley , Potter ’s obviously spotted some money on the ground ! ”
70890	70896	70876	70876	Neville	199	“ Come on , Harry ! ”
71021	71049	71051	71051	Hermione	221	“ Ron ! Ron ! Where are you ? The game ’s over ! Harry ’s won ! We ’ve won ! Gryffindor is in the lead ! ”
71142	71146	71148	71148	Dumbledore	122	“ Well done , ”
71158	71177	71178	71178	Snape	266	“ Nice to see you have n’t been brooding about that mirror … been keeping busy … excellent … ”
71561	71585	71557	71557	they	1927	“ … d - don’t know why you wanted t - t - to meet here of all p - places , Severus … ”
71586	71597	71599	71599	Snape	266	“ Oh , I thought we ’d keep this private , ”
71605	71621	71601	71601	his	266	“ Students are n’t supposed to know about the Sorcerer ’s Stone , after all . ”
71635	71651	71631	71631	Snape	266	“ Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid ’s yet ? ”
71652	71662	71601	71601	his	266	“ B - b - but Severus , I — ”
71663	71675	71677	71677	Snape	266	“ You do n’t want me as your enemy , Quirrell , ”
71685	71695	71677	71677	Snape	266	“ I — I do n’t know what you — ”
71696	71705	71601	71601	his	266	“ You know perfectly well what I mean . ”
71728	71739	71727	71727	Snape	266	say,“—your little bit of hocus pocus . I ’m waiting . ”
71740	71751	71727	71727	Snape	266	“ B - but I d - d - don’t — ”
71752	71756	71757	71757	Snape	266	“ Very well , ”
71761	71786	71787	71787	He	266	“ We ’ll have another little chat soon , when you ’ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie . ”
71825	71832	71833	71833	Hermione	221	“ Harry , where have youbeen ? ”
71836	71846	71848	71848	Ron	198	“ We won ! You won ! We won ! ”
71856	71925	71848	71848	Ron	198	“ And I gave Malfoy a black eye , and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single handed ! He ’s still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he ’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin ! Everyone ’s waiting for you in the common room , we ’re having a party , Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens . ”
71926	71932	71934	71934	Harry	104	“ Never mind that now , ”
71937	71953	71954	71954	He	104	“ Let ’s find an empty room , you wait ’ til you hear this … ”
71979	72060	71969	71969	he	104	“ So we were right , itis the Sorcerer ’s Stone , and Snape ’s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it . He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he said something about Quirrell ’s ‘ hocus pocus’—I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy , loads of enchantments , probably , and Quirrell would have done some anti Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through — ”
72061	72079	72081	72081	Hermione	221	“ So you mean the Stone ’s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape ? ”
72085	72094	72096	72096	Ron	198	“ It ’ll be gone by next Tuesday , ”
72264	72273	72255	72255	she	221	“ Hermione , the exams are ages away . ”
72274	72278	72279	72279	Hermione	221	“ Ten weeks , ”
72282	72297	72279	72279	Hermione	221	“ That ’s not ages , that ’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel . ”
72298	72308	72309	72309	Ron	198	“ But we ’re not six hundred years old , ”
72313	72329	72309	72309	Ron	198	“ Anyway , what are you studying for , you already know it ’s an A. ”
72330	72380	72279	72279	Hermione	221	“ What am I studying for ? Are you crazy ? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year ? They ’re very important , I should have started studying a month ago , I do n’t know what ’s gotten into me … ”
72469	72476	72477	72477	Ron	198	“ I ’ll never remember this , ”
72537	72538	72532	72532	Harry	104	up“Dittany ”
72556	72567	72553	72553	Ron	198	“ Hagrid ! What are you doing in the library ? ”
72590	72596	72597	72597	he	121	“ Jus ’ lookin ’ , ”
72611	72621	72597	72597	he	121	“ An ’ what ’re you lot up ter ? ”
72627	72640	72622	72622	He	121	“ Yer not still lookin ’ fer Nicolas Flamel , are yeh ? ”
72641	72653	72655	72655	Ron	198	“ Oh , we found out who he is ages ago , ”
72658	72675	72655	72655	Ron	198	“ And we know what that dog ’s guarding , it ’s a Sorcerer ’s St — ”
72676	72679	72680	72680	Hagrid	121	“ Shhhh ! ”
72691	72707	72687	72687	anyone	380	“ Don ’ go shoutin ’ about it , what ’s the matter with yeh ? ”
72708	72726	72728	72728	Harry	104	“ There are a few things we wanted to ask you , as a matter of fact , ”
72730	72741	72728	72728	Harry	104	“ about what ’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy — ”
72742	72745	72747	72747	Hagrid	121	“ SHHHH ! ”
72750	72800	72747	72747	Hagrid	121	“ Listen — come an ’ see me later , I ’m not promisin ’ I ’ll tell yeh anythin ’ , mind , but don ’ go rabbitin ’ about it in here , students aren ’ s’pposed ter know . They ’ll think I ’ve told yeh — ”
72801	72808	72810	72810	Harry	104	“ See you later , then , ”
72816	72825	72827	72827	Hermione	221	“ What was he hiding behind his back ? ”
72830	72843	72827	72827	Hermione	221	“ Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone ? ”
72844	72856	72858	72858	Ron	198	“ I ’m going to see what section he was in , ”
72889	72892	72893	72893	he	198	“ Dragons ! ”
72896	72928	72893	72893	he	198	“ Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons ! Look at these : Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland ; From Egg to Inferno , A Dragon Keeper ’s Guide . ”
72929	72949	72951	72951	Harry	104	“ Hagrid ’s always wanted a dragon , he told me so the first time I ever met him , ”
72953	72961	72963	72963	Ron	198	“ But it ’s against our laws , ”
72965	73027	72963	72963	Ron	198	“ Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks ’ Convention of 1709 , everyone knows that . It ’s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we ’re keeping dragons in the back garden — anyway , you ca n’t tame dragons , it ’s dangerous . You should see the burns Charlie ’s got off wild ones in Romania . ”
73028	73037	73039	73039	Harry	104	“ But there are n’t wild dragons inBritain ? ”
73041	73047	73049	73049	Ron	198	“ Of course there are , ”
73051	73094	73049	73049	Ron	198	“ Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks . The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up , I can tell you . Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who ’ve spotted them , to make them forget . ”
73095	73104	73106	73106	Hermione	221	“ So what on earths Hagrid up to ? ”
73137	73142	73144	73144	he	121	“ Who is it ? ”
73196	73206	73182	73182	Hagrid	121	“ So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’ ? ”
73207	73210	73212	73212	Harry	104	“ Yes , ”
73223	73243	73247	73247	him	104	“ We were wondering if you could tell us what ’s guarding the Sorcerer ’s Stone apart from Fluffy . ”
73249	73257	73258	73258	he	121	“ O ’ course I ca n’t , ”
73261	73326	73258	73258	he	121	“ Number one , I don ’ know meself . Number two , yeh know too much already , so I wouldn ’ tell yeh if I could . That Stone ’s here fer a good reason . It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an ’ all ? Beats me how yeh even know abou ’ Fluffy . ”
73327	73356	73358	73358	Hermione	221	“ Oh , come on , Hagrid , you might not want to tell us , but youdo know , you know everything that goes on round here , ”
73378	73389	73374	73374	he	121	“ We only wondered who haddone the guarding , really . ”
73394	73410	73390	73390	Hermione	221	“ We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him , apart from you . ”
73427	73470	73471	73471	he	1943	“ Well , I don ’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that … let ’s see … he borrowed Fluffy from me … then some o ’ the teachers did enchantments … Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ”
73479	73508	73471	73471	he	1943	“ Professor Quirrell — an ’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’ , o ’ course . Hang on , I ’ve forgotten someone . Oh yeah , Professor Snape . ”
73509	73512	73476	73476	his	1943	“ Snape ? ”
73513	73542	73543	73543	Harry	104	“ Yeah — yer not still on abou ’ that , are yeh ? Look , Snape helpedprotect the Stone , he ’s not about ter steal it . ”
73602	73622	73624	73624	Harry	104	“ You ’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy , are n’t you , Hagrid ? ”
73627	73645	73624	73624	Harry	104	“ And you would n’t tell anyone , would you ? Not even one of the teachers ? ”
73646	73657	73659	73659	Hagrid	121	“ Not a soul knows except me an ’ Dumbledore , ”
73662	73669	73670	73670	Harry	104	“ Well , that ’s something , ”
73676	73690	73670	73670	Harry	104	“ Hagrid , can we have a window open ? I ’m boiling . ”
73691	73699	73701	73701	Hagrid	121	“ Ca n’t , Harry , sorry , ”
73718	73723	73711	73711	Harry	104	“ Hagrid — what’sthat ? ”
73751	73754	73756	73756	Hagrid	121	“ Ah , ”
73764	73769	73756	73756	Hagrid	121	“ That ’s er … ”
73770	73779	73781	73781	Ron	198	“ Where did you get it , Hagrid ? ”
73796	73805	73781	73781	Ron	198	“ It must ’ve cost you a fortune . ”
73806	73810	73812	73812	Hagrid	121	“ Won it , ”
73814	73857	73812	73812	Hagrid	121	“ Las ’ night . I was down in the village havin’ a few drinks an ’ got into a game o ’ cards with a stranger . Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it , ter be honest . ”
73858	73873	73875	73875	Hermione	221	“ But what are you going to do with it when it ’s hatched ? ”
73877	73888	73890	73890	Hagrid	121	“ Well , I ’ve bin doin’ some readin ’ , ”
73901	73998	73999	73999	He	121	“ Got this outta the library — Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit — it ’s a bit outta date , o ’ course , but it ’s all in here . Keep the egg in the fire , ’cause their mothers breathe on I em , see , an ’ when it hatches , feed it on a bucket o ’ brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour . An ’ see here — how ter recognize diff’rent eggs — what I got there ’s a Norwegian Ridgeback . They ’re rare , them . ”
74011	74020	74021	74021	she	221	“ Hagrid , you live in awooden house , ”
74069	74081	74082	74082	Ron	198	“ Wonder what it ’s like to have a peaceful life , ”
74165	74183	74158	74158	Hermione	221	“ Hermione , how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching ? ”
74184	74217	74158	74158	Hermione	221	“ We ’ve got lessons , we ’ll get into trouble , and that ’s nothing to what Hagrid ’s going to be in when someone finds out what he ’s doing — ”
74218	74222	74223	74223	Harry	104	“ Shut up ! ”
74334	74340	74341	74341	He	121	“ It ’s nearly out . ”
74473	74478	74479	74479	Hagrid	121	“ Is n’t hebeautiful ? ”
74504	74515	74517	74517	Hagrid	121	“ Bless him , look , he knows his mommy ! ”
74519	74522	74524	74524	Hermione	221	“ Hagrid , ”
74526	74536	74524	74524	Hermione	221	“ how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow , exactly ? ”
74562	74568	74551	74551	he	121	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
74569	74596	74597	74597	Harry	104	“ Someone was lookin ’ through the gap in the curtains — it ’s a kid — he ’s runnin ’ back up ter the school . ”
74664	74670	74671	74671	Harry	104	“ Just let him go , ”
74674	74679	74671	74671	Harry	104	“ Set him free . ”
74680	74685	74687	74687	Hagrid	121	“ I ca n’t , ”
74689	74699	74687	74687	Hagrid	121	“ He ’s too little . He ’d die . ”
74756	74765	74767	74767	Hagrid	121	“ I ’ve decided to call him Norbert , ”
74777	74794	74767	74767	Hagrid	121	“ He really knows me now , watch . Norbert ! Norbert ! Where ’s Mommy ? ”
74795	74802	74803	74803	Ron	198	“ He ’s lost his marbles , ”
74810	74813	74815	74815	Harry	104	“ Hagrid , ”
74818	74844	74815	74815	Harry	104	“ give it two weeks and Norbert ’s going to be as long as your house . Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment . ”
74850	74875	74845	74845	Hagrid	121	“ I — I know I ca n’t keep him forever , but I ca n’t jus ’ dump him , I ca n’t . ”
74882	74884	74885	74885	he	104	“Charlie , ”
74888	74896	74898	74898	Ron	198	“ You ’re losing it , too , ”
74900	74907	74898	74898	Ron	198	“ I ’m Ron , remember ? ”
74908	74946	74973	74974	an owl	2504	“ No — Charlie — your brother , Charlie . In Romania . Studying dragons . We could send Norbert to him . Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild ! ”
74947	74950	74952	74952	Ron	198	“ Brilliant ! ”
74954	74961	74952	74952	Ron	198	“ How about it , Hagrid ? ”
75063	75068	75069	75069	he	198	“ It bit me ! ”
75085	75161	75069	75069	he	198	“ I ’m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week . I tell you , that dragon ’s the most horrible animal I ’ve ever met , but the way Hagrid goes on about it , you ’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit . When it bit me he told me off for frightening it . And when I left , he was singing it a lullaby . ”
75171	75176	75178	75178	Harry	104	“ It ’s Hedwig ! ”
75186	75194	75178	75178	Harry	104	“ She ’ll have Charlie ’s answer ! ”
75208	75319	75200	75200	their	498	“ Dear Ron , How are you ? Thanks for the letter — I’d be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback , but it wo n’t be easy getting him here . I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week . Trouble is , they must n’t be seen carrying an illegal dragon . Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday ? They can meet you there and take him away while it ’s still dark . Send me an answer as soon as possible . Love , Charlie ”
75327	75335	75337	75337	Harry	104	“ We ’ve got the Invisibility Cloak , ”
75339	75361	75337	75337	Harry	104	“ It should n’t be too difficult — I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert . ”
75491	75499	75500	75500	he	198	“ It ’s not just my hand , ”
75503	75586	75500	75500	he	198	“ although that feels like it ’s about to fall off . Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me . He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me — I’ve told her it was a dog , but I do n’t think she believes me . I should n’t have hit him at the Quidditch match , that ’s why he ’s doing this . ”
75596	75607	75609	75609	Hermione	221	“ It ’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday , ”
75634	75639	75640	75640	he	198	“ Midnight on Saturday ! ”
75647	75680	75640	75640	he	198	“ Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie ’s letter was in that book Malfoy took , he ’s going to know we ’re getting rid of Norbert . ”
75709	75720	75721	75721	Harry	104	“ It ’s too late to change the plan now , ”
75725	75771	75721	75721	Harry	104	“ We have n’t got time to send Charlie another owl , and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert . We ’ll have to risk it . And wehave got the Invisibility Cloak , Malfoy does n’t know about that . ”
75801	75809	75810	75810	he	121	“ I wo n’t let you in , ”
75813	75827	75810	75810	he	121	“ Norbert ’s at a tricky stage — nothin’ I ca n’t handle . ”
75858	75883	75849	75849	Norbert	342	“ Aargh ! It ’s all right , he only got my boot — jus ’ playin’—he ’s only a baby , after all . ”
76007	76023	76025	76025	Hagrid	121	“ He ’s got lots o ’ rats an ’ some brandy fer the journey , ”
76031	76046	76025	76025	Hagrid	121	“ An ’ I ’ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely . ”
76069	76075	76076	76076	Hagrid	121	“ Bye bye , Norbert ! ”
76096	76103	76094	76094	themselves	1974	“ Mommy will never forget you ! ”
76163	76167	76168	76168	Harry	104	“ Nearly there ! ”
76245	76248	76249	76249	she	113	“ Detention ! ”
76252	76271	76249	76249	she	113	“ And twenty points from Slytherin ! Wandering around in the middle of the night , howdare you — ”
76272	76291	76227	76228	Professor McGonagall	113	“ You do n’t understand , Professor . Harry Potter ’s coming — he ’s got a dragon ! ”
76292	76317	76249	76249	she	113	“ What utter rubbish ! How dare you tell such lies ! Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you , Malfoy ! ”
76373	76383	76366	76366	Hermione	221	“ Malfoy ’s got detention ! I could sing ! ”
76384	76388	76389	76389	Harry	104	“ Do n’t , ”
76552	76559	76560	76560	he	275	“ Well , well , well , ”
76563	76568	76560	76560	he	275	“ weare in trouble . ”
76767	76770	76771	76771	Neville	199	“ Harry ! ”
76783	76812	76771	76771	Neville	199	“ I was trying to find you to warn you , I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you , he said you had a drag — ”
76847	76881	76839	76839	she	113	“ I would never have believed it of any of you . Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower . It ’s one o’clock in the morning . Explain yourselves . ”
76911	76927	76929	76930	Professor McGonagall	113	“ I think I ’ve got a good idea of what ’s been going on , ”
76932	76991	76929	76930	Professor McGonagall	113	“ It does n’t take a genius to work it out . You fed Draco Malfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon , trying to get him out of bed and into trouble . I ’ve already caught him . I suppose you think it’sfunny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it , too ? ”
77044	77049	77051	77052	Professor McGonagall	113	“ I ’m disgusted , ”
77054	77149	77051	77052	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Four students out of bed in one night ! I ’ve never heard of such a thing before ! You , Miss Granger , I thought you had more sense . As for you , Mr. Potter , I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this . All three of you will receive detentions — yes , you too , Mr. Longbottom , nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night , especially these days , it ’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor . ”
77150	77153	77154	77154	Harry	104	“ Fifty ? ”
77174	77178	77180	77181	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Fifty pointseach , ”
77192	77197	77180	77181	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Professor — please — ”
77198	77201	77186	77186	her	113	“ Youcan’t — ”
77202	77237	77186	77186	her	113	“ Do n’t tell me what I can and ca n’t do , Potter . Now get back to bed , all of you . I ’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students . ”
77507	77517	77498	77498	he	262	“ Thanks , Potter , we owe you one ! ”
77524	77558	77518	77519	Only Ron	198	“ They ’ll all forget this in a few weeks . Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they ’ve been here , and people still like them . ”
77559	77578	77580	77580	Harry	104	“ They ’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go , though , have they ? ”
77583	77588	77589	77589	Ron	198	“ Well — no , ”
77651	77654	77655	77655	Wood	317	“ Resign ? ”
77658	77680	77655	77655	Wood	317	“What good’ll that do ? How are we going to get any points back if we ca n’t win at Quidditch ? ”
77714	77718	77711	77711	they	1709	“ the Seeker . ”
77908	77918	77904	77904	Quirrell	175	“ No — no — not again , please — ”
77932	77939	77928	77928	Harry	104	“ All right — all right — ”
78106	78114	78116	78116	Ron	198	“ Snape ’s done it , then ! ”
78118	78133	78116	78116	Ron	198	“ If Quirrell ’s told him how to break his Anti Dark Force spell — ”
78134	78142	78144	78144	Hermione	221	“ There ’s still Fluffy , though , ”
78146	78161	78163	78163	Ron	198	“ Maybe Snape ’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid , ”
78175	78205	78163	78163	Ron	198	“ I bet there ’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three headed dog . So what do we do , Harry ? ”
78225	78253	78219	78219	Hermione	221	“ Go to Dumbledore . That ’s what we should have done ages ago . If we try anything ourselves we ’ll be thrown out for sure . ”
78254	78261	78263	78263	Harry	104	“ But we ’ve got noproof ! ”
78265	78393	78263	78263	Harry	104	“Quirrell ’s too scared to back us up . Snape ’s only got to say he does n’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think they ’ll believe , him or us ? It ’s not exactly a secret we hate him , Dumbledore’ll think we made it up to get him sacked . Filch would n’t help us if his life depended on it , he ’s too friendly with Snape , and the more students get thrown out , the better , he ’ll think . And do n’t forget , we ’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy . That ’ll take a lot of explaining . ”
78403	78414	78399	78399	Ron	198	“ If we just do a bit of poking around — ”
78415	78418	78420	78420	Harry	104	“ No , ”
78423	78431	78432	78432	He	104	“ we ’ve done enough poking around . ”
78475	78496	78469	78469	They	2029	“ Your detention will take place at eleven o’clock tonight . Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall . Professor McGonagall ”
78602	78606	78608	78608	Filch	267	“ Follow me , ”
78618	78638	78639	78639	he	267	“ I bet you ’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again , wo n’t you , eh ? ”
78646	78736	78639	78639	he	267	“ Oh yes … hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me … It ’s just a pity they let the old punishments die out … hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days , I ’ve got the chains still in my office , keep ’em well oiled in case they ’re ever needed … Right , off we go , and do n’t think of running off , now , it ’ll be worse for you if you do . ”
78811	78827	78828	78828	Harry	104	“ Is that you , Filch ? Hurry up , I want ter get started . ”
78862	78906	78859	78859	Filch	267	“ I suppose you think you ’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf ? Well , think again , boy — it ’s into the forest you ’re going and I ’m much mistaken if you ’ll all come out in one piece . ”
78925	78929	78930	78930	he	225	“ The forest ? ”
78944	78968	78934	78934	he	225	“ We ca n’t go in there at night — there ’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves , I heard . ”
78983	78993	78995	78995	Filch	267	“ That ’s your problem , is n’t it ? ”
79003	79020	78997	78997	his	267	“ Should ’ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble , should n’t you ? ”
79053	79058	79059	79059	he	225	“ Abou ’ time , ”
79062	79080	79059	79059	he	225	“ I bin waitin ’ fer half an hour already . All right , Harry , Hermione ? ”
79081	79093	79095	79095	Filch	267	“ I should n’t be too friendly to them , Hagrid , ”
79098	79109	79095	79095	Filch	267	“ they ’re here to be punished , after all . ”
79110	79120	79122	79122	Hagrid	121	“ That ’s why yer late , is it ? ”
79128	79156	79122	79122	Hagrid	121	“ Bin lecturin ’ them , eh ? ’ Snot your place ter do that . Yeh’ve done yer bit , I ’ll take over from here . ”
79157	79165	79167	79167	Filch	267	“ I ’ll be back at dawn , ”
79169	79177	79178	79178	he	267	“ for what ’s left of them , ”
79206	79215	79216	79216	he	225	“ I ’m not going in that forest , ”
79233	79244	79246	79246	Hagrid	121	“ Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts , ”
79249	79263	79246	79246	Hagrid	121	“ Yeh’ve done wrong an ’ now yeh’ve got ter pay fer it . ”
79264	79301	79230	79230	his	225	“ But this is servant stuff , it ’s not for students to do . I thought we ’d be copying lines or something , if my father knew I was doing this , he ’d — ”
79302	79314	79315	79315	Hagrid	121	“ — tell yer that ’s how it is at Hogwarts , ”
79318	79363	79315	79315	Hagrid	121	“ Copyin ’ lines ! What good ’s that ter anyone ? Yeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out . If yeh think yer father’d rather you were expelled , then get back off ter the castle an ’ pack . Go on . ”
79381	79385	79387	79387	Hagrid	121	“ Right then , ”
79389	79426	79427	79427	He	121	“ now , listen carefully , ’cause it ’s dangerous what we ’re gon na do tonight , an ’ I don ’ want no one takin ’ risks . Follow me over here a moment . ”
79474	79478	79480	79480	Hagrid	121	“ Look there , ”
79482	79551	79480	79480	Hagrid	121	“ see that stuff shinin ’ on the ground ? Silvery stuff ? That ’s unicorn blood . There ’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat . This is the second time in a week . I found one dead last Wednesday . We ’re gon na try an ’ find the poor thing . We might have ter put it out of its misery . ”
79552	79564	79566	79566	Malfoy	225	“ And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first ? ”
79578	79598	79600	79600	Hagrid	121	“ There ’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that ’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang , ”
79602	79652	79600	79600	Hagrid	121	“ An ’ keep ter the path . Right , now , we ’re gon na split inter two parties an ’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions . There ’s blood all over the place , it must ’ve bin staggerin ’ around since last night at least . ”
79653	79658	79660	79660	Malfoy	225	“ I want Fang , ”
79670	79684	79686	79686	Hagrid	121	“ All right , but I warn yeh , he ’s a coward , ”
79688	79778	79686	79686	Hagrid	121	“ So me , Harry , an ’ Hermione’ll go one way an ’ Draco , Neville , an ’ Fang’ll go the other . Now , if any of us finds the unicorn , we ’ll send up green sparks , right ? Get yer wands out an ’ practice now — that ’s it — an ’ if anyone gets in trouble , send up red sparks , an ’ we ’ll all come an ’ find yeh — so , be careful — let ’s go . ”
79865	79874	79875	79875	Harry	104	“ Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns ? ”
79878	79883	79885	79885	Hagrid	121	“ Not fast enough , ”
79887	79912	79885	79885	Hagrid	121	“ It ’s not easy ter catch a unicorn , they ’re powerful magic creatures . I never knew one ter be hurt before . ”
79951	79958	79959	79959	Hagrid	121	“ You all right , Hermione ? ”
79962	79994	79959	79959	Hagrid	121	“ Don ’ worry , it ca n’t ’ve gone far if it ’s this badly hurt , an ’ then we ’ll be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE ! ”
80073	80078	80079	80079	he	121	“ I knew it , ”
80082	80093	80079	80079	he	121	“ There ’s summat in here that shouldn ’ be . ”
80094	80098	80099	80099	Harry	104	“ A werewolf ? ”
80102	80118	80120	80120	Hagrid	121	“ That wasn ’ no werewolf an ’ it wasn ’ no unicorn , neither , ”
80123	80134	80120	80120	Hagrid	121	“ Right , follow me , but careful , now . ”
80158	80163	80164	80164	Hagrid	121	“ Who ’s there ? ”
80167	80174	80164	80164	Hagrid	121	“ Show yerself — I’m armed ! ”
80227	80236	80238	80238	Hagrid	121	“ Oh , it ’s you , Ronan , ”
80242	80247	80248	80248	He	121	“ How are yeh ? ”
80258	80266	80268	80268	Ronan	351	“ Good evening to you , Hagrid , ”
80278	80286	80270	80270	He	351	“ Were you going to shoot me ? ”
80287	80296	80298	80298	Hagrid	121	“ Ca n’t be too careful , Ronan , ”
80304	80347	80298	80298	Hagrid	121	“ There ’s summat bad loose in this forest . This is Harry Potter an ’ Hermione Granger , by the way . Students up at the school . An ’ this is Ronan , you two . He ’s a centaur . ”
80348	80353	80355	80355	Hermione	221	“ We ’d noticed , ”
80358	80362	80364	80364	Ronan	351	“ Good evening , ”
80366	80383	80364	80364	Ronan	351	“ Students , are you ? And do you learn much , up at the school ? ”
80384	80387	80298	80298	Hagrid	121	“ Erm — ”
80388	80392	80394	80394	Hermione	221	“ A bit , ”
80397	80407	80394	80394	Hermione	221	“ A bit . Well , that ’s something . ”
80422	80428	80411	80411	He	351	“ Mars is bright tonight . ”
80429	80432	80434	80434	Hagrid	121	“ Yeah , ”
80441	80468	80434	80434	Hagrid	121	“ Listen , I ’m glad we ’ve run inter yeh , Ronan , ’cause there ’s a unicorn bin hurt — you seen anythin ’ ? ”
80484	80493	80494	80494	he	351	“ Always the innocent are the first victims , ”
80497	80511	80494	80494	he	351	“ So it has been for ages past , so it is now . ”
80512	80515	80517	80517	Hagrid	121	“ Yeah , ”
80519	80533	80517	80517	Hagrid	121	“ but have yeh seen anythin ’ , Ronan ? Anythin ’ unusual ? ”

80555	80570	80573	80573	Hagrid	121	“ Yeah , but I was meanin ’ anythin ’ unusual a bit nearer home ”
80575	80585	80573	80573	Hagrid	121	“ So yeh have n’t noticed anythin ’ strange ? ”
80600	80606	80599	80599	he	351	said,“The forest hides many secrets . ”
80639	80644	80646	80646	Hagrid	121	“ Hullo , Bane , ”
80648	80652	80646	80646	Hagrid	121	“ All right ? ”
80653	80665	80625	80627	a second centaur	2056	“ Good evening , Hagrid , I hope you are well ? ”
80666	80705	80706	80706	Bane	354	“ Well enough . Look , I ’ve jus ’ bin askin ’ Ronan , you seen anythin ’ odd in here lately ? There ’s a unicorn bin injured — would yeh know anythin ’ about it ? ”
80719	80724	80725	80725	he	354	“Mars is bright tonight , ”
80729	80734	80736	80736	Hagrid	121	“ We ’ve heard , ”
80739	80766	80736	80736	Hagrid	121	“ Well , if either of you do see anythin ’ , let me know , wo n’t yeh ? We ’ll be off , then . ”
80792	80795	80797	80797	Hagrid	121	“ Never , ”
80800	80825	80797	80797	Hagrid	121	“ try an ’ get a straight answer out of a centaur . Ruddy stargazers . Not interested in anythin ’ closer’n the moon . ”
80826	80834	80836	80836	Hermione	221	“ Are there many ofthem in here ? ”
80838	80886	80836	80836	Hermione	221	“ Oh , a fair few … Keep themselves to themselves mostly , but they ’re good enough about turnin ’ up if ever I want a word . They ’re deep mind , centaurs … they know things … jus ’ don ’ let on much . ”
80887	80898	80900	80900	Harry	104	“ D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier ? ”
80902	80936	80900	80900	Harry	104	“ Did that sound like hooves to you ? Nah , if yeh ask me , that was what ’s bin killin ’ the unicorns — never heard anythin ’ like it before . ”
80994	81008	80988	80988	Hermione	221	“ Hagrid ! Look ! Red sparks , the others are in trouble ! ”
81009	81015	81016	81016	Hagrid	121	“ You two wait here ! ”
81019	81032	81016	81016	Hagrid	121	“ Stay on the path , I ’ll come back for yeh ! ”
81065	81078	81080	81080	Hermione	221	“ You do n’t think they ’ve been hurt , do you ? ”
81082	81110	81080	81080	Hermione	221	“ I do n’t care if Malfoy has , but if something ’s got Neville … it ’s our fault he ’s here in the first place . ”
81202	81255	81256	81256	Hagrid	121	“ We ’ll be lucky ter catch anythin ’ now , with the racket you two were makin ’ . Right , we ’re changin ’ groups — Neville , you stay with me an ’ Hermione , Harry , you go with Fang an ’ this idiot . I ’m sorry , ”
81264	81286	81256	81256	Hagrid	121	“ but he ’ll have a harder time frightenin ’ you , an ’ we ’ve got ta get this done . ”
81382	81385	81386	81386	he	104	“ Look — ”
81542	81545	81546	81546	Malfoy	225	“ AAAAAAAAAARGH ! ”
81708	81714	81716	81717	the centaur	2055	“ Are you all right ? ”
81725	81734	81716	81717	the centaur	2055	“ Yes — thank you — whatwas that ? ”
81774	81781	81782	81782	he	2055	“ You are the Potter boy , ”
81785	81823	81824	81824	he	2055	“ You had better get back to Hagrid . The forest is not safe at this time — especially for you . Can you ride ? It will be quicker this way . My name is Firenze , ”
81876	81879	81880	81880	Bane	354	“ Firenze ! ”
81883	81908	81880	81880	Bane	354	“ What are you doing ? You have a human on your back ! Have you no shame ? Are you a common mule ? ”
81909	81917	81919	81919	Firenze	356	“ Do you realize who this is ? ”
81921	81938	81919	81919	Firenze	356	“ This is the Potter boy . The quicker he leaves this forest , the better . ”
81939	81947	81949	81949	Bane	354	“ What have you been telling him ? ”
81951	81982	81949	81949	Bane	354	“ Remember , Firenze , we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens . Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ? ”
81989	82000	82001	82001	he	351	“I’m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best , ”
82016	82055	82008	82008	Bane	354	“ For the best ! What is that to do with us ? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold ! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest ! ”
82079	82087	82088	82088	Firenze	356	“ Do you not see that unicorn ? ”
82093	82138	82088	82088	Firenze	356	“ Do you not understand why it was killed ? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret ? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest , Bane , yes , with humans alongside me if I must . ”
82178	82185	82186	82186	he	104	“ Why ’s Bane so angry ? ”
82189	82201	82186	82186	he	104	“ What was that thing you saved me from , anyway ? ”
82273	82287	82269	82269	Firenze	356	“ Harry Potter , do you know what unicorn blood is used for ? ”
82288	82291	82293	82293	Harry	104	“ No , ”
82301	82314	82293	82293	Harry	104	“ We ’ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions . ”
82315	82330	82332	82332	Firenze	356	“ That is because it is a monstrous thing , to slay a unicorn , ”
82334	82412	82332	82332	Firenze	356	“ Only one who has nothing to lose , and everything to gain , would commit such a crime . The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive , even if you are an inch from death , but at a terrible price . You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself , and you will have but a half life , a cursed life , from the moment the blood touches your lips . ”
82431	82439	82440	82440	he	104	“ But who ’d be that desperate ? ”
82444	82462	82440	82440	he	104	“ If you ’re going to be cursed forever , death ’s better , is n’t it ? ”
82463	82467	82468	82468	Firenze	356	“ It is , ”
82471	82525	82468	82468	Firenze	356	“ unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else — something that will bring you back to full strength and power — something that will mean you can never die . Mr. Potter , do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment ? ”
82526	82547	82440	82440	he	104	“ The Sorcerer ’s Stone ! Of course — the Elixir of Life ! But I do n’t understand who — ”
82548	82574	82468	82468	Firenze	356	“ Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power , who has clung to life , awaiting their chance ? ”
82615	82639	82604	82604	Hagrid	121	“ Some say he died . Codswallop , in my opinion . Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die . ”
82640	82645	82646	82646	Harry	104	“ Do you mean , ”
82649	82653	82646	82646	Harry	104	“ that wasVol — ”
82654	82664	82665	82665	Hermione	221	“ Harry ! Harry , are you all right ? ”
82680	82685	82687	82687	Harry	104	“ I ’m fine , ”
82696	82712	82687	82687	Harry	104	“ The unicorn ’s dead , Hagrid , it ’s in that clearing back there . ”
82713	82721	82722	82722	Firenze	356	“ This is where I leave you , ”
82733	82739	82740	82740	Harry	104	“ You are safe now . ”
82746	82753	82755	82755	Firenze	356	“ Good luck , Harry Potter , ”
82757	82780	82781	82781	He	121	“ The planets have been read wrongly before now , even by centaurs . I hope this is one of those times . ”
82877	82906	82872	82872	He	104	“ Snape wants the stone for Voldemort … and Voldemort ’s waiting in the forest … and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich … ”
82907	82913	82915	82915	Ron	198	“ Stop saying the name ! ”
82935	82997	82930	82930	Harry	104	“ Firenze saved me , but he should n’t have done so … Bane was furious … he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen … They must show that Voldemort ’s coming back … Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me … I suppose that ’s written in the stars as well . ”
82998	83006	83007	83007	Ron	198	“ Will you stop saying the name ! ”
83010	83027	83007	83007	Ron	198	“ So all I ’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone , ”
83033	83054	83028	83028	Harry	104	“ then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off … Well , I suppose Bane’ll be happy . ”
83068	83132	83061	83061	she	221	“ Harry , everyone says Dumbledore ’s the only one You - Know - Who was ever afraid of . With Dumbledore around , You - Know - Who wo n’t touch you . Anyway , who says the centaurs are right ? It sounds like fortune telling to me , and Professor McGonagall says that ’s a very imprecise branch of magic . ”
83605	83617	83619	83619	Hermione	221	“ That was far easier than I thought it would be , ”
83632	83653	83619	83619	Hermione	221	“ I need n’t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager . ”
83710	83714	83715	83715	Ron	198	“No more studying , ”
83725	83757	83715	83715	Ron	198	“ You could look more cheerful , Harry , we ’ve got a week before we find out how badly we ’ve done , there ’s no need to worry yet . ”
83764	83772	83773	83773	he	104	“ I wish I knew what thismeans ! ”
83778	83795	83773	83773	he	104	“My scar keeps hurting — it ’s happened before , but never as often as this . ”
83796	83802	83803	83803	Hermione	221	“ Go to Madam Pomfrey , ”
83806	83812	83814	83814	Harry	104	“ I ’m not ill , ”
83816	83830	83814	83814	Harry	104	“ I think it ’s a warning … it means danger ’s coming … ”
83843	83914	83915	83915	Harry	104	“ Harry , relax , Hermione ’s right , the Stone ’s safe as long as Dumbledore ’s around . Anyway , we ’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy . He nearly had his leg ripped off once , he ’s not going to try it again in a hurry . And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down . ”
83950	83978	83947	83947	Hermione	221	“ That ’s just the exams . I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we ’d done that one . ”
84057	84063	84065	84065	Ron	198	“ Where ’re you going ? ”
84068	84076	84078	84078	Harry	104	“ I ’ve just thought of something , ”
84085	84097	84080	84080	He	104	“ We ’ve got to go and see Hagrid , now . ”
84098	84101	84103	84103	Hermione	221	“ Why ? ”
84110	84121	84123	84123	Harry	104	“ Do n’t you think it ’s a bit odd , ”
84131	84193	84123	84123	Harry	104	“ that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon , and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket ? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it ’s against wizard law ? Lucky they found Hagrid , do n’t you think ? Why did n’t I see it before ? ”
84194	84201	84203	84203	Ron	198	“ What are you talking about ? ”
84248	84251	84252	84252	he	121	“ Hullo , ”
84257	84268	84252	84252	he	121	“ Finished yer exams ? Got time fer a drink ? ”
84269	84274	84276	84276	Ron	198	“ Yes , please , ”
84284	84323	84279	84279	Harry	104	“ No , we ’re in a hurry . Hagrid , I ’ve got to ask you something . You know that night you won Norbert ? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like ? ”
84324	84327	84329	84329	Hagrid	121	“ Dunno , ”
84332	84341	84329	84329	Hagrid	121	“ he wouldn ’ take his cloak off . ”
84355	84407	84352	84352	his	121	“ It ’s not that unusual , yeh get a lot o ’ funny folk in the Hog ’s Head — that ’s the pub down in the village . Mighta bin a dragon dealer , mightn ’ he ? I never saw his face , he kept his hood up . ”
84418	84435	84408	84408	Harry	104	“What did you talk to him about , Hagrid ? Did you mention Hogwarts at all ? ”
84436	84441	84443	84443	Hagrid	121	“ Mighta come up , ”
84452	84584	84443	84443	Hagrid	121	“ Yeah … he asked what I did , an ’ I told him I was gamekeeper here … He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after … so I told him … an ’ I said what I ’d always really wanted was a dragon … an ’ then … I can ’ remember too well , ’cause he kept buyin ’ me drinks … Let ’s see … yeah , then he said he had the dragon egg an ’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted … but he had ter be sure I could handle it , he didn ’ want it ter go ter any old home … So I told him , after Fluffy , a dragon would be easy … ”
84585	84597	84598	84598	Harry	104	“ And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy ? ”
84609	84666	84598	84598	Harry	104	“ Well — yeah — how many three headed dogs d’yeh meet , even around Hogwarts ? So I told him , Fluffy ’s a piece o ’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down , jus ’ play him a bit o ’ music an ’ he ’ll go straight off ter sleep — ”
84672	84679	84680	84680	he	121	“ I shouldn’ta told yeh that ! ”
84684	84696	84697	84697	Harry	104	“ Forget I said it ! Hey — where’re yeh goin’ ? ”
84732	84741	84743	84743	Harry	104	“ We ’ve got to go to Dumbledore , ”
84745	84805	84743	84743	Harry	104	“ Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy , and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must ’ve been easy , once he ’d got Hagrid drunk . I just hope Dumbledore believes us . Firenze might back us up if Bane does n’t stop him . Where ’s Dumbledore ’s office ? ”
84846	84853	84854	84854	Harry	104	“ We ’ll just have to — ”
84866	84874	84877	84878	Professor McGonagall	113	“ What are you three doing inside ? ”
84887	84895	84897	84897	Hermione	221	“ We want to see Professor Dumbledore , ”
84907	84912	84904	84904	Ron	198	“ See Professor Dumbledore ? ”
84930	84933	84913	84914	Professor McGonagall	113	“ Why ? ”
84940	84947	84948	84948	he	104	“ It ’s sort of secret , ”
84967	84975	84976	84976	she	113	“ Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago , ”
84980	84999	84976	84976	she	113	“ He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once . ”
85000	85003	85005	85005	Harry	104	“ He’sgone ? ”
85008	85010	85005	85005	Harry	104	“Now ? ”
85011	85030	84976	84976	she	113	“ Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard , Potter , he has many demands on his time — ”
85031	85037	84976	84976	she	113	“ But this is important . ”
85038	85055	85005	85005	Harry	104	“ Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic , Potter ? ”
85056	85059	85061	85061	Harry	104	“ Look , ”
85069	85080	85061	85061	Harry	104	“ Professor — it ’s about the Sorcerer ’s stone — ”
85111	85117	85118	85118	she	113	“ How do you know ? ”
85121	85152	85118	85118	she	113	“ Professor , I think — Iknow — that Sn — that someone ’s going to try and steal the Stone . I ’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore . ”
85164	85172	85173	85173	she	113	“ Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow , ”
85177	85207	85173	85173	she	113	“ I do n’t know how you found out about the Stone , but rest assured , no one can possibly steal it , it ’s too well protected . ”
85208	85212	85265	85265	Harry	104	“ But Professor — ”
85213	85224	85225	85225	she	113	“ Potter , I know what I ’m talking about , ”
85239	85252	85229	85229	She	113	“ I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine . ”
85258	85263	85265	85265	Harry	104	“ It ’s tonight , ”
85278	85327	85265	85265	Harry	104	“ Snape ’s going through the trapdoor tonight . He ’s found out everything he needs , and now he ’s got Dumbledore out of the way . He sent that note , I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up . ”
85328	85334	85335	85335	Hermione	221	“ But what can we — ”
85349	85353	85354	85354	he	266	“ Good afternoon , ”
85363	85375	85376	85376	he	266	“ You should n’t be inside on a day like this , ”
85386	85390	85391	85391	Harry	104	“ We were — ”
85404	85412	85414	85414	Snape	266	“ You want to be more careful , ”
85416	85446	85414	85414	Snape	266	“ Hanging around like this , people will think you ’re up to something . And Gryffindor really ca n’t afford to lose any more points , can it ? ”
85462	85487	85488	85488	He	266	“ Be warned , Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled . Good day to you . ”
85510	85522	85523	85523	he	104	“ Right , here ’s what we ’ve got to do , ”
85527	85561	85523	85523	he	104	“ One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it . Hermione , you ’d better do that . ”
85562	85566	85574	85574	Ron	198	“ Why me ? ”
85567	85572	85574	85574	Ron	198	“ It ’s obvious , ”
85576	85590	85591	85591	He	104	“ You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick , you know . ”
85598	85618	85591	85591	He	104	“ ‘ Oh Professor Flitwick , I ’m so worried , I think I got question fourteenb wrong … ’ ”
85619	85625	85627	85627	Hermione	221	“ Oh , shut up , ”
85640	85652	85653	85653	Harry	104	“ And we ’d better stay outside the third floor corridor , ”
85657	85661	85653	85653	Harry	104	“ Come on . ”
85702	85719	85720	85720	she	113	“ I suppose you think you ’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments ! ”
85723	85758	85720	85720	she	113	“ Enough of this nonsense ! If I hear you ’ve come anywhere near here again , I ’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor ! Yes , Weasley , from my own house ! ”
85772	85781	85769	85769	Harry	104	said,“At least Hermione ’s on Snape ’s tail , ”
85796	85803	85804	85804	she	221	“ I ’m sorry , Harry ! ”
85807	85851	85804	85804	she	221	“ Snape came out and asked me what I was doing , so I said I was waiting for Flitwick , and Snape went to get him , and I ’ve only just got away , I do n’t know where Snape went . ”
85852	85864	85865	85865	Harry	104	“ Well , that ’s it then , is n’t it ? ”
85884	85905	85879	85879	his	104	“ I ’m going out of here tonight and I ’m going to try and get to the Stone first . ”
85906	85911	85913	85913	Ron	198	“ You ’re mad ! ”
85915	85920	85922	85922	Hermione	221	“ You ca n’t ! ”
85924	85938	85922	85922	Hermione	221	“ After what McGonagall and Snape have said ? You ’ll be expelled ! ”
85939	85943	85944	85944	Harry	104	“ SO WHAT ? ”
85947	86118	86119	86119	He	2126	“ Do n’t you understand ? If Snape gets hold of the Stone , Voldemort ’s coming back ! Have n’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over ? There wo n’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from ! He ’ll flatten it , or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts ! Losing points does n’t matter anymore , ca n’t you see ? D’you think he ’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup ? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone , well , I ’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there , it ’s only dying a bit later than I would have , because I ’m never going over to the Dark Side ! I ’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me ! Voldemort killed my parents , remember ? ”
86124	86131	86133	86133	Hermione	221	“ You ’re right , Harry , ”
86139	86147	86149	86149	Harry	104	“ I ’ll use the Invisibility Cloak , ”
86151	86161	86149	86149	Harry	104	“ It ’s just lucky I got it back . ”
86162	86172	86174	86174	Ron	198	“ But will it cover all three of us ? ”
86176	86184	86174	86174	Ron	198	“ All — all three of us ? ”
86185	86203	86149	86149	Harry	104	“ Oh , come off it , you do n’t think we ’d let you go alone ? ”
86204	86209	86211	86211	Hermione	221	“ Of course not , ”
86214	86244	86211	86211	Hermione	221	“ How do you think you ’d get to the Stone without us ? I ’d better go and took through my books , there might be something useful … ”
86245	86260	86149	86149	Harry	104	“ But if we get caught , you two will be expelled , too . ”
86261	86269	86271	86271	Hermione	221	“ Not if I can help it , ”
86274	86301	86271	86271	Hermione	221	“ Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam . They ’re not throwing me out after that . ”
86406	86412	86413	86413	Ron	198	“ Better get the cloak , ”
86479	86512	86470	86470	He	104	“ We ’d better put the cloak on here , and make sure it covers all three of us — if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own — ”
86513	86519	86574	86574	Neville	199	“ What are you doing ? ”
86555	86562	86564	86564	Harry	104	“ Nothing , Neville , nothing , ”
86581	86588	86589	86589	he	199	“ You ’re going out again , ”
86592	86599	86601	86601	Hermione	221	“ No , no , no , ”
86603	86620	86621	86621	Harry	104	“ No , we ’re not . Why do n’t you go to bed , Neville ? ”
86651	86658	86660	86660	Neville	199	“ You ca n’t go out , ”
86662	86677	86660	86660	Neville	199	“ you ’ll be caught again . Gryffindor will be in even more trouble . ”
86678	86684	86686	86686	Harry	104	“ You do n’t understand , ”
86688	86693	86686	86686	Harry	104	“ this is important . ”
86705	86714	86715	86715	he	104	“ I wo n’t let you do it , ”
86728	86735	86715	86715	he	104	“ I’ll — I’ll fight you ! ”
86736	86739	86740	86740	Ron	198	“ Neville , ”
86741	86753	86715	86715	he	104	exploded,“get away from that hole and do n’t be an idiot — ”
86754	86763	86765	86765	Neville	199	“ Do n’t you call me an idiot ! ”
86767	86794	86765	86765	Neville	199	“ I do n’t think you should be breaking any more rules ! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people ! ”
86795	86802	86804	86804	Ron	198	“ Yes , but not tous , ”
86808	86819	86820	86820	He	198	“Neville , you do n’t know what you ’re doing . ”
86838	86848	86850	86850	Neville	199	“ Go on then , try and hit me ! ”
86856	86861	86850	86850	Neville	199	“ I ’m ready ! ”
86867	86870	86871	86871	he	104	“ Dosomething , ”
86879	86882	86883	86883	she	221	“ Neville , ”
86886	86896	86897	86897	She	221	“ I ’m really , really sorry about this . ”
86902	86906	86907	86907	she	221	“ Petrificus Totalus ! ”
86982	86990	86991	86991	Harry	104	“ What ’ve you done to him ? ”
86994	87002	87004	87004	Hermione	221	“ It ’s the full Body Bind , ”
87007	87017	87004	87004	Hermione	221	“ Oh , Neville , I ’m so sorry . ”
87018	87030	87032	87032	Harry	104	“ We had to , Neville , no time to explain , ”
87034	87042	87044	87044	Ron	198	“ You ’ll understand later , Neville , ”
87119	87131	87132	87132	Ron	198	“ Oh , let ’s kick her , just this once , ”
87199	87204	87205	87205	he	231	“ Who ’s there ? ”
87221	87245	87214	87214	He	231	“ Know you ’re there , even if I ca n’t see you . Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie ? ”
87260	87276	87246	87246	He	231	“ Should call Filch , I should , if something ’s a creeping around unseen . ”
87283	87286	87287	87287	he	104	“ Peeves , ”
87295	87307	87287	87287	he	104	“ the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible . ”
87332	87344	87345	87345	he	231	“ So sorry , your bloodiness , Mr. Baron , Sir , ”
87349	87381	87345	87345	he	231	“ My mistake , my mistake — I did n’t see you — of course I did n’t , you ’re invisible — forgive old Peevsie his little joke , sir . ”
87382	87390	87392	87392	Harry	104	“ I have business here , Peeves , ”
87394	87402	87392	87392	Harry	104	“ Stay away from this place tonight . ”
87403	87414	87416	87416	Peeves	231	“ I will , sir , I most certainly will , ”
87425	87440	87442	87442	he	231	“ Hope your business goes well , Baron , I ’ll not bother you . ”
87446	87451	87453	87453	Ron	198	“ Brilliant , Harry ! ”
87477	87484	87485	87485	Harry	104	“ Well , there you are , ”
87489	87497	87485	87485	Harry	104	“ Snape ’s already got past Fluffy . ”
87527	87541	87542	87542	he	104	“ If you want to go back , I wo n’t blame you , ”
87545	87559	87542	87542	he	104	“ You can take the cloak , I wo n’t need it now . ”
87560	87566	87568	87568	Ron	198	“ Do n’t be stupid , ”
87570	87575	87577	87577	Hermione	221	“ We ’re coming , ”
87619	87627	87628	87628	Hermione	221	“ What ’s that at its feet ? ”
87631	87637	87639	87639	Ron	198	“ Looks like a harp , ”
87641	87649	87639	87639	Ron	198	“ Snape must have left it there . ”
87650	87661	87663	87663	Harry	104	“ It must wake up the moment you stop playing , ”
87665	87671	87672	87672	He	104	“ Well , here goes … ”
87737	87741	87742	87742	Ron	198	“ Keep playing , ”
87775	87788	87790	87790	Ron	198	“ I think we ’ll be able to pull the door open , ”
87799	87807	87790	87790	Ron	198	“ Want to go first , Hermione ? ”
87808	87815	87823	87823	his	198	“ No , I do n’t ! ”
87816	87820	87821	87821	Ron	198	“ All right . ”
87850	87856	87834	87834	He	198	“ What can you see ? ”
87861	87882	87883	87883	Harry	104	“ Nothing — just black — there ’s no way of climbing down , we ’ll just have to drop . ”
87904	87915	87917	87917	Ron	198	“ You want to go first ? Are you sure ? ”
87919	87942	87943	87943	Harry	104	“ I do n’t know how deep this thing goes . Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep . ”
88019	88042	88013	88013	he	104	said,“If anything happens to me , do n’t follow . Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore , right ? ”
88043	88046	88048	88048	Ron	198	“ Right , ”
88050	88060	88048	88048	Ron	198	“ See you in a minute , I hope … ”
88127	88132	88133	88133	he	104	“ It ’s okay ! ”
88152	88163	88133	88133	he	104	“ it ’s a soft landing , you can jump ! ”
88177	88183	88169	88169	He	198	“ What ’s this stuff ? ”
88189	88213	88169	88169	He	198	“ Dunno , some sort of plant thing . I suppose it ’s here to break the fall . Come on , Hermione ! ”
88242	88251	88252	88252	she	221	“ We must be miles under the school , ”
88255	88265	88267	88267	Ron	198	“ Lucky this plant thing ’s here , really , ”
88269	88272	88274	88274	Hermione	221	“ Lucky ! ”
88276	88281	88274	88274	Hermione	221	“Look at you both ! ”
88386	88390	88391	88391	Hermione	221	“ Stop moving ! ”
88395	88408	88391	88391	Hermione	221	“ I know what this is — it ’s Devil ’s Snare ! ”
88409	88429	88431	88431	Ron	198	“ Oh , I ’m so glad we know what it ’s called , that ’s a great help , ”
88447	88461	88463	88463	Hermione	221	“ Shut up , I ’m trying to remember how to kill it ! ”
88465	88476	88477	88477	Harry	104	“ Well , hurry up , I ca n’t breathe ! ”
88490	88511	88477	88477	Harry	104	“ Devil ’s Snare , Devil ’s Snare … what did Professor Sprout say?—it likes the dark and the damp — ”
88512	88518	88519	88519	Harry	104	“ So light a fire ! ”
88522	88534	88519	88519	Harry	104	“ Yes — of course — but there ’s no wood ! ”
88542	88548	88549	88549	Ron	198	“ HAVE YOU GONE MAD ? ”
88552	88560	88549	88549	Ron	198	“ ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT ? ”
88561	88566	88568	88568	Hermione	221	“ Oh , right ! ”
88644	88654	88656	88656	Harry	104	“ Lucky you pay attention in Herbology , Hermione , ”
88671	88674	88676	88676	Ron	198	“ Yeah , ”
88678	88694	88676	88676	Ron	198	“ and lucky Harry does n’t lose his head in a crisis—‘there ’s no wood,’honestly . ”
88695	88699	88701	88701	Harry	104	“ This way , ”
88787	88793	88794	88794	Ron	198	“ Can you hear something ? ”
88813	88822	88794	88794	Ron	198	“ Do you think it ’s a ghost ? ”
88823	88835	88794	88794	Ron	198	“ I do n’t know … sounds like wings to me . ”
88836	88848	88849	88849	They	1096	“ There ’s light ahead — I can see something moving . ”
88903	88917	88919	88919	Ron	198	“ Do you think they ’ll attack us if we cross the room ? ”
88921	88924	88926	88926	Harry	104	“ Probably , ”
88928	88959	88926	88926	Harry	104	“ They do n’t look very vicious , but I suppose if they all swooped down at once … well , there ’s no other choice … I ’ll run . ”
89042	89046	89048	89048	Ron	198	“ Now what ? ”
89050	89063	89065	89065	Hermione	221	“ These birds … they ca n’t be here just for decoration , ”
89078	89084	89085	89085	Harry	104	“ They ’re not birds ! ”
89089	89103	89104	89104	he	104	“ They’rekeys ! Winged keys — look carefully . So that must mean … ”
89121	89140	89104	89104	he	104	“ … yes — look ! Broomsticks ! We ’ve got to catch the key to the door ! ”
89141	89148	89149	89149	Ron	198	“ But there arehundreds of them ! ”
89157	89176	89149	89149	Ron	198	“ We ’re looking for a big , old fashioned one — probably silver , like the handle . ”
89287	89291	89292	89292	he	104	“ That one ! ”
89298	89323	89324	89324	Ron	198	“ That big one — there — no , there — with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side . ”
89347	89357	89358	89358	Harry	104	“ We ’ve got to close in on it ! ”
89373	89405	89406	89406	Ron	198	“ Ron , you come at it from above — Hermione , stay below and stop it from going down and I ’ll try and catch it . Right , NOW ! ”
89517	89520	89521	89521	Harry	104	“ Ready ? ”
89636	89643	89644	89644	Harry	104	“ Now what do we do ? ”
89647	89656	89658	89658	Ron	198	“ It ’s obvious , is n’t it ? ”
89660	89672	89658	89658	Ron	198	“ We ’ve got to play our way across the room . ”
89683	89686	89688	89688	Hermione	221	“ How ? ”
89691	89695	89697	89697	Ron	198	“ I think , ”
89699	89709	89710	89710	He	198	“ we ’re going to have to be chessmen . ”
89756	89770	89747	89747	his	2178	“ Do we — er — have to join you to get across ? ”
89783	89807	89776	89776	Ron	198	“ This needs thinking about he said . I suppose we ’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces … ”
89820	89839	89819	89819	he	198	said,“Now , do n’t be offended or anything , but neither of you are that good at chess — ”
89840	89846	89848	89848	Harry	104	“ We ’re not offended , ”
89851	89859	89848	89848	Harry	104	“ Just tell us what to do . ”
89860	89886	89819	89819	he	198	“ Well , Harry , you take the place of that bishop , and Hermione , you go next to him instead of that castle . ”
89887	89892	89848	89848	Harry	104	“ What about you ? ”
89893	89902	89904	89904	Ron	198	“ I ’m going to be a knight , ”
89953	89961	89963	89963	Ron	198	“ White always plays first in chess , ”
89970	89975	89963	89963	Ron	198	“ Yes … look … ”
90012	90023	90024	90024	Their	2182	“ Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right . ”
90059	90066	90068	90068	Ron	198	“ Had to let that happen , ”
90073	90087	90068	90068	Ron	198	“ Leaves you free to take that bishop , Hermione , go on . ”
90154	90160	90161	90161	he	198	“ We ’re nearly there , ”
90165	90174	90161	90161	he	198	“ Let me think — let me think … ”
90185	90188	90190	90190	Ron	198	“ Yes … ”
90193	90207	90190	90190	Ron	198	“ It ’s the only way … I ’ve got to be taken . ”
90208	90211	90212	90212	Harry	104	“ NO ! ”
90217	90222	90224	90224	Ron	198	“ That ’s chess ! ”
90226	90257	90224	90224	Ron	198	“ You ’ve got to make some sacrifices ! I take one step forward and she ’ll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate the king , Harry ! ”
90258	90261	90190	90190	Ron	198	“ But — ”
90262	90272	90190	90190	Ron	198	“ Do you want to stop Snape or not ? ”
90273	90276	90224	90224	Ron	198	“ Ron — ”
90277	90294	90190	90190	Ron	198	“ Look , if you do n’t hurry up , he ’ll already have the Stone ! ”
90300	90303	90304	90304	Ron	198	“ Ready ? ”
90313	90329	90330	90330	He	198	“ Here I go — now , do n’t hang around once you ’ve won . ”
90449	90456	90438	90438	Hermione	221	“ What if he ’s — ? ”
90457	90464	90466	90466	Harry	104	“ He ’ll be all right , ”
90473	90481	90438	90438	Hermione	221	“ What do you reckon ’s next ? ”
90482	90524	90525	90525	They	2197	“ We ’ve had Sprout ’s , that was the Devil ’s Snare ; Flitwick must ’ve put charms on the keys ; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive ; that leaves Quirrell ’s spell , and Snape ’s . ”
90531	90535	90536	90536	Harry	104	“ All right ? ”
90539	90543	90544	90544	Harry	104	“ Go on . ”
90604	90617	90618	90618	Harry	104	“ I ’m glad we did n’t have to fight that one , ”
90631	90640	90641	90641	He	104	“ Come on , I ca n’t breathe . ”
90684	90688	90690	90690	Harry	104	“ Snape ’s , ”
90692	90700	90690	90690	Harry	104	“ What do we have to do ? ”
90749	90752	90753	90753	Hermione	221	“ Look ! ”
90967	90970	90972	90972	Hermione	221	“ Brilliant , ”
90974	91008	90972	90972	Hermione	221	“This is n’t magic — it ’s logic — a puzzle . A lot of the greatest wizards have n’t got an ounce of logic , they ’d be stuck in here forever . ”
91009	91019	90954	90954	she	221	“ But so will we , wo n’t we ? ”
91020	91025	91027	91027	Hermione	221	“ Of course not , ”
91029	91070	91027	91027	Hermione	221	“ Everything we need is here on this paper . Seven bottles : three are poison ; two are wine ; one will get us safely through the black fire , and one will get us back through the purple . ”
91071	91081	90954	90954	she	221	“ But how do we know which to drink ? ”
91082	91088	91089	91089	Hermione	221	“ Give me a minute . ”
91123	91127	91128	91128	she	221	“ Got it , ”
91131	91147	91128	91128	she	221	“ The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire — toward the Stone . ”
91155	91166	91167	91167	he	104	“ There ’s only enough there for one of us , ”
91170	91177	91167	91167	he	104	“ That ’s hardly one swallow . ”
91184	91196	91178	91178	They	2211	“ Which one will get you back through the purple flames ? ”
91211	91216	91218	91218	Harry	104	“ You drink that , ”
91220	91289	91218	91218	Harry	104	“ No , listen , get back and get Ron . Grab brooms from the flying - key room , they ’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore , we need him . I might be able to hold Snape off for a while , but I ’m no match for him , really . ”
91290	91305	91335	91335	Hermione	221	“ But Harry — what if You - Know - Who ’s with him ? ”
91306	91318	91320	91320	Harry	104	“ Well — I was lucky once , was n’t I ? ”
91327	91334	91320	91320	Harry	104	“ I might get lucky again . ”
91353	91356	91341	91341	she	221	“ Hermione ! ”
91357	91368	91320	91320	Harry	104	“ Harry — you’re a great wizard , you know . ”
91369	91378	91380	91380	Harry	104	“ I ’m not as good as you , ”
91392	91395	91397	91397	Hermione	221	“ Me ! ”
91399	91422	91397	91397	Hermione	221	“ Books ! And cleverness ! There are more important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — be careful ! ”
91423	91428	91430	91430	Harry	104	“ You drink first , ”
91432	91444	91430	91430	Harry	104	“ You are sure which is which , are n’t you ? ”
91445	91448	91452	91452	She	221	“ Positive , ”
91468	91474	91476	91476	Harry	104	“ It ’s not poison ? ”
91479	91488	91476	91476	Harry	104	“ No — but it ’s like ice . ”
91489	91499	91430	91430	Harry	104	“ Quick , go , before it wears off . ”
91500	91507	91476	91476	Harry	104	“ Good luck — take care . ”
91508	91511	91512	91512	Hermione	221	“ GO ! ”
91542	91547	91548	91548	he	104	“ Here I come , ”
91645	91648	91650	91650	Harry	104	“ You ! ”
91663	91666	91667	91667	he	175	“ Me , ”
91671	91684	91667	91667	he	175	“ I wondered whether I ’d be meeting you here , Potter . ”
91685	91692	91704	91704	his	175	“ But I thought — Snape — ”
91693	91696	91697	91697	Quirrell	175	“ Severus ? ”
91716	91762	91697	91697	Quirrell	175	“ Yes , Severus does seem the type , does n’t he ? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat . Next to him , who would suspect p - p - poor , st - stuttering P - Professor Quirrell ? ”
91780	91788	91697	91697	Quirrell	175	“ But Snape tried to kill me ! ”
91789	91865	91704	91704	his	175	“ No , no , no . I tried to kill you . Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match . She broke my eye contact with you . Another few seconds and I ’d have got you off that broom . I ’d have managed it before then if Snape had n’t been muttering a countercurse , trying to save you . ”
91866	91873	91697	91697	Quirrell	175	“ Snape was trying tosave me ? ”
91874	91878	91880	91880	Quirrell	175	“ Of course , ”
91883	91966	91880	91880	Quirrell	175	“ Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match ? He was trying to make sure I did n’t do it again . Funny , really … he need n’t have bothered . I could n’t do anything with Dumbledore watching . All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stopGryffindor from winning , hedid make himself unpopular … and what a waste of time , when after all that , I ’m going to kill you tonight . ”
91985	92022	91967	91967	Quirrell	175	“ You ’re too nosy to live , Potter . Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that , for all I knew you ’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone . ”
92023	92030	91880	91880	Quirrell	175	“ You let the troll in ? ”
92031	92132	91967	91967	Quirrell	175	“ Certainly . I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there ? Unfortunately , while everyone else was running around looking for it , Snape , who already suspected me , went straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death , that three headed dog did n’t even manage to bite Snape ’s leg off properly . Now , wait quietly , Potter . I need to examine this interesting mirror . ”
92153	92164	92165	92165	Quirrell	175	“ This mirror is the key to finding the Stone , ”
92175	92204	92169	92169	his	175	“ Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this … but he ’s in London … I ’ll be far away by the time he gets back … ”
92225	92235	92236	92236	he	104	“ I saw you and Snape in the forest — ”
92240	92243	92245	92245	Quirrell	175	“ Yes , ”
92258	92303	92245	92245	Quirrell	175	“ He was on to me by that time , trying to find out how far I ’d got . He suspected me all along . Tried to frighten me — as though he could , when I had Lord Voldemort on my side … ”
92318	92337	92304	92304	Quirrell	175	“ I see the Stone … I ’m presenting it to my master … but where is it ? ”
92365	92376	92352	92352	Hehad	104	“ But Snape always seemed to hate me so much . ”
92377	92383	92385	92385	Quirrell	175	“ Oh , he does , ”
92388	92417	92385	92385	Quirrell	175	“ heavens , yes . He was at Hogwarts with your father , did n’t you know ? They loathed each other . But he never wanted youdead . ”
92418	92437	92352	92352	Hehad	104	“ But I heard you a few days ago , sobbing — I thought Snape was threatening you … ”
92453	92456	92457	92457	he	175	“ Sometimes , ”
92460	92482	92457	92457	he	175	“ I find it hard to follow my master ’s instructions — he is a great wizard and I am weak — ”
92483	92495	92496	92496	Harry	104	“ You mean he was there in the classroom with you ? ”
92499	92508	92510	92510	Quirrell	175	“ He is with me wherever I go , ”
92513	92597	92510	92510	Quirrell	175	“ I met him when I traveled around the world . A foolish young man I was then , full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil . Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was . There is no good and evil , there is only power , and those too weak to seekit … Since then , I have served him faithfully , although I have let him down many times . He has had to be very hard on me . ”
92602	92641	92598	92598	Quirrell	175	“ He does not forgive mistakes easily . When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts , he was most displeased . He punished me … decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me … ”
92686	92703	92680	92680	Quirrell	175	“ I do n’t understand … is the Stoneinside the mirror ? Should I break it ? ”
92821	92838	92814	92814	He	175	“ What does this mirror do ? How does it work ? Help me , Master ! ”
92859	92868	92869	92869	Quirrell	175	“ Use the boy … Use the boy … ”
92874	92882	92883	92883	He	175	“ Yes — Potter — come here . ”
92904	92908	92909	92909	Quirrell	175	“ Come here , ”
92912	92924	92909	92909	Quirrell	175	“ Look in the mirror and tell me what you see . ”
93064	93067	93069	93069	Quirrell	175	“ Well ? ”
93072	93078	93069	93069	Quirrell	175	“ What do you see ? ”
93085	93094	93095	93095	he	104	“ I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore , ”
93098	93109	93095	93095	he	104	“ I — I’ve won the house cup for Gryffindor . ”
93114	93121	93122	93122	he	175	“ Get out of the way , ”
93169	93176	93162	93162	Quirrell	175	“ He lies … He lies … ”
93177	93184	93185	93185	Quirrell	175	“ Potter , come back here ! ”
93188	93200	93185	93185	Quirrell	175	“ Tell me the truth ! What did you just see ? ”
93207	93220	93185	93185	Quirrell	175	“ Let me speak to him … face - to - face … ”
93221	93230	93267	93267	Quirrell	175	“ Master , you are not strong enough ! ”
93231	93240	93241	93241	Harry	104	“ I have strength enough … for this … ”
93360	93364	93513	93514	the face	2221	“ Harry Potter … ”
93382	93389	93390	93391	the face	2221	“ See what I have become ? ”
93394	93485	93390	93391	the face	2221	“ Mere shadow and vapor … I have form only when I can share another ’s body … but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds … Unicorn blood has strengthened me , these past weeks … you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest … and once I have the Elixir of Life , I will be able to create a body of my own … Now … why do n’t you give me that Stone in your pocket ? ”
93504	93511	93513	93514	the face	2221	“ Do n’t be a fool , ”
93516	93544	93513	93514	the face	2221	“ Better save your own life and join me … or you ’ll meet the same end as your parents … They died begging me for mercy … ”
93545	93548	93549	93549	Harry	104	“ LIAR ! ”
93575	93579	93568	93570	The evil face	2223	“ How touching … ”
93583	93643	93568	93570	The evil face	2223	“ I always value bravery … Yes , boy , your parents were brave … I killed your father first ; and he put up a courageous fight … but your mother need n’t have died … she was trying to protect you … Now give me the Stone , unless you want her to have died in vain . ”
93644	93647	93648	93648	Harry	104	“ NEVER ! ”
93657	93660	93656	93656	Voldemort	116	screamed“SEIZE HIM ! ”
93759	93766	93768	93768	Voldemort	116	“ Seize him ! SEIZE HIM ! ”
93814	93829	93809	93809	Quirrell	175	“ Master , I can not hold him — my hands — my hands ! ”
93872	93883	93885	93885	Voldemort	116	“ Then kill him , fool , and be done ! ”
93911	93914	93898	93898	Harry	104	“ AAAARGH ! ”
94026	94033	94016	94016	Quirrell	175	“ KILL HIM ! KILL HIM ! ”
94047	94052	94053	94053	He	104	“ Harry ! Harry ! ”
94140	94146	94148	94148	Dumbledore	112	“ Good afternoon , Harry , ”
94159	94179	94150	94150	Harry	104	“ Sir ! The Stone ! It was Quirrell ! He ’s got the Stone ! Sir , quick — ”
94180	94195	94197	94197	Dumbledore	112	“ Calm yourself , dear boy , you are a little behind the times , ”
94199	94207	94197	94197	Dumbledore	112	“ Quirrell does not have the Stone . ”
94208	94217	94150	94150	Harry	104	“ Then who does ? Sir , I — ”
94218	94233	94234	94234	Harry	104	“ Harry , please relax , or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out . ”
94280	94288	94290	94290	Dumbledore	112	“ Tokens from your friends and admirers , ”
94294	94365	94290	94290	Dumbledore	112	“ What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret , so , naturally , the whole school knows . I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send youa toilet seat . No doubt they thought it would amuse you . Madam Pomfrey , however , felt it might not be very hygienic , and confiscated it . ”
94366	94375	94241	94241	He	104	“ How long have I been in here ? ”
94376	94401	94241	94241	He	104	“ Three days . Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round , they have been extremely worried . ”
94402	94409	94290	94290	Dumbledore	112	“ But sit , the Stone — ”
94410	94459	94241	94241	He	104	“ I see you are not to be distracted . Very well , the Stone . Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you . I arrived in time to prevent that , although you were doing very well on your own , I must say . ”
94460	94471	94241	94241	He	104	“ You got there ? You got Hermione ’s owl ? ”
94472	94517	94290	94290	Dumbledore	112	“ We must have crossed in midair . No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left . I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you . ”
94518	94523	94290	94290	Dumbledore	112	“ It was you . ”
94524	94533	94241	94241	He	104	“ I feared I might be too late . ”
94534	94551	94290	94290	Dumbledore	112	“ You nearly were , I could n’t have kept him off the Stone much longer — ”
94552	94590	94290	94290	Dumbledore	112	“ Not the Stone , boy , you — the effort involved nearly killed you . For one terrible moment there , I was afraid it had . As for the Stone , it has been destroyed . ”
94591	94594	94596	94596	Harry	104	“ Destroyed ? ”
94599	94607	94596	94596	Harry	104	“ But your friend — Nicolas Flamel — ”
94608	94616	94618	94618	Dumbledore	112	“ Oh , you know about Nicolas ? ”
94624	94655	94618	94618	Dumbledore	112	“ Youdid do the thing properly , did n’t you ? Well , Nicolas and I have had a little chat , and agreed it ’s all for the best . ”
94656	94671	94290	94290	Dumbledore	112	“ But that means he and his wife will die , wo n’t they ? ”
94672	94693	94694	94694	Dumbledore	112	“ They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then , yes , they will die . ”
94706	94813	94694	94694	Dumbledore	112	“ To one as young as you , I ’m sure it seems incredible , but to Nicolas and Perenelle , it really is like going to bed after a very , very long day . After all , to the well organized mind , death is but the next great adventure . You know , the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing . As much money and life as you could want ! The two things most human beings would choose above all — the trouble is , humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them . ”
94832	94835	94837	94837	Harry	104	“ Sir ? ”
94839	94866	94837	94837	Harry	104	“ I ’ve been thinking … sir — even if the Stone ’s gone , Vol — , I mean , You - Know - Who — ”
94867	94893	95050	95050	he	2226	“ Call him Voldemort , Harry . Always use the proper name for things . Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself . ”
94894	94927	95050	95050	he	2226	“ Yes , sir . Well , Voldemort ’s going to try other ways of coming back , is n’t he ? I mean , he has n’t gone , has he ? ”
94928	95034	95035	95035	Harry	104	“ No , Harry , he has not . He is still out there somewhere , perhaps looking for another body to share … not being truly alive , he can not be killed . He left Quirrell to die ; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies . Nevertheless , Harry , while you may only have delayed his returnto power , it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time — and if he is delayed again , and again , why , he may never return to power . ”
95051	95079	95050	95050	he	2226	said,“Sir , there are some other things I ’d like to know , if you can tell me … things I want to know the truth about … ”
95080	95084	95085	95085	Dumbledore	112	“ The truth . ”
95088	95142	95085	95085	Dumbledore	112	“ It is a beautiful and terrible thing , and should therefore be treated with great caution . However , I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to , in which case I beg you ’ll forgive me . I shall not , of course , lie . ”
95143	95177	95178	95178	Dumbledore	112	“ Well … Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me . But why would he want to kill me in the first place ? ”
95185	95246	95178	95178	Dumbledore	112	“ Alas , the first thing you ask me , I can not tell you . Not today . Not now . You will know , one day … put it from your mind for now , Harry . When you are older … I know you hate to hear this … when you are ready , you will know . ”
95258	95267	95178	95178	Dumbledore	112	“ But why could n’t Quirrell touch me ? ”
95268	95386	95387	95387	Dumbledore	112	“ Your mother died to save you . If there is one thing Voldemort can not understand , it is love . He did n’t realize that love as powerful as your mother ’s for you leaves its own mark . Not a scar , no visible sign … to have been loved so deeply , even though the person who loved us is gone , will give us some protection forever . It is in your very skin . Quirrell , full of hatred , greed , and ambition , sharing his soul with Voldemort , could not touch you for this reason . It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good . ”
95421	95435	95413	95413	he	104	said,“And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know who sent it to me ? ”
95436	95457	95458	95458	Dumbledore	112	“ Ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession , and I thought you might like it . ”
95463	95486	95458	95458	Dumbledore	112	“ Useful things … your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here . ”
95487	95494	95413	95413	he	104	“ And there ’s something else … ”
95495	95499	95413	95413	he	104	“ Fire away . ”
95500	95505	95458	95458	Dumbledore	112	“ Quirrell said Snape — ”
95506	95512	95413	95413	he	104	“ Professor Snape , Harry . ”
95513	95533	95413	95413	he	104	“ Yes , him — Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father . Is that true ? ”
95534	95563	95413	95413	he	104	“ Well , they did rather detest each other . Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy . And then , your father did something Snape could never forgive . ”
95564	95567	95458	95458	Dumbledore	112	“ What ? ”
95568	95574	95413	95413	he	104	“ He saved his life . ”
95575	95578	95413	95413	he	104	“ What ? ”
95579	95582	95584	95584	Dumbledore	112	“ Yes … ”
95587	95651	95584	95584	Dumbledore	112	“ Funny , the way people ’s minds work , is n’t it ? Professor Snape could n’t bear being in your father ’s debt … I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even . Then he could go back to hating your father ’s memory in peace … ”
95668	95678	95665	95665	he	104	“ And sir , there ’s one more thing … ”
95679	95684	95413	95413	he	104	“ Just the one ? ”
95685	95697	95413	95413	he	104	“ How did I get the Stone out of the mirror ? ”
95698	95847	95848	95848	He	2227	“ Ah , now , I ’m glad you asked me that . It was one of my more brilliant ideas , and between you and me , that ’s saying something . You see , only one who wanted tofind the Stone — find it , but not use it — would be able to get it , otherwise they ’d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life . My brain surprises even me sometimes … Now , enough questions . I suggest you make a start on these sweets . Ah ! Bettie Bott ’s Every Flavor Beans ! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one , and since then I ’m afraid I ’ve rather lost my liking for them — but I think I ’ll be safe with a nice toffee , do n’t you ? ”
95864	95869	95861	95861	he	2227	said,“Alas ! Ear wax ! ”
95885	95890	95891	95891	Harry	104	“ Just five minutes , ”
95894	95898	95891	95891	Harry	104	“ Absolutely not . ”
95899	95906	95861	95861	he	2227	“ You let Professor Dumbledore in … ”
95907	95924	95861	95861	he	2227	“ Well , of course , that was the headmaster , quite different . You needrest . ”
95925	95945	95891	95891	Harry	104	“ I am resting , look , lying down and everything . Oh , go on , Madam Pomfrey … ”
95946	95952	95953	95953	she	117	“ Oh , very well , ”
95956	95961	95963	95963	she	117	“ But five minutesonly . ”
95970	95973	95963	95963	she	117	“ Harry ! ”
96001	96019	95989	95989	she	221	“ Oh , Harry , we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore was so worried — ”
96020	96029	96031	96031	Ron	198	“ The whole school ’s talking about it , ”
96033	96037	96031	96031	Ron	198	“ Whatreally happened ? ”
96110	96117	96119	96119	Ron	198	“ So the Stone ’s gone ? ”
96122	96129	96119	96119	Ron	198	“ Flamel ’s just going todie ? ”
96130	96159	96172	96172	Ron	198	“ That ’s what I said , but Dumbledore thinks that — what was it?—‘to the well organized mind , death is but the next great adventure . ’ ”
96160	96170	96172	96172	Ron	198	“ I always said he was off his rocker , ”
96184	96192	96194	96194	Harry	104	“ So what happened to you two ? ”
96196	96205	96207	96207	Hermione	221	“ Well , I got back all right , ”
96209	96268	96207	96207	Hermione	221	“ I brought Ron round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew — he just said , ‘ Harry ’s gone after him , has n’t he ? ’ and hurtled off to the third floor . ”
96269	96279	96281	96281	Ron	198	“ D’you think he meant you to do it ? ”
96283	96293	96281	96281	Ron	198	“ Sending you your father ’s cloak and everything ? ”
96294	96297	96298	96298	Hermione	221	“ Well , ”
96299	96317	96281	96281	Ron	198	exploded,“if he did — I mean to say that ’s terrible — you could have been killed . ”
96318	96325	96327	96327	Harry	104	“ No , it is n’t , ”
96330	96430	96327	96327	Harry	104	“ He ’s a funny man , Dumbledore . I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance . I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here , you know . I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try , and instead of stopping us , he just taught us enough to help . I do n’t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked . It ’s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could … ”
96431	96443	96445	96445	Ron	198	“ Yeah , Dumbledore ’s off his rocker , all right , ”
96448	96498	96445	96445	Ron	198	“ Listen , you ’ve got to be up for the end of year feast tomorrow . The points are all in and Slytherin won , of course — you missed the last Quidditch match , we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good . ”
96508	96519	96520	96520	she	117	“ You ’ve had nearly fifteen minutes , now OUT , ”
96538	96547	96548	96548	he	104	“ I want to go to the feast , ”
96560	96568	96548	96548	he	104	“ I can , ca n’t I ? ”
96569	96581	96582	96582	she	117	“ Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go , ”
96602	96609	96582	96582	she	117	“ And you have another visitor . ”
96610	96615	96617	96617	Harry	104	“ Oh , good , ”
96619	96624	96625	96625	Hagrid	121	“ Who is it ? ”
96667	96678	96679	96679	he	121	“ It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault ! ”
96688	96751	96679	96679	he	121	“ I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy ! I told him ! It was the only thing he did n’t know , an ’ I told him ! Yeh could ’ve died ! All fer a dragon egg ! I ’ll never drink again ! I should be chucked out an ’ made ter live as a Muggle ! ”
96752	96755	96757	96757	Harry	104	“ Hagrid ! ”
96777	96808	96679	96679	he	121	“ Hagrid , he ’d have found out somehow , this is Voldemort we ’re talking about , he ’d have found out even if you had n’t told him . ”
96809	96815	96817	96817	Hagrid	121	“ Yeh could ’ve died ! ”
96819	96828	96817	96817	Hagrid	121	“ An ’ don ’ say the name ! ”
96829	96832	96833	96833	Harry	104	“ VOLDEMORT ! ”
96846	96891	96842	96842	he	121	“ I ’ve met him and I ’m calling him by his name . Please cheer up , Hagrid , we saved the Stone , it ’s gone , he ca n’t use it . Have a Chocolate Frog , I ’ve got loads … ”
96903	96914	96892	96892	Hagrid	121	said,“That reminds me . I ’ve got yeh a present . ”
96915	96926	96928	96928	Harry	104	“ It ’s not a stoat sandwich , is it ? ”
96940	96969	96934	96934	Hagrid	121	“ Nah . Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it . ’ Course , he shoulda sacked me instead — anyway , got yeh this … ”
97007	97036	97037	97037	Harry	104	“ Sent owls off ter all yer parents ’ old school friends , askin ’ fer photos … knew yeh didn ’ have any … d’yeh like it ? ”
97192	97197	97198	97198	Dumbledore	122	“ Another year gone ! ”
97202	97323	97198	97198	Dumbledore	122	“ And I must trouble you with an old man ’s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast . What a year it has been ! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were … you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts … Now , as I understand it , the house cup here needs awarding , and the points stand thus : In fourth place , Gryffindor , with three hundred and twelve points ; in third , Hufflepuff , with three hundred and fifty two ; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty six and Slytherin , four hundred and seventy - two . ”
97355	97365	97367	97367	Dumbledore	122	“ Yes , yes , well done , Slytherin , ”
97369	97380	97367	97367	Dumbledore	122	“ However , recent events must be taken into account . ”
97395	97398	97400	97400	Dumbledore	122	“ Ahem , ”
97402	97427	97400	97400	Dumbledore	122	“ I have a few last minute points to dish out . Let me see . Yes … First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley … ”
97445	97468	97435	97435	he	198	“ … for the best played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years , I award Gryffindor house fifty points . ”
97491	97509	97484	97484	Percy	195	prefects,“My brother , you know ! My youngest brother ! Got past McGonagall ’s giant chess set ! ”
97517	97544	97545	97545	Hermione	221	“ Second — to Miss Hermione Granger … for the use of cool logic in the face of fire , I award Gryffindor house fifty points . ”
97579	97587	97589	97589	Dumbledore	122	“ Third — to Mr. Harry Potter … ”
97596	97612	97589	97589	Dumbledore	122	“ … for pure nerve and outstanding courage , I award Gryffindor house sixty points . ”
97675	97683	97685	97685	Dumbledore	122	“ There are all kinds of courage , ”
97689	97725	97685	97685	Dumbledore	122	“ It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies , but just as much to stand up to our friends . I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom . ”
97834	97838	97839	97839	Dumbledore	122	“ Which means , ”
97859	97868	97869	97869	He	122	“ we need a little change of decoration . ”
98155	98167	98169	98170	Fred Weasley	196	“ I always hope they ’ll forget to give us these , ”
98306	98315	98317	98317	Ron	198	“ You must come and stay this summer , ”
98319	98330	98317	98317	Ron	198	“ both of you — I’ll send you an owl . ”
98331	98334	98336	98336	Harry	104	“ Thanks , ”
98338	98348	98336	98336	Harry	104	“ I ’ll need something to look forward to . ”
98370	98375	98365	98367	Some of them	2574	“ Bye , Harry ! ”

98383	98387	98389	98389	Ron	198	“ Still famous , ”
98395	98406	98408	98408	Harry	104	“ Not where I ’m going , I promise you , ”
98422	98434	98410	98410	He	104	“There he is , Mom , there he is , look ! ”
98453	98457	98458	98458	she	194	“ Harry Potter ! ”

98471	98484	98485	98486	Mrs. Weasley	327	“ Be quiet , Ginny , and it ’s rude to point . ”

98589	98597	98599	98600	Mrs. Weasley	327	“ You must be Harry ’s family ! ”
98602	98609	98611	98612	Uncle Vernon	125	“ In a manner of speaking , ”
98614	98627	98611	98612	Uncle Vernon	125	“ Hurry up , boy , we have n’t got all day . ”
