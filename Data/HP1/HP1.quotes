1084	1098	1080	1080	they	415	“ The Potters , that ’s right , that ’s what I heard — ”
1099	1108	1080	1080	they	415	“ — yes , their son , Harry — ”
1340	1343	1344	1344	he	96	“ Sorry , ”
1413	1457	1402	1402	he	435	“ Do n’t be sorry , my dear sir , for nothing could upset me today ! Rejoice , for You - Know - Who has gone at last ! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating , this happy , happy day ! ”
1600	1603	1605	1606	Mr. Dursley	96	“ Shoo ! ”
1692	1696	1668	1668	She	95	“ Wo n’t ! ”
1732	1798	1714	1714	he	96	“ And finally , bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nation ’s owls have been behaving very unusually today . Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight , there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise . Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern . ”
1806	1833	1802	1802	himself	96	“ Most mysterious . And now , over to Jim McGuffin with the weather . Going to be any more showers of owls tonight , Jim ? ”
1834	1839	1841	1842	the weatherman	448	“ Well , Ted , ”
1844	1928	1841	1842	the weatherman	448	“ I do n’t know about that , but it ’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today . Viewers as far apart as Kent , Yorkshire , and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday , they ’ve had a downpour of shootingstars ! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it ’s not until next week , folks ! But I can promise a wet night tonight . ”
2000	2019	1994	1994	He	96	“ Er — Petunia , dear — you have n’t heard from your sister lately , have you ? ”
2045	2048	2049	2049	she	95	“ No , ”
2053	2056	2049	2049	she	95	“ Why ? ”
2057	2064	2065	2066	Mr. Dursley	96	“ Funny stuff on the news , ”
2069	2088	2065	2066	Mr. Dursley	96	“ Owls … shooting stars … and there were a lot of funny looking people in town today … ”
2089	2092	2094	2095	Mrs. Dursley	95	“ So ? ”
2097	2119	2094	2095	Mrs. Dursley	95	“ Well , I just thought … maybe … it was something to do with … you know … her crowd . ”
2142	2145	2133	2133	he	96	“ Potter . ”
2163	2179	2154	2154	he	96	“ Their son — he’d be about Dudley ’s age now , would n’t he ? ”
2180	2185	2187	2188	Mrs. Dursley	95	“ I suppose so , ”
2191	2204	2187	2188	Mrs. Dursley	95	“ What ’s his name again ? Howard , is n’t it ? ”
2205	2218	2160	2160	he	96	“ Harry . Nasty , common name , if you ask me . ”
2219	2224	2226	2227	Mr. Dursley	96	“ Oh , yes , ”
2234	2241	2242	2242	He	96	“ Yes , I quite agree . ”
2774	2780	2769	2769	He	110	“ I should have known . ”
2954	2963	2949	2949	he	110	“ Fancy seeing you here , Professor McGonagall . ”
3034	3043	3044	3044	she	474	“ How did you know it was me ? ”
3047	3062	3044	3044	she	474	“ My dear Professor , I ’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly . ”
3063	3080	3082	3083	Professor McGonagall	111	“ You ’d be stiff if you ’d been sitting on a brick wall all day , ”
3085	3110	3082	3083	Professor McGonagall	111	“ All day ? When you could have been celebrating ? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here . ”
3116	3127	3128	3128	she	474	“ Oh yes , everyone ’s celebrating , all right , ”
3132	3163	3128	3128	she	474	“ You ’d think they ’d be a bit more careful , but no — even the Muggles have noticed something ’s going on . It was on their news . ”
3178	3224	3164	3164	She	474	“ I heard it . Flocks of owls … shooting stars … Well , they ’re not completely stupid . They were bound to notice something . Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle . He never had much sense . ”
3225	3232	3234	3234	Dumbledore	110	“ You ca n’t blame them , ”
3237	3249	3234	3234	Dumbledore	110	“ We ’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years . ”
3250	3255	3257	3258	Professor McGonagall	111	“ I know that , ”
3261	3296	3257	3258	Professor McGonagall	111	“ But that ’s no reason to lose our heads . People are being downright careless , out on the streets in broad daylight , not even dressed in Muggle clothes , swapping rumors . ”
3329	3370	3325	3325	she	474	“ A fine thing it would be if , on the very day You - Know - Who seems to have disappeared at last , the Muggles found out about us all . I suppose he reallyhas gone , Dumbledore ? ”
3371	3377	3379	3379	Dumbledore	110	“ It certainly seems so , ”
3381	3398	3379	3379	Dumbledore	110	“ We have much to be thankful for . Would you care for a lemon drop ? ”
3399	3402	3325	3325	she	474	“ Awhat ? ”
3403	3421	3436	3436	she	474	“ A lemon drop . They ’re a kind of Muggle sweet I ’m rather fond of . ”
3422	3428	3430	3431	Professor McGonagall	111	“ No , thank you , ”
3448	3462	3436	3436	she	474	“ As I say , even if You - Know - Whohas gone — ”
3463	3512	3513	3514	Professor McGonagall	111	“ My dear Professor , surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name ? All this ‘ You - Know - Who ’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name : Voldemort . ”
3532	3564	3518	3518	Dumbledore	110	“It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘ You - Know - Who . ’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort ’s name . ”
3565	3571	3574	3575	Professor McGonagall	111	“ I know you have n’t ”
3584	3611	3574	3575	Professor McGonagall	111	“ But you ’re different . Everyone knows you ’re the only one You Know — oh , all right , Voldemort , was frightened of . ”
3612	3617	3619	3619	Dumbledore	110	“ You flatter me , ”
3622	3631	3619	3619	Dumbledore	110	“ Voldemort had powers I will never have . ”
3632	3646	3518	3518	Dumbledore	110	“ Only because you ’re too — well — noble to use them . ”
3647	3672	3673	3674	Professor McGonagall	111	“ It ’s lucky it ’s dark . I have n’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs . ”
3682	3713	3673	3674	Professor McGonagall	111	said,“The owls are nothing next to therumors that are flying around . You know what everyone ’s saying ? About why he ’s disappeared ? About what finally stopped him ? ”
3773	3774	3756	3756	she	111	whatever“everyone ”
3807	3811	3812	3812	she	111	“ What they’resaying , ”
3814	3850	3851	3851	Dumbledore	110	on,“is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric ’s Hollow . He went to find the Potters . The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that they’re — dead . ”
3860	3883	3856	3857	Professor McGonagall	111	“ Lily and James … I ca n’t believe it … I did n’t want to believe it … Oh , Albus … ”
3894	3900	3901	3901	he	110	“I know … I know … ”
3915	3984	3905	3906	Professor McGonagall	111	“ That ’s not all . They ’re saying he tried to kill the Potter ’s son , Harry . But — he could n’t . He could n’t kill that little boy . No one knows why , or how , but they ’re saying that when he could n’t kill Harry Potter , Voldemort ’s power somehow broke — and that ’s why he ’s gone . ”
3989	3994	3996	3997	Professor McGonagall	111	“ It’s — it’strue ? ”
3999	4044	3996	3997	Professor McGonagall	111	“After all he ’s done … all the people he ’s killed … he could n’t kill a little boy ? It ’s just astounding … of all the things to stop him … but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive ? ”
4045	4051	4053	4053	Dumbledore	110	“ We can only guess , ”
4055	4061	4053	4053	Dumbledore	110	“ We may never know . ”
4140	4161	4132	4132	he	110	said,“Hagrid ’s late . I suppose it was he who told you I ’d be here , by the way ? ”
4162	4165	4167	4168	Professor McGonagall	111	“ Yes , ”
4170	4190	4167	4168	Professor McGonagall	111	“ And I do n’t suppose you ’re going to tell mewhy you ’re here , of all places ? ”
4191	4214	4132	4132	he	110	“ I ’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle . They ’re the only family he has left now . ”
4215	4228	4230	4231	Professor McGonagall	111	“ You do n’t mean — youcan’t mean the people who livehere ? ”
4243	4300	4230	4231	Professor McGonagall	111	“Dumbledore — you ca n’t . I ’ve been watching them all day . You could n’t find two people who are less like us . And they ’ve got this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street , screaming for sweets . Harry Potter come and live here ! ”
4301	4310	4312	4312	Dumbledore	110	“ It ’s the best place for him , ”
4315	4340	4312	4312	Dumbledore	110	“ His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he ’s older . I ’ve written them a letter . ”
4341	4345	4347	4348	Professor McGonagall	111	“ A letter ? ”
4358	4423	4347	4348	Professor McGonagall	111	“ Really , Dumbledore , you think you can explain all this in a letter ? These people will never understand him ! He ’ll be famous — a legend — I would n’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in thefuture — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know his name ! ”
4424	4427	4429	4429	Dumbledore	110	“ Exactly , ”
4443	4498	4429	4429	Dumbledore	110	“ It would be enough to turn any boy ’s head . Famous before he can walk and talk ! Famous for something he wo n’t even remember ! Ca n’t you see how much better off he ’ll be , growing up away from all that until he ’s ready to take it ? ”
4513	4534	4535	4535	She	111	said,“Yes — yes , you ’re right , of course . But how is the boy getting here , Dumbledore ? ”
4552	4558	4542	4542	she	111	“ Hagrid ’s bringing him . ”
4559	4576	4542	4542	she	111	“ You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this ? ”
4577	4586	4588	4588	Dumbledore	110	“ I would trust Hagrid with my life , ”
4590	4604	4606	4607	Professor McGonagall	111	“ I ’m not saying his heart is n’t in the right place , ”
4610	4630	4606	4607	Professor McGonagall	111	“ but you ca n’t pretend he ’s not careless . He does tend to — what was that ? ”
4790	4793	4795	4795	Dumbledore	110	“ Hagrid , ”
4800	4812	4795	4795	Dumbledore	110	“ At last . And where did you get that motorcycle ? ”
4813	4822	4824	4825	the giant	484	“ Borrowed it , Professor Dumbledore , sir , ”
4836	4852	4824	4825	the giant	484	“ Young Sirius Black lent it to me . I ’ve got him , sir . ”
4853	4860	4795	4795	Dumbledore	110	“ No problems , were there ? ”
4861	4897	4898	4898	Dumbledore	110	“ No , sir — house was almost destroyed , but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin ’ around . He fell asleep as we was flyin ’ over Bristol . ”
4947	4953	4955	4956	Professor McGonagall	111	“ Is that where — ? ”
4958	4961	4963	4963	Dumbledore	110	“ Yes , ”
4965	4973	4963	4963	Dumbledore	110	“ He ’ll have that scar forever . ”
4974	4985	5036	5036	Dumbledore	110	“ Could n’t you do something about it , Dumbledore ? ”
4986	5035	5036	5036	Dumbledore	110	“ Even if I could , I would n’t . Scars can come in handy . I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground . Well — give him here , Hagrid — we’d better get this over with . ”
5050	5064	5066	5066	Hagrid	119	“ Could I — could I say good bye to him , sir ? ”
5105	5108	5095	5095	Hagrid	119	“ Shhh ! ”
5113	5120	5110	5111	Professor McGonagall	111	“ you ’ll wake the Muggles ! ”
5121	5128	5130	5130	Hagrid	119	“ S - s - sorry , ”
5146	5174	5130	5130	Hagrid	119	“ But I c - c - can’t stand it — Lily an ’ James dead — an ’ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles — ”
5175	5201	5202	5203	Professor McGonagall	111	“ Yes , yes , it ’s all very sad , but get a grip on yourself , Hagrid , or we ’ll be found , ”
5301	5304	5306	5306	Dumbledore	110	“ Well , ”
5309	5331	5306	5306	Dumbledore	110	“ that ’s that . We ’ve no business staying here . We may as well go and join the celebrations . ”
5332	5335	5337	5337	Hagrid	119	“ Yeah , ”
5344	5365	5337	5337	Hagrid	119	“ I ’ll be takin ’ Sirius his bike back . G’night , Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore , sir . ”
5402	5415	5417	5417	Dumbledore	120	“ I shall see you soon , I expect , Professor McGonagall , ”
5512	5518	5519	5519	he	120	“ Good luck , Harry , ”
5684	5694	5666	5673	people meeting in secret all over the country	501	“ To Harry Potter — the boy who lived ! ”
5917	5925	5905	5905	her	107	“ Up ! Get up ! Now ! ”
5940	5943	5944	5944	she	2244	“ Up ! ”

6031	6034	6036	6036	Harry	102	“ Nearly , ”
6038	6073	6074	6074	Harry	102	“ Well , get a move on , I want you to look after the bacon . And do n’t you dare let it burn , I want everything perfect on Duddy ’s birthday . ”
6077	6083	6084	6085	his aunt	2244	“ What did you say ? ”
6091	6096	6084	6085	his aunt	2244	“ Nothing , nothing … ”
6429	6439	6440	6440	she	107	“ In the car crash when your parents died , ”
6444	6451	6440	6440	she	107	“ And do n’t ask questions . ”
6483	6488	6489	6489	he	123	“ Comb your hair ! ”
6672	6676	6677	6677	he	98	“ Thirty six , ”

6783	6809	6781	6781	she	107	quickly,“And we ’ll buy you anothertwo presents while we ’re out today . How ’s that , popkin?Two more presents . Is that all right ? ”
6825	6833	6823	6823	he	98	slowly,“So I ’ll have thirty … thirty … ”
6834	6840	6842	6843	Aunt Petunia	107	“ Thirty nine , sweetums , ”
6845	6848	6842	6843	Aunt Petunia	107	“ Oh . ”

7329	7340	7342	7343	Aunt Petunia	107	“ I suppose we could take him to the zoo , ”

Oh , she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that — thatschool — and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn , turning teacups into rats . I was the only one who saw her for what she was — a freak ! But for my mother and father , oh no , it was Lily this and Lily that , they were proud of having a witch in the family ! ”
16881	16943	16870	16870	she	804	“ Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you , and of course I knew you ’d be just the same , just as strange , just as — as — abnormal — and then , if you please , she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you ! ”

17260	17306	17307	17307	Hagrid	119	“ Gulpin ’ gargoyles , Harry , people are still scared . Blimey , this is difficult . See , there was this wizard who went … bad . As bad as you could go . Worse . Worse than worse . His name was … ”
17316	17323	17324	17324	Harry	102	“ Could you write it down ? ”
17327	17339	17324	17324	Harry	102	“ Nah ca n’t spell it . All right — Voldemort . ”
17343	17490	17340	17340	Hagrid	119	“Don’t make me say it again . Anyway , this — this wizard , about twenty years ago now , started lookin ’ fer followers . Got ’em , too — some were afraid , some just wanted a bit o ’ his power , ’cause he was gettin ’ himself power , all right . Dark days , Harry . Did n’t know who ter trust , did n’t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches … terrible things happened . He was takin ’ over . ’ Course , some stood up to him — an ’ he killed ’em . Horribly . One o ’ the only safe places left was Hogwarts . Reckon Dumbledore ’s the only one You - Know - Who was afraid of . Did n’t dare trytakin ’ the school , not jus ’ then , anyway . “
17561	17617	17618	17618	Hagrid	119	“ Maybe he thought he could persuade ’em … maybe he just wanted ’em outta the way . All anyone knows is , he turned up in the village where you was all living , on Halloween ten years ago . You was just a year old . He came ter yer house an’—an ’ — ”
17639	17642	17643	17643	he	119	“ Sorry , ”
17646	17671	17643	17643	he	119	“ But it ’s that sad — knew yer mum an ’ dad , an ’ nicer people yeh could n’t find — anyway … “
17853	17922	17929	17929	myself	0	” Something very painful was going on in Harry ’s mind . As Hagrid ’s story came to a close , he saw again the blinding flash of green light , more clearly than he had ever remembered it before — and he remembered something else , for the first time in his life : a high , cold , cruel laugh . Hagrid was watching him sadly . “
17942	17943	17937	17937	yeh	812	” “
17949	17989	17937	17937	yeh	812	” said Uncle Vernon . Harry jumped ; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there . Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage . He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched . “
17998	18002	17992	17992	you	812	” he snarled , “
18081	18113	18115	18115	you	812	” But at that moment , Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat . Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword , he said,“I’m
18127	18161	18119	18119	I’m	0	” In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant , Uncle Vernon ’s courage failed again ; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent . “
18166	18204	18119	18119	I’m	0	” said Hagrid , breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa , which this time sagged right down to the floor . Harry , meanwhile , still had questions to ask , hundreds of them . “
18223	18224	18214	18214	I	0	” “
18270	18349	18267	18267	he	158	“ Some say he died . Codswallop , in my opinion . Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die . Some say he ’s still out there , bidin ’ his time , like , but I don ’ believe it . People who was on his side came back ter ours . Some of ’em came outta kinda trances . Don ’ reckon they could ’ve done if he was comin ’ back . “
18413	18531	18532	18532	Hagrid	119	” Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes , but Harry , instead of feeling pleased and proud , felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake . A wizard ? Him ? How could he possibly be ? He ’d spent his life being clouted by Dudley , and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon ; if he was really a wizard , why had n’t they been turned into warty toads every time they ’d tried to lock him in his cupboard ? If he ’d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world , how come Dudley hadalways been able to kick him around like a football ? “
18534	18539	18532	18532	Hagrid	119	” he said quietly , “
18559	18567	18568	18570	Not a wizard	833	” To his surprise , Hagrid chuckled . “
18585	18714	18579	18579	you	119	” Harry looked into the fire . Now he came to think about it … every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he , Harry , had been upset or angry … chased by Dudley ’s gang , he had somehow found himself out of their reach … dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut , he ’d managed to make it grow back … and the very last time Dudley had hit him , had n’t he got his revenge , without even realizing he was doing it ? Had n’t he set a boa constrictor on him ? Harry looked back at Hagrid , smiling , and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him . “
18717	18721	18579	18579	you	119	” said Hagrid . “
18740	18754	18732	18732	you	102	” But Uncle Vernon was n’t going to give in without a fight . “
18765	18769	18757	18757	I	0	” he hissed . “
18803	18804	18784	18784	I	0	” “
18821	18825	18815	18815	you	0	” growled Hagrid . “
18906	18907	18903	18904	Albus Dumbled	159	” “
18923	18945	18903	18904	Albus Dumbled	159	” yelled Uncle Vernon . But he had finally gone too far . Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head,“NEVER
18947	18951	18903	18904	Albus Dumbled	159	” he thundered , “
18967	19087	19088	19088	Shouldn’ta	160	” He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet light , a sound like a firecracker , a sharp squeal , and the next second , Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom , howling in pain . When he turned his back on them , Harry saw a curly pig ’s tail poking through a hole in his trousers . Uncle Vernon roared . Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room , he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them . Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard . “
19093	19098	19088	19088	Shouldn’ta	160	” he said ruefully , “
19133	19146	19150	19150	yeh	844	” He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows . “
19160	19164	19150	19150	yeh	844	” he said . “
19215	19216	19205	19205	I	0	” “
19226	19230	19205	19205	I	0	” asked Harry . “
19283	19284	19281	19281	Dumbledore	154	” “
19290	19291	19292	19292	It	848	” “
19306	19311	19292	19292	It	848	” said Hagrid loudly . “
19327	19341	19342	19342	You	844	” He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry . “
19348	19352	19342	19342	You	844	” he said . “
19379	19379	19364	19364	I	0	”
19402	19408	19409	19409	he	102	“ It was a dream , ”
19414	19448	19409	19409	he	102	“ I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards . When I open my eyes I ’ll be at home in my cupboard . ”
19497	19501	19502	19502	Harry	102	“ All right , ”
19505	19511	19502	19502	Harry	102	“ I ’m getting up . ”
19629	19635	19636	19636	Harry	102	“ Do n’t do that . ”
19662	19665	19667	19667	Harry	102	“ Hagrid ! ”
19670	19676	19667	19667	Harry	102	“ There ’s an owl — ”
19677	19681	19682	19682	Hagrid	119	“ Pay him , ”
19688	19691	19682	19682	Hagrid	119	“ What ? ”
19692	19708	19709	19709	Hagrid	119	“ He wants payin ’ fer deliverin ’ the paper . Look in the pockets . ”
19748	19754	19756	19756	Hagrid	119	“ Give him five Knuts , ”
19759	19762	19756	19756	Hagrid	119	“ Knuts ? ”
19763	19769	19770	19770	Harry	102	“ The little bronze ones . ”
19819	19846	19847	19847	Harry	102	“ Best be off , Harry , lots ter do today , got ta get up ter London an ’ buy all yer stuff fer school . ”
19881	19886	19859	19859	He	102	“ Um — Hagrid ? ”
19887	19890	19892	19892	Hagrid	119	“ Mm ? ”
19902	19930	19892	19892	Hagrid	119	“ I have n’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night … he wo n’t pay for me to go and learn magic . ”
19931	19938	19940	19940	Hagrid	119	“ Do n’t worry about that , ”
19949	19960	19940	19940	Hagrid	119	“ D’yeh think yer parents did n’t leave yeh anything ? ”
19961	19969	19892	19892	Hagrid	119	“ But if their house was destroyed — ”
19970	20024	19892	19892	Hagrid	119	“ They didn ’ keep their gold in the house , boy ! Nah , first stop fer us is Gringotts . Wizards ’ bank . Have a sausage , they ’re not bad cold — an ’ I wouldn ’ say no teh a bit o ’ yer birthday cake , neither . ”
20025	20029	19940	19940	Hagrid	119	“ Wizards havebanks ? ”
20030	20041	20042	20042	Harry	102	“ Just the one . Gringotts . Run by goblins . ”
20052	20055	20042	20042	Harry	102	“ Goblins ? ”
20056	20121	20122	20122	Hagrid	119	“ Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an ’ rob it , I ’ll tell yeh that . Never mess with goblins , Harry . Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe—’cept maybe Hogwarts . As a matter o ’ fact , I got ta visit Gringotts anyway . Fer Dumbledore . Hogwarts business . ”
20128	20157	20124	20124	himself	119	“ He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him . Fetchin ’ you gettin ’ things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me , see . “
20167	20212	20042	20042	Harry	102	” Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock . The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight . The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there , with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm . “
20219	20229	20215	20215	you	119	” Harry asked , looking around for another boat . “
20232	20236	20215	20215	you	119	” said Hagrid . “
20239	20240	20318	20318	yeh	119	” “
20262	20282	20260	20260	yeh	119	” They settled down in the boat , Harry still staring at Hagrid , trying to imagine him flying . “
20291	20303	20260	20260	yeh	119	” said Hagrid , giving Harry another of his sideways looks . “
20327	20328	20318	20318	yeh	119	” “
20333	20368	20318	20318	yeh	119	” said Harry , eager to see more magic . Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again , tapped it twice on the side of the boat , and they sped off toward land . “
20380	20384	20371	20371	you	0	” Harry asked . “
20389	20400	20401	20401	They	854	” said Hagrid , unfolding his newspaper as he spoke . “
20458	20509	20453	20453	yer	119	” Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper , theDaily Prophet . Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this , but it was very difficult , he ’d never had so many questions in his life . “
20521	20529	20453	20453	yer	119	” Hagrid muttered , turning the page . “
20537	20547	20589	20589	he	163	” Harry asked , before he could stop himself . “
20551	20555	20589	20589	he	163	” said Hagrid . “
20602	20603	20589	20589	he	163	” “
20612	20613	20616	20616	their	858	” “
20641	20642	20630	20630	witches	2385	” “
20645	20646	20630	20630	witches	2385	” “
20671	20749	20753	20753	Harry	102	” At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall . Hagrid folded up his newspaper , and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street . Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station . Harry could n’t blame them . Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else , he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly , “
20763	20764	20765	20765	Hagrid	119	” “
20767	20781	20783	20783	you	119	” said Harry , panting a bit as he ran to keep up , “
20790	20791	20783	20783	you	119	” “
20798	20802	20795	20795	they	112	” said Hagrid . “
20811	20812	20813	20814	You’dlike one	862	” “
20816	20817	20813	20814	You’dlike one	862	” “
20831	20856	20828	20828	we	864	” They had reached the station . There was a train to London in five minutes ’ time . Hagrid , who did n’t understand “
20860	20904	20828	20828	we	864	” as he called it , gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets . People stared more than ever on the train . Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus tent . “
20912	20930	20910	20910	Harry	102	” he asked as he counted stitches . Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket . “
20933	20937	20910	20910	Harry	102	” said Hagrid . “
20948	21174	20945	20945	yeh	0	” Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he had n’t noticed the night before , and read : HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY UNIFORM First year students will require : 1 . Three sets of plain work robes ( black ) 2 . One plain pointed hat ( black ) for day wear 3 . One pair of protective gloves ( dragon hide or similar ) 4 . One winter cloak ( black , silver fastenings ) Please note that all pupils ’ clothes should carry name tags COURSE BOOKS All students should have a copy of each of the following : The Standard Book of Spells ( Grade 1 ) by Miranda Goshawk A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling A Beginners ’ Guide to Transfiguration by Emetic Switch One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander The Dark Forces : A Guide to Self Protection by Quentin Trimble OTHER EQUIPMENT 1 wand 1 cauldron ( pewter , standard size 2 ) set 1 set of glass or crystal phials 1 telescope set 1 brass scales Students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad PARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS “
21183	21188	20945	20945	yeh	0	” Harry wondered aloud . “
21196	21257	21190	21190	yeh	866	” said Hagrid . Harry had never been to London before . Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going , he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way . He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground , and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow . “
21269	21431	21263	21264	the Muggles	112	” he said as they climbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops . Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily ; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him . They passed book shops and music stores , hamburger restaurants and cinemas , but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand . This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people . Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them ? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks ? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up ? If Harry had n’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor , he might have thought so ; yet somehow , even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable , Harry could n’t help trusting him . “
21436	21445	21263	21264	the Muggles	112	” said Hagrid , coming to a halt , “
21456	21647	21650	21650	Hagrid	119	” It was a tiny , grubby looking pub . If Hagrid had n’t pointed it out , Harry would n’t have noticed it was there . The people hurrying by did n’t glance at it . Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they could n’t see the Leaky Cauldron at all . In fact , Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it . Before he could mention this , Hagrid had steered him inside . For a famous place , it was very dark and shabby . A few old women were sitting in a corner , drinking tiny glasses of sherry . One of them was smoking a long pipe . A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender , who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut . The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in . Everyone seemed to know Hagrid ; they waved and smiled at him , and the bartender reached for a glass , saying,“The
21652	21653	21650	21650	Hagrid	119	” “
21665	21684	21659	21659	I	0	” said Hagrid , clapping his great hand on Harry ’s shoulder and making Harry ’s knees buckle . “
21688	21697	21650	21650	Hagrid	119	” said the bartender , peering at Harry , “
21705	21717	21650	21650	Hagrid	119	” The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent . “
21722	21728	21650	21650	Hagrid	119	” whispered the old bartender , “
21736	21758	21729	21730	Harry Potter	102	” He hurried out from behind the bar , rushed toward Harry and seized his hand , tears in his eyes . “
21768	21829	21762	21763	Mr. Potter	102	” Harry did n’t know what to say . Everyone was looking at him . The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out . Hagrid was beaming . Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment , Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron . “
21846	21847	21851	21852	Mr. Potter	102	” “
21860	21861	21854	21854	I	0	” “
21875	21876	21869	21869	I’m	0	” “
21896	21897	21893	21894	Dedalus Diggle	113	” “
21904	21920	21921	21921	You	102	” said Harry , as Dedalus Diggle ’s top hat fell off in his excitement . “
21930	21931	21921	21921	You	102	” “
21935	21945	21932	21932	He	113	” cried Dedalus Diggle , looking around at everyone . “
21955	21990	21951	21951	He	113	” Harry shook hands again and again — Doris Crockford kept coming back for more . A pale young man made his way forward , very nervously . One of his eyes was twitching . “
21994	21998	21999	21999	Harry	102	” said Hagrid . “
22012	22013	22001	22002	Professor Quirrell	172	” “
22020	22030	22016	22018	P - Potter	173	” stammered Professor Quirrell , grasping Harry ’s hand , “
22048	22049	22046	22046	you	102	” “
22061	22062	22055	22055	you	172	” “
22075	22090	22067	22073	the D - D - Dark Arts	872	” muttered Professor Quirrell , as though he ’d rather not think about it . “
22109	22114	22103	22107	P - P - Potter	174	” He laughed nervously . “
22150	22197	22125	22125	I	0	” He looked terrified at the very thought . But the others would n’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself . It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all . At last , Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble . “
22211	22256	22209	22209	Harry	102	” Doris Crockford shook Harry ’s hand one last time , and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small , walled courtyard , where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds . Hagrid grinned at Harry . “
22289	22290	22283	22283	he	172	” “
22297	22298	22292	22292	he	172	” “
22378	22404	22332	22332	They	874	” Vampires ? Hags ? Harry ’s head was swimming . Hagrid , meanwhile , was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can . “
22411	22415	22332	22332	They	874	” he muttered . “
22423	22490	22421	22421	Harry	102	” He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella . The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle , a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid , an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight . “
22493	22497	22421	22421	Harry	102	” said Hagrid , “
22502	22572	22421	22421	Harry	102	” He grinned at Harry ’s amazement . They stepped through the archway . Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall . The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop . Cauldrons — All Sizes — Copper , Brass , Pewter , Silver — Self Stirring — Collapsible , said a sign hanging over them . “
22582	22586	22575	22575	you	102	” said Hagrid , “
22596	22656	22592	22592	yer	102	” Harry wished he had about eight more eyes . He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street , trying to look at everything at once : the shops , the things outside them , the people doing their shopping . A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed , saying,“Dragon
22668	22717	22664	22664	they	880	” A low , soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny , Screech , Barn , Brown , and Snowy . Several boys of about Harry ’s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it . “
22720	22728	22664	22664	they	880	” Harry heard one of them say , “
22738	22791	22664	22664	they	880	” There were shops selling robes , shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before , windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels ’ eyes , tottering piles of spell books , quills , and rolls of parchment , potion bottles , globes of the moon … “
22794	22830	22664	22664	they	880	” said Hagrid . They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops . Standing beside its burnished bronze doors , wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold , was — “
22838	22971	22835	22836	a goblin	881	” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him . The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry . He had a swarthy , clever face , a pointed beard and , Harry noticed , very long fingers and feet . He bowed as they walked inside . Now they were facing a second pair of doors , silver this time , with words engraved upon them : Enter , stranger , but take heedOf what awaits the sin of greed , For those who take , but do not earn , Must pay most dearly in their turn . So if you seek beneath our floorsA treasure that was never yours , Thief , you have been warned , bewareOf finding more than treasure there . “
22986	23074	22973	22973	I	0	” said Hagrid . A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall . About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter , scribbling in large ledgers , weighing coins in brass scales , examining precious stones through eyeglasses . There were too many doors to count leading off the hall , and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these . Hagrid and Harry made for the counter . “
23077	23085	22973	22973	I	0	” said Hagrid to a free goblin . “
23100	23101	23094	23096	Mr. Harry Potter	102	” “
23109	23110	23094	23096	Mr. Harry Potter	102	” “
23116	23169	23094	23096	Mr. Harry Potter	102	” said Hagrid , and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter , scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin ’s book of numbers . The goblin wrinkled his nose . Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals . “
23173	23193	23094	23096	Mr. Harry Potter	102	” said Hagrid at last , holding up a tiny golden key . The goblin looked at it closely . “
23201	23202	23094	23096	Mr. Harry Potter	102	” “
23216	23226	23213	23214	Professor Dumbledore	120	” said Hagrid importantly , throwing out his chest . “
23243	23251	23231	23231	You	885	” The goblin read the letter carefully . “
23255	23265	23231	23231	You	885	” he said , handing it back to Hagrid , “
23279	23314	23277	23277	Griphook	176	” Griphook was yet another goblin . Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets , he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall . “
23330	23334	23277	23277	Griphook	176	” Harry asked . “
23341	23346	23277	23277	Griphook	176	” said Hagrid mysteriously . “
23370	23567	23568	23568	I	0	” Griphook held the door open for them . Harry , who had expected more marble , was surprised . They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches . It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor . Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them . They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off . At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages . Harry tried to remember , left , right , right , left , middle fork , right , left , but it was impossible . The rattling cart seemed to know its own way , because Griphook was n’t steering . Harry ’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them , but he kept them wide open . Once , he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon , but too late — they plunged even deeper , passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor . “
23572	23584	23353	23353	Dumbledore	120	” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart , “
23596	23597	23353	23353	Dumbledore	120	” “
23608	23612	23353	23353	Dumbledore	120	” said Hagrid . “
23632	23711	23625	23625	I	0	” He did look very green , and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall , Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling . Griphook unlocked the door . A lot of green smoke came billowing out , and as it cleared , Harry gasped . Inside were mounds of gold coins . Columns of silver . Heaps of little bronze Knuts . “
23715	23789	23625	23625	I	0	” smiled Hagrid . All Harry’s — it was incredible . The Dursleys could n’t have known about this or they ’d have had it from him faster than blinking . How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep ? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him , buried deep under London . Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag . “
23796	23800	23353	23353	Dumbledore	120	” he explained . “
23842	23848	23840	23840	yeh	889	” He turned to Griphook . “
23865	23866	23840	23840	yeh	889	” “
23871	23947	23840	23840	yeh	889	” said Griphook . They were going even deeper now and gathering speed . The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners . They went rattling over an underground ravine , and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom , but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck . Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole . “
23951	23973	23840	23840	yeh	889	” said Griphook importantly . He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away . “
23995	23999	23983	23983	they	890	” said Griphook . “
24012	24016	24003	24003	you	891	” Harry asked . “
24023	24117	24003	24003	you	891	” said Griphook with a rather nasty grin . Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault , Harry was sure , and he leaned forward eagerly , expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty . Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor . Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat . Harry longed to know what it was , but knew better than to ask . “
24148	24224	24142	24142	I	0	” said Hagrid . One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts . Harry did n’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money . He did n’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he ’d had in his whole life — more money than even Dudley had ever had . “
24232	24246	24142	24142	I	0	” said Hagrid , nodding toward Madam Malkin ’s Robes for All Occasions . “
24274	24308	24268	24268	I	0	” He did still look a bit sick , so Harry entered Madam Malkin ’s shop alone , feeling nervous . Madam Malkin was a squat , smiling witch dressed all in mauve . “
24313	24323	24311	24311	dear	2213	” she said , when Harry started to speak . “
24341	24402	24311	24311	dear	2213	” In the back of the shop , a boy with a pale , pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes . Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him , slipped a long robe over his head , and began to pin it to the right length . “
24405	24410	24311	24311	dear	2213	” said the boy , “
24415	24416	24311	24311	dear	2213	” “
24419	24423	24311	24311	dear	2213	” said Harry . “
24442	24455	24433	24433	mother	900	” said the boy . He had a bored , drawling voice . “
24500	24508	24485	24485	I	0	” Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley . “
24515	24521	24511	24511	your	905	” the boy went on . “
24524	24528	24511	24511	your	905	” said Harry . “
24534	24535	24485	24485	I	0	” “
24538	24551	24552	24552	I	0	” Harry said again , wondering what on earth Quidditch could be . “
24589	24590	24573	24573	I	0	” “
24593	24604	24573	24573	I	0	” said Harry , feeling more stupid by the minute . “
24649	24650	24647	24647	you	0	” “
24653	24667	24668	24668	I	0	” said Harry , wishing he could say something a bit more interesting . “
24676	24711	24668	24668	I	0	” said the boy suddenly , nodding toward the front window . Hagrid was standing there , grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he could n’t come in . “
24716	24729	24730	24730	He	119	” said Harry , pleased to know something the boy did n’t . “
24735	24736	24730	24730	He	119	” “
24739	24744	24730	24730	He	119	” said the boy , “
24762	24763	24760	24760	he	119	” “
24769	24784	24764	24764	He	119	” said Harry . He was liking the boy less and less every second . “
24828	24829	24810	24810	he	119	” “
24836	24841	24810	24810	he	119	” said Harry coldly . “
24845	24855	24843	24843	you	0	” said the boy , with a slight sneer . “
24867	24868	24869	24869	They	2273	” “
24873	24892	24869	24869	They	2273	” said Harry shortly . He did n’t feel much like going into the matter with this boy . “
24897	24908	24869	24869	They	2273	” said the other , not sounding sorry at all . “
24918	24919	24916	24916	they	2273	” “
24934	24935	24931	24931	you	0	” “
25006	25015	25017	25017	you	0	” But before Harry could answer , Madam Malkin said,“That
25023	25045	25017	25017	you	0	” and Harry , not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy , hopped down from the footstool . “
25058	25087	25055	25055	I	0	” said the drawling boy . Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him ( chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts ) . “
25092	25096	25055	25055	I	0	” said Hagrid . “
25099	25140	25141	25141	Hagrid	119	” Harry lied . They stopped to buy parchment and quills . Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote . When they had left the shop , he said , “
25147	25148	25149	25149	Blimey	153	” “
25168	25169	25196	25196	he	928	” “
25177	25193	25196	25196	he	928	” said Harry . He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkin ’s . “
25209	25210	25196	25196	he	928	” “
25301	25302	25305	25305	Quidditch	179	” “
25307	25308	25305	25305	Quidditch	179	” “
25352	25353	25384	25384	I	0	” “
25361	25362	25359	25359	Hufflepuff	182	” “
25382	25383	25384	25384	I	0	” “
25391	25396	25386	25386	I	0	” said Harry gloomily . “
25402	25407	25400	25400	Slytherin	181	” said Hagrid darkly . “
25433	25434	25425	25425	You	947	” “
25448	25449	25439	25439	You	947	” “
25456	25583	25584	25584	I	0	” said Hagrid . They bought Harry ’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather ; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk ; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all . Even Dudley , who never read anything , would have been wild to get his hands on some of these . Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away fromCurses and Countercurses ( Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges : Hair Loss , Jelly Legs , Tongue - Tying and Much , Much More ) by Professor Vindictus Viridian . “
25595	25596	25584	25584	I	0	” “
25625	25629	25610	25610	yer	948	” said Hagrid . “
25657	25671	25676	25676	yer	948	” Hagrid would n’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron , either ( “
25678	25820	25822	25822	yer	948	” ) , but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope . Then they visited the Apothecary , which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell , a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages . Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor ; jars of herbs , dried roots , and bright powders lined the walls ; bundles of feathers , strings of fangs , and snarled claws hung from the ceiling . While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry , Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty one Galleons each and minuscule , glittery black beetle eyes ( five Knuts a scoop ) . Outside the Apothecary , Hagrid checked Harry ’s list again . “
25841	25848	25849	25849	You	0	” Harry felt himself go red . “
25855	25856	25849	25849	You	0	” “
25930	25992	26018	26018	Ollivander	185	” Twenty minutes later , they left Eeylops Owl Emporium , which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering , jewel bright eyes . Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl , fast asleep with her head under her wing . He could n’t stop stammering his thanks , sounding just like Professor Quirrell . “
25998	26003	26018	26018	Ollivander	185	” said Hagrid gruffly . “
26040	26199	26032	26032	yeh	948	” A magic wand … this was what Harry had been really looking forward to . The last shop was narrow and shabby . Peeling gold letters over the door readOllivanders : Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window . A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside . It was a tiny place , empty except for a single , spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait . Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library ; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling . For some reason , the back of his neck prickled . The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic . “
26203	26258	26032	26032	yeh	948	” said a soft voice . Harry jumped . Hagrid must have jumped , too , because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair . An old man was standing before them , his wide , pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop . “
26261	26266	26032	26032	yeh	948	” said Harry awkwardly . “
26270	26275	26032	26032	yeh	948	” said the man . “
26292	26299	26289	26290	Harry Potter	102	” It was n’t a question . “
26341	26363	26364	26364	Your	953	” Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry . Harry wished he would blink . Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy . “
26413	26440	26395	26396	your father	956	” Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose . Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes . “
26446	26464	26465	26465	I	0	” Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry ’s forehead with a long , white finger . “
26478	26483	26470	26470	I	0	” he said softly . “
26522	26538	26539	26539	Rubeus	119	” He shook his head and then , to Harry ’s relief , spotted Hagrid . “
26563	26564	26551	26551	Oak	186	” “
26572	26576	26568	26568	sir	2264	” said Hagrid . “
26596	26604	26609	26609	they	961	” said Mr. Ollivander , suddenly stern . “
26614	26622	26609	26609	they	961	” said Hagrid , shuffling his feet . “
26632	26637	26623	26623	I	0	” he added brightly . “
26643	26649	26639	26639	you	119	” said Mr. Ollivander sharply . “
26656	26674	26654	26654	sir	2264	” said Hagrid quickly . Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke . “
26677	26688	26654	26654	sir	2264	” said Mr. Ollivander , giving Hagrid a piercing look . “
26700	26715	26693	26694	Mr. Potter	102	” He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket . “
26722	26723	26693	26694	Mr. Potter	102	” “
26733	26737	26728	26728	I	0	” said Harry . “
26747	26780	26728	26728	I	0	” He measured Harry from shoulder to finger , then wrist to elbow , shoulder to floor , knee to armpit and round his head . As he measured , he said , “
26851	26886	26846	26847	another wizard	965	” Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure , which was measuring between his nostrils , was doing this on its own . Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves , taking down boxes . “
26891	26907	26846	26847	another wizard	965	” he said , and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor . “
26939	26968	26969	26969	Maple	187	” Harry took the wand and ( feeling foolish ) waved it around a bit , but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once . “
26982	27005	26846	26847	another wizard	965	” Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it , too , was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander . “
27034	27085	27086	27087	Tricky customer	966	” Harry tried . And tried . He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for . The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair , but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves , the happier he seemed to become . “
27129	27193	27104	27104	I	0	” Harry took the wand . He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers . He raised the wand above his head , brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework , throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls . Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried,“Oh
27219	27239	27104	27104	I	0	” He put Harry ’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper , still muttering , “
27244	27245	27104	27104	I	0	” “
27248	27252	27104	27104	I	0	” said Harry , “
27257	27267	27268	27268	I	0	” Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare . “
27334	27338	27328	27328	brother	968	” Harry swallowed . “
27402	27546	27359	27360	the wizard	958	” Harry shivered . He was n’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much . He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand , and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop . The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley , back through the wall , back through the Leaky Cauldron , now empty . Harry did n’t speak at all as they walked down the road ; he did n’t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground , laden as they were with all their funny shaped packages , with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry ’s lap . Up another escalator , out into Paddington station ; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder . “
27559	27591	27359	27360	the wizard	958	” he said . He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them . Harry kept looking around . Everything looked so strange , somehow . “
27602	27639	27598	27598	Yer	971	” said Hagrid . Harry was n’t sure he could explain . He ’d just had the best birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his hamburger , trying to find the words . “
27646	27652	27640	27640	Everyone	2222	” he said at last . “
27720	27740	27707	27707	Vol	158	” Hagrid leaned across the table . Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile . “
27810	27833	27834	27834	Yer	975	” Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys , then handed him an envelope . “
27839	27843	27834	27834	Yer	975	” he said . “
27888	28217	27886	27886	Harry	102	” The train pulled out of the station . Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight ; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window , but he blinked and Hagrid had gone . Harry ’s last month with the Dursleys was n’t fun . True , Dudley was now so scared of Harry he would n’t stay in the same room , while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon did n’t shut Harry in his cupboard , force him to do anything , or shout at him — in fact , they did n’t speak to him at all . Half terrified , half furious , they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty . Although this was an improvement in many ways , it did become a bit depressing after a while . Harry kept to his room , with his new owl for company . He had decided to call her Hedwig , a name he had found inA History of Magic . His school books were very interesting . He lay on his bed reading late into the night , Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased . It was lucky that Aunt Petunia did n’t come in to vacuum anymore , because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice . Every night before he went to sleep , Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall , counting down to September the first . On the last day of August he thought he ’d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King ’s Cross station the next day , so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television . He cleared his throat to let them know he was there , and Dudley screamed and ran from the room . “
28223	28233	28220	28221	Uncle Vernon	123	” Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening . “
28252	28258	28236	28236	I	0	” Uncle Vernon grunted again . “
28271	28280	28282	28282	you	123	” Grunt . Harry supposed that meant yes . “
28284	28298	28282	28282	you	123	” He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke . “
28321	28328	28319	28319	they	981	” Harry did n’t say anything . “
28336	28337	28338	28338	I	0	” “
28343	28367	28338	28338	I	0	” said Harry , realizing this for the first time . He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket . “
28384	28394	28368	28368	I	0	” he read . His aunt and uncle stared . “
28398	28399	28368	28368	I	0	” “
28406	28407	28368	28368	I	0	” “
28413	28418	28368	28368	I	0	” said Uncle Vernon . “
28429	28430	28368	28368	I	0	” “
28437	28438	28439	28439	Barking	190	” “
28441	28446	28453	28453	them	985	” said Uncle Vernon , “
28490	28491	28485	28485	I	0	” “
28499	28509	28494	28494	you	0	” Harry asked , trying to keep things friendly . “
28516	28521	28494	28494	you	0	” growled Uncle Vernon . “
28535	28713	28494	28494	you	0	” Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep . He got up and pulled on his jeans because he did n’t want to walk into the station in his wizard ’s robes — he’d change on the train . He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed , saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage , and then paced the room , waiting for the Dursleys to get up . Two hours later , Harry ’s huge , heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys ’ car , Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry , and they had set off . They reached King ’s Cross at half past ten . Uncle Vernon dumped Harry ’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him . Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead , facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face . “
28751	28792	28749	28749	they	992	” He was quite right , of course . There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it , and in the middle , nothing at all . “
28798	29102	28749	28749	they	992	” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile . He left without another word . Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away . All three of them were laughing . Harry ’s mouth went rather dry . What on earth was he going to do ? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks , because of Hedwig . He ’d have to ask someone . He stopped a passing guard , but did n’t dare mention platform nine and three - quarters . The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry could n’t even tell him what part of the country it was in , he started to get annoyed , as though Harry was being stupid on purpose . Getting desperate , Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock , but the guard said there was n’t one . In the end the guard strode away , muttering about time wasters . Harry was now trying hard not to panic . According to the large clock over the arrivals board , he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it;he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift , a pocket full of wizard money , and a large owl . Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do , like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley . He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector ’s stand between platforms nine and ten . At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying . “
29111	29182	28749	28749	they	992	” Harry swung round . The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys , all with flaming red hair . Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry ’s in front of him — and they had anowl . Heart hammering , Harry pushed his cart after them . They stopped and so did he , just near enough to hear what they were saying . “
29191	29198	28749	28749	they	992	” said the boys ’ mother . “
29205	29221	29222	29222	Mom	2338	” piped a small girl , also red headed , who was holding her hand , “
29229	29230	29226	29226	I	0	” “
29252	29320	29321	29321	Fred	193	” What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten . Harry watched , careful not to blink in case he missed it — but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms , a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away , the boy had vanished . “
29326	29332	29323	29323	you	0	” the plump woman said . “
29342	29347	29340	29340	George	194	” said the boy . “
29365	29366	29360	29360	youtell	994	” “
29373	29374	29369	29369	George	194	” “
29382	29457	29380	29380	Fred	193	” said the boy , and off he went . His twin called after him to hurry up , and he must have done so , because a second later , he had gone — but how had he done it ? Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there — and then , quite suddenly , he was n’t anywhere . There was nothing else for it . “
29461	29469	29380	29380	Fred	193	” Harry said to the plump woman . “
29474	29478	29472	29472	dear	2213	” she said . “
29490	29524	29484	29484	Ron	195	” She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons . He was tall , thin , and gangling , with freckles , big hands and feet , and a long nose . “
29527	29531	29484	29484	Ron	195	” said Harry . “
29547	29548	29540	29540	I	0	” “
29556	29565	29540	29540	I	0	” she said kindly , and Harry nodded . “
29570	29574	29540	29540	I	0	” she said . “
29633	29634	29631	29631	Ron	195	” “
29639	29919	29631	29631	Ron	195	” said Harry . He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier . It looked very solid . He started to walk toward it . People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten . Harry walked more quickly . He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he ’d be in trouble — leaning forward on his cart , he broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — he would n’t be able to stop — the cart was out of control — he was a foot away — he closed his eyes ready for the crash — It did n’t come … he kept on running … he opened his eyes . A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people . A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express , eleven o’clock . Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought iron archway where the barrier had been , with the wordsPlatform Nine and Three - quarters on it . He had done it . Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd , while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs . Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks . The first few carriages were already packed with students , some hanging out of the window to talk to their families , some fighting over seats . Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat . He passed a round faced boy who was saying,“Gran
29928	29929	29921	29921	I	0	” “
29934	29953	29932	29932	Neville	196	” he heard the old woman sigh . A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd . “
29964	30058	29932	29932	Neville	196	” The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms , and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long , hairy leg . Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train . He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door . He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot . “
30063	30079	29932	29932	Neville	196	” It was one of the red haired twins he ’d followed through the barrier . “
30084	30088	29932	29932	Neville	196	” Harry panted . “
30097	30119	29932	29932	Neville	196	” With the twins ’ help , Harry ’s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment . “
30122	30135	29932	29932	Neville	196	” said Harry , pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes . “
30140	30155	30156	30156	Blimey	153	” said one of the twins suddenly , pointing at Harry ’s lightning scar . “
30158	30164	30166	30166	you	153	” said the other twin . “
30168	30169	30170	30170	He	1002	” “
30173	30179	30170	30170	He	1002	” said the first twin . “
30184	30190	30182	30182	you	153	” he added to Harry . “
30193	30197	30182	30182	you	153	” said Harry . “
30201	30206	30198	30199	Harry Potter	102	” chorused the twins . “
30211	30215	30209	30209	him	1002	” said Harry . “
30224	30257	30221	30221	I	0	” The two boys gawked at him , and Harry felt himself turning red . Then , to his relief , a voice came floating in through the train ’s open door . “
30266	30267	30270	30270	Mom	2338	” “
30272	30325	30326	30326	Ron	195	” With a last look at Harry , the twins hopped off the train . Harry sat down next to the window where , half hidden , he could watch the red haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying . Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief . “
30336	30361	30326	30326	Ron	195	” The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way , but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose . “
30366	30371	30362	30362	Mom	2338	” He wriggled free . “
30383	30390	30375	30376	ickle Ronnie	195	” said one of the twins . “
30394	30398	30375	30376	ickle Ronnie	195	” said Ron . “
30403	30408	30401	30401	Percy	192	” said their mother . “
30414	30450	30409	30409	He	192	” The oldest boy came striding into sight . He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes , and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letterP on it . “
30458	30462	30456	30456	Mother	198	” he said . “
30477	30478	30475	30475	themselves	1005	” “
30487	30501	30482	30482	you	192	” said one of the twins , with an air of great surprise . “
30513	30514	30502	30502	You	192	” “
30528	30534	30522	30522	him	192	” said the other twin . “
30537	30538	30522	30522	him	192	” “
30542	30543	30522	30522	him	192	” “
30547	30548	30522	30522	him	192	” “
30552	30553	30522	30522	him	192	” “
30559	30565	30522	30522	him	192	” said Percy the Prefect . “
30575	30582	30568	30568	Percy	192	” said one of the twins . “
30588	30594	30584	30584	he	192	” said their mother fondly . “
30616	30634	30608	30608	me	0	” She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left . Then she turned to the twins . “
30664	30665	30657	30657	you’ve	1012	” “
30679	30680	30671	30671	We	1013	” “
30689	30690	30687	30687	Mom	2338	” “
30699	30700	30697	30697	Ron	195	” “
30712	30713	30705	30706	ickle Ronniekins	199	” “
30717	30744	30705	30706	ickle Ronniekins	199	” said Ron again . He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it . “
30761	30774	30775	30775	You	2338	” Harry leaned back quickly so they could n’t see him looking . “
30794	30795	30791	30791	he	1017	” “
30798	30799	30791	30791	he	1017	” “
30803	30812	30800	30801	Harry Potter	102	” Harry heard the little girl ’s voice . “
30832	30833	30827	30827	Mom	2338	” “
30867	30868	30870	30870	him	1017	” “
30884	30885	30886	30887	Poor dear	1024	” “
30913	30914	30904	30904	he	1017	” “
30933	30941	30942	30942	I	0	” Their mother suddenly became very stern . “
30972	30973	30955	30955	you	193	” “
30982	30987	30955	30955	you	193	” A whistle sounded . “
30991	31027	30955	30955	you	193	” their mother said , and the three boys clambered onto the train . They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good bye , and their younger sister began to cry . “
31041	31042	31043	31043	We	1027	” “
31052	31053	31054	31054	George	194	” “
31056	31057	31054	31054	George	194	” “
31063	31174	31061	31061	Mom	2338	” The train began to move . Harry saw the boys ’ mother waving and their sister , half laughing , half crying , running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed , then she fell back and waved . Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner . Houses flashed past the window . Harry felt a great leap of excitement . He did n’t know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind . The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in . “
31179	31190	31061	31061	Mom	2338	” he asked , pointing at the seat opposite Harry . “
31196	31238	31061	31061	Mom	2338	” Harry shook his head and the boy sat down . He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window , pretending he had n’t looked . Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose . “
31243	31249	31241	31241	Ron	195	” The twins were back . “
31272	31273	31262	31263	Lee Jordan	197	” “
31276	31280	31281	31281	Harry	102	” mumbled Ron . “
31283	31289	31291	31291	we	1029	” said the other twin , “
31314	31315	31309	31309	you	195	” “
31318	31334	31309	31309	you	195	” said Harry and Ron . The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them . “
31341	31349	31336	31336	you	102	” Ron blurted out . Harry nodded . “
31366	31370	31353	31353	I	0	” said Ron . “
31380	31402	31373	31373	you	102	” He pointed at Harry ’s forehead . Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar . Ron stared . “
31414	31415	31407	31407	You	102	” “
31418	31422	31407	31407	You	102	” said Harry , “
31430	31431	31424	31424	I	0	” “
31434	31439	31424	31424	I	0	” said Ron eagerly . “
31454	31455	31442	31442	I	0	” “
31458	31495	31442	31442	I	0	” said Ron . He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments , then , as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing , he looked quickly out of the window again . “
31502	31517	31498	31499	your family	1032	” asked Harry , who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him . “
31526	31530	31522	31522	I	0	” said Ron . “
31551	31552	31545	31545	we	1035	” “
31562	31583	31545	31545	we	1035	” The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about . “
31593	31597	31586	31586	you	0	” said Ron . “
31603	31604	31612	31612	them	112	” “
31632	31633	31628	31630	three wizard brothers	1039	” “
31636	31649	31628	31630	three wizard brothers	1039	” said Ron . For some reason , he was looking gloomy . “
31781	31799	31776	31776	Percy	192	” Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat , which was asleep . “
31842	31933	31839	31839	Scabbers	204	” Ron ’s ears went pink . He seemed to think he ’d said too much , because he went back to staring out of the window . Harry did n’t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl . After all , he ’d never had any money in his life until a month ago , and he told Ron so , all about having to wear Dudley ’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents . This seemed to cheer Ron up . “
31957	31961	31955	31955	Voldemort	114	” Ron gasped . “
31964	31968	31969	31969	You	0	” said Harry . “
31979	31989	31969	31969	You	0	” said Ron , sounding both shocked and impressed . “I’d
31998	31999	31992	31992	you	0	” “
32013	32017	32000	32000	I	0	” said Harry , “
32041	32060	32038	32038	I	0	” he added , voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately , “
32071	32072	32063	32063	I	0	” “
32094	32161	32063	32063	I	0	” While they had been talking , the train had carried them out of London . Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep . They were quiet for a time , watching the fields and lanes flick past . Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling , dimpled woman slid back their door and said,“Anything
32168	32340	32344	32344	you	1064	” Harry , who had n’t had any breakfast , leapt to his feet , but Ron ’s ears went pink again and he muttered that he ’d brought sandwiches . Harry went out into the corridor . He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys , and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry — but the woman did n’t have Mars Bars . What she did have were Bettie Bott ’s Every Flavor Beans , Drooble ’s Best Blowing Gum , Chocolate Frogs , Pumpkin Pasties , Cauldron Cakes , Licorice Wands , and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life . Not wanting to miss anything , he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts . Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat . “
32346	32347	32344	32344	you	1064	” “
32350	32388	32391	32391	I	0	” said Harry , taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty . Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it . There were four sandwiches inside . He pulled one of them apart and said,“She
32398	32399	32391	32391	I	0	” “
32407	32416	32391	32391	I	0	” said Harry , holding up a pasty . “
32420	32421	32391	32391	I	0	” “
32433	32437	32422	32422	You	1064	” said Ron . “
32445	32450	32391	32391	I	0	” he added quickly , “
32459	32460	32455	32457	five of us	1066	” “
32468	32521	32455	32457	five of us	1066	” said Harry , who had never had anything to share before or , indeed , anyone to share it with . It was a nice feeling , sitting there with Ron , eating their way through all Harry ’s pasties , cakes , and candies ( the sandwiches lay forgotten ) . “
32526	32539	32540	32540	They	1068	” Harry asked Ron , holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs . “
32548	32560	32455	32457	five of us	1066	” He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him . “
32563	32567	32455	32457	five of us	1066	” said Ron . “
32580	32581	32578	32578	Agrippa	208	” “
32584	32585	32578	32578	Agrippa	208	” “
32631	32683	32629	32629	Ptolemy	209	” Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card . It showed a man ’s face . He wore half - moon glasses , had a long , crooked nose , and flowing silver hair , beard , and mustache . Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore . “
32688	32692	32686	32686	Dumbledore	110	” said Harry . “
32704	32708	32702	32702	Dumbledore	110	” said Ron . “
32722	32815	32718	32718	Agrippa	208	” Harry turned over his card and read : ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times , Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945 , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon ’s blood , and his work on alchemy with his partner , Nicolas Flamel . Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling . Harry turned the card back over and saw , to his astonishment , that Dumbledore ’s face had disappeared . “
32820	32821	32816	32816	He	110	” “
32835	32839	32824	32824	you	0	” said Ron . “
32871	32887	32889	32889	yourself	0	” Ron ’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped . “
32891	32895	32889	32889	yourself	0	” said Harry . “
32913	32914	32916	32916	they	2211	” “
32927	32932	32920	32920	they	2211	” Ron sounded amazed . “Weird
32934	33035	33051	33051	they	1075	” Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile . Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards , but Harry could n’t keep his eyes off them . Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana , but Hengist of Woodcroft , Alberic Grunnion , Circe , Paracelsus , and Merlin . He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna , who was scratching her nose , to open a bag of Bertie Bott ’s Every Flavor Beans . “
33044	33049	33036	33036	You	1074	” Ron warned Harry . “
33098	33117	33089	33089	he	194	” Ron picked up a green bean , looked at it carefully , and bit into a corner . “
33124	33241	33089	33089	he	194	” They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans . Harry got toast , coconut , baked bean , strawberry , curry , grass , coffee , sardine , and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron would n’t touch , which turned out to be pepper . The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder . The neat fields had gone . Now there were woods , twisting rivers , and dark green hills . There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in . He looked tearful . “
33244	33248	33089	33089	he	194	” he said , “
33258	33266	33251	33251	you	1077	” When they shook their heads , he wailed,“I’ve
33277	33278	33270	33270	He	1078	” “
33284	33288	33279	33279	He	1078	” said Harry . “
33291	33297	33279	33279	He	1078	” said the boy miserably . “
33305	33309	33301	33301	you	1077	” He left . “
33319	33323	33314	33314	he	1078	” said Ron . “
33353	33364	33348	33348	I	0	” The rat was still snoozing on Ron ’s lap . “
33377	33383	33370	33370	you	1077	” said Ron in disgust . “
33411	33441	33404	33404	I	0	” He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered looking wand . It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end . “
33451	33491	33404	33404	I	0	” He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again . The toadless boy was back , but this time he had a girl with him . She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes . “
33503	33527	33498	33498	Neville	196	” she said . She had a bossy sort of voice , lots of bushy brown hair , and rather large front teeth . “
33539	33560	33528	33528	We	1080	” said Ron , but the girl was n’t listening , she was looking at the wand in his hand . “
33575	33585	33564	33564	you	1078	” She sat down . Ron looked taken aback . “
33591	33597	33564	33564	you	1078	” He cleared his throat . “Sunshine
33612	33629	33631	33631	you	1078	” He waved his wand , but nothing happened . Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep . “
33639	33644	33631	33631	you	1078	” said the girl . “
33755	33790	33791	33791	I	0	” She said all this very fast . Harry looked at Ron , and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he had n’t learned all the course books by heart either . “
33796	33800	33791	33791	I	0	” Ron muttered . “
33804	33808	33801	33802	Harry Potter	102	” said Harry . “
33813	33817	33818	33818	I	0	” said Hermione . “
33859	33860	33876	33876	you	1078	” “
33864	33871	33862	33862	I	0	” said Harry , feeling dazed . “
33892	33896	33890	33890	me	0	” said Hermione . “
33978	33990	33970	33970	I	0	” And she left , taking the toadless boy with her . “
34005	34018	33997	33997	I	0	” said Ron . He threw his wand back into his trunk . “
34036	34037	34022	34022	George	194	” “
34045	34049	34022	34022	George	194	” asked Harry . “
34052	34065	34022	34022	George	194	” said Ron . Gloom seemed to be settling on him again . “
34106	34107	34100	34100	they	1089	” “
34126	34127	34118	34118	You	0	” “
34130	34144	34118	34118	You	0	” said Ron . He flopped back into his seat , looking depressed . “
34161	34174	34148	34148	I	0	” said Harry , trying to take Ron ’s mind off houses . “
34190	34204	34205	34205	Charlie	203	” Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he ’d finished school . “
34222	34226	34213	34213	Bill	202	” said Ron . “
34262	34266	34253	34253	someone	700	” Harry stared . “
34274	34275	34253	34253	someone	700	” “
34346	34395	34337	34337	You	1097	” Harry turned this news over in his mind . He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You - Know - Who was mentioned . He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world , but it had been a lot more comfortable saying“Voldemort
34396	34400	34337	34337	You	1097	” without worrying . “
34408	34412	34337	34337	You	1097	” Ron asked . “
34421	34425	34415	34415	I	0	” Harry confessed . “
34428	34433	34337	34337	You	1097	” Ron looked dumbfounded . “
34448	34572	34337	34337	You	1097	” And he was off , explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players , describing famous games he ’d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he ’d like to get if he had the money . He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again , but it was n’t Neville the toadless boy , or Hermione Granger this time . Three boys entered , and Harry recognized the middle one at once : it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin ’s robe shop . He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he ’d shown back in Diagon Alley . “
34577	34581	34582	34582	They	1100	” he said . “
34605	34606	34600	34600	you	102	” “
34609	34645	34600	34600	you	102	” said Harry . He was looking at the other boys . Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean . Standing on either side of the pale boy , they looked like bodyguards . “
34656	34669	34654	34654	Goyle	220	” said the pale boy carelessly , noticing where Harry was looking . “
34679	34700	34708	34708	you	102	” Ron gave a slight cough , which might have been hiding a snigget . Draco Malfoy looked at him . “
34739	34746	34718	34719	My father	899	” He turned back to Harry . “You’ll
34780	34798	34799	34799	I	0	” He held out his hand to shake Harry ’s , but Harry did n’t take it . “
34814	34836	34801	34801	I	0	” he said coolly . Draco Malfoy did n’t go red , but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks . “
34848	34853	34846	34846	Potter	102	” he said slowly . “
34902	34910	34891	34892	that Hagrid	1111	” Both Harry and Ron stood up . “
34915	34927	34891	34892	that Hagrid	1111	” Ron said , his face as red as his hair . “
34940	34944	34938	34938	you	102	” Malfoy sneered . “
34951	34974	34946	34946	you	102	” said Harry , more bravely than he felt , because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron . “
35002	35117	34995	34995	you	102	” Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron leapt forward , but before he ’d so much as touched Goyle , Goyle let out a horrible yell . Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger , sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle ’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round , howling , and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window , all three of them disappeared at once . Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets , or perhaps they ’d heard footsteps , because a second later , Hermione Granger had come in . “
35123	35144	34995	34995	you	102	” she said , looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail . “
35153	35165	35145	35145	I	0	” Ron said to Harry . He looked closer at Scabbers . “
35181	35187	35174	35174	he	1114	” And so he had . “
35194	35204	35188	35188	You	0	” Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley . “
35212	35217	35205	35205	I	0	” said Ron darkly . “
35269	35275	35251	35251	He	1054	” He turned to Hermione . “
35283	35284	35285	35285	You	0	” “
35337	35338	35339	35339	Scabbers	204	” “
35347	35355	35339	35339	Scabbers	204	” said Ron , scowling at her . “
35364	35365	35357	35357	you	0	” “
35389	35397	35375	35376	people outside	1124	” said Hermione in a sniffy voice . “
35415	35494	35412	35412	you	0	” Ron glared at her as she left . Harry peered out of the window . It was getting dark . He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky . The train did seem to be slowing down . He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes . Ron ’s were a bit short for him , you could see his sneakers underneath them . A voice echoed through the train:“We
35522	35610	35658	35658	Firs	222	” Harry ’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron , he saw , looked pale under his freckles . They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor . The train slowed right down and finally stopped . People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny , dark platform . Harry shivered in the cold night air . Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students , and Harry heard a familiar voice:“Firs
35626	35639	35624	35624	Harry	102	” Hagrid ’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads . “
35664	35721	35658	35658	Firs	222	” Slipping and stumbling , they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep , narrow path . It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there . Nobody spoke much . Neville , the boy who kept losing his toad , sniffed once or twice . “
35737	35744	35658	35658	Firs	222	” Hagrid called over his shoulder , “
35752	35756	35658	35658	Firs	222	” There was a loud“Oooooh
35758	35802	35658	35658	Firs	222	” The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake . Perched atop a high mountain on the other side , its windows sparkling in the starry sky , was a vast castle with many turrets and towers . “
35810	35842	35843	35843	Everyone	2222	” Hagrid called , pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore . Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione . “
35846	35857	35843	35843	Everyone	2222	” shouted Hagrid , who had a boat to himself . “
35863	35918	35843	35843	Everyone	2222	” And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once , gliding across the lake , which was as smooth as glass . Everyone was silent , staring up at the great castle overhead . It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood . “
35922	35996	35843	35843	Everyone	2222	” yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff ; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face . They were carried along a dark tunnel , which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle , until they reached a kind of underground harbor , where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles . “
36007	36023	36024	36024	Trevor	223	” said Hagrid , who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them . “
36026	36085	36024	36024	Trevor	223	” cried Neville blissfully , holding out his hands . Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid ’s lamp , coming out at last onto smooth , damp grass right in the shadow of the castle . They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge , oak front door . “
36097	36111	36089	36089	You	2222	” Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door .
36152	36161	36163	36163	Hagrid	119	“ The firs ’ years , Professor McGonagall , ”
36165	36178	36179	36179	She	1132	“ Thank you , Hagrid . I will take them from here . ”
36312	36317	36319	36320	Professor McGonagall	111	“ Welcome to Hogwarts , ”
36322	36403	36319	36320	Professor McGonagall	111	“ The start of term banquet will begin shortly , but before you take your seats in the Great Hall , you will be sorted into your houses . The Sorting is a very important ceremony because , while you are here , your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts . You will have classes with the rest of your house , sleep in your house dormitory , and spend free time in your house common room . “
36493	36530	36531	36531	Her	1151	“ The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school . I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting . ”
36565	36576	36578	36579	Professor McGonagall	111	“ I shall return when we are ready for you , ”
36581	36586	36587	36587	She	1151	“ Please wait quietly . ”
36595	36605	36606	36606	he	102	“ How exactly do they sort us into houses ? ”
36610	36633	36606	36606	he	102	“ Some sort of test , I think . Fred said it hurts a lot , but I think he was joking . ”
36815	36820	36821	36821	He	102	“ What the — ? ”
36879	36895	36874	36877	a fat little monk	1164	saying:“Forgive and forget , I say , we ought to give him a second chance — ”
36896	36941	36942	36948	A ghost wearing a ruff and tights	1165	“ My dear Friar , have n’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves ? He gives us all a bad name and you know , he ’s not really even a ghost — I say , what are you all doing here ? ”
36959	36963	36965	36967	the Fat Friar	1167	“ New students ! ”
36974	36983	36965	36967	the Fat Friar	1167	“ About to be Sorted , I suppose ? ”
36990	36998	37000	37001	the Friar	1170	“ Hope to see you in Hufflepuff ! ”
37003	37011	37000	37001	the Friar	1170	“ My old house , you know . ”
37012	37017	36965	36967	the Fat Friar	1167	“ Move along now , ”
37023	37032	36965	36967	the Fat Friar	1167	“ The Sorting Ceremony ’s about to start . ”
37051	37058	37059	37060	Professor McGonagall	111	“ Now , form a line , ”
37066	37071	37059	37060	Professor McGonagall	111	“ and follow me . ”
37275	37294	37274	37274	Hermione	216	whisper,“It ’s bewitched to look like the sky outside . I read about it inHogwarts , A History . ”
37452	37651	37665	37665	It	1191	sing:“Oh , you may not think I ’m pretty , But do n’t judge on what you see , I’ll eat myself if you can findA smarter hat than me . You can keep your bowlers black , Your top hats sleek and tall , For I ’m the Hogwarts Sorting HatAnd I can cap them all . There ’s nothing hidden in your headThe Sorting Hat ca n’t see , So try me on and I will tell youWhere you ought to be . You might belong in Gryffindor , Where dwell the brave at heart , Their daring , nerve , and chivalrySet Gryffindors apart;You might belong in Hufflepuff , Where they are just and loyal , Those patient Hufflepuffs are trueAnd unafraid of toil;Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw , If you ’ve a ready mind , Where those of wit and learning , Will always find their kind;Or perhaps in SlytherinYou’ll make your real friends , Those cunning folk use any meansTo achieve their ends . So put me on ! Do n’t be afraid!And do n’t get in a flap!You’re in safe hands ( though I have none)For I ’m a Thinking Cap ! ”
37680	37692	37693	37693	Ron	195	“ So we ’ve just got to try on the hat ! ”
37698	37713	37693	37693	Ron	195	“ I ’ll kill Fred , he was going on about wrestling a troll . ”
37812	37834	37835	37835	she	111	“ When I call your name , you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted , ”
37838	37843	37835	37835	she	111	“ Abbott , Hannah ! ”

38528	38577	38513	38513	He	102	“ Difficult . Very difficult . Plenty of courage , I see . Not a bad mind either . There ’s talent , ah my goodness , yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself , now that ’s interesting … So where shall I put you ? ”
38594	38600	38592	38592	Slytherin	181	“ Not Slytherin , eh ? ”
38606	38656	38592	38592	Slytherin	181	“ Are you sure ? You could be great , you know , it ’s all here in your head , and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness , no doubt about that — no ? Well , if you ’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR ! ”
38724	38732	38721	38723	the Weasley twins	1216	yelled,“We got Potter ! We got Potter ! ”

39086	39089	39090	39090	he	110	“ Welcome , ”
39093	39130	39090	39090	he	110	“ Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts ! Before we begin our banquet , I would like to say a few words . And here they are : Nitwit ! Blubber ! Oddment ! Tweak ! “
39134	39155	39090	39090	he	110	” He sat back down . Everybody clapped and cheered . Harry did n’t know whether to laugh or not . “
39163	39169	39170	39170	Mad	250	” he asked Percy uncertainly . “
39172	39177	39170	39170	Mad	250	” said Percy airily . “
39202	39344	39200	39200	Harry	102	” Harry ’s mouth fell open . The dishes in front of him were now piled with food . He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table : roast beef , roast chicken , pork chops and lamb chops , sausages , bacon and steak , boiled potatoes , roast potatoes , fries , Yorkshire pudding , peas , carrots , gravy , ketchup , and , for some strange reason , peppermint humbugs . The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry , but he ’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked . Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted , even if it made him sick . Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat . It was all delicious . “
39350	39366	39200	39200	Harry	102	” said the ghost in the ruff sadly , watching Harry cut up his steak , “
39372	39373	39369	39369	you	102	” “
39384	39389	39374	39374	I	0	” said the ghost . “
39429	39430	39423	39427	Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower	1231	” “
39437	39442	39431	39431	I	0	” said Ron suddenly . “
39455	39456	39457	39457	I	0	” “
39468	39481	39463	39466	Sir Nicholas de Mimsy	251	” the ghost began stiffly , but sandy haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted . “
39491	39513	39487	39487	you	102	” Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed , as if their little chat was n’t going at all the way he wanted . “
39516	39587	39487	39487	you	102	” he said irritably . He seized his left ear and pulled . His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge . Someone had obviously tried to behead him , but not done it properly . Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces , Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck , coughed , and said,“So
39641	39697	39635	39635	he	1234	” Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there , with blank staring eyes , a gaunt face , and robes stained with silver blood . He was right next to Malfoy who , Harry was pleased to see , did n’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements . “
39706	39713	39714	39714	I	0	” asked Seamus with great interest . “
39719	39795	39635	39635	he	1234	” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately . When everyone had eaten as much as they could , the remains of the food faded from the plates , leaving them sparkling clean as before . A moment later the desserts appeared . Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of , apple pies , treacle tarts , chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts , trifle , strawberries , Jell - O , rice pudding — ”
39812	39821	39823	39823	Seamus	237	“ I ’m half - and - half , ”
39825	39856	39857	39858	The others	2493	“ Me dad ’s a Muggle . Mom did n’t tell him she was a witch ’ til after they were married . Bit of a nasty shock for him . ”
39861	39868	39870	39870	Ron	195	“ What about you , Neville ? ”
39872	39886	39888	39888	Neville	196	“ Well , my gran brought me up and she ’s a witch , ”
39890	40051	39888	39888	Neville	196	“ but the family thought I was all - Muggle for ages . My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once , I nearly drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight . Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner , and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go . But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road . They were all really pleased , Gran was crying , she was so happy . And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come , you see . Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad . ”
40067	40108	40058	40059	Percy Weasley	192	“ Ido hope they start right away , there ’s so much to learn , I ’m particularly interested in Transfiguration , you know , turning something into something else , of course , it ’s supposed to be very difficult ”
40110	40127	40058	40059	Percy Weasley	192	“ You ’ll be starting small , just matches into needles and that sort of thing — ”
40226	40229	40230	40230	Harry	102	“ Ouch ! ”
40238	40243	40245	40245	Percy	192	“ What is it ? ”
40247	40252	40245	40245	Percy	192	“ N - nothing . ”
40291	40301	40302	40302	he	102	“ Who ’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell ? ”
40306	40361	40302	40302	he	102	“ Oh , you know Quirrell already , do you ? No wonder he ’s looking so nervous , that ’s Professor Snape . He teaches Potions , but he does n’t want to — everyone knows he ’s after Quirrell ’s job . Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts , Snape . ”
40400	40429	40370	40370	Snape	258	“ Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered . I have a few start of term notices to give you . “
40462	40476	40477	40477	I	0	” Dumbledore ’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins . “
40505	40532	40486	40487	the caretaker	1248	“ Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term . Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch . “
40570	40584	40585	40585	He	0	” Harry laughed , but he was one of the few who did . “
40590	40596	40585	40585	He	0	” he muttered to Percy . “
40600	40608	40585	40585	He	0	” said Percy , frowning at Dumbledore . “
40654	40655	40644	40644	he	0	” “
40672	40735	40666	40666	us	1253	” cried Dumbledore . Harry noticed that the other teachers ’ smiles had become rather fixed . Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick , as if he was trying to get a fly off the end , and a long golden ribbon flew out of it , which rose high above the tables and twisted itself , snakelike , into words . “
40742	40746	40738	40738	their	2222	” said Dumbledore , “
40752	40892	40666	40666	us	1253	” And the school bellowed : Hogwarts , Hogwarts , Hoggy Warty Hogwarts , Teach us something please , Whether we be old and baldOr young with scabby knees , Our heads could do with fillingWith some interesting stuff , For now they ’re bare and full of air , Dead flies and bits of fluff , So teach us things worth knowing , Bring back what we ’ve forgot , Just do your best , we ’ll do the rest , And learn until our brains all rot . Everybody finished the song at different times . At last , only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march . Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished , he was one of those who clapped loudest . “
40897	40905	40666	40666	us	1253	” he said , wiping his eyes . “
40923	41065	40920	40920	you	1258	” The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds , out of the Great Hall , and up the marble staircase . Harry ’s legs were like lead again , but only because he was so tired and full of food . He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed , or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hangingtapestries . They climbed more staircases , yawning and dragging their feet , and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt . A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them , and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him . “
41068	41076	41077	41078	A poltergeist	1259	” Percy whispered to the first years . “
41080	41086	41077	41078	A poltergeist	1259	” He raised his voice , “
41092	41111	41090	41090	yourself	1260	” A loud , rude sound , like the air being let out of a balloon , answered . “
41123	41157	41113	41113	you	1260	” There was a pop , and a little man with wicked , dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared , floating cross - legged in the air , clutching the walking sticks . “
41160	41169	41113	41113	you	1260	” he said , with an evil cackle . “
41176	41187	41191	41191	Peeves	226	” He swooped suddenly at them . They all ducked . “
41204	41239	41194	41195	the Baron’ll	262	” barked Percy . Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished , dropping the walking sticks on Neville ’s head . They heard him zooming away , rattling coats of armor as he passed . “
41248	41258	41240	41240	You	1260	” said Percy , as they set off again . “
41284	41306	41307	41307	Password	263	” At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress . “
41309	41313	41307	41307	Password	263	” she said . “
41317	41441	41314	41315	Caput Draconis	264	” said Percy , and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall . They all scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room , a cozy , round room full of squashy armchairs . Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another . At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the towers — they found their beds at last : five four posters hung with deep red , velvet curtains . Their trunks had already been brought up . Too tired to talk much , they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed . “
41449	41458	41307	41307	Password	263	” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings . “
41469	41640	41463	41463	He	1266	” Harry was going to ask Ron if he ’d had any of the treacle tart , but he fell asleep almost at once . Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much , because he had a very strange dream . He was wearing Professor Quirrell ’s turban , which kept talking to him , telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once , because it was his destiny . Harry told the turban he did n’t want to be in Slytherin ; it got heavier and heavier ; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy , laughing at him ashe struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher , Snape , whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke , sweating and shaking . He rolled over and fell asleep again , and when he woke next day , he did n’t remember the dream at all .
41641	41646	41729	41729	they	1268	“ There , look . ”
41647	41650	41463	41463	He	1266	“ Where ? ”
41651	41662	41463	41463	He	1266	“ Next to the tall kid with the red hair . ”
41663	41668	41729	41729	they	1268	“ Wearing the glasses ? ”
41669	41676	41463	41463	He	1266	“ Did you see his face ? ”
41677	41684	41685	41685	Whispers	265	“ Did you see his scar ? ”
41978	41983	41995	41996	the caretaker	1248	“ GOT YOUR CONK ! ”
42504	42521	42522	42522	she	111	“ Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts , ”
42525	42544	42522	42522	she	111	“ Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back . You have been warned . ”
42912	42919	42920	42920	Harry	102	“ What have we got today ? ”
42931	42938	42940	42940	Ron	195	“ Double Potions with the Slytherins , ”
42942	42967	42940	42940	Ron	195	“ Snape ’s Head of Slytherin House . They say he always favors them — we’ll be able to see if it ’s true . ”
42968	42974	42976	42976	Harry	102	“ Wish McGonagall favored us , ”
43145	43193	43129	43129	Harry	102	“ Dear Harry , I know you get Friday afternoons off , so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three ? I want to hear all about your first week . Send us an answer back with Hedwig . Hagrid ”
43203	43223	43195	43195	Harry	102	“ Yes , please , see you later on the back of the note , and sent Hedwig off again ”
43370	43375	43376	43376	he	258	“ Ah , Yes , ”
43380	43389	43376	43376	he	258	“ Harry Potter . Our new — celebrity . ”
43445	43460	43461	43461	he	258	“ You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking , ”
43495	43587	43483	43483	Snape	258	“ As there is little foolish wand waving here , many of you will hardly believe this is magic . I do n’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes , the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins , bewitching the mind , ensnaring the senses … I can teach you how to bottle fame , brew glory , even stopper death — if you are n’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach . ”
43626	43629	43631	43631	Snape	258	“ Potter ! ”
43634	43652	43631	43631	Snape	258	“ What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood ? ”
43685	43693	43695	43695	Harry	102	“ I do n’t know , sir , ”
43705	43716	43717	43717	He	258	“ Tut , tut — fame clearly is n’t everything . ”
43723	43745	43717	43717	He	258	“ Let ’s try again . Potter , where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar ? ”
43797	43805	43789	43789	Goyle	220	“ I do n’t know , sir . ”
43806	43821	43822	43822	Harry	102	“ Thought you would n’t open a book before coming , eh , Potter ? ”
43869	43882	43860	43860	Snape	258	“ What is the difference , Potter , between monkshood and wolfsbane ? ”
43898	43904	43906	43906	Harry	102	“ I do n’t know , ”
43909	43924	43906	43906	Harry	102	“ I think Hermione does , though , why do n’t you try her ? ”
43948	43952	43953	43953	he	258	“ Sit down , ”
43958	44037	43953	43953	he	258	“ For your information , Potter , asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death . A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons . As for monkshood and wolfsbane , they are the same plant , which also goes by the name of aconite . Well ? Why are n’t you all copying that down ? ”
44053	44068	44052	44052	Snape	258	said,“And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek , Potter . ”
44236	44240	44242	44242	Snape	258	“ Idiot boy ! ”
44256	44272	44273	44273	Neville	196	“ I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire ? ”
44286	44295	44296	44296	Snape	258	“ Take him up to the hospital wing , ”
44317	44360	44307	44307	Ron	195	“ You — Potter — why did n’t you tell him not to add the quills ? Thought he ’d make you look good if he got it wrong , did you ? That ’s another point you ’ve lost for Gryffindor . ”
44381	44387	44388	44388	he	195	“ Do n’t push it , ”
44391	44401	44388	44388	he	195	“ I ’ve heard Snape can turn very nasty . ”
44447	44451	44453	44453	Ron	195	“ Cheer up , ”
44455	44475	44453	44453	Ron	195	“ Snape ’s always taking points off Fred and George . Can I come and meet Hagrid with you ? ”
44542	44548	44536	44536	Hagrid	119	saying,“Back , Fang — back . ”
44566	44570	44571	44571	he	119	“ Hang on , ”
44574	44578	44571	44571	he	119	“Back , Fang . ”
44639	44645	44647	44647	Hagrid	119	“ Make yerselves at home , ”
44678	44683	44684	44684	Harry	102	“ This is Ron , ”
44705	44711	44713	44713	Hagrid	119	“ Another Weasley , eh ? ”
44721	44737	44713	44713	Hagrid	119	“ I spent half me life chasin ’ yer twin brothers away from the forest . ”
44795	44799	44793	44793	Hagrid	119	Fitch“that old git . ”
44800	44852	44853	44853	Harry	102	“ An ’ as fer that cat , Mrs. Norris , I ’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime . D’yeh know , every time I go up ter the school , she follows me everywhere ? Ca n’t get rid of her — Fitch puts her up to it . ”
44883	44891	44861	44861	Hagrid	119	“ But he seemed to reallyhate me . ”
44892	44895	44897	44897	Hagrid	119	“ Rubbish ! ”
44899	44904	44897	44897	Hagrid	119	“ Why should he ? ”
44924	44931	44932	44932	Hagrid	119	“ How ’s yer brother Charlie ? ”
44936	44947	44932	44932	Hagrid	119	“ I liked him a lot — great with animals . ”
45051	45077	45079	45081	a Gringotts spokesgoblin	26	“ But we ’re not telling you what was in there , so keep your noses out if you know what ’s good for you , ”
45109	45112	45114	45114	Harry	102	“ Hagrid ! ”
45116	45136	45114	45114	Harry	102	“ that Gringotts break in happened on my birthday ! It might ’ve been happening while we were there ! ”
45390	45393	45395	45395	Harry	102	“ Typical , ”
45398	45419	45395	45395	Harry	102	“ Just what I always wanted . To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy . ”
45434	45448	45450	45450	Ron	195	“ You do n’t know that you ’ll make a fool of yourself , ”
45453	45479	45450	45450	Ron	195	“ Anyway , I know Malfoy ’s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch , but I bet that ’s all talk . ”
45880	45886	45887	45887	he	196	“ It ’s a Remembrall ! ”
45890	45926	45887	45887	he	196	“ Gran knows I forget things — this tells you if there ’s something you ’ve forgotten to do . Look , you hold it tight like this and if it turns red — oh … ”
45939	45946	45947	45947	Neville	196	“ … you ’ve forgotten something … ”
46016	46022	45995	45996	Professor McGonagall	111	“ What ’s going on ? ”
46023	46032	46035	46035	Malfoy	221	“ Malfoy ’s got my Remembrall , Professor . ”
46045	46049	46050	46050	he	221	“ Just looking , ”
46217	46227	46228	46228	she	260	“ Well , what are you all waiting for ? ”
46231	46244	46245	46245	Harry	102	“ Everyone stand by a broomstick . Come on , hurry up . ”
46266	46276	46278	46279	Madam Hooch	260	“ Stick out your right hand over your broom , ”
46284	46291	46278	46279	Madam Hooch	260	“ and say ‘ Up ! ’ ”
46292	46295	46296	46296	everyone	2222	“ UP ! ”
46424	46442	46444	46445	Madam Hooch	260	“ Now , when I blow my whistle , you kick off from the ground , hard , ”
46447	46477	46444	46445	Madam Hooch	260	“ Keep your brooms steady , rise a few feet , and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly . On my whistle — three — two — ”
46506	46512	46513	46513	she	260	“ Come back , boy ! ”
46618	46622	46625	46625	her	260	“ Broken wrist , ”
46628	46643	46625	46625	her	260	“ Come on , boy — it ’s all right , up you get . ”
46653	46697	46644	46644	She	260	“ None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing ! You leave those brooms where they are or you ’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘ Quidditch . ’ Come on , dear . ”
46735	46746	46730	46730	Malfoy	221	“ Did you see his face , the great lump ? ”
46753	46759	46747	46749	The other Slytherins	254	“ Shut up , Malfoy , ”
46764	46772	46774	46775	Pansy Parkinson	240	“ Ooh , sticking up for Longbottom ? ”
46783	46793	46777	46781	a hard faced Slytherin girl	1399	“ Never thoughtyou’d like fat little crybabies , Parvati . ”
46794	46797	46799	46799	Malfoy	221	“ Look ! ”
46811	46823	46799	46799	Malfoy	221	“ It ’s that stupid thing Longbottom ’s gran sent him . ”
46836	46843	46845	46845	Harry	102	“ Give that here , Malfoy , ”
46858	46878	46854	46854	Malfoy	221	“ I think I ’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about — up a tree ? ”
46879	46883	46884	46884	Harry	102	“ Give ithere ! ”
46918	46925	46926	46926	Harry	102	called,“Come and get it , Potter ! ”
46931	46934	46926	46926	Harry	102	“ No ! ”
46939	46954	46957	46957	her	216	“Madam Hooch told us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble . ”
47069	47074	47075	47075	Harry	102	“ Give it here , ”
47078	47088	47075	47075	Harry	102	“ or I ’ll knock you off that broom ! ”
47089	47094	47096	47096	Malfoy	221	“ Oh , yeah ? ”
47166	47180	47181	47181	Harry	102	“ No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck , Malfoy , ”
47193	47202	47203	47203	he	102	“ Catch it if you can , then ! ”
47324	47328	47309	47309	he	102	“ HARRY POTTER ! ”
47354	47364	47346	47346	He	102	“ Never — in all my time at Hogwarts — ”
47377	47386	47374	47374	her	111	furiously,“—howdare you — might have broken your neck — ”
47387	47396	47346	47346	He	102	“ It was n’t his fault , Professor — ”
47397	47404	47346	47346	He	102	“ Be quiet , Miss Patil . ”
47405	47409	47374	47374	her	111	“ But Malfoy — ”
47410	47423	47424	47424	Harry	102	“ That’senough , Mr. Weasley . Potter , follow me , now . ”
47655	47670	47651	47651	her	111	“ Excuse me , Professor Flitwick , could I borrow Wood for a moment ? ”
47714	47721	47723	47724	Professor McGonagall	111	“ Follow me , you two , ”
47740	47744	47745	47746	Professor McGonagall	111	“ In here . ”
47769	47774	47775	47775	she	111	“ Out , Peeves ! ”
47811	47827	47796	47797	Professor McGonagall	111	“ Potter , this is Oliver Wood . Wood — I’ve found you a Seeker . ”
47837	47844	47828	47828	Wood	281	“ Are you serious , Professor ? ”
47845	47848	47850	47851	Professor McGonagall	111	“ Absolutely , ”
47854	47880	47850	47851	Professor McGonagall	111	“ The boy ’s a natural . I ’ve never seen anything like it . Was that your first time on a broomstick , Potter ? ”
47918	47932	47933	47934	Professor McGonagall	111	“ He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty foot dive , ”
47938	47953	47954	47954	Wood	281	“ Did n’t even scratch himself . Charlie Weasley could n’t have done it . ”
47969	47979	47980	47980	he	281	“ Ever seen a game of Quidditch , Potter ? ”
47984	47993	47980	47980	he	281	“ Wood ’s captain of the Gryffindor team , ”
47998	48010	48012	48012	Wood	281	“ He ’s just the build for a Seeker , too , ”
48023	48052	48012	48012	Wood	281	“ Light — speedy — we’ll have to get him a decent broom , Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven , I ’d say . ”
48053	48104	48105	48106	Professor McGonagall	111	“ I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we ca n’t bend the first year rule . Heaven knows , we need a better team than last year . Flattened in that last match by Slytherin , I could n’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks … ”
48115	48137	48105	48106	Professor McGonagall	111	“ I want to hear you ’re training hard , Potter , or I may change my mind about punishing you . ”
48143	48151	48152	48152	she	111	“ Your father would have been proud , ”
48155	48164	48139	48139	she	111	“ He was an excellent Quidditch player himself . ”
48168	48171	48192	48193	Professor McGonagall	111	“ You’rejoking . ”
48217	48220	48221	48221	he	195	“ Seeker ? ”
48224	48238	48221	48221	he	195	“But first yearsnever — you must be the youngest house player in about — ”
48239	48244	48246	48246	Harry	102	“ — a century , ”
48265	48270	48271	48271	Ron	195	“ Wood told me . ”
48287	48294	48296	48296	Harry	102	“ I start training next week , ”
48298	48313	48296	48296	Harry	102	“ Only do n’t tell anyone , Wood wants to keep it a secret . ”
48331	48335	48337	48337	George	194	“ Well done , ”
48343	48357	48337	48337	George	194	“ Wood told us . We ’re on the team too — Beaters . ”
48358	48376	48378	48378	Fred	193	“ I tell you , we ’re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year , ”
48380	48416	48378	48378	Fred	193	“ We have n’t won since Charlie left , but this year ’s team is going to be brilliant . You must be good , Harry , Wood was almost skipping when he told us . ”
48417	48441	48337	48337	George	194	“ Anyway , we ’ve got to go , Lee Jordan reckons he ’s found a new secret passageway out of the school . ”
48442	48466	48467	48467	Fred	193	“ Bet it ’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week . See you . ”
48489	48508	48487	48487	Goyle	220	“ Having a last meal , Potter ? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles ? ”
48509	48533	48535	48535	Harry	102	“ You ’re a lot braver now that you ’re back on the ground and you ’ve got your little friends with you , ”
48574	48585	48587	48587	Malfoy	221	“ I ’d take you on anytime on my own , ”
48589	48623	48587	48587	Malfoy	221	“ Tonight , if you want . Wizard ’s duel . Wands only — no contact . What ’s the matter ? Never heard of a wizard ’s duel before , I suppose ? ”
48624	48630	48632	48632	Ron	195	“ Of course he has , ”
48637	48647	48632	48632	Ron	195	“ I ’m his second , who ’s yours ? ”
48659	48662	48663	48663	he	221	“ Crabbe , ”
48666	48685	48663	48663	he	221	“ Midnight all right ? We ’ll meet you in the trophy room ; that ’s always unlocked . ”
48699	48706	48708	48708	Harry	102	“What is a wizard ’s duel ? ”
48710	48722	48708	48708	Harry	102	“ And what do you mean , you ’re my second ? ”
48723	48737	48739	48739	Ron	195	“ Well , a second ’s there to take over if you die , ”
48763	48817	48759	48759	he	195	“ But people only die in proper duels , you know , with real wizards . The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do is send sparks at each other . Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage . I bet he expected you to refuse , anyway . ”
48818	48830	48759	48759	he	195	“ And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens ? ”
48831	48842	48843	48843	Ron	195	“ Throw it away and punch him on the nose , ”
48846	48850	48843	48843	Ron	195	“ Excuse me . ”
48861	48873	48875	48875	Ron	195	“ Ca n’t a person eat in peace in this place ? ”
48885	48898	48877	48877	Hermione	216	“ I could n’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying — ”
48899	48904	48905	48905	Ron	195	“ Bet you could , ”
48908	48948	48905	48905	Ron	195	“ — and youmustn’t go wandering around the school at night , think of the points you ’ll lose Gryffindor if you ’re caught , and you ’re bound to be . It ’s really very selfish of you . ”
48949	48959	48961	48961	Harry	102	“ And it ’s really none of your business , ”
48963	48968	48970	48970	Ron	195	“ Good - bye , ”
49027	49051	49017	49017	Ron	195	“ If he tries to curse you , you ’d better dodge it , because I ca n’t remember how to block them . ”
49120	49125	49126	49126	Ron	195	“ Half past eleven , ”
49131	49137	49126	49126	Ron	195	“ we ’d better go . ”
49202	49215	49291	49291	he	102	them,“I ca n’t believe you ’re going to do this , Harry . ”
49234	49237	49239	49239	Ron	195	“ You ! ”
49242	49247	49239	49239	Ron	195	“Go back to bed ! ”
49248	49255	49256	49256	Hermione	216	“ I almost told your brother , ”
49259	49275	49256	49256	Hermione	216	“ Percy — he ’s a prefect , he ’d put a stop to this . ”
49286	49290	49291	49291	he	102	“ Come on , ”
49337	49379	49321	49321	She	216	“ Do n’t youcare about Gryffindor , do youonly care about yourselves , I do n’t want Slytherin to win the house cup , and you ’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells . ”
49380	49384	49321	49321	She	216	“ Go away . ”
49385	49413	49321	49321	She	216	“ All right , but I warned you , you just remember what I said when you ’re on the train home tomorrow , you ’re so — ”
49465	49474	49475	49475	she	216	“ Now what am I going to do ? ”
49479	49485	49487	49487	Ron	195	“ That ’s your problem , ”
49489	49503	49487	49487	Ron	195	“ We ’ve got to go , we ’re going to be late . ”
49521	49528	49529	49529	she	216	“ I ’m coming with you , ”
49532	49537	49529	49529	she	216	“ You are not . ”
49538	49585	49487	49487	Ron	195	“ D’you think I ’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me ? If he finds all three of us I ’ll tell him the truth , that I was trying to stop you , and you can back me up . ”
49586	49593	49595	49595	Ron	195	“ You ’ve got some nerve — ”
49598	49606	49608	49608	Harry	102	“ Shut up , both of you ! ”
49611	49616	49608	49608	Harry	102	“ I heard something . ”
49624	49628	49630	49630	Ron	195	“ Mrs. Norris ? ”
49667	49695	49647	49647	He	196	“ Thank goodness you found me ! I ’ve been out here for hours , I could n’t remember the new password to get in to bed . ”
49696	49727	49736	49736	Harry	102	“ Keep your voice down , Neville . The password ’s ‘ Pig snout ’ but it wo n’t help you now , the Fat Lady ’s gone off somewhere . ”
49728	49734	49736	49736	Harry	102	“ How ’s your arm ? ”
49738	49741	49743	49743	Neville	196	“ Fine , ”
49748	49758	49743	49743	Neville	196	“ Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute . ”
49759	49781	49736	49736	Harry	102	“ Good — well , look , Neville , we ’ve got to be somewhere , we ’ll see you later — ”
49782	49788	49790	49790	Neville	196	“ Do n’t leave me ! ”
49797	49816	49790	49790	Neville	196	“ I do n’t want to stay here alone , the Bloody Baron ’s been past twice already . ”
49831	49864	49817	49817	Ron	195	“ If either of you get us caught , I ’ll never rest until I ’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about , and used it on you . ”
50020	50031	50032	50032	Ron	195	“ He ’s late , maybe he ’s chickened out , ”
50064	50079	50056	50056	someone	700	“ Sniff around , my sweet , they might be lurking in a corner . ”
50137	50144	50147	50147	him	266	“ They ’re in here somewhere , ”
50150	50154	50147	50147	him	266	“ probably hiding . ”
50155	50159	50160	50160	Harry	102	“ This way ! ”
50236	50239	50240	50240	Harry	102	“ RUN ! ”
50327	50335	50336	50336	Harry	102	“ I think we ’ve lost him , ”
50358	50365	50349	50349	Neville	196	“ I — told — you , ”
50377	50384	50349	50349	Neville	196	“ I — told — you . ”
50385	50396	50398	50398	Ron	195	“ We ’ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower , ”
50400	50405	50398	50398	Ron	195	“ quickly as possible . ”
50406	50411	50412	50412	Hermione	216	“ Malfoy tricked you , ”
50417	50453	50412	50412	Hermione	216	“ You realize that , do n’t you ? He was never going to meet you — Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room , Malfoy must have tipped him off . ”
50471	50476	50462	50462	he	102	“ Let ’s go . ”
50528	50542	50543	50543	Peeves	226	“ Shut up , Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown out . ”
50546	50570	50543	50543	Peeves	226	“ Wandering around at midnight , Ickle Firsties ? Tut , tut , tut . Naughty , naughty , you ’ll get caughty . ”
50571	50585	50516	50516	He	226	“ Not if you do n’t give us away , Peeves , please . ”
50586	50594	50596	50596	Peeves	226	“ Should tell Filch , I should , ”
50608	50619	50603	50603	his	226	“ It ’s for your own good , you know . ”
50620	50627	50629	50629	Ron	195	“ Get out of the way , ”
50642	50648	50649	50649	Peeves	226	“ STUDENTS OUT OF BED ! ”
50652	50662	50649	50649	Peeves	226	“ STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR — ”
50692	50697	50698	50698	Ron	195	“ This is it ! ”
50709	50720	50698	50698	Ron	195	“ We ’re done for ! This is the end ! ”
50738	50744	50731	50731	he	266	“ Oh , move over , ”
50759	50761	50748	50748	She	216	whispered,“Alohomora ! ”
50789	50798	50799	50799	Filch	266	“ Which way did they go , Peeves ? ”
50803	50809	50799	50799	Filch	266	“ Quick , tell me . ”
50810	50816	50848	50848	his	226	“ Say ‘ please . ’ ”
50817	50831	50848	50848	his	226	“ Do n’t mess with me , Peeves , nowwhere did they go ? ”
50832	50844	50846	50846	Peeves	226	“ Sha n’t say nothing if you do n’t say please , ”
50853	50859	50846	50846	Peeves	226	“ All right — please . ”
50860	50885	50848	50848	his	226	“ NOTHING ! Ha haaa ! Told you I would n’t say nothing if you did n’t say please ! Ha ha ! Haaaaaa ! ”
50901	50909	50910	50910	Harry	102	“ He thinks this door is locked , ”
50913	50925	50910	50910	Harry	102	“ I think we ’ll be okay — getoff , Neville ! ”
50943	50945	50927	50927	Neville	196	“What ? ”
51237	51246	51247	51247	she	1472	“ Where on earth have you all been ? ”
51265	51276	51278	51278	Harry	102	“ Never mind that — pig snout , pig snout , ”
51324	51344	51346	51346	Ron	195	“ What do they think they ’re doing , keeping a thing like that locked up in a school ? ”
51349	51360	51346	51346	Ron	195	“ If any dog needs exercise , that one does . ”
51374	51388	51389	51389	she	1472	“You do n’t use your eyes , any of you , do you ? ”
51392	51403	51389	51389	she	1472	“ Did n’t you see what it was standing on . ”
51404	51408	51409	51409	Harry	102	“ The floor ? ”
51412	51429	51409	51409	Harry	102	“ I was n’t looking at its feet , I was too busy with its heads . ”
51430	51450	51451	51451	She	1472	“ No , not the floor . It was standing on a trapdoor . It ’s obviously guarding something . ”
51459	51494	51451	51451	She	1472	“ I hope you ’re pleased with yourselves . We could all have been killed — or worse , expelled . Now , if you do n’t mind , I ’m going to bed . ”
51504	51512	51513	51513	he	102	“ No , we do n’t mind , ”
51516	51529	51513	51513	he	102	“ You ’d think we dragged her along , would n’t you . ”
51695	51705	51707	51707	Ron	195	“ It ’s either really valuable or really dangerous , ”
51709	51713	51715	51715	Harry	102	“ Or both , ”
51951	52009	52018	52018	he	102	“ DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE . It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand , but I do n’t want everybody knowing you ’ve got a broomstick or they ’ll all want one . Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session . Professor McGonagall ”
52027	52033	52034	52034	Ron	195	“ A Nimbus Two Thousand ! ”
52038	52045	52034	52034	Ron	195	“ I ’ve never eventouched one . ”
52091	52097	52098	52098	he	221	“ That ’s a broomstick , ”
52117	52136	52098	52098	he	221	“ You ’ll be in for it this time , Potter , first years are n’t allowed them . ”
52143	52151	52152	52152	he	195	“ It ’s not any old broomstick , ”
52155	52180	52181	52181	Ron	195	“ it ’s a Nimbus Two Thousand . What did you say you ’ve got at home , Malfoy , a Comet Two Sixty ? ”
52186	52203	52181	52181	Ron	195	“ Comets look flashy , but they ’re not in the same league as the Nimbus . ”
52204	52222	52223	52223	Malfoy	221	“ What would you know about it , Weasley , you could n’t afford half the handle , ”
52227	52242	52223	52223	Malfoy	221	“ I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig . ”
52256	52265	52266	52266	he	272	“ Not arguing , I hope , boys ? ”
52269	52279	52281	52281	Malfoy	221	“ Potter ’s been sent a broomstick , Professor , ”
52284	52293	52295	52296	Professor Flitwick	272	“ Yes , yes , that ’s right , ”
52302	52321	52295	52296	Professor Flitwick	272	“ Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances , Potter . And what model is it ? ”
52322	52330	52332	52332	Harry	102	“ A Nimbus Two Thousand , sir , ”
52348	52363	52364	52364	he	102	“ And it ’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I ’ve got it , ”
52384	52391	52392	52392	Harry	102	“ Well , it ’s true , ”
52404	52420	52392	52392	Harry	102	“ If he had n’t stolen Neville ’s Remembrall I wouln’t be on the team … ”
52421	52435	52445	52445	Hermione	216	“ So I suppose you think that ’s a reward for breaking rules ? ”
52462	52472	52474	52474	Harry	102	“ I thought you were n’t speaking to us ? ”
52476	52484	52486	52486	Ron	195	“ Yes , do n’t stop now , ”
52488	52497	52486	52486	Ron	195	“ it ’s doing us so much good . ”
52585	52588	52589	52589	Ron	195	“ Wow , ”
52795	52803	52804	52805	Oliver Wood	281	“ Hey , Potter , come down ! ”
52826	52830	52832	52832	Wood	281	“ Very nice , ”
52838	52875	52876	52876	He	281	“ I see what McGonagall meant … you really are a natural . I ’m just going to teach you the rules this evening , then you ’ll be joining team practice three times a week . ”
52888	52891	52893	52893	Wood	281	“ Right , ”
52895	52930	52893	52893	Wood	281	“ Now , Quidditch is easy enough to understand , even if it ’s not too easy to play . There are seven players on each side . Three of them are called Chasers . ”
52931	52935	52936	52936	Harry	102	“ Three Chasers , ”
52955	52963	52965	52965	Wood	281	“ This ball ’s called the Quaffle , ”
52967	53007	52965	52965	Wood	281	“ The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal . Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops . Follow me ? ”
53008	53023	53024	53024	Harry	102	“ The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score , ”
53027	53046	53024	53024	Harry	102	“ So — that ’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops , is n’t it ? ”
53047	53052	53054	53054	Wood	281	“ What ’s basketball ? ”
53057	53061	53063	53063	Harry	102	“ Never mind , ”
53066	53103	53063	53063	Harry	102	“ Now , there ’s another player on each side who ’s called the Keeper . I ’m Keeper for Gryffindor . I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring . ”
53104	53111	53113	53113	Harry	102	“ Three Chasers , one Keeper , ”
53123	53142	53143	53143	He	281	“ And they play with the Quaffle . Okay , got that . So what are they for ? ”
53154	53161	53163	53163	Wood	281	“ I ’ll show you now , ”
53165	53169	53170	53170	He	281	“ Take this . ”
53185	53197	53198	53198	Wood	281	“ I ’m going to show you what the Bludgers do , ”
53201	53208	53209	53209	He	281	“ These two are the Bludgers . ”
53244	53248	53249	53249	Wood	281	“ Stand back , ”
53333	53336	53337	53337	Wood	281	“ See ? ”
53354	53414	53337	53337	Wood	281	“ The Bludgers rocket around , trying to knock players off their brooms . That ’s why you have two Beaters on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it ’s their job to protect their side fromthe Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team . So — think you ’ve got all that ? ”
53415	53442	53443	53443	Harry	102	“ Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle ; the Keeper guards the goal posts ; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team , ”
53447	53451	53453	53453	Wood	281	“ Very good , ”
53455	53465	53470	53470	he	102	“ Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone ? ”
53474	53523	53470	53470	he	102	“ Never at Hogwarts . We ’ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that . Now , the last member of the team is the Seeker . That ’s you . And you do n’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers — ”
53524	53533	53470	53470	he	102	“ — unless they crack my head open . ”
53534	53563	53564	53564	Wood	281	“ Do n’t worry , the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean , they ’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves . ”
53609	53612	53470	53470	he	102	“ This , ”
53614	53758	53470	53470	he	102	Wood,“is the Golden Snitch , and it ’s the most important ball of the lot . It ’s very hard to catch because it ’s so fast and difficult to see . It ’s the Seeker ’s job to catch it . You ’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers , Beaters , Bludgers , and Quaffle to get it before the other team ’s Seeker , because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points , so they nearly always win . That ’s why Seekers get fouled so much . A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught , so it can go on for ages — I think the record is three months , they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep . “
53768	53796	53797	53797	We	1508	” Harry shook his head . He understood what he had to do all right , it was doing it that was going to be the problem . “
53806	53818	53470	53470	he	102	” said Wood , carefully shutting it back inside the crate , “
53840	53915	53470	53470	he	102	” He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later , he and Harry were up in the air , Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch . Harry did n’t miss a single one , and Wood was delighted . After half an hour , night had really fallen and they could n’t carry on . “
53927	53940	53470	53470	he	102	” said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle . “
53971	54181	53963	53963	he	203	” Perhaps it was because he was now so busy , what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework , but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he ’d already been at Hogwarts two months . The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had . His lessons , too , were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics . On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors . Even better , Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly , something they had all been dying to try since they ’d seen him make Neville ’s toad zoom around the classroom . Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice . Harry ’s partner was Seamus Finnigan ( which was a relief , because Neville had been trying to catch his eye ) . Ron , however , was to be working with Hermione Granger . It was hard totell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this . She had n’t spoken to either of them since the day Harry ’s broomstick had arrived . “
54196	54212	54237	54248	Wizard Baruffio , who said ‘s ’ instead of ‘ f ’	1511	” squeaked Professor Flitwick , perched on top of his pile of books as usual . “
54262	54332	54251	54251	himself	1511	” It was very difficult . Harry and Seamus swished and flicked , but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop . Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat . Ron , at the next table , was n’t having much more luck . “
54336	54348	54349	54349	You	1512	” he shouted , waving his long arms like a windmill . “
54355	54361	54349	54349	You	1512	” Harry heard Hermione snap . “
54382	54383	54384	54384	You	1512	” “
54396	54414	54391	54391	you	1512	” Ron snarled . Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown , flicked her wand , and said,“Wingardium
54417	54433	54391	54391	you	1512	” Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads . “
54439	54446	54391	54391	you	1512	” cried Professor Flitwick , clapping . “
54457	54472	54451	54452	Miss Granger	216	” Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class . “
54483	54498	54451	54452	Miss Granger	216	” he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor , “
54506	54540	54499	54499	she	216	” Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him . It was Hermione . Harry caught a glimpse of her face — and was startled to see that she was in tears . “
54547	54548	54543	54543	she	216	” “
54551	54562	54563	54563	She	216	” said Ron , but he looked a bit uncomfortable . “
54573	54754	54755	54755	Troll	300	” Hermione did n’t turn up for the next class and was n’t seen all afternoon . On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast , Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls ’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone . Ron looked still more awkward at this , but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall , where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds . A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds , making the candles in the pumpkins stutter . The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates , as it had at the start of term banquet . Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall , his turban askew and terror on his face . Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore ’s chair , slumped against the table , and gasped , “
54767	54802	54755	54755	Troll	300	” He then sank to the floor in a dead faint . There was an uproar . It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore ’s wand to bring silence . “
54805	54809	54755	54755	Troll	300	” he rumbled , “
54819	54826	54755	54755	Troll	300	” Percy was in his element . “
54871	54872	54868	54869	a prefect	1046	” “
54880	54889	54868	54869	a prefect	1046	” Harry asked as they climbed the stairs . “
54903	54907	54895	54895	they	1523	” said Ron . “
54918	54949	54909	54909	Peeves	226	” They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions . As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs , Harry suddenly grabbed Ron ’s arm . “
54957	54958	54955	54955	Hermione	216	” “
54963	54964	54961	54961	her	216	” “
54973	54979	54965	54965	She	216	” Ron bit his lip . “
54985	54989	54965	54965	She	216	” he snapped . “
54997	55040	55041	55041	Percy	192	” Ducking down , they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way , slipped down a deserted side corridor , and hurried off toward the girls ’ bathroom . They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them . “
55043	55077	55041	55041	Percy	192	” hissed Ron , pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin . Peering around it , however , they saw not Percy but Snape . He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view . “
55083	55087	55080	55080	he	192	” Harry whispered . “
55103	55104	55091	55091	he	192	” “
55108	55125	55091	55091	he	192	” Quietly as possible , they crept along the next corridor after Snape ’s fading footsteps . “
55134	55145	55126	55126	He	192	” Harry said , but Ron held up his hand . “
55151	55343	55147	55147	you	0	” Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils , a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean . And then they heard it — a low grunting , and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet . Ron pointed — at the end of a passage to the left , something huge was moving toward them . They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight . It was a horrible sight . Twelve feet tall , its skin was a dull , granite gray , its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut . It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat , horny feet . The smell coming from it was incredible . It was holding a huge wooden club , which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long . The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside . It waggled its long ears , making up its tiny mind , then slouched slowly into the room . “
55350	55354	55147	55147	you	0	” Harry muttered . “
55361	55362	55355	55355	We	1530	” “
55366	55413	55355	55355	We	1530	” said Ron nervously . They edged toward the open door , mouths dry , praying the troll was n’t about to come out of it . With one great leap , Harry managed to grab the key , slam the door , and lock it . “
55416	55465	55355	55355	We	1530	” Flushed with their victory , they started to run back up the passage , but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop — a high , petrified scream — and it was coming from the chamber they ’d just chained up . “
55470	55480	55355	55355	We	1530	” said Ron , pale as the Bloody Baron . “
55488	55492	55493	55493	Hermione	216	” Harry gasped . “
55495	55581	55493	55493	Hermione	216	” they said together . It was the last thing they wanted to do , but what choice did they have ? Wheeling around , they sprinted back to the door and turned the key , fumbling in their panic . Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside . Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite , looking as if she was about to faint . The troll was advancing on her , knocking the sinks off the walls as it went . “
55585	55657	55493	55493	Hermione	216	” Harry said desperately to Ron , and , seizing a tap , he threw it as hard as he could against the wall . The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione . It lumbered around , blinking stupidly , to see what had made the noise . Its mean little eyes saw Harry . It hesitated , then made for him instead , lifting its club as it went . “
55663	55722	55493	55493	Hermione	216	” yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber , and he threw a metal pipe at it . The troll did n’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder , but it heard the yell and paused again , turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead , giving Harry time to run around it . “
55730	55958	55959	55959	Leviosa	303	” Harry yelled at Hermione , trying to pull her toward the door , but she could n’t move , she was still flat against the wall , her mouth open with terror . The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk . It roared again and started toward Ron , who was nearest and had no way to escape . Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid : He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll ’s neck from behind . The troll could n’t feel Harry hanging there , but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose , and Harry ’s wand had still been in his hand when he ’d jumped — it had gone straight up one of the troll ’s nostrils . Howling with pain , the troll twisted and flailed its club , with Harry clinging on for dear life ; any second , the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club . Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright ; Ron pulled out his own wand — not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head:“Wingardium
55961	56062	55959	55959	Leviosa	303	” The club flew suddenly out of the troll ’s hand , rose high , high up into the air , turned slowly over — and dropped , with a sickening crack , onto its owner ’s head . The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face , with a thud that made the whole room tremble . Harry got to his feet . He was shaking and out of breath . Ron was standing there with his wand still raised , staring at what he had done . It was Hermione who spoke first . “
56068	56069	56070	56070	I	0	” “
56076	56080	56070	56070	I	0	” said Harry , “
56090	56116	56081	56081	I	0	” He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll ’s nose . It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue . “
56122	56269	56081	56081	I	0	” He wiped it on the troll ’s trousers . A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up . They had n’t realized what a racket they had been making , but of course , someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll ’s roars . A moment later , Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room , closely followed by Snape , with Quirrell bringing up the rear . Quirrell took one look at the troll , let out a faint whimper , and sat quickly down on a toilet , clutching his heart . Snape bent over the troll . Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry . Harry had never seen her look so angry . Her lips were white . Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry ’s mind . “
56278	56306	56274	56274	you	1533	” said Professor McGonagall , with cold fury in her voice . Harry looked at Ron , who was still standing with his wand in the air . “
56323	56358	56318	56318	you	1533	” Snape gave Harry a swift , piercing look . Harry looked at the floor . He wished Ron would put his wand down . Then a small voice came out of the shadows . “
56370	56371	56364	56364	they	1535	” “
56375	56387	56364	56364	they	1535	” Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last . “
56419	56436	56412	56412	I	0	” Ron dropped his wand . Hermione Granger , telling a downright lie to a teacher ? “
56489	56506	56478	56478	It	1538	” Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story was n’t new to them . “
56513	56525	56478	56478	It	1538	” said Professor McGonagall , staring at the three of them , “
56546	56595	56535	56535	you	216	” Hermione hung her head . Harry was speechless . Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules , and here she was , pretending she had , to get them out of trouble . It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets . “
56609	56614	56596	56597	Miss Granger	216	” said Professor McGonagall . “
56648	56660	56639	56639	Students	2452	” Hermione left . Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron . “
56704	56745	56700	56700	You	216	” They hurried out of the chamber and did n’t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up . It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll , quite apart from anything else . “
56755	56759	56746	56746	We	1543	” Ron grumbled . “
56773	56774	56777	56777	her	1544	” “
56787	56791	56777	56777	her	1544	” Ron admitted . “
56799	56800	56801	56801	She	1544	” “
56818	56833	56834	56835	Pig snout	1546	” Harry reminded him . They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady . “
56837	56895	56834	56835	Pig snout	1546	” they said and entered . The common room was packed and noisy . Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up . Hermione , however , stood alone by the door , waiting for them . There was a very embarrassed pause . Then , none of them looking at each other , they all said“Thanks
56897	56945	56834	56835	Pig snout	1546	” and hurried off to get plates . But from that moment on , Hermione Granger became their friend . There are some things you ca n’t share without ending up liking each other , and knocking out a twelve - foot mountain troll is one of them .
57422	57433	57408	57408	he	285	“ What ’s that you ’ve got there , Potter ? ”
57444	57456	57458	57458	Snape	285	“ Library books are not to be taken outside the school , ”
57460	57471	57458	57458	Snape	285	“ Give it to me . Five points from Gryffindor . ”
57472	57481	57482	57482	Harry	102	“ He ’s just made that rule up , ”
57490	57499	57482	57482	Harry	102	“ Wonder what ’s wrong with his leg ? ”
57500	57512	57514	57514	Ron	195	“ Dunno , but I hope it ’s really hurting him , ”
57559	57565	57552	57552	She	216	“ How will you learn ? ”
57633	57639	57640	57640	they	1561	“ Better you than me , ”
57747	57751	57752	57752	Snape	285	“ Blasted thing , ”
57756	57772	57752	57752	Snape	285	“ How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once ? ”
57783	57786	57773	57773	Harry	102	“ POTTER ! ”
57808	57820	57805	57805	Harry	102	“ I just wondered if I could have my book back . ”
57821	57825	57826	57826	Harry	102	“ GET OUT!OUT ! ”
57844	57850	57851	57851	Ron	195	“ Did you get it ? ”
57858	57864	57854	57854	Harry	102	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
57878	57885	57886	57886	he	102	“ You know what this means ? ”
57890	57938	57886	57886	he	102	“ He tried to get past that three headed dog at Halloween ! That ’s where he was going when we saw him — he ’s after whatever it ’s guarding ! And I ’d bet my broomstickhe let that troll in , to make a diversion ! ”
57945	57952	57953	57953	she	216	“ No — he would n’t , ”
57956	57978	57953	57953	she	216	“ I know he ’s not very nice , but he would n’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe . ”
57979	57993	57995	57995	Ron	195	“ Honestly , Hermione , you think all teachers are saints or something , ”
57997	58023	57995	57995	Ron	195	“ I ’m with Harry . I would n’t put anything past Snape . But what ’s he after ? What ’s that dog guarding ? ”

58422	58427	58429	58430	Fred Weasley	193	“ The big one , ”
58432	58442	58444	58444	George	194	“ The one we ’ve all been waiting for , ”

58720	58747	58700	58700	her	260	“ And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor — what an excellent Chaser that girl is , and rather attractive , too — ”
58748	58751	58700	58700	her	260	“ JORDAN ! ”
58752	58757	58758	58760	The Weasley twins	1216	“ Sorry , Professor . ”
58781	59006	58778	58779	Professor McGonagall	111	“ And she ’s really belting along up there , a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet , a good find of Oliver Wood ’s , last year only a reserve — back to Johnson and — no , the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle , Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — he ’s going to sc — no , stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that ’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there , nice dive around Flint , off up the field and — OUCH — that must have hurt , hit in the back of the head by a Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that ’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts , but he ’s blocked by a second Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley , ca n’t tell which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater , anyway , and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle , a clear field ahead andoff she goes — she ’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the goal posts are ahead — come on , now , Angelina — Keeper Bletchley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE ! ”
59022	59030	59019	59020	the Slytherins	254	“ Budge up there , move along . ”

59071	59094	59059	59059	Hagrid	119	“ But it is n’t the same as bein ’ in the crowd . No sign of the Snitch yet , eh ? ”
59095	59098	59100	59100	Ron	195	“ Nope , ”
59102	59112	59100	59100	Ron	195	“ Harry has n’t had much to do yet . ”
59113	59124	59126	59126	Hagrid	119	“ Kept outta trouble , though , that ’s somethin’ , ”
59173	59187	59188	59188	Wood	307	“ Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch , ”
59192	59205	59188	59188	Wood	307	“ We do n’t want you attacked before you have to be . ”
59291	59298	59299	59299	he	102	“ All right there , Harry ? ”
59315	59320	59306	59306	he	102	“ Slytherin in possession , ”
59326	59354	59321	59322	Lee Jordan	197	“ Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers , two Weasleys , and Chaser Bell , and speeds toward the — wait a moment — was that the Snitch ? ”
59510	59513	59515	59516	the Gryffindors	253	“ Foul ! ”
59563	59572	59560	59561	Dean Thomas	170	yelling,“Send him off , ref ! Red card ! ”
59573	59582	59584	59584	Ron	195	“ What are you talking about , Dean ? ”
59586	59590	59592	59592	Dean	170	“ Red card ! ”
59595	59612	59592	59592	Dean	170	“ In soccer you get shown the red card and you ’re out of the game ! ”
59613	59622	59623	59623	Ron	195	“ But this is n’t soccer , Dean , ”
59637	59652	59627	59627	Hagrid	119	“ They oughta change the rules . Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air . ”
59664	59676	59653	59654	Lee Jordan	197	“ So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating — ”
59677	59680	59682	59683	Professor McGonagall	111	“ Jordan ! ”
59685	59696	59682	59683	Professor McGonagall	111	“ I mean , after that open and revolting foul — ”
59697	59705	59653	59654	Lee Jordan	197	“ Jordan , I ’m warning you — ”
59706	59758	59653	59654	Lee Jordan	197	“ All right , all right . Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker , which could happen to anyone , I ’m sure , so a penalty to Gryffindor , taken by Spinnet , who puts it away , no trouble , and we continue play , Gryffindor still in possession . ”
59931	59973	59926	59926	Lee	197	“ Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face by a Bludger , hope it broke his nose — only joking , Professor — Slytherins score — A no … ”
60012	60021	59993	59993	It	1596	“ Dunno what Harry thinks he ’s doing , ”
60031	60056	60025	60025	He	119	“ If I didn ’ know better , I ’d say he ’d lost control of his broom … but he ca n’t have … ”
60123	60134	60135	60135	Seamus	237	“ Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him ? ”
60138	60143	60135	60135	Seamus	237	“ Ca n’t have , ”
60151	60175	60147	60147	his	119	“ Ca n’t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand . ”
60202	60208	60210	60210	Ron	195	“ What are you doing ? ”
60215	60220	60210	60210	Ron	195	“ I knew it , ”
60224	60229	60230	60230	Ron	195	“ Snape — look . ”
60261	60271	60273	60273	Hermione	216	“ He ’s doing something — jinxing the broom , ”
60275	60281	60273	60273	Hermione	216	“ What should we do ? ”
60282	60288	60258	60258	his	285	“ Leave it to me . ”
60406	60412	60413	60413	Ron	195	“ Come on , Hermione , ”
60572	60579	60580	60580	Ron	195	“ Neville , you can look ! ”
60641	60648	60649	60649	he	102	“ I ’ve got the Snitch ! ”
60666	60675	60676	60676	Flint	181	“ He didn’tcatch it , he nearlyswallowed it , ”
60746	60751	60752	60752	Ron	195	“ It was Snape , ”
60756	60780	60752	60752	Ron	195	“ Hermione and I saw him . He was cursing your broomstick , muttering , he would n’t take his eyes off you . ”
60781	60784	60786	60786	Hagrid	119	“ Rubbish , ”
60806	60815	60816	60816	Harry	102	“ Why would Snape do somethin’ like that ? ”
60839	60847	60848	60848	he	102	“ I found out something about him , ”
60852	60881	60848	60848	he	102	“ He tried to get past that three headed dog on Halloween . It bit him . We think he was trying to steal whatever it ’s guarding . ”
60887	60895	60896	60896	he	119	“ How do you know about Fluffy ? ”
60899	60902	60896	60896	he	119	“ Fluffy ? ”
60903	60934	60848	60848	he	102	“ Yeah — he ’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las ’ year — I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the — ”
60935	60938	60940	60940	Harry	102	“ Yes ? ”
60943	60952	60954	60954	Hagrid	119	“ Now , do n’t ask me anymore , ”
60957	60966	60954	60954	Hagrid	119	“ That ’s top secret , that is . ”
60967	60975	60848	60848	he	102	“ But Snape ’s trying tosteal it . ”
60976	60979	60981	60981	Hagrid	119	“ Rubbish , ”
60984	60999	60981	60981	Hagrid	119	“ Snape ’s a Hogwarts teacher , he ’d do nothin’ of the sort . ”
61000	61011	61013	61013	Hermione	216	“ So why did he just try to kill Harry ? ”
61029	61068	61027	61027	Snape	285	“ I know a jinx when I see one , Hagrid , I ’ve read all about them ! You ’ve got to keep eye contact , and Snape was n’t blinking at all , I saw him ! ”
61069	61079	61081	61081	Hagrid	119	“ I ’m tellin ’ yeh , yer wrong ! ”
61084	61159	61081	61081	Hagrid	119	“ I don ’ know why Harry ’s broom acted like that , but Snape wouldn ’ try an ’ kill a student ! Now , listen to me , all three of yeh — yer meddlin ’ in things that don ’ concern yeh . It ’s dangerous . You forget that dog , an ’ you forget what it ’s guardin ’ , that ’s between Professor Dumbledore an ’ Nicolas Flamel — ”
61160	61163	61165	61165	Harry	102	“ Aha ! ”
61167	61180	61165	61165	Harry	102	“ so there ’s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved , is there ? ”
61344	61351	61353	61354	Draco Malfoy	221	“ I do feel so sorry , ”
61360	61381	61382	61382	He	221	“ for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they ’re not wanted at home . ”
61633	61642	61643	61643	Ron	195	“ Hi , Hagrid , want any help ? ”
61653	61665	61647	61647	his	195	“ Nah , I ’m all right , thanks , Ron . ”
61666	61676	61678	61678	Malfoy	221	“ Would you mind moving out of the way ? ”
61686	61730	61731	61731	Ron	195	“ Are you trying to earn some extra money , Weasley ? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose — that hut of Hagrid ’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family ’s used to . ”
61743	61746	61747	61747	Ron	195	“ WEASLEY ! ”
61758	61766	61768	61768	Hagrid	119	“ He was provoked , Professor Snape , ”
61781	61789	61771	61771	his	119	“ Malfoy was insultin ’ his family . ”
61790	61805	61807	61807	Snape	258	“ Be that as it may , fighting is against Hogwarts rules , Hagrid , ”
61810	61833	61807	61807	Snape	258	“ Five points from Gryffindor , Weasley , and be grateful it is n’t more . Move along , all of you . ”
61852	61858	61860	61860	Ron	195	“ I ’ll get him , ”
61870	61881	61863	61863	his	195	“ one of these days , I ’ll get him — ”
61882	61888	61890	61890	Harry	102	“ I hate them both , ”
61892	61897	61890	61890	Harry	102	“ Malfoy and Snape . ”
61898	61910	61912	61912	Hagrid	119	“ Come on , cheer up , it ’s nearly Christmas , ”
61914	61933	61912	61912	Hagrid	119	“ Tell yeh what , come with me an ’ see the Great Hall , looks a treat . ”
61963	61982	62037	62037	Hagrid	119	“ Ah , Hagrid , the last tree — put it in the far corner , would you ? ”
62025	62036	62037	62037	Hagrid	119	“ How many days you got left until yer holidays ? ”
62040	62044	62046	62046	Hermione	216	“ Just one , ”
62048	62074	62046	62046	Hermione	216	“ And that reminds me — Harry , Ron , we ’ve got half an hour before lunch , we should be in the library . ”
62075	62083	62085	62085	Ron	195	“ Oh yeah , you ’re right , ”
62116	62120	62122	62122	Hagrid	119	“ The library ? ”
62131	62144	62122	62122	Hagrid	119	“ Just before the holidays ? Bit keen , are n’t yeh ? ”
62145	62153	62154	62154	Harry	102	“ Oh , we ’re not working , ”
62159	62177	62154	62154	Harry	102	“ Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we ’ve been trying to find out who he is . ”
62178	62181	62182	62182	Hagrid	119	“ Youwhat ? ”
62186	62208	62182	62182	Hagrid	119	“Listen here — I’ve told yeh — drop it . It ’s nothin’ to you what that dog ’s guardin ’ . ”
62209	62224	62226	62226	Hermione	216	“ We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is , that ’s all , ”
62228	62242	62243	62243	Harry	102	“ Unless you ’d like to tell us and save us the trouble ? ”
62246	62279	62243	62243	Harry	102	“ We must ’ve been through hundreds of books already and we ca n’t find him anywhere — just give us a hint — I know I ’ve read his name somewhere . ”
62280	62287	62289	62289	Hagrid	119	“ I ’m sayin ’ nothin’ , ”
62292	62303	62305	62305	Ron	195	“ Just have to find out for ourselves , then , ”
62562	62571	62579	62580	Madam Pince	318	“ What are you looking for , boy ? ”
62572	62575	62577	62577	Harry	102	“ Nothing , ”
62590	62604	62581	62582	the librarian	1650	“ You ’d better get out , then . Go on — out ! ”
62758	62772	62774	62774	Hermione	216	“ You will keep looking while I ’m away , wo n’t you ? ”
62776	62787	62774	62774	Hermione	216	“ And send me an owl if you find anything . ”
62788	62802	62804	62804	Ron	195	“ And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is , ”
62806	62815	62804	62804	Ron	195	“ It ’d be safe to ask them . ”
62816	62826	62828	62828	Hermione	216	“ Very safe , as they ’re both dentists , ”
63058	63080	63044	63044	they	1662	“ Do n’t send me there , ca n’t you see his knight ? Sendhim , we can afford to losehim . ”

63296	63301	63303	63303	Harry	102	“ That ’s friendly , ”
63313	63316	63317	63317	he	195	“ Weird ! ”

63343	63356	63334	63334	Harry	102	“ Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these ? ”
63357	63368	63370	63370	Ron	195	“ I think I know who that one ’s from , ”
63384	63403	63404	63404	he	195	“ My mom . I told her you did n’t expect any presents and — oh , no , ”

63573	63590	63553	63553	he	195	“ If that ’s what I think it is — they’re really rare , andreally valuable . ”
63591	63596	63597	63597	Harry	102	“ What is it ? ”
63621	63628	63630	63630	Ron	195	“ It ’s an Invisibility Cloak , ”
63640	63651	63630	63630	Ron	195	“ I ’m sure it is — try it on . ”
63665	63671	63660	63660	Ron	195	“ Itis ! Look down ! ”

63970	63984	63962	63962	Fred	193	“ She obviously makes more of an effort if you ’re not family . ”
63985	63995	63996	63996	George	194	“ Why are n’t you wearing yours , Ron ? ”
63999	64013	63996	63996	George	194	“ Come on , get it on , they ’re lovely and warm . ”

64119	64144	64116	64116	Fred	193	“ P for prefect ! Get it on , Percy , come on , we ’re all wearing ours , even Harry got one . ”
64145	64152	64154	64154	Percy	192	“ I — don’t — want , ”
64172	64185	64187	64187	George	194	“ And you ’re not sitting with the prefects today , either , ”
64189	64197	64187	64187	George	194	“ Christmas is a time for family . ”
64928	64933	64935	64937	the Fat Lady	1438	“ Who ’s there ? ”
65451	65481	65443	65443	he	102	“ You asked me to come directly to you , Professor , if anyone was wandering around at night , and somebody ’s been in the library Restricted Section . ”
65521	65538	65503	65503	his	266	replied,“The Restricted Section ? Well , they ca n’t be far , we ’ll catch them . ”
66177	66180	66181	66181	he	102	“ Mom ? ”
66184	66187	66181	66181	he	102	“ Dad ? ”
66372	66378	66359	66359	He	102	“ I ’ll come back , ”
66385	66393	66395	66395	Ron	195	“ You could have woken me up , ”
66399	66418	66395	66395	Ron	195	“ You can come tonight , I ’m going back , I want to show you the mirror . ”
66419	66430	66431	66431	Ron	195	“ I ’d like to see your mom and dad , ”
66435	66462	66431	66431	Ron	195	“ And I want to see all your family , all the Weasleys , you ’ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone . ”
66463	66472	66474	66474	Ron	195	“ You can see them any old time , ”
66476	66515	66474	66474	Ron	195	“ Just come round my house this summer . Anyway , maybe it only shows dead people . Shame about not finding Flamel , though . Have some bacon or something , why are n’t you eating anything ? ”
66570	66576	66578	66578	Ron	195	“ Are you all right ? ”
66580	66585	66578	66578	Ron	195	“ You look odd . ”
66644	66649	66651	66651	Ron	195	“ I ’m freezing , ”
66653	66662	66651	66651	Ron	195	“ Let ’s forget it and go back . ”
66663	66666	66667	66667	Harry	102	“ No ! ”
66677	66718	66667	66667	Harry	102	” They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction , but saw no one else . Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold , Harry spotted the suit of armor . “
66728	66764	66667	66667	Harry	102	” They pushed the door open . Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror . There they were . His mother and father beamed at the sight of him . “
66767	66771	66667	66667	Harry	102	” Harry whispered . “
66778	66779	66772	66772	I	0	” “
66793	66794	66795	66795	I	0	” “
66801	66802	66799	66799	you	0	” “
66816	66856	66813	66813	I	0	” Harry stepped aside , but with Ron in front of the mirror , he could n’t see his family anymore , just Ron in his paisley pajamas . Ron , though , was staring transfixed at his image . “
66861	66865	66859	66859	me	0	” he said . “
66876	66877	66867	66867	you	0	” “
66898	66899	66895	66896	head boy	809	” “

66934	66950	66929	66930	Quidditch captain	1726	” Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry . “
66960	66961	66952	66952	you	0	” “
66978	66979	66973	66973	me	0	” “
66996	66997	66980	66980	You	0	” “
67019	67020	67012	67012	I	0	” “
67026	67052	67012	67012	I	0	” A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion . They had n’t realized how loudly they had been talking . “
67055	67106	67012	67012	I	0	” Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door . Ron and Harry stood quite still , both thinking the same thing — did the cloak work on cats ? After what seemed an age , she turned and left . “
67128	67148	67121	67121	she	1729	” And Ron pulled Harry out of the room . The snow still had n’t melted the next morning . “
67156	67160	67154	67154	Harry	102	” said Ron . “
67163	67164	67154	67154	Harry	102	” “
67175	67176	67154	67154	Harry	102	” “
67182	67183	67179	67179	you	102	” “
67203	67204	67179	67179	you	102	” “
67208	67209	67210	67210	I	0	” “
67269	67270	67271	67271	You	102	” “
67276	67277	67271	67271	You	102	” “
67288	67409	67282	67282	Harry	102	” But Harry only had one thought in his head , which was to get back in front of the mirror , and Ron was n’t going to stop him . That third night he found his way more quickly than before . He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise , but he did n’t meet anyone . And there were his mother and father smiling at him again , and one of his grandfathers nodding happily . Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror . There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family . Nothing at all . Except — “
67417	67471	67415	67415	Harry	102	” Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice . He looked behind him . Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore . Harry must have walked straight past him , so desperate to get to the mirror he had n’t noticed him . “
67481	67482	67473	67473	I	0	” “
67492	67507	67473	67473	I	0	” said Dumbledore , and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling . “
67510	67526	67527	67527	you	102	” said Dumbledore , slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry , “
67544	67545	67527	67527	you	102	” “
67557	67558	67555	67555	sir	2264	” “
67571	67572	67573	67573	It	1734	” “
67583	67584	67573	67573	It	1734	” “
67596	67597	67590	67590	Ron	195	” “
67604	67605	67600	67600	you	102	” “
67616	67621	67606	67606	I	0	” said Dumbledore gently . “
67636	67642	67644	67644	me	0	” Harry shook his head . “
67686	67693	67669	67669	he	1739	” Harry thought . Then he said slowly,“It
67704	67705	67669	67669	he	1739	” “
67710	67715	67669	67669	he	1739	” said Dumbledore quietly . “
67816	67890	67891	67891	Harry	102	“ The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow , Harry , and I ask you not to go looking for it again . If you ever do run across it , you will now be prepared . It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live , remember that . Now , why do n’t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed ? ”
67895	67907	67891	67891	Harry	102	“ Sir — Professor Dumbledore ? Can I ask you something ? ”
67908	67917	67918	67918	Dumbledore	120	“ Obviously , you ’ve just done so , ”
67921	67932	67918	67918	Dumbledore	120	“ You may ask me one more thing , however . ”
67933	67945	67891	67891	Harry	102	“ What do you see when you look in the mirror ? ”
67946	67961	67962	67962	Harry	102	“ I ? I see myself holding a pair of thick , woolen socks . ”
67965	67973	67975	67975	Dumbledore	120	“ One can never have enough socks , ”
67977	68001	67975	67975	Dumbledore	120	“ Another Christmas has come and gone and I did n’t get a single pair . People will insist on giving me books . ”
68131	68146	68148	68148	Ron	195	“ You see , Dumbledore was right , that mirror could drive you mad , ”
68200	68207	68176	68176	She	216	“ If Filch had caught you ! ”
68424	68431	68432	68432	he	307	“ Will you stop messing around ! ”
68435	68470	68432	68432	he	307	“ That ’s exactly the sort of thing that ’ll lose us the match ! Snape ’s refereeing this time , and he ’ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor ! ”
68483	68488	68489	68489	he	307	“ Snape ’s refereeing ? ”
68497	68520	68489	68489	he	307	“ When ’s he ever refereed a Quidditch match ? He ’s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin . ”
68535	68541	68543	68543	Wood	307	“ It ’s notmy fault , ”
68545	68571	68543	68543	Wood	307	“ We ’ve just got to make sure we play a clean game , so Snape has n’t got an excuse to pick on us . ”
68659	68669	68671	68671	Ron	195	“ Do n’t talk to me for a moment , ”
68680	68686	68687	68687	He	195	“ I need to concen — ”
68695	68707	68691	68691	Harry	102	“ What ’s the matter with you ? You look terrible . ”
68736	68741	68743	68743	Hermione	216	“ Do n’t play , ”
68747	68753	68755	68755	Ron	195	“ Say you ’re ill , ”
68757	68764	68765	68765	Hermione	216	“ Pretend to break your leg , ”
68768	68774	68776	68776	Ron	195	“ Really break your leg , ”
68778	68783	68785	68785	Harry	102	“ I ca n’t , ”
68787	68807	68785	68785	Harry	102	“ There is n’t a reserve Seeker . If I back out , Gryffindor ca n’t play at all . ”
68896	68900	68903	68903	him	196	“ What happened ? ”
68915	68918	68920	68920	Neville	196	“ Malfoy , ”
68923	68944	68920	68920	Neville	196	“ I met him outside the library . He said he ’d been looking for someone to practice that on . ”
68945	68951	68952	68952	Hermione	216	“ Go to Professor McGonagall ! ”
68956	68960	68952	68952	Hermione	216	“ Report him ! ”
68966	68974	68975	68975	he	196	“ I do n’t want more trouble , ”
68978	68990	68992	68992	Ron	195	“ You ’ve got to stand up to him , Neville ! ”
68994	69021	68992	68992	Ron	195	“ He ’s used to walking all over people , but that ’s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier . ”
69022	69046	69047	69047	Neville	196	“ There ’s no need to tell me I ’m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor , Malfoy ’s already done that , ”
69094	69102	69103	69103	Harry	102	“ You ’re worth twelve of Malfoy , ”
69106	69128	69103	69103	Harry	102	“ The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor , did n’t it ? And where ’s Malfoy ? In stinking Slytherin . ”
69143	69169	69138	69138	he	196	“ Thanks , Harry … I think I ’ll go to bed … D’you want the card , you collect them , do n’t you ? ”
69183	69187	69188	69188	he	102	“ Dumbledore again , ”
69191	69200	69201	69201	He	102	“ He was the first one I ever — ”
69222	69228	69229	69229	he	102	“ I ’ve found him ! ”
69232	69300	69229	69229	he	102	“I’ve found Flamel ! Itold you I ’d read the name somewhere before , I read it on the train coming here — listen to this : ‘ Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945 , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon ’s blood , and his work on alchemy with his partner , Nicolas Flamel ’ ! ”
69328	69332	69333	69333	she	216	“ Stay there ! ”
69372	69381	69382	69382	she	216	“ I never thought to look in here ! ”
69386	69403	69382	69382	she	216	“ I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading . ”
69404	69407	69409	69409	Ron	195	“ Light ? ”
69447	69455	69439	69439	she	216	“ I knew it ! Iknew it ! ”
69456	69464	69466	69466	Ron	195	“ Are we allowed to speak yet ? ”
69473	69477	69478	69478	she	216	“ Nicolas Flamel , ”
69480	69491	69478	69478	she	216	dramatically,“is the only known maker of the Sorcerer ’s Stone ! ”
69503	69507	69509	69509	Harry	102	“ The what ? ”
69513	69531	69511	69511	Ron	195	“ Oh , honestly , do n’t you two read ? Look — read that , there . ”
69659	69662	69664	69664	Hermione	216	“ See ? ”
69673	69721	69669	69669	Ron	195	“ The dog must be guarding Flamel ’s Sorcerer ’s Stone ! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him , because they ’re friends and he knew someone was after it , that ’s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts ! ”
69722	69735	69737	69737	Harry	102	“ A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying ! ”
69739	69750	69737	69737	Harry	102	“ No wonder Snape ’s after it!Anyone would want it . ”
69751	69768	69770	69770	Ron	195	“ And no wonder we could n’t find Flamel in thatStudy of Recent Developments in Wizardry , ”
69772	69789	69770	69770	Ron	195	“He ’s not exactly recent if he ’s six hundred and sixty five , is he ? ”
69853	69860	69861	69861	he	102	“ I ’m going to play , ”
69867	69905	69861	69861	he	102	“ If I do n’t , all the Slytherins will think I ’m just too scared to face Snape . I ’ll show them … it ’ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win . ”
69906	69920	69922	69922	Hermione	216	“ Just as long as we ’re not wiping you off the field , ”
70244	70254	70255	70255	Hermione	216	“ Now , do n’t forget , it’sLocomotor Mortis , ”
70266	70270	70271	70271	Ron	195	“ I know , ”
70274	70279	70271	70271	Ron	195	“ Do n’t nag . ”
70292	70328	70286	70286	Wood	307	“ Do n’t want to pressure you , Potter , but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it ’s now . Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much . ”
70329	70337	70339	70340	Fred Weasley	193	“ The whole school ’s out there ! ”
70348	70359	70339	70340	Fred Weasley	193	“ Even — blimey — Dumbledore ’s come to watch ! ”
70367	70370	70371	70371	he	102	“ Dumbledore ? ”
70450	70460	70461	70461	he	195	“ I ’ve never seen Snape look so mean , ”
70465	70473	70461	70461	he	195	“ Look they ’re off — Ouch ! ”
70489	70502	70487	70487	Malfoy	221	“ Oh , sorry , Weasley , did n’t see you there . ”
70511	70537	70538	70538	Ron	195	“ Wonder how long Potter ’s going to stay on his broom this time ? Anyone want a bet ? What about you , Weasley ? ”
70592	70606	70608	70608	Malfoy	221	“ You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team ? ”
70627	70673	70674	70674	Neville	196	“ It ’s people they feel sorry for . See , there ’s Potter , who ’s got no parents , then there ’s the Weasleys , who’vegot no money — you should be on the team , Longbottom , you ’ve got no brains . ”
70687	70697	70698	70698	he	196	“ I ’m worth twelve of you , Malfoy , ”
70725	70731	70712	70712	Ron	195	said,“You tell him , Neville . ”
70732	70752	70712	70712	Ron	195	“ Longbottom , if brains were gold you ’d be poorer than Weasley , and that ’s saying something . ”
70768	70780	70712	70712	Ron	195	“ I ’m warning you , Malfoy — one more word — ”
70781	70784	70786	70786	Hermione	216	“ Ron ! ”
70789	70792	70786	70786	Hermione	216	“ Harry — ”
70793	70798	70799	70799	Harry	102	“ What ? Where ? ”
70838	70856	70858	70858	Malfoy	221	“ You ’re in luck , Weasley , Potter ’s obviously spotted some money on the ground ! ”
70897	70903	70883	70883	Neville	196	“ Come on , Harry ! ”
71028	71056	71058	71058	Hermione	216	“ Ron ! Ron ! Where are you ? The game ’s over ! Harry ’s won ! We ’ve won ! Gryffindor is in the lead ! ”
71149	71153	71155	71155	Dumbledore	120	“ Well done , ”
71165	71184	71185	71185	Snape	258	“ Nice to see you have n’t been brooding about that mirror … been keeping busy … excellent … ”
71568	71592	71564	71564	they	1801	“ … d - don’t know why you wanted t - t - to meet here of all p - places , Severus … ”
71593	71604	71606	71606	Snape	258	“ Oh , I thought we ’d keep this private , ”
71612	71628	71608	71608	his	258	“ Students are n’t supposed to know about the Sorcerer ’s Stone , after all . ”
71642	71658	71638	71638	Snape	258	“ Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid ’s yet ? ”
71659	71669	71608	71608	his	258	“ B - b - but Severus , I — ”
71670	71682	71684	71684	Snape	258	“ You do n’t want me as your enemy , Quirrell , ”
71692	71702	71684	71684	Snape	258	“ I — I do n’t know what you — ”
71703	71712	71608	71608	his	258	“ You know perfectly well what I mean . ”
71735	71746	71734	71734	Snape	258	say,“—your little bit of hocus pocus . I ’m waiting . ”
71747	71758	71734	71734	Snape	258	“ B - but I d - d - don’t — ”
71759	71763	71764	71764	Snape	258	“ Very well , ”
71768	71793	71794	71794	He	258	“ We ’ll have another little chat soon , when you ’ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie . ”
71832	71839	71840	71840	Hermione	216	“ Harry , where have youbeen ? ”
71843	71853	71855	71855	Ron	195	“ We won ! You won ! We won ! ”
71863	71932	71855	71855	Ron	195	“ And I gave Malfoy a black eye , and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single handed ! He ’s still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he ’ll be all right — talk about showing Slytherin ! Everyone ’s waiting for you in the common room , we ’re having a party , Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens . ”
71933	71939	71941	71941	Harry	102	“ Never mind that now , ”
71944	71960	71961	71961	He	102	“ Let ’s find an empty room , you wait ’ til you hear this … ”
71986	72067	71976	71976	he	102	“ So we were right , itis the Sorcerer ’s Stone , and Snape ’s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it . He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he said something about Quirrell ’s ‘ hocus pocus’—I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy , loads of enchantments , probably , and Quirrell would have done some anti Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through — ”
72068	72086	72088	72088	Hermione	216	“ So you mean the Stone ’s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape ? ”
72092	72101	72103	72103	Ron	195	“ It ’ll be gone by next Tuesday , ”
72271	72280	72262	72262	she	216	“ Hermione , the exams are ages away . ”
72281	72285	72286	72286	Hermione	216	“ Ten weeks , ”
72289	72304	72286	72286	Hermione	216	“ That ’s not ages , that ’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel . ”
72305	72315	72316	72316	Ron	195	“ But we ’re not six hundred years old , ”
72320	72336	72316	72316	Ron	195	“ Anyway , what are you studying for , you already know it ’s an A. ”
72337	72387	72286	72286	Hermione	216	“ What am I studying for ? Are you crazy ? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year ? They ’re very important , I should have started studying a month ago , I do n’t know what ’s gotten into me … ”
72476	72483	72484	72484	Ron	195	“ I ’ll never remember this , ”
72544	72545	72539	72539	Harry	102	up“Dittany ”
72563	72574	72560	72560	Ron	195	“ Hagrid ! What are you doing in the library ? ”
72597	72603	72604	72604	he	119	“ Jus ’ lookin ’ , ”
72618	72628	72604	72604	he	119	“ An ’ what ’re you lot up ter ? ”
72634	72647	72629	72629	He	119	“ Yer not still lookin ’ fer Nicolas Flamel , are yeh ? ”
72648	72660	72662	72662	Ron	195	“ Oh , we found out who he is ages ago , ”
72665	72682	72662	72662	Ron	195	“ And we know what that dog ’s guarding , it ’s a Sorcerer ’s St — ”
72683	72686	72687	72687	Hagrid	119	“ Shhhh ! ”
72698	72714	72694	72694	anyone	372	“ Don ’ go shoutin ’ about it , what ’s the matter with yeh ? ”
72715	72733	72735	72735	Harry	102	“ There are a few things we wanted to ask you , as a matter of fact , ”
72737	72748	72735	72735	Harry	102	“ about what ’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy — ”
72749	72752	72754	72754	Hagrid	119	“ SHHHH ! ”
72757	72807	72754	72754	Hagrid	119	“ Listen — come an ’ see me later , I ’m not promisin ’ I ’ll tell yeh anythin ’ , mind , but don ’ go rabbitin ’ about it in here , students aren ’ s’pposed ter know . They ’ll think I ’ve told yeh — ”
72808	72815	72817	72817	Harry	102	“ See you later , then , ”
72823	72832	72834	72834	Hermione	216	“ What was he hiding behind his back ? ”
72837	72850	72834	72834	Hermione	216	“ Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone ? ”
72851	72863	72865	72865	Ron	195	“ I ’m going to see what section he was in , ”
72896	72899	72900	72900	he	195	“ Dragons ! ”
72903	72935	72900	72900	he	195	“ Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons ! Look at these : Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland ; From Egg to Inferno , A Dragon Keeper ’s Guide . ”
72936	72956	72958	72958	Harry	102	“ Hagrid ’s always wanted a dragon , he told me so the first time I ever met him , ”
72960	72968	72970	72970	Ron	195	“ But it ’s against our laws , ”
72972	73034	72970	72970	Ron	195	“ Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks ’ Convention of 1709 , everyone knows that . It ’s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we ’re keeping dragons in the back garden — anyway , you ca n’t tame dragons , it ’s dangerous . You should see the burns Charlie ’s got off wild ones in Romania . ”
73035	73044	73046	73046	Harry	102	“ But there are n’t wild dragons inBritain ? ”
73048	73054	73056	73056	Ron	195	“ Of course there are , ”
73058	73101	73056	73056	Ron	195	“ Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks . The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up , I can tell you . Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who ’ve spotted them , to make them forget . ”
73102	73111	73113	73113	Hermione	216	“ So what on earths Hagrid up to ? ”
73144	73149	73151	73151	he	119	“ Who is it ? ”
73203	73213	73189	73189	Hagrid	119	“ So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’ ? ”
73214	73217	73219	73219	Harry	102	“ Yes , ”
73230	73250	73254	73254	him	102	“ We were wondering if you could tell us what ’s guarding the Sorcerer ’s Stone apart from Fluffy . ”
73256	73264	73265	73265	he	119	“ O ’ course I ca n’t , ”
73268	73333	73265	73265	he	119	“ Number one , I don ’ know meself . Number two , yeh know too much already , so I wouldn ’ tell yeh if I could . That Stone ’s here fer a good reason . It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an ’ all ? Beats me how yeh even know abou ’ Fluffy . ”
73334	73363	73365	73365	Hermione	216	“ Oh , come on , Hagrid , you might not want to tell us , but youdo know , you know everything that goes on round here , ”
73385	73396	73381	73381	he	119	“ We only wondered who haddone the guarding , really . ”
73401	73417	73397	73397	Hermione	216	“ We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him , apart from you . ”
73434	73477	73478	73478	he	1817	“ Well , I don ’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that … let ’s see … he borrowed Fluffy from me … then some o ’ the teachers did enchantments … Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Professor McGonagall — ”
73486	73515	73478	73478	he	1817	“ Professor Quirrell — an ’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’ , o ’ course . Hang on , I ’ve forgotten someone . Oh yeah , Professor Snape . ”
73516	73519	73483	73483	his	1817	“ Snape ? ”
73520	73549	73550	73550	Harry	102	“ Yeah — yer not still on abou ’ that , are yeh ? Look , Snape helpedprotect the Stone , he ’s not about ter steal it . ”
73609	73629	73631	73631	Harry	102	“ You ’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy , are n’t you , Hagrid ? ”
73634	73652	73631	73631	Harry	102	“ And you would n’t tell anyone , would you ? Not even one of the teachers ? ”
73653	73664	73666	73666	Hagrid	119	“ Not a soul knows except me an ’ Dumbledore , ”
73669	73676	73677	73677	Harry	102	“ Well , that ’s something , ”
73683	73697	73677	73677	Harry	102	“ Hagrid , can we have a window open ? I ’m boiling . ”
73698	73706	73708	73708	Hagrid	119	“ Ca n’t , Harry , sorry , ”
73725	73730	73718	73718	Harry	102	“ Hagrid — what’sthat ? ”
73758	73761	73763	73763	Hagrid	119	“ Ah , ”
73771	73776	73763	73763	Hagrid	119	“ That ’s er … ”
73777	73786	73788	73788	Ron	195	“ Where did you get it , Hagrid ? ”
73803	73812	73788	73788	Ron	195	“ It must ’ve cost you a fortune . ”
73813	73817	73819	73819	Hagrid	119	“ Won it , ”
73821	73864	73819	73819	Hagrid	119	“ Las ’ night . I was down in the village havin’ a few drinks an ’ got into a game o ’ cards with a stranger . Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it , ter be honest . ”
73865	73880	73882	73882	Hermione	216	“ But what are you going to do with it when it ’s hatched ? ”
73884	73895	73897	73897	Hagrid	119	“ Well , I ’ve bin doin’ some readin ’ , ”
73908	74005	74006	74006	He	119	“ Got this outta the library — Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit — it ’s a bit outta date , o ’ course , but it ’s all in here . Keep the egg in the fire , ’cause their mothers breathe on I em , see , an ’ when it hatches , feed it on a bucket o ’ brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour . An ’ see here — how ter recognize diff’rent eggs — what I got there ’s a Norwegian Ridgeback . They ’re rare , them . ”
74018	74027	74028	74028	she	216	“ Hagrid , you live in awooden house , ”
74076	74088	74089	74089	Ron	195	“ Wonder what it ’s like to have a peaceful life , ”
74172	74190	74165	74165	Hermione	216	“ Hermione , how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching ? ”
74191	74224	74165	74165	Hermione	216	“ We ’ve got lessons , we ’ll get into trouble , and that ’s nothing to what Hagrid ’s going to be in when someone finds out what he ’s doing — ”
74225	74229	74230	74230	Harry	102	“ Shut up ! ”
74341	74347	74348	74348	He	119	“ It ’s nearly out . ”
74480	74485	74486	74486	Hagrid	119	“ Is n’t hebeautiful ? ”
74511	74522	74524	74524	Hagrid	119	“ Bless him , look , he knows his mommy ! ”
74526	74529	74531	74531	Hermione	216	“ Hagrid , ”
74533	74543	74531	74531	Hermione	216	“ how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow , exactly ? ”
74569	74575	74558	74558	he	119	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
74576	74603	74604	74604	Harry	102	“ Someone was lookin ’ through the gap in the curtains — it ’s a kid — he ’s runnin ’ back up ter the school . ”
74671	74677	74678	74678	Harry	102	“ Just let him go , ”
74681	74686	74678	74678	Harry	102	“ Set him free . ”
74687	74692	74694	74694	Hagrid	119	“ I ca n’t , ”
74696	74706	74694	74694	Hagrid	119	“ He ’s too little . He ’d die . ”
74763	74772	74774	74774	Hagrid	119	“ I ’ve decided to call him Norbert , ”
74784	74801	74774	74774	Hagrid	119	“ He really knows me now , watch . Norbert ! Norbert ! Where ’s Mommy ? ”
74802	74809	74810	74810	Ron	195	“ He ’s lost his marbles , ”
74817	74820	74822	74822	Harry	102	“ Hagrid , ”
74825	74851	74822	74822	Harry	102	“ give it two weeks and Norbert ’s going to be as long as your house . Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment . ”
74857	74882	74852	74852	Hagrid	119	“ I — I know I ca n’t keep him forever , but I ca n’t jus ’ dump him , I ca n’t . ”
74889	74891	74892	74892	he	102	“Charlie , ”
74895	74903	74905	74905	Ron	195	“ You ’re losing it , too , ”
74907	74914	74905	74905	Ron	195	“ I ’m Ron , remember ? ”
74915	74953	74980	74981	an owl	2418	“ No — Charlie — your brother , Charlie . In Romania . Studying dragons . We could send Norbert to him . Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild ! ”
74954	74957	74959	74959	Ron	195	“ Brilliant ! ”
74961	74968	74959	74959	Ron	195	“ How about it , Hagrid ? ”
75070	75075	75076	75076	he	195	“ It bit me ! ”
75092	75168	75076	75076	he	195	“ I ’m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week . I tell you , that dragon ’s the most horrible animal I ’ve ever met , but the way Hagrid goes on about it , you ’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit . When it bit me he told me off for frightening it . And when I left , he was singing it a lullaby . ”
75178	75183	75185	75185	Harry	102	“ It ’s Hedwig ! ”
75193	75201	75185	75185	Harry	102	“ She ’ll have Charlie ’s answer ! ”
75215	75326	75207	75207	their	490	“ Dear Ron , How are you ? Thanks for the letter — I’d be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback , but it wo n’t be easy getting him here . I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week . Trouble is , they must n’t be seen carrying an illegal dragon . Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday ? They can meet you there and take him away while it ’s still dark . Send me an answer as soon as possible . Love , Charlie ”
75334	75342	75344	75344	Harry	102	“ We ’ve got the Invisibility Cloak , ”
75346	75368	75344	75344	Harry	102	“ It should n’t be too difficult — I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert . ”
75498	75506	75507	75507	he	195	“ It ’s not just my hand , ”
75510	75593	75507	75507	he	195	“ although that feels like it ’s about to fall off . Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me . He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me — I’ve told her it was a dog , but I do n’t think she believes me . I should n’t have hit him at the Quidditch match , that ’s why he ’s doing this . ”
75603	75614	75616	75616	Hermione	216	“ It ’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday , ”
75641	75646	75647	75647	he	195	“ Midnight on Saturday ! ”
75654	75687	75647	75647	he	195	“ Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie ’s letter was in that book Malfoy took , he ’s going to know we ’re getting rid of Norbert . ”
75716	75727	75728	75728	Harry	102	“ It ’s too late to change the plan now , ”
75732	75778	75728	75728	Harry	102	“ We have n’t got time to send Charlie another owl , and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert . We ’ll have to risk it . And wehave got the Invisibility Cloak , Malfoy does n’t know about that . ”
75808	75816	75817	75817	he	119	“ I wo n’t let you in , ”
75820	75834	75817	75817	he	119	“ Norbert ’s at a tricky stage — nothin’ I ca n’t handle . ”
75865	75890	75856	75856	Norbert	332	“ Aargh ! It ’s all right , he only got my boot — jus ’ playin’—he ’s only a baby , after all . ”
76014	76030	76032	76032	Hagrid	119	“ He ’s got lots o ’ rats an ’ some brandy fer the journey , ”
76038	76053	76032	76032	Hagrid	119	“ An ’ I ’ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely . ”
76076	76082	76083	76083	Hagrid	119	“ Bye bye , Norbert ! ”
76103	76110	76101	76101	themselves	1848	“ Mommy will never forget you ! ”
76170	76174	76175	76175	Harry	102	“ Nearly there ! ”
76252	76255	76256	76256	she	111	“ Detention ! ”
76259	76278	76256	76256	she	111	“ And twenty points from Slytherin ! Wandering around in the middle of the night , howdare you — ”
76279	76298	76234	76235	Professor McGonagall	111	“ You do n’t understand , Professor . Harry Potter ’s coming — he ’s got a dragon ! ”
76299	76324	76256	76256	she	111	“ What utter rubbish ! How dare you tell such lies ! Come on — I shall see Professor Snape about you , Malfoy ! ”
76380	76390	76373	76373	Hermione	216	“ Malfoy ’s got detention ! I could sing ! ”
76391	76395	76396	76396	Harry	102	“ Do n’t , ”
76559	76566	76567	76567	he	266	“ Well , well , well , ”
76570	76575	76567	76567	he	266	“ weare in trouble . ”
76774	76777	76778	76778	Neville	196	“ Harry ! ”
76790	76819	76778	76778	Neville	196	“ I was trying to find you to warn you , I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you , he said you had a drag — ”
76854	76888	76846	76846	she	111	“ I would never have believed it of any of you . Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower . It ’s one o’clock in the morning . Explain yourselves . ”
76918	76934	76936	76937	Professor McGonagall	111	“ I think I ’ve got a good idea of what ’s been going on , ”
76939	76998	76936	76937	Professor McGonagall	111	“ It does n’t take a genius to work it out . You fed Draco Malfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon , trying to get him out of bed and into trouble . I ’ve already caught him . I suppose you think it’sfunny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it , too ? ”
77051	77056	77058	77059	Professor McGonagall	111	“ I ’m disgusted , ”
77061	77156	77058	77059	Professor McGonagall	111	“ Four students out of bed in one night ! I ’ve never heard of such a thing before ! You , Miss Granger , I thought you had more sense . As for you , Mr. Potter , I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this . All three of you will receive detentions — yes , you too , Mr. Longbottom , nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night , especially these days , it ’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor . ”
77157	77160	77161	77161	Harry	102	“ Fifty ? ”
77181	77185	77187	77188	Professor McGonagall	111	“ Fifty pointseach , ”
77199	77204	77187	77188	Professor McGonagall	111	“ Professor — please — ”
77205	77208	77193	77193	her	111	“ Youcan’t — ”
77209	77244	77193	77193	her	111	“ Do n’t tell me what I can and ca n’t do , Potter . Now get back to bed , all of you . I ’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students . ”
77514	77524	77505	77505	he	254	“ Thanks , Potter , we owe you one ! ”
77531	77565	77525	77526	Only Ron	195	“ They ’ll all forget this in a few weeks . Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they ’ve been here , and people still like them . ”
77566	77585	77587	77587	Harry	102	“ They ’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go , though , have they ? ”
77590	77595	77596	77596	Ron	195	“ Well — no , ”
77658	77661	77662	77662	Wood	307	“ Resign ? ”
77665	77687	77662	77662	Wood	307	“What good’ll that do ? How are we going to get any points back if we ca n’t win at Quidditch ? ”
77721	77725	77718	77718	they	1575	“ the Seeker . ”
77915	77925	77911	77911	Quirrell	172	“ No — no — not again , please — ”
77939	77946	77935	77935	Harry	102	“ All right — all right — ”
78113	78121	78123	78123	Ron	195	“ Snape ’s done it , then ! ”
78125	78140	78123	78123	Ron	195	“ If Quirrell ’s told him how to break his Anti Dark Force spell — ”
78141	78149	78151	78151	Hermione	216	“ There ’s still Fluffy , though , ”
78153	78168	78170	78170	Ron	195	“ Maybe Snape ’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid , ”
78182	78212	78170	78170	Ron	195	“ I bet there ’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three headed dog . So what do we do , Harry ? ”
78232	78260	78226	78226	Hermione	216	“ Go to Dumbledore . That ’s what we should have done ages ago . If we try anything ourselves we ’ll be thrown out for sure . ”
78261	78268	78270	78270	Harry	102	“ But we ’ve got noproof ! ”
78272	78400	78270	78270	Harry	102	“Quirrell ’s too scared to back us up . Snape ’s only got to say he does n’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think they ’ll believe , him or us ? It ’s not exactly a secret we hate him , Dumbledore’ll think we made it up to get him sacked . Filch would n’t help us if his life depended on it , he ’s too friendly with Snape , and the more students get thrown out , the better , he ’ll think . And do n’t forget , we ’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy . That ’ll take a lot of explaining . ”
78410	78421	78406	78406	Ron	195	“ If we just do a bit of poking around — ”
78422	78425	78427	78427	Harry	102	“ No , ”
78430	78438	78439	78439	He	102	“ we ’ve done enough poking around . ”
78482	78503	78476	78476	They	1903	“ Your detention will take place at eleven o’clock tonight . Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall . Professor McGonagall ”
78609	78613	78615	78615	Filch	259	“ Follow me , ”
78625	78645	78646	78646	he	259	“ I bet you ’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again , wo n’t you , eh ? ”
78653	78743	78646	78646	he	259	“ Oh yes … hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me … It ’s just a pity they let the old punishments die out … hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days , I ’ve got the chains still in my office , keep ’em well oiled in case they ’re ever needed … Right , off we go , and do n’t think of running off , now , it ’ll be worse for you if you do . ”
78818	78834	78835	78835	Harry	102	“ Is that you , Filch ? Hurry up , I want ter get started . ”
78869	78913	78866	78866	Filch	259	“ I suppose you think you ’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf ? Well , think again , boy — it ’s into the forest you ’re going and I ’m much mistaken if you ’ll all come out in one piece . ”
78932	78936	78937	78937	he	221	“ The forest ? ”
78951	78975	78941	78941	he	221	“ We ca n’t go in there at night — there ’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves , I heard . ”
78990	79000	79002	79002	Filch	259	“ That ’s your problem , is n’t it ? ”
79010	79027	79004	79004	his	259	“ Should ’ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble , should n’t you ? ”
79060	79065	79066	79066	he	221	“ Abou ’ time , ”
79069	79087	79066	79066	he	221	“ I bin waitin ’ fer half an hour already . All right , Harry , Hermione ? ”
79088	79100	79102	79102	Filch	259	“ I should n’t be too friendly to them , Hagrid , ”
79105	79116	79102	79102	Filch	259	“ they ’re here to be punished , after all . ”
79117	79127	79129	79129	Hagrid	119	“ That ’s why yer late , is it ? ”
79135	79163	79129	79129	Hagrid	119	“ Bin lecturin ’ them , eh ? ’ Snot your place ter do that . Yeh’ve done yer bit , I ’ll take over from here . ”
79164	79172	79174	79174	Filch	259	“ I ’ll be back at dawn , ”
79176	79184	79185	79185	he	259	“ for what ’s left of them , ”
79213	79222	79223	79223	he	221	“ I ’m not going in that forest , ”
79240	79251	79253	79253	Hagrid	119	“ Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts , ”
79256	79270	79253	79253	Hagrid	119	“ Yeh’ve done wrong an ’ now yeh’ve got ter pay fer it . ”
79271	79308	79237	79237	his	221	“ But this is servant stuff , it ’s not for students to do . I thought we ’d be copying lines or something , if my father knew I was doing this , he ’d — ”
79309	79321	79322	79322	Hagrid	119	“ — tell yer that ’s how it is at Hogwarts , ”
79325	79370	79322	79322	Hagrid	119	“ Copyin ’ lines ! What good ’s that ter anyone ? Yeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out . If yeh think yer father’d rather you were expelled , then get back off ter the castle an ’ pack . Go on . ”
79388	79392	79394	79394	Hagrid	119	“ Right then , ”
79396	79433	79434	79434	He	119	“ now , listen carefully , ’cause it ’s dangerous what we ’re gon na do tonight , an ’ I don ’ want no one takin ’ risks . Follow me over here a moment . ”
79481	79485	79487	79487	Hagrid	119	“ Look there , ”
79489	79558	79487	79487	Hagrid	119	“ see that stuff shinin ’ on the ground ? Silvery stuff ? That ’s unicorn blood . There ’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat . This is the second time in a week . I found one dead last Wednesday . We ’re gon na try an ’ find the poor thing . We might have ter put it out of its misery . ”
79559	79571	79573	79573	Malfoy	221	“ And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first ? ”
79585	79605	79607	79607	Hagrid	119	“ There ’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that ’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang , ”
79609	79659	79607	79607	Hagrid	119	“ An ’ keep ter the path . Right , now , we ’re gon na split inter two parties an ’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions . There ’s blood all over the place , it must ’ve bin staggerin ’ around since last night at least . ”
79660	79665	79667	79667	Malfoy	221	“ I want Fang , ”
79677	79691	79693	79693	Hagrid	119	“ All right , but I warn yeh , he ’s a coward , ”
79695	79785	79693	79693	Hagrid	119	“ So me , Harry , an ’ Hermione’ll go one way an ’ Draco , Neville , an ’ Fang’ll go the other . Now , if any of us finds the unicorn , we ’ll send up green sparks , right ? Get yer wands out an ’ practice now — that ’s it — an ’ if anyone gets in trouble , send up red sparks , an ’ we ’ll all come an ’ find yeh — so , be careful — let ’s go . ”
79872	79881	79882	79882	Harry	102	“ Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns ? ”
79885	79890	79892	79892	Hagrid	119	“ Not fast enough , ”
79894	79919	79892	79892	Hagrid	119	“ It ’s not easy ter catch a unicorn , they ’re powerful magic creatures . I never knew one ter be hurt before . ”
79958	79965	79966	79966	Hagrid	119	“ You all right , Hermione ? ”
79969	80001	79966	79966	Hagrid	119	“ Don ’ worry , it ca n’t ’ve gone far if it ’s this badly hurt , an ’ then we ’ll be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE ! ”
80080	80085	80086	80086	he	119	“ I knew it , ”
80089	80100	80086	80086	he	119	“ There ’s summat in here that shouldn ’ be . ”
80101	80105	80106	80106	Harry	102	“ A werewolf ? ”
80109	80125	80127	80127	Hagrid	119	“ That wasn ’ no werewolf an ’ it wasn ’ no unicorn , neither , ”
80130	80141	80127	80127	Hagrid	119	“ Right , follow me , but careful , now . ”
80165	80170	80171	80171	Hagrid	119	“ Who ’s there ? ”
80174	80181	80171	80171	Hagrid	119	“ Show yerself — I’m armed ! ”
80234	80243	80245	80245	Hagrid	119	“ Oh , it ’s you , Ronan , ”
80249	80254	80255	80255	He	119	“ How are yeh ? ”
80265	80273	80275	80275	Ronan	341	“ Good evening to you , Hagrid , ”
80285	80293	80277	80277	He	341	“ Were you going to shoot me ? ”
80294	80303	80305	80305	Hagrid	119	“ Ca n’t be too careful , Ronan , ”
80311	80354	80305	80305	Hagrid	119	“ There ’s summat bad loose in this forest . This is Harry Potter an ’ Hermione Granger , by the way . Students up at the school . An ’ this is Ronan , you two . He ’s a centaur . ”
80355	80360	80362	80362	Hermione	216	“ We ’d noticed , ”
80365	80369	80371	80371	Ronan	341	“ Good evening , ”
80373	80390	80371	80371	Ronan	341	“ Students , are you ? And do you learn much , up at the school ? ”
80391	80394	80305	80305	Hagrid	119	“ Erm — ”
80395	80399	80401	80401	Hermione	216	“ A bit , ”
80404	80414	80401	80401	Hermione	216	“ A bit . Well , that ’s something . ”
80429	80435	80418	80418	He	341	“ Mars is bright tonight . ”
80436	80439	80441	80441	Hagrid	119	“ Yeah , ”
80448	80475	80441	80441	Hagrid	119	“ Listen , I ’m glad we ’ve run inter yeh , Ronan , ’cause there ’s a unicorn bin hurt — you seen anythin ’ ? ”
80491	80500	80501	80501	he	341	“ Always the innocent are the first victims , ”
80504	80518	80501	80501	he	341	“ So it has been for ages past , so it is now . ”
80519	80522	80524	80524	Hagrid	119	“ Yeah , ”
80526	80540	80524	80524	Hagrid	119	“ but have yeh seen anythin ’ , Ronan ? Anythin ’ unusual ? ”
80541	80547	80548	80548	Ronan	341	“ Mars is bright tonight , ”
80557	80561	80552	80552	Hagrid	119	“ Unusually bright . ”
80562	80581	80501	80501	he	341	“ Yeah , but I was meanin ’ anythin ’ unusual a bit nearer home , said Hagrid . “
80591	80606	80552	80552	Hagrid	119	” Yet again , Ronan took a while to answer . At last , he said,“The
80612	80645	80646	80646	Hullo	343	” A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again , but it was only a second centaur , black haired and bodied and wilder looking than Ronan . “
80650	80654	80648	80648	Bane	344	” said Hagrid . “
80658	80659	80663	80663	Hagrid	119	” “
80671	80672	80665	80665	I	0	” “
80711	80725	80704	80704	yeh	1930	” Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan . He looked skyward . “Mars
80730	80735	80704	80704	yeh	1930	” he said simply . “
80740	80745	80704	80704	yeh	1930	” said Hagrid grumpily . “
80772	80798	80765	80765	We	1933	” Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing , staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view . “
80801	80806	80765	80765	We	1933	” said Hagrid irritably , “
80831	80832	80878	80878	centaurs	1938	” “
80840	80844	80878	80878	centaurs	1938	” asked Hermione . “
80892	80893	80880	80880	they	1937	” “
80904	80908	80880	80880	they	1937	” said Harry . “
80942	81000	81001	81001	Hagrid	119	” They walked on through the dense , dark trees . Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder . He had the nasty feeling they were being watched . He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them . They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid ’s arm . “
81014	81015	81016	81016	You	1941	” “
81021	81025	81016	81016	You	1941	” Hagrid shouted . “
81038	81071	81031	81031	I	0	” They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other , very scared , until they could n’t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them . “
81084	81088	81082	81082	you	1941	” whispered Hermione . “
81116	81208	81209	81209	We	1010	” The minutes dragged by . Their ears seemed sharper than usual . Harry ’s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind , every cracking twig . What was going on ? Where were the others ? At last , a great crunching noise announced Hagrid ’s return . Malfoy , Neville , and Fang were with him . Hagrid was fuming . Malfoy , it seemed , had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke . Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks . “
81261	81270	81257	81257	I	0	” Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry , “
81292	81388	81272	81272	he	1945	” So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang . They walked for nearly half an hour , deeper and deeper into the forest , until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick . Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker . There were splashes on the roots of a tree , as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by . Harry could see a clearing ahead , through the tangled branches of an ancient oak . “
81391	81548	81272	81272	he	1945	” he murmured , holding out his arm to stop Malfoy . Something bright white was gleaming on the ground . They inched closer . It was the unicorn all right , and it was dead . Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad . Its long , slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white on the dark leaves . Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood . A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered … Then , out of the shadows , a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast . Harry , Malfoy , and Fang stood transfixed . The cloaked figure reached the unicorn , lowered its head over the wound in the animal ’s side , and began to drink its blood . “
81551	81714	81272	81272	he	1945	” Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Fang . The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down its front . It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry — he could n’t move for fear . Then a pain like he ’d never felt before pierced his head ; it was as though his scar were on fire . Half blinded , he staggered backward . He heard hooves behind him , galloping , and something jumped clean over Harry , charging at the figure . The pain in Harry ’s head was so bad he fell to his knees . It took a minute or two to pass . When he looked up , the figure had gone . A centaur was standing over him , not Ronan or Bane ; this one looked younger ; he had white blond hair and a palomino body . “
81720	81731	81831	81831	he	1946	” said the centaur , pulling Harry to his feet . “
81740	81780	81735	81735	you	1946	” The centaur did n’t answer . He had astonishingly blue eyes , like pale sapphires . He looked carefully at Harry , his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out , livid , on Harry ’s forehead . “
81787	81791	81831	81831	he	1946	” he said . “
81824	81830	81831	81831	he	1946	“ My name is Firenze , ”
81883	81886	81887	81887	Bane	344	“ Firenze ! ”
81890	81915	81887	81887	Bane	344	“ What are you doing ? You have a human on your back ! Have you no shame ? Are you a common mule ? ”
81916	81924	81926	81926	Firenze	346	“ Do you realize who this is ? ”
81928	81945	81926	81926	Firenze	346	“ This is the Potter boy . The quicker he leaves this forest , the better . ”
81946	81954	81956	81956	Bane	344	“ What have you been telling him ? ”
81958	81989	81956	81956	Bane	344	“ Remember , Firenze , we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens . Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ? ”
81996	82007	82008	82008	he	341	“I’m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best , ”
82023	82062	82015	82015	Bane	344	“ For the best ! What is that to do with us ? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold ! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest ! ”
82086	82094	82095	82095	Firenze	346	“ Do you not see that unicorn ? ”
82100	82145	82095	82095	Firenze	346	“ Do you not understand why it was killed ? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret ? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest , Bane , yes , with humans alongside me if I must . ”
82185	82192	82193	82193	he	102	“ Why ’s Bane so angry ? ”
82196	82208	82193	82193	he	102	“ What was that thing you saved me from , anyway ? ”
82280	82294	82276	82276	Firenze	346	“ Harry Potter , do you know what unicorn blood is used for ? ”
82295	82298	82300	82300	Harry	102	“ No , ”
82308	82321	82300	82300	Harry	102	“ We ’ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions . ”
82322	82337	82339	82339	Firenze	346	“ That is because it is a monstrous thing , to slay a unicorn , ”
82341	82419	82339	82339	Firenze	346	“ Only one who has nothing to lose , and everything to gain , would commit such a crime . The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive , even if you are an inch from death , but at a terrible price . You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself , and you will have but a half life , a cursed life , from the moment the blood touches your lips . ”
82438	82446	82447	82447	he	102	“ But who ’d be that desperate ? ”
82451	82469	82447	82447	he	102	“ If you ’re going to be cursed forever , death ’s better , is n’t it ? ”
82470	82474	82475	82475	Firenze	346	“ It is , ”
82478	82532	82475	82475	Firenze	346	“ unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else — something that will bring you back to full strength and power — something that will mean you can never die . Mr. Potter , do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment ? ”
82533	82554	82447	82447	he	102	“ The Sorcerer ’s Stone ! Of course — the Elixir of Life ! But I do n’t understand who — ”
82555	82581	82475	82475	Firenze	346	“ Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power , who has clung to life , awaiting their chance ? ”
82622	82646	82611	82611	Hagrid	119	“ Some say he died . Codswallop , in my opinion . Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die . ”
82647	82652	82653	82653	Harry	102	“ Do you mean , ”
82656	82660	82653	82653	Harry	102	“ that wasVol — ”
82661	82671	82672	82672	Hermione	216	“ Harry ! Harry , are you all right ? ”
82687	82692	82694	82694	Harry	102	“ I ’m fine , ”
82703	82719	82694	82694	Harry	102	“ The unicorn ’s dead , Hagrid , it ’s in that clearing back there . ”
82720	82728	82729	82729	Firenze	346	“ This is where I leave you , ”
82740	82746	82747	82747	Harry	102	“ You are safe now . ”
82753	82760	82762	82762	Firenze	346	“ Good luck , Harry Potter , ”
82764	82787	82788	82788	He	119	“ The planets have been read wrongly before now , even by centaurs . I hope this is one of those times . ”
82884	82913	82879	82879	He	102	“ Snape wants the stone for Voldemort … and Voldemort ’s waiting in the forest … and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich … ”
82914	82920	82922	82922	Ron	195	“ Stop saying the name ! ”
82942	83004	82937	82937	Harry	102	“ Firenze saved me , but he should n’t have done so … Bane was furious … he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen … They must show that Voldemort ’s coming back … Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me … I suppose that ’s written in the stars as well . ”
83005	83013	83014	83014	Ron	195	“ Will you stop saying the name ! ”
83017	83034	83014	83014	Ron	195	“ So all I ’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone , ”
83040	83061	83035	83035	Harry	102	“ then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off … Well , I suppose Bane’ll be happy . ”
83075	83139	83068	83068	she	216	“ Harry , everyone says Dumbledore ’s the only one You - Know - Who was ever afraid of . With Dumbledore around , You - Know - Who wo n’t touch you . Anyway , who says the centaurs are right ? It sounds like fortune telling to me , and Professor McGonagall says that ’s a very imprecise branch of magic . ”
83612	83624	83626	83626	Hermione	216	“ That was far easier than I thought it would be , ”
83639	83660	83626	83626	Hermione	216	“ I need n’t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager . ”
83717	83721	83722	83722	Ron	195	“No more studying , ”
83732	83764	83722	83722	Ron	195	“ You could look more cheerful , Harry , we ’ve got a week before we find out how badly we ’ve done , there ’s no need to worry yet . ”
83771	83779	83780	83780	he	102	“ I wish I knew what thismeans ! ”
83785	83802	83780	83780	he	102	“My scar keeps hurting — it ’s happened before , but never as often as this . ”
83803	83809	83810	83810	Hermione	216	“ Go to Madam Pomfrey , ”
83813	83819	83821	83821	Harry	102	“ I ’m not ill , ”
83823	83837	83821	83821	Harry	102	“ I think it ’s a warning … it means danger ’s coming … ”
83850	83921	83922	83922	Harry	102	“ Harry , relax , Hermione ’s right , the Stone ’s safe as long as Dumbledore ’s around . Anyway , we ’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy . He nearly had his leg ripped off once , he ’s not going to try it again in a hurry . And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down . ”
83957	83985	83954	83954	Hermione	216	“ That ’s just the exams . I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we ’d done that one . ”
84064	84070	84072	84072	Ron	195	“ Where ’re you going ? ”
84075	84083	84085	84085	Harry	102	“ I ’ve just thought of something , ”
84092	84104	84087	84087	He	102	“ We ’ve got to go and see Hagrid , now . ”
84105	84108	84110	84110	Hermione	216	“ Why ? ”
84117	84128	84130	84130	Harry	102	“ Do n’t you think it ’s a bit odd , ”
84138	84200	84130	84130	Harry	102	“ that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon , and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket ? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it ’s against wizard law ? Lucky they found Hagrid , do n’t you think ? Why did n’t I see it before ? ”
84201	84208	84210	84210	Ron	195	“ What are you talking about ? ”
84255	84258	84259	84259	he	119	“ Hullo , ”
84264	84275	84259	84259	he	119	“ Finished yer exams ? Got time fer a drink ? ”
84276	84281	84283	84283	Ron	195	“ Yes , please , ”
84291	84330	84286	84286	Harry	102	“ No , we ’re in a hurry . Hagrid , I ’ve got to ask you something . You know that night you won Norbert ? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like ? ”
84331	84334	84336	84336	Hagrid	119	“ Dunno , ”
84339	84348	84336	84336	Hagrid	119	“ he wouldn ’ take his cloak off . ”
84362	84414	84359	84359	his	119	“ It ’s not that unusual , yeh get a lot o ’ funny folk in the Hog ’s Head — that ’s the pub down in the village . Mighta bin a dragon dealer , mightn ’ he ? I never saw his face , he kept his hood up . ”
84425	84442	84415	84415	Harry	102	“What did you talk to him about , Hagrid ? Did you mention Hogwarts at all ? ”
84443	84448	84450	84450	Hagrid	119	“ Mighta come up , ”
84459	84591	84450	84450	Hagrid	119	“ Yeah … he asked what I did , an ’ I told him I was gamekeeper here … He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after … so I told him … an ’ I said what I ’d always really wanted was a dragon … an ’ then … I can ’ remember too well , ’cause he kept buyin ’ me drinks … Let ’s see … yeah , then he said he had the dragon egg an ’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted … but he had ter be sure I could handle it , he didn ’ want it ter go ter any old home … So I told him , after Fluffy , a dragon would be easy … ”
84592	84604	84605	84605	Harry	102	“ And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy ? ”
84616	84673	84605	84605	Harry	102	“ Well — yeah — how many three headed dogs d’yeh meet , even around Hogwarts ? So I told him , Fluffy ’s a piece o ’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down , jus ’ play him a bit o ’ music an ’ he ’ll go straight off ter sleep — ”
84679	84686	84687	84687	he	119	“ I shouldn’ta told yeh that ! ”
84691	84703	84704	84704	Harry	102	“ Forget I said it ! Hey — where’re yeh goin’ ? ”
84739	84748	84750	84750	Harry	102	“ We ’ve got to go to Dumbledore , ”
84752	84812	84750	84750	Harry	102	“ Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy , and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must ’ve been easy , once he ’d got Hagrid drunk . I just hope Dumbledore believes us . Firenze might back us up if Bane does n’t stop him . Where ’s Dumbledore ’s office ? ”
84853	84860	84861	84861	Harry	102	“ We ’ll just have to — ”
84873	84881	84884	84885	Professor McGonagall	111	“ What are you three doing inside ? ”
84894	84902	84904	84904	Hermione	216	“ We want to see Professor Dumbledore , ”
84914	84919	84911	84911	Ron	195	“ See Professor Dumbledore ? ”
84937	84940	84920	84921	Professor McGonagall	111	“ Why ? ”
84947	84954	84955	84955	he	102	“ It ’s sort of secret , ”
84974	84982	84983	84983	she	111	“ Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago , ”
84987	85006	84983	84983	she	111	“ He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once . ”
85007	85010	85012	85012	Harry	102	“ He’sgone ? ”
85015	85017	85012	85012	Harry	102	“Now ? ”
85018	85037	84983	84983	she	111	“ Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard , Potter , he has many demands on his time — ”
85038	85044	84983	84983	she	111	“ But this is important . ”
85045	85062	85012	85012	Harry	102	“ Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic , Potter ? ”
85063	85066	85068	85068	Harry	102	“ Look , ”
85076	85087	85068	85068	Harry	102	“ Professor — it ’s about the Sorcerer ’s stone — ”
85118	85124	85125	85125	she	111	“ How do you know ? ”
85128	85159	85125	85125	she	111	“ Professor , I think — Iknow — that Sn — that someone ’s going to try and steal the Stone . I ’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore . ”
85171	85179	85180	85180	she	111	“ Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow , ”
85184	85214	85180	85180	she	111	“ I do n’t know how you found out about the Stone , but rest assured , no one can possibly steal it , it ’s too well protected . ”
85215	85219	85272	85272	Harry	102	“ But Professor — ”
85220	85231	85232	85232	she	111	“ Potter , I know what I ’m talking about , ”
85246	85259	85236	85236	She	111	“ I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine . ”
85265	85270	85272	85272	Harry	102	“ It ’s tonight , ”
85285	85334	85272	85272	Harry	102	“ Snape ’s going through the trapdoor tonight . He ’s found out everything he needs , and now he ’s got Dumbledore out of the way . He sent that note , I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up . ”
85335	85341	85342	85342	Hermione	216	“ But what can we — ”
85356	85360	85361	85361	he	258	“ Good afternoon , ”
85370	85382	85383	85383	he	258	“ You should n’t be inside on a day like this , ”
85393	85397	85398	85398	Harry	102	“ We were — ”
85411	85419	85421	85421	Snape	258	“ You want to be more careful , ”
85423	85453	85421	85421	Snape	258	“ Hanging around like this , people will think you ’re up to something . And Gryffindor really ca n’t afford to lose any more points , can it ? ”
85469	85494	85495	85495	He	258	“ Be warned , Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled . Good day to you . ”
85517	85529	85530	85530	he	102	“ Right , here ’s what we ’ve got to do , ”
85534	85568	85530	85530	he	102	“ One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it . Hermione , you ’d better do that . ”
85569	85573	85581	85581	Ron	195	“ Why me ? ”
85574	85579	85581	85581	Ron	195	“ It ’s obvious , ”
85583	85597	85598	85598	He	102	“ You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick , you know . ”
85605	85625	85598	85598	He	102	“ ‘ Oh Professor Flitwick , I ’m so worried , I think I got question fourteenb wrong … ’ ”
85626	85632	85634	85634	Hermione	216	“ Oh , shut up , ”
85647	85659	85660	85660	Harry	102	“ And we ’d better stay outside the third floor corridor , ”
85664	85668	85660	85660	Harry	102	“ Come on . ”
85709	85726	85727	85727	she	111	“ I suppose you think you ’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments ! ”
85730	85765	85727	85727	she	111	“ Enough of this nonsense ! If I hear you ’ve come anywhere near here again , I ’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor ! Yes , Weasley , from my own house ! ”
85779	85788	85776	85776	Harry	102	said,“At least Hermione ’s on Snape ’s tail , ”
85803	85810	85811	85811	she	216	“ I ’m sorry , Harry ! ”
85814	85858	85811	85811	she	216	“ Snape came out and asked me what I was doing , so I said I was waiting for Flitwick , and Snape went to get him , and I ’ve only just got away , I do n’t know where Snape went . ”
85859	85871	85872	85872	Harry	102	“ Well , that ’s it then , is n’t it ? ”
85891	85912	85886	85886	his	102	“ I ’m going out of here tonight and I ’m going to try and get to the Stone first . ”
85913	85918	85920	85920	Ron	195	“ You ’re mad ! ”
85922	85927	85929	85929	Hermione	216	“ You ca n’t ! ”
85931	85945	85929	85929	Hermione	216	“ After what McGonagall and Snape have said ? You ’ll be expelled ! ”
85946	85950	85951	85951	Harry	102	“ SO WHAT ? ”
85954	86125	86126	86126	He	1998	“ Do n’t you understand ? If Snape gets hold of the Stone , Voldemort ’s coming back ! Have n’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over ? There wo n’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from ! He ’ll flatten it , or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts ! Losing points does n’t matter anymore , ca n’t you see ? D’you think he ’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup ? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone , well , I ’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there , it ’s only dying a bit later than I would have , because I ’m never going over to the Dark Side ! I ’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me ! Voldemort killed my parents , remember ? ”
86131	86138	86140	86140	Hermione	216	“ You ’re right , Harry , ”
86146	86154	86156	86156	Harry	102	“ I ’ll use the Invisibility Cloak , ”
86158	86168	86156	86156	Harry	102	“ It ’s just lucky I got it back . ”
86169	86179	86181	86181	Ron	195	“ But will it cover all three of us ? ”
86183	86191	86181	86181	Ron	195	“ All — all three of us ? ”
86192	86210	86156	86156	Harry	102	“ Oh , come off it , you do n’t think we ’d let you go alone ? ”
86211	86216	86218	86218	Hermione	216	“ Of course not , ”
86221	86251	86218	86218	Hermione	216	“ How do you think you ’d get to the Stone without us ? I ’d better go and took through my books , there might be something useful … ”
86252	86267	86156	86156	Harry	102	“ But if we get caught , you two will be expelled , too . ”
86268	86276	86278	86278	Hermione	216	“ Not if I can help it , ”
86281	86308	86278	86278	Hermione	216	“ Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam . They ’re not throwing me out after that . ”
86413	86419	86420	86420	Ron	195	“ Better get the cloak , ”
86486	86519	86477	86477	He	102	“ We ’d better put the cloak on here , and make sure it covers all three of us — if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own — ”
86520	86526	86581	86581	Neville	196	“ What are you doing ? ”
86562	86569	86571	86571	Harry	102	“ Nothing , Neville , nothing , ”
86588	86595	86596	86596	he	196	“ You ’re going out again , ”
86599	86606	86608	86608	Hermione	216	“ No , no , no , ”
86610	86627	86628	86628	Harry	102	“ No , we ’re not . Why do n’t you go to bed , Neville ? ”
86658	86665	86667	86667	Neville	196	“ You ca n’t go out , ”
86669	86684	86667	86667	Neville	196	“ you ’ll be caught again . Gryffindor will be in even more trouble . ”
86685	86691	86693	86693	Harry	102	“ You do n’t understand , ”
86695	86700	86693	86693	Harry	102	“ this is important . ”
86712	86721	86722	86722	he	102	“ I wo n’t let you do it , ”
86735	86742	86722	86722	he	102	“ I’ll — I’ll fight you ! ”
86743	86746	86747	86747	Ron	195	“ Neville , ”
86748	86760	86722	86722	he	102	exploded,“get away from that hole and do n’t be an idiot — ”
86761	86770	86772	86772	Neville	196	“ Do n’t you call me an idiot ! ”
86774	86801	86772	86772	Neville	196	“ I do n’t think you should be breaking any more rules ! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people ! ”
86802	86809	86811	86811	Ron	195	“ Yes , but not tous , ”
86815	86826	86827	86827	He	195	“Neville , you do n’t know what you ’re doing . ”
86845	86855	86857	86857	Neville	196	“ Go on then , try and hit me ! ”
86863	86868	86857	86857	Neville	196	“ I ’m ready ! ”
86874	86877	86878	86878	he	102	“ Dosomething , ”
86886	86889	86890	86890	she	216	“ Neville , ”
86893	86903	86904	86904	She	216	“ I ’m really , really sorry about this . ”
86909	86913	86914	86914	she	216	“ Petrificus Totalus ! ”
86989	86997	86998	86998	Harry	102	“ What ’ve you done to him ? ”
87001	87009	87011	87011	Hermione	216	“ It ’s the full Body Bind , ”
87014	87024	87011	87011	Hermione	216	“ Oh , Neville , I ’m so sorry . ”
87025	87037	87039	87039	Harry	102	“ We had to , Neville , no time to explain , ”
87041	87049	87051	87051	Ron	195	“ You ’ll understand later , Neville , ”
87126	87138	87139	87139	Ron	195	“ Oh , let ’s kick her , just this once , ”
87206	87211	87212	87212	he	226	“ Who ’s there ? ”
87228	87252	87221	87221	He	226	“ Know you ’re there , even if I ca n’t see you . Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie ? ”
87267	87283	87253	87253	He	226	“ Should call Filch , I should , if something ’s a creeping around unseen . ”
87290	87293	87294	87294	he	102	“ Peeves , ”
87302	87314	87294	87294	he	102	“ the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible . ”
87339	87351	87352	87352	he	226	“ So sorry , your bloodiness , Mr. Baron , Sir , ”
87356	87388	87352	87352	he	226	“ My mistake , my mistake — I did n’t see you — of course I did n’t , you ’re invisible — forgive old Peevsie his little joke , sir . ”
87389	87397	87399	87399	Harry	102	“ I have business here , Peeves , ”
87401	87409	87399	87399	Harry	102	“ Stay away from this place tonight . ”
87410	87421	87423	87423	Peeves	226	“ I will , sir , I most certainly will , ”
87432	87447	87449	87449	he	226	“ Hope your business goes well , Baron , I ’ll not bother you . ”
87453	87458	87460	87460	Ron	195	“ Brilliant , Harry ! ”
87484	87491	87492	87492	Harry	102	“ Well , there you are , ”
87496	87504	87492	87492	Harry	102	“ Snape ’s already got past Fluffy . ”
87534	87548	87549	87549	he	102	“ If you want to go back , I wo n’t blame you , ”
87552	87566	87549	87549	he	102	“ You can take the cloak , I wo n’t need it now . ”
87567	87573	87575	87575	Ron	195	“ Do n’t be stupid , ”
87577	87582	87584	87584	Hermione	216	“ We ’re coming , ”
87626	87634	87635	87635	Hermione	216	“ What ’s that at its feet ? ”
87638	87644	87646	87646	Ron	195	“ Looks like a harp , ”
87648	87656	87646	87646	Ron	195	“ Snape must have left it there . ”
87657	87668	87670	87670	Harry	102	“ It must wake up the moment you stop playing , ”
87672	87678	87679	87679	He	102	“ Well , here goes … ”
87744	87748	87749	87749	Ron	195	“ Keep playing , ”
87782	87795	87797	87797	Ron	195	“ I think we ’ll be able to pull the door open , ”
87806	87814	87797	87797	Ron	195	“ Want to go first , Hermione ? ”
87815	87822	87830	87830	his	195	“ No , I do n’t ! ”
87823	87827	87828	87828	Ron	195	“ All right . ”
87857	87863	87841	87841	He	195	“ What can you see ? ”
87868	87889	87890	87890	Harry	102	“ Nothing — just black — there ’s no way of climbing down , we ’ll just have to drop . ”
87911	87922	87924	87924	Ron	195	“ You want to go first ? Are you sure ? ”
87926	87949	87950	87950	Harry	102	“ I do n’t know how deep this thing goes . Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep . ”
88026	88049	88020	88020	he	102	said,“If anything happens to me , do n’t follow . Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore , right ? ”
88050	88053	88055	88055	Ron	195	“ Right , ”
88057	88067	88055	88055	Ron	195	“ See you in a minute , I hope … ”
88134	88139	88140	88140	he	102	“ It ’s okay ! ”
88159	88170	88140	88140	he	102	“ it ’s a soft landing , you can jump ! ”
88184	88190	88176	88176	He	195	“ What ’s this stuff ? ”
88196	88220	88176	88176	He	195	“ Dunno , some sort of plant thing . I suppose it ’s here to break the fall . Come on , Hermione ! ”
88249	88258	88259	88259	she	216	“ We must be miles under the school , ”
88262	88272	88274	88274	Ron	195	“ Lucky this plant thing ’s here , really , ”
88276	88279	88281	88281	Hermione	216	“ Lucky ! ”
88283	88288	88281	88281	Hermione	216	“Look at you both ! ”
88393	88397	88398	88398	Hermione	216	“ Stop moving ! ”
88402	88415	88398	88398	Hermione	216	“ I know what this is — it ’s Devil ’s Snare ! ”
88416	88436	88438	88438	Ron	195	“ Oh , I ’m so glad we know what it ’s called , that ’s a great help , ”
88454	88468	88470	88470	Hermione	216	“ Shut up , I ’m trying to remember how to kill it ! ”
88472	88483	88484	88484	Harry	102	“ Well , hurry up , I ca n’t breathe ! ”
88497	88518	88484	88484	Harry	102	“ Devil ’s Snare , Devil ’s Snare … what did Professor Sprout say?—it likes the dark and the damp — ”
88519	88525	88526	88526	Harry	102	“ So light a fire ! ”
88529	88541	88526	88526	Harry	102	“ Yes — of course — but there ’s no wood ! ”
88549	88555	88556	88556	Ron	195	“ HAVE YOU GONE MAD ? ”
88559	88567	88556	88556	Ron	195	“ ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT ? ”
88568	88573	88575	88575	Hermione	216	“ Oh , right ! ”
88651	88661	88663	88663	Harry	102	“ Lucky you pay attention in Herbology , Hermione , ”
88678	88681	88683	88683	Ron	195	“ Yeah , ”
88685	88701	88683	88683	Ron	195	“ and lucky Harry does n’t lose his head in a crisis—‘there ’s no wood,’honestly . ”
88702	88706	88708	88708	Harry	102	“ This way , ”
88794	88800	88801	88801	Ron	195	“ Can you hear something ? ”
88820	88829	88801	88801	Ron	195	“ Do you think it ’s a ghost ? ”
88830	88842	88801	88801	Ron	195	“ I do n’t know … sounds like wings to me . ”
88843	88855	88856	88856	They	2683	“ There ’s light ahead — I can see something moving . ”
88910	88924	88926	88926	Ron	195	“ Do you think they ’ll attack us if we cross the room ? ”
88928	88931	88933	88933	Harry	102	“ Probably , ”
88935	88966	88933	88933	Harry	102	“ They do n’t look very vicious , but I suppose if they all swooped down at once … well , there ’s no other choice … I ’ll run . ”
89049	89053	89055	89055	Ron	195	“ Now what ? ”
89057	89070	89072	89072	Hermione	216	“ These birds … they ca n’t be here just for decoration , ”
89085	89091	89092	89092	Harry	102	“ They ’re not birds ! ”
89096	89110	89111	89111	he	102	“ They’rekeys ! Winged keys — look carefully . So that must mean … ”
89128	89147	89111	89111	he	102	“ … yes — look ! Broomsticks ! We ’ve got to catch the key to the door ! ”
89148	89155	89156	89156	Ron	195	“ But there arehundreds of them ! ”
89164	89183	89156	89156	Ron	195	“ We ’re looking for a big , old fashioned one — probably silver , like the handle . ”
89294	89298	89299	89299	he	102	“ That one ! ”
89305	89330	89331	89331	Ron	195	“ That big one — there — no , there — with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side . ”
89354	89364	89365	89365	Harry	102	“ We ’ve got to close in on it ! ”
89380	89412	89413	89413	Ron	195	“ Ron , you come at it from above — Hermione , stay below and stop it from going down and I ’ll try and catch it . Right , NOW ! ”
89524	89527	89528	89528	Harry	102	“ Ready ? ”
89643	89650	89651	89651	Harry	102	“ Now what do we do ? ”
89654	89663	89665	89665	Ron	195	“ It ’s obvious , is n’t it ? ”
89667	89679	89665	89665	Ron	195	“ We ’ve got to play our way across the room . ”
89690	89693	89695	89695	Hermione	216	“ How ? ”
89698	89702	89704	89704	Ron	195	“ I think , ”
89706	89716	89717	89717	He	195	“ we ’re going to have to be chessmen . ”
89763	89777	89754	89754	his	2050	“ Do we — er — have to join you to get across ? ”
89790	89814	89783	89783	Ron	195	“ This needs thinking about he said . I suppose we ’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces … ”
89827	89846	89826	89826	he	195	said,“Now , do n’t be offended or anything , but neither of you are that good at chess — ”
89847	89853	89855	89855	Harry	102	“ We ’re not offended , ”
89858	89866	89855	89855	Harry	102	“ Just tell us what to do . ”
89867	89893	89826	89826	he	195	“ Well , Harry , you take the place of that bishop , and Hermione , you go next to him instead of that castle . ”
89894	89899	89855	89855	Harry	102	“ What about you ? ”
89900	89909	89911	89911	Ron	195	“ I ’m going to be a knight , ”
89960	89968	89970	89970	Ron	195	“ White always plays first in chess , ”
89977	89982	89970	89970	Ron	195	“ Yes … look … ”
90019	90030	90031	90031	Their	2054	“ Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right . ”
90066	90073	90075	90075	Ron	195	“ Had to let that happen , ”
90080	90094	90075	90075	Ron	195	“ Leaves you free to take that bishop , Hermione , go on . ”
90161	90167	90168	90168	he	195	“ We ’re nearly there , ”
90172	90181	90168	90168	he	195	“ Let me think — let me think … ”
90192	90195	90197	90197	Ron	195	“ Yes … ”
90200	90214	90197	90197	Ron	195	“ It ’s the only way … I ’ve got to be taken . ”
90215	90218	90219	90219	Harry	102	“ NO ! ”
90224	90229	90231	90231	Ron	195	“ That ’s chess ! ”
90233	90264	90231	90231	Ron	195	“ You ’ve got to make some sacrifices ! I take one step forward and she ’ll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate the king , Harry ! ”
90265	90268	90197	90197	Ron	195	“ But — ”
90269	90279	90197	90197	Ron	195	“ Do you want to stop Snape or not ? ”
90280	90283	90231	90231	Ron	195	“ Ron — ”
90284	90301	90197	90197	Ron	195	“ Look , if you do n’t hurry up , he ’ll already have the Stone ! ”
90307	90310	90311	90311	Ron	195	“ Ready ? ”
90320	90336	90337	90337	He	195	“ Here I go — now , do n’t hang around once you ’ve won . ”
90456	90463	90445	90445	Hermione	216	“ What if he ’s — ? ”
90464	90471	90473	90473	Harry	102	“ He ’ll be all right , ”
90480	90488	90445	90445	Hermione	216	“ What do you reckon ’s next ? ”
90489	90531	90532	90532	They	2069	“ We ’ve had Sprout ’s , that was the Devil ’s Snare ; Flitwick must ’ve put charms on the keys ; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive ; that leaves Quirrell ’s spell , and Snape ’s . ”
90538	90542	90543	90543	Harry	102	“ All right ? ”
90546	90550	90551	90551	Harry	102	“ Go on . ”
90611	90624	90625	90625	Harry	102	“ I ’m glad we did n’t have to fight that one , ”
90638	90647	90648	90648	He	102	“ Come on , I ca n’t breathe . ”
90691	90695	90697	90697	Harry	102	“ Snape ’s , ”
90699	90707	90697	90697	Harry	102	“ What do we have to do ? ”
90756	90759	90760	90760	Hermione	216	“ Look ! ”
90974	90977	90979	90979	Hermione	216	“ Brilliant , ”
90981	91015	90979	90979	Hermione	216	“This is n’t magic — it ’s logic — a puzzle . A lot of the greatest wizards have n’t got an ounce of logic , they ’d be stuck in here forever . ”
91016	91026	90961	90961	she	216	“ But so will we , wo n’t we ? ”
91027	91032	91034	91034	Hermione	216	“ Of course not , ”
91036	91077	91034	91034	Hermione	216	“ Everything we need is here on this paper . Seven bottles : three are poison ; two are wine ; one will get us safely through the black fire , and one will get us back through the purple . ”
91078	91088	90961	90961	she	216	“ But how do we know which to drink ? ”
91089	91095	91096	91096	Hermione	216	“ Give me a minute . ”
91130	91134	91135	91135	she	216	“ Got it , ”
91138	91154	91135	91135	she	216	“ The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire — toward the Stone . ”
91162	91173	91174	91174	he	102	“ There ’s only enough there for one of us , ”
91177	91184	91174	91174	he	102	“ That ’s hardly one swallow . ”
91191	91203	91185	91185	They	2083	“ Which one will get you back through the purple flames ? ”
91218	91223	91225	91225	Harry	102	“ You drink that , ”
91227	91296	91225	91225	Harry	102	“ No , listen , get back and get Ron . Grab brooms from the flying - key room , they ’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore , we need him . I might be able to hold Snape off for a while , but I ’m no match for him , really . ”
91297	91312	91342	91342	Hermione	216	“ But Harry — what if You - Know - Who ’s with him ? ”
91313	91325	91327	91327	Harry	102	“ Well — I was lucky once , was n’t I ? ”
91334	91341	91327	91327	Harry	102	“ I might get lucky again . ”
91360	91363	91348	91348	she	216	“ Hermione ! ”
91364	91375	91327	91327	Harry	102	“ Harry — you’re a great wizard , you know . ”
91376	91385	91387	91387	Harry	102	“ I ’m not as good as you , ”
91399	91402	91404	91404	Hermione	216	“ Me ! ”
91406	91429	91404	91404	Hermione	216	“ Books ! And cleverness ! There are more important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — be careful ! ”
91430	91435	91437	91437	Harry	102	“ You drink first , ”
91439	91451	91437	91437	Harry	102	“ You are sure which is which , are n’t you ? ”
91452	91455	91459	91459	She	216	“ Positive , ”
91475	91481	91483	91483	Harry	102	“ It ’s not poison ? ”
91486	91495	91483	91483	Harry	102	“ No — but it ’s like ice . ”
91496	91506	91437	91437	Harry	102	“ Quick , go , before it wears off . ”
91507	91514	91483	91483	Harry	102	“ Good luck — take care . ”
91515	91518	91519	91519	Hermione	216	“ GO ! ”
91549	91554	91555	91555	he	102	“ Here I come , ”
91652	91655	91657	91657	Harry	102	“ You ! ”
91670	91673	91674	91674	he	172	“ Me , ”
91678	91691	91674	91674	he	172	“ I wondered whether I ’d be meeting you here , Potter . ”
91692	91699	91711	91711	his	172	“ But I thought — Snape — ”
91700	91703	91704	91704	Quirrell	172	“ Severus ? ”
91723	91769	91704	91704	Quirrell	172	“ Yes , Severus does seem the type , does n’t he ? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat . Next to him , who would suspect p - p - poor , st - stuttering P - Professor Quirrell ? ”
91787	91795	91704	91704	Quirrell	172	“ But Snape tried to kill me ! ”
91796	91872	91704	91704	Quirrell	172	“ No , no , no . I tried to kill you . Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match . She broke my eye contact with you . Another few seconds and I ’d have got you off that broom . I ’d have managed it before then if Snape had n’t been muttering a countercurse , trying to save you . ”
91873	91880	91704	91704	Quirrell	172	“ Snape was trying tosave me ? ”
91881	91885	91887	91887	Quirrell	172	“ Of course , ”
91890	91973	91887	91887	Quirrell	172	“ Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match ? He was trying to make sure I did n’t do it again . Funny , really … he need n’t have bothered . I could n’t do anything with Dumbledore watching . All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stopGryffindor from winning , hedid make himself unpopular … and what a waste of time , when after all that , I ’m going to kill you tonight . ”
91992	92029	91974	91974	Quirrell	172	“ You ’re too nosy to live , Potter . Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that , for all I knew you ’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone . ”
92030	92037	91887	91887	Quirrell	172	“ You let the troll in ? ”
92038	92124	91974	91974	Quirrell	172	“ Certainly . I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there ? Unfortunately , while everyone else was running around looking for it , Snape , who already suspected me , went straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death , that three headed dog did n’t even manage to bite Snape ’s leg off properly . “
92140	92161	92132	92132	I	0	” It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell . It was the Mirror of Erised . “
92172	92183	92132	92132	I	0	” Quirrell murmured , tapping his way around the frame . “
92212	92233	92234	92234	I	0	” All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror . “
92243	92248	92236	92236	you	0	” he blurted out . “
92251	92266	92236	92236	you	0	” said Quirrell idly , walking around the mirror to look at the back . “
92311	92326	92327	92327	I	0	” Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it . “
92345	92373	92388	92388	he	258	” Harry struggled against the ropes binding him , but they did n’t give . Hehad to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror . “
92384	92385	92375	92375	Snape	258	” “
92391	92396	92388	92388	he	258	” said Quirrell casually , “
92425	92426	92420	92420	he	258	” “
92445	92461	92440	92440	Snape	258	” For the first time , a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell ’s face . “
92464	92468	92469	92469	I	0	” he said , “
92490	92491	92494	92494	he	2088	” “
92503	92507	92494	92494	he	2088	” Harry gasped . “
92516	92521	92508	92508	He	2088	” said Quirrell quietly . “
92605	92610	92595	92595	He	2088	” Quirrell shivered suddenly . “
92649	92694	92633	92633	He	2088	” Quirrell ’s voice trailed away . Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley how could he have been so stupid ? He’dseen Quirrell there that very day , shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron . Quirrell cursed under his breath . “
92711	92829	92707	92707	I	0	” Harry ’s mind was racing . What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment , he thought , is to find the Stone before Quirrell does . So if I look in the mirror , I should see myseff finding it — which means I ’ll see where it ’s hidden ! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I ’m up to ? He tried to edge to the left , to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing , but the ropes around his ankles were too tight : he tripped and fell over . Quirrell ignored him . He was still talking to himself . “
92846	92867	92844	92844	Master	2099	” And to Harry ’s horror , a voice answered , and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself . “
92876	92882	92873	92874	the boy	428	” Quirrell rounded on Harry . “
92890	92912	92885	92885	Potter	102	” He clapped his hands once , and the ropes binding Harry fell off . Harry got slowly to his feet . “
92916	92920	92885	92885	Potter	102	” Quirrell repeated . “
92932	93072	92929	92929	you	102	” Harry walked toward him . I must lie , he thought desperately . I must look and lie about what I see , that ’s all . Quirrell moved close behind him . Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell ’s turban . He closed his eyes , stepped in front of the mirror , and opened them again . He saw his reflection , pale and scared looking at first . But a moment later , the reflection smiled at him . It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood red stone . It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket — and as it did so , Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket . Somehow — incredibly — he’d gotten the Stone . “
93075	93080	92929	92929	you	102	” said Quirrell impatiently . “
93086	93093	93083	93083	you	2102	” Harry screwed up his courage . “
93102	93106	93107	93107	I	0	” he invented . “
93117	93122	93109	93109	I’ve	0	” Quirrell cursed again . “
93129	93177	93178	93178	He	120	” he said . As Harry moved aside , he felt the Sorcerer ’s Stone against his leg . Dare he make a break for it ? But he had n’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke , though Quirrell was n’t moving his lips . “
93184	93185	93181	93181	He	120	” “
93192	93196	93186	93186	Potter	102	” Quirrell shouted . “
93208	93215	93204	93204	you	102	” The high voice spoke again . “
93228	93229	93217	93217	me	0	” “
93238	93239	93232	93232	you	2099	” “
93248	93368	93240	93240	I	0	” Harry felt as if Devil ’s Snare was rooting him to the spot . He could n’t move a muscle . Petrified , he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban . What was going on ? The turban fell away . Quirrell ’s head looked strangely small without it . Then he turned slowly on the spot . Harry would have screamed , but he could n’t make a sound . Where there should have been a back to Quirrell ’s head , there was a face , the most terrible face Harry had ever seen . It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils , like a snake . “
93372	93390	93369	93370	Harry Potter	102	” it whispered . Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs would n’t move . “
93397	93402	93393	93393	I	0	” the face said . “
93493	93512	93484	93484	you	2105	” So he knew . The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry ’s legs . He stumbled backward . “
93519	93524	93516	93517	a fool	2107	” snarled the face . “
93552	93553	93545	93545	They	2273	” “
93556	93583	93545	93545	They	2273	” Harry shouted suddenly . Quirrell was walking backward at him , so that Voldemort could still see him . The evil face was now smiling . “
93587	93591	93545	93545	They	2273	” it hissed . “
93651	93652	93642	93642	you	2105	” “
93655	93665	93666	93666	HIM	2113	” Harry sprang toward the flame door , but Voldemort screamed“SEIZE
93668	93767	93666	93666	HIM	2113	” and the next second , Harry felt Quirrell ’s hand close on his wrist . At once , a needle sharp pain seared across Harry ’s scar ; his head felt as though it was about to split in two ; he yelled , struggling with all his might , and to his surprise , Quirrell let go of him . The pain in his head lessened — he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone , and saw him hunched in pain , looking at his fingers — they were blistering before his eyes . “
93774	93822	93823	93823	Master	2114	” shrieked Voldemort again , and Quirrell lunged , knocking Harry clean off his feet , landing on top of him , both hands around Harry ’s neck — Harry ’s scar was almost blinding him with pain , yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony . “
93837	93880	93825	93825	I	0	” And Quirrell , though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees , let go of his neck and stared , bewildered , at his own palms — Harry could see they looked burned , raw , red , and shiny . “
93891	93919	93825	93825	I	0	” screeched Voldemort . Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse , but Harry , by instinct , reached up and grabbed Quirrell ’s face — “
93922	94034	93825	93825	I	0	” Quirrell rolled off him , his face blistering , too , and then Harry knew : Quirrell could n’t touch his bare skin , not without suffering terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell , keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse . Harry jumped to his feet , caught Quirrell by the arm , and hung on as tight as he could . Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry ’s head was building — he could n’t see — he could only hear Quirrell ’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort ’s yells of , “
94041	94055	94056	94056	Harry	102	” and other voices , maybe in Harry ’s own head , crying , “
94060	94148	94058	94058	Harry	102	” He felt Quirrell ’s arm wrenched from his grasp , knew all was lost , and fell into blackness , down … down … down … Something gold was glinting just above him . The Snitch ! He tried to catch it , but his arms were too heavy . He blinked . It was n’t the Snitch at all . It was a pair of glasses . How strange . He blinked again . The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him . “
94154	94167	94168	94168	Sir	2264	” said Dumbledore . Harry stared at him . Then he remembered : “
94187	94188	94183	94183	Sir	2264	” “
94203	94207	94208	94208	Quirrell	172	” said Dumbledore . “
94215	94216	94208	94208	Quirrell	172	” “
94225	94226	94227	94227	Harry	102	” “
94241	94288	94233	94234	Madam Pomfrey	115	” Harry swallowed and looked around him . He realized he must be in the hospital wing . He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets , and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop . “
94296	94302	94233	94234	Madam Pomfrey	115	” said Dumbledore , beaming . “
94373	94374	94356	94357	Madam Pomfrey	115	” “
94383	94384	94378	94378	I	0	” “

94525	94526	94529	94529	you	102	” “
94531	94532	94529	94529	you	102	” “

94598	94599	94622	94622	Nicolas	210	” “
94602	94607	94622	94622	Nicolas	210	” said Harry blankly . “
94615	94616	94612	94613	Nicolas Flamel	210	” “
94624	94632	94622	94622	Nicolas	210	” said Dumbledore , sounding quite delighted . “
94663	94664	94645	94645	Nicolas	210	” “
94679	94680	94681	94681	They	2133	” “
94701	94714	94681	94681	They	2133	” Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry ’s face . “
94821	94840	94841	94841	Sir	2264	” Harry lay there , lost for words . Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling . “
94843	94847	94841	94841	Sir	2264	” said Harry . “
94874	94875	94865	94865	I	0	” “
94901	94902	94905	94905	sir	2264	” “
94935	94936	94933	94933	he	114	” “
95042	95059	95073	95073	you	2141	” Harry nodded , but stopped quickly , because it made his head hurt . Then he said,“Sir
95087	95088	95079	95079	I	0	” “
95092	95096	95079	95079	I	0	” Dumbledore sighed . “
95150	95151	95141	95141	I	0	” “
95185	95193	95175	95175	he	114	” Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time . “
95254	95266	95250	95250	you	2141	” And Harry knew it would be no good to argue . “
95275	95276	95271	95271	Quirrell	172	” “
95394	95429	95386	95392	a person marked by something so good	2148	” Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill , which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet . When he had found his voice again , Harry said,“And
95443	95444	95435	95435	you	2141	” “
95465	95471	95458	95458	I	0	” Dumbledore ’s eyes twinkled . “
95494	95495	95475	95476	your father	956	” “
95502	95503	95475	95476	your father	956	” “
95507	95508	95509	95509	Quirrell	172	” “
95513	95514	95511	95511	Snape	258	” “
95520	95521	95524	95524	him	258	” “
95541	95542	95526	95526	Quirrell	172	” “
95571	95572	95562	95563	your father	956	” “
95575	95576	95577	95577	He	258	” “
95582	95583	95577	95577	He	258	” “
95586	95587	95577	95577	He	258	” “
95590	95595	95577	95577	He	258	” said Dumbledore dreamily . “
95659	95676	95646	95646	he	258	” Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound , so he stopped . “
95686	95687	95646	95646	he	258	” “
95692	95693	95646	95646	he	258	” “
95705	95706	95646	95646	he	258	” “
95855	95872	95853	95853	you	2264	” He smiled and popped the golden brown bean into his mouth . Then he choked and said,“Alas
95877	95893	95853	95853	you	2264	” Madam Pomfrey , the nurse , was a nice woman , but very strict . “
95898	95902	95853	95853	you	2264	” Harry pleaded . “
95906	95907	95908	95908	You	2264	” “
95914	95915	95908	95908	You	2264	” “
95932	95933	95929	95929	You	2264	” “
95953	95954	95950	95951	Madam Pomfrey	115	” “
95960	95964	95950	95951	Madam Pomfrey	115	” she said . “
95969	95978	95979	95979	Harry	102	” And she let Ron and Hermione in . “
95981	96009	95979	95979	Harry	102	” Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again , but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore . “
96027	96028	96022	96022	Dumbledore	120	” “
96037	96041	96022	96022	Dumbledore	120	” said Ron . “
96045	96118	96022	96022	Dumbledore	120	” It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors . Harry told them everything : Quirrell ; the mirror ; the Stone ; and Voldemort . Ron and Hermione were a very good audience ; they gasped in all the right places , and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell ’s turban , Hermione screamed out loud . “
96125	96130	96131	96131	Flamel	210	” said Ron finally . “
96137	96138	96131	96131	Flamel	210	” “
96167	96168	96172	96172	he	120	” “
96178	96192	96169	96169	I	0	” said Ron , looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was . “
96200	96204	96197	96197	you	2165	” said Harry . “
96213	96217	96207	96207	I	0	” said Hermione . “
96276	96277	96252	96252	he	120	” “
96287	96291	96280	96280	he	120	” said Ron . “
96301	96302	96280	96280	he	120	” “
96305	96307	96308	96308	he	120	” Hermione exploded,“if
96325	96326	96308	96308	he	120	” “
96333	96338	96308	96308	he	120	” said Harry thoughtfully . “
96438	96439	96425	96425	he	120	” “
96451	96456	96445	96445	his	120	” said Ron proudly . “
96506	96516	96517	96517	You	0	” At that moment , Madam Pomfrey bustled over . “
96527	96546	96517	96517	You	0	” she said firmly . After a good night ’s sleep , Harry felt nearly back to normal . “
96555	96568	96569	96569	I	0	” he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes . “
96576	96577	96578	96579	Professor Dumbledore	120	” “
96589	96610	96578	96579	Professor Dumbledore	120	” she said stiffily , as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore did n’t realize how risky feasts could be . “
96617	96618	96614	96615	another visitor	2174	” “
96623	96627	96614	96615	another visitor	2174	” said Harry . “
96632	96675	96578	96579	Professor Dumbledore	120	” Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke . As usual when he was indoors , Hagrid looked too big to be allowed . He sat down next to Harry , took one look at him , and burst into tears . “
96686	96696	96697	96697	I	0	” he sobbed , his face in his hands . “
96759	96760	96761	96761	Hagrid	119	” “
96763	96785	96786	96786	Hagrid	119	” said Harry , shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse , great tears leaking down into his beard . “
96816	96817	96810	96810	you	119	” “
96823	96827	96810	96810	you	119	” sobbed Hagrid . “
96836	96837	96838	96838	VOLDEMORT	114	” “
96840	96854	96855	96855	I	0	” Harry bellowed , and Hagrid was so shocked , he stopped crying . “
96899	96911	96913	96913	me	0	” Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said,“That
96922	96923	96915	96915	I	0	” “
96934	96948	96965	96965	he	120	” said Harry anxiously , and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle . “
96977	97015	96965	96965	he	120	” It seemed to be a handsome , leather covered book . Harry opened it curiously . It was full of wizard photographs . Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father . “
97044	97200	96965	96965	he	120	” Harry could n’t speak , but Hagrid understood . Harry made his way down to the end of year feast alone that night . He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey ’s fussing about , insisting on giving him one last checkup , so the Great Hall was already full . It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin ’s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row . A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table . When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush , and then everybody started talking loudly at once . He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him . Fortunately , Dumbledore arrived moments later . The babble died away . “
97205	97210	96965	96965	he	120	” Dumbledore said cheerfully . “
97269	97332	97396	97397	The Slytherins	254	“ Now , as I understand it , the house cup here needs awarding , and the points stand thus : In fourth place , Gryffindor , with three hundred and twelve points ; in third , Hufflepuff , with three hundred and fifty two ; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty six and Slytherin , four hundred and seventy - two . ”
97364	97374	97376	97376	Dumbledore	120	“ Yes , yes , well done , Slytherin , ”
97378	97389	97376	97376	Dumbledore	120	“ However , recent events must be taken into account . ”
97404	97407	97409	97409	Dumbledore	120	“ Ahem , ”
97411	97429	97409	97409	Dumbledore	120	“ I have a few last minute points to dish out . Let me see . Yes … “
97437	97455	97433	97435	Mr. Ronald Weasley	280	” Ron went purple in the face ; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn . “
97478	97501	97471	97471	I	0	” Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling ; the stars overhead seemed to quiver . Percy could be heard telling the other prefects,“My
97519	97527	97513	97513	McGonagall	111	” At last there was silence again . “
97554	97589	97547	97547	I	0	” Hermione buried her face in her arms ; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears . Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves — they were a hundred points up . “
97597	97606	97593	97595	Mr. Harry Potter	102	” said Dumbledore . The room went deadly quiet “
97622	97685	97615	97615	I	0	” The din was deafening . Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy two points — exactly the same as Slytherin . They had tied for the house cup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point . Dumbledore raised his hand . The room gradually fell silent . “
97693	97699	97615	97615	I	0	” said Dumbledore , smiling . “
97735	97844	97731	97733	Mr. Neville Longbottom	196	” Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place , so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table . Harry , Ron , and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville , white with shock , disappeared under a pile of people hugging him . He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before . Harry , still cheering , nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy , who could n’t have looked more stunned and horrified if he ’d just had the Body Bind Curse put on him . “
97848	97869	97731	97733	Mr. Neville Longbottom	196	” Dumbledore called over the storm of applause , for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin , “
97878	98165	98166	98166	I	0	” He clapped his hands . In an instant , the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold ; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place . Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall ’s hand , with a horrible , forced smile . He caught Harry ’s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape ’s feelings toward him had n’t changed one jot . This did n’t worry Harry . It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year , or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts . It was the best evening of Harry ’s life , better than winning at Quidditch , or Christmas , or knocking out mountain trolls … he would never , ever forget tonight . Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come , but come they did . To their great surprise , both he and Ron passed with good marks ; Hermione , of course , had the best grades of the first years . Even Neville scraped through , his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one . They had hoped that Goyle , who was almost as stupid as he was mean , might be thrown out , but he had passed , too . It was a shame , but as Ron said , you could n’t have everything in life . And suddenly , their wardrobes were empty , their trunks were packed , Neville ’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets ; notes were handed out to all students , warning them not to use magic over the holidays ( “
98177	98316	98169	98169	they	2192	” said Fred Weasley sadly ) ; Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake ; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express ; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier ; eating Bettie Bott ’s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns ; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats ; pulling into platform nine and three - quarters at King ’s Cross Station . It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform . A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier , letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they did n’t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles . “
98325	98329	98169	98169	they	2192	” said Ron , “
98340	98341	98334	98334	I’ll	2195	” “
98344	98348	98334	98334	I’ll	2195	” said Harry , “
98358	98380	98334	98334	I’ll	2195	” People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world . Some of them called : “
98385	98386	98383	98383	Harry	102	” “
98392	98393	98390	98390	Potter	102	” “
98397	98405	98390	98390	Potter	102	” said Ron , grinning at him . “
98416	98432	98433	98433	he	102	” said Harry . He , Ron , and Hermione passed through the gateway together . “There
98444	98463	98439	98439	he	102	” It was Ginny Weasley , Ron ’s younger sister , but she was n’t pointing at Ron . “
98467	98471	98464	98465	Harry Potter	102	” she squealed . “
98480	98481	98474	98474	Mom	200	” “
98494	98502	98485	98485	Ginny	191	” Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them . “
98506	98510	98474	98474	Mom	200	” she said . “
