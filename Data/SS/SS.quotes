1091	1134	1136	1136	He	85	" Yes , he would give them three thousand pounds : it would be liberal and handsome ! It would be enough to make them completely easy . Three thousand pounds ! he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience . "
2162	2173	2175	2176	her husband	324	" It was my father 's last request to me , "
2178	2188	2175	2176	her husband	324	" that I should assist his widow and daughters . "
2189	2248	2175	2176	her husband	324	" He did not know what he was talking of , I dare say ; ten to one but he was light - headed at the time . Had he been in his right senses , he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child . "
2249	2371	2175	2176	her husband	324	" He did not stipulate for any particular sum , my dear Fanny ; he only requested me , in general terms , to assist them , and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do . Perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself . He could hardly suppose I should neglect them . But as he required the promise , I could not do less than give it ; at least I thought so at the time . The promise , therefore , was given , and must be performed . Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home . "
2372	2396	2397	2397	she	376	" Well , then , LET something be done for them ; but THAT something need not be three thousand pounds . Consider , "
2400	2442	2397	2397	she	376	" that when the money is once parted with , it never can return . Your sisters will marry , and it will be gone for ever . If , indeed , it could be restored to our poor little boy — "
2443	2450	2452	2453	her husband	324	" Why , to be sure , "
2458	2501	2452	2453	her husband	324	" that would make great difference . The time may come when Harold will regret that so large a sum was parted with . If he should have a numerous family , for instance , it would be a very convenient addition . "
2502	2509	2175	2176	her husband	324	" To be sure it would . "
2510	2541	2452	2453	her husband	324	" Perhaps , then , it would be better for all parties , if the sum were diminished one half.—Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes ! "
2542	2583	2175	2176	her husband	324	" Oh ! beyond anything great ! What brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters , even if REALLY his sisters ! And as it is — only half blood!—But you have such a generous spirit ! "
2584	2595	2596	2596	he	324	" I would not wish to do any thing mean , "
2599	2640	2596	2596	he	324	" One had rather , on such occasions , do too much than too little . No one , at least , can think I have not done enough for them : even themselves , they can hardly expect more . "
2641	2651	2653	2654	the lady	378	" There is no knowing what THEY may expect , "
2656	2678	2653	2654	the lady	378	" but we are not to think of their expectations : the question is , what you can afford to do . "
2679	2731	2596	2596	he	324	" Certainly — and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds a - piece . As it is , without any addition of mine , they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother 's death — a very comfortable fortune for any young woman . "
2732	2798	2653	2654	the lady	378	" To be sure it is ; and , indeed , it strikes me that they can want no addition at all . They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them . If they marry , they will be sure of doing well , and if they do not , they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds . "
2799	2871	2596	2596	he	324	" That is very true , and , therefore , I do not know whether , upon the whole , it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives , rather than for them — something of the annuity kind I mean.—My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself . A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable . "
2888	2893	2895	2895	she	286	" To be sure , "
2897	2928	2895	2895	she	286	" it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once . But , then , if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in . "
2929	2947	2653	2654	the lady	378	" Fifteen years ! my dear Fanny ; her life can not be worth half that purchase . "
2948	3191	2895	2895	she	286	" Certainly not ; but if you observe , people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them ; and she is very stout and healthy , and hardly forty . An annuity is a very serious business ; it comes over and over every year , and there is no getting rid of it . You are not aware of what you are doing . I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities ; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father 's will , and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it . Twice every year these annuities were to be paid ; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them ; and then one of them was said to have died , and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing . My mother was quite sick of it . Her income was not her own , she said , with such perpetual claims on it ; and it was the more unkind in my father , because , otherwise , the money would have been entirely at my mother 's disposal , without any restriction whatever . It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities , that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world . "
3192	3200	3202	3203	Mr. Dashwood	85	" It is certainly an unpleasant thing , "
3205	3265	3202	3203	Mr. Dashwood	85	" to have those kind of yearly drains on one 's income . One 's fortune , as your mother justly says , is NOT one 's own . To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum , on every rent day , is by no means desirable : it takes away one 's independence . "
3266	3351	2895	2895	she	286	" Undoubtedly ; and after all you have no thanks for it . They think themselves secure , you do no more than what is expected , and it raises no gratitude at all . If I were you , whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely . I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly . It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred , or even fifty pounds from our own expenses . "
3352	3470	3202	3203	Mr. Dashwood	85	" I believe you are right , my love ; it will be better that there should by no annuity in the case ; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance , because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income , and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year . It will certainly be much the best way . A present of fifty pounds , now and then , will prevent their ever being distressed for money , and will , I think , be amply discharging my promise to my father . "
3471	3785	2895	2895	she	286	" To be sure it will . Indeed , to say the truth , I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all . The assistance he thought of , I dare say , was only such as might be reasonably expected of you ; for instance , such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them , helping them to move their things , and sending them presents of fish and game , and so forth , whenever they are in season . I 'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther ; indeed , it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did . Do but consider , my dear Mr. Dashwood , how excessively comfortable your mother - in - law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds , besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls , which brings them in fifty pounds a year a - piece , and , of course , they will pay their mother for their board out of it . Altogether , they will have five hundred a - year amongst them , and what on earth can four women want for more than that?—They will live so cheap ! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all . They will have no carriage , no horses , and hardly any servants ; they will keep no company , and can have no expenses of any kind ! Only conceive how comfortable they will be ! Five hundred a year ! I am sure I can not imagine how they will spend half of it ; and as to your giving them more , it is quite absurd to think of it . They will be much more able to give YOU something . "
3786	3791	3793	3794	Mr. Dashwood	85	" Upon my word , "
3796	3881	3793	3794	Mr. Dashwood	85	" I believe you are perfectly right . My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say . I clearly understand it now , and I will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described . When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can . Some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then . "
3882	3885	3887	3887	Fanny	87	" Certainly , "
3889	3952	3887	3887	Fanny	87	" But , however , ONE thing must be considered . When your father and mother moved to Norland , though the furniture of Stanhill was sold , all the china , plate , and linen was saved , and is now left to your mother . Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it . "
3953	3985	3793	3794	Mr. Dashwood	85	" That is a material consideration undoubtedly . A valuable legacy indeed ! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here . "
3986	4085	3887	3887	Fanny	87	" Yes ; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house . A great deal too handsome , in my opinion , for any place THEY can ever afford to live in . But , however , so it is . Your father thought only of THEM . And I must say this : that you owe no particular gratitude to him , nor attention to his wishes ; for we very well know that if he could , he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM . "
5082	5087	5089	5089	she	86	" It is enough , "
5091	5112	5089	5089	she	86	" to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough . It implies everything amiable . I love him already . "
5113	5121	5123	5123	Elinor	88	" I think you will like him , "
5125	5133	5123	5123	Elinor	88	" when you know more of him . "
5134	5138	5140	5141	her mother	338	" Like him ! "
5146	5157	5140	5141	her mother	338	" I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love . "
5158	5164	5140	5141	her mother	338	" You may esteem him . "
5165	5180	5140	5141	her mother	338	" I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love . "
5307	5317	5319	5319	she	86	" In a few months , my dear Marianne . "
5321	5344	5319	5319	she	86	" Elinor will , in all probability be settled for life . We shall miss her ; but SHE will be happy . "
5345	5357	5276	5276	she	86	" Oh ! Mamma , how shall we do without her ? "
5358	5429	5319	5319	she	86	" My love , it will be scarcely a separation . We shall live within a few miles of each other , and shall meet every day of our lives . You will gain a brother , a real , affectionate brother . I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward 's heart . But you look grave , Marianne ; do you disapprove your sister 's choice ? "
5430	5433	5435	5435	Marianne	89	" Perhaps , "
5437	5727	5435	5435	Marianne	89	" I may consider it with some surprise . Edward is very amiable , and I love him tenderly . But yet — he is not the kind of young man — there is something wanting — his figure is not striking ; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister . His eyes want all that spirit , that fire , which at once announce virtue and intelligence . And besides all this , I am afraid , Mamma , he has no real taste . Music seems scarcely to attract him , and though he admires Elinor 's drawings very much , it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth . It is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter . He admires as a lover , not as a connoisseur . To satisfy me , those characters must be united . I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own . He must enter into all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both . Oh ! mama , how spiritless , how tame was Edward 's manner in reading to us last night ! I felt for my sister most severely . Yet she bore it with so much composure , she seemed scarcely to notice it . I could hardly keep my seat . To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild , pronounced with such impenetrable calmness , such dreadful indifference ! "
5729	5757	5319	5319	she	86	" He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose . I thought so at the time ; but you WOULD give him Cowper . "
5758	5879	5435	5435	Marianne	89	" Nay , Mamma , if he is not to be animated by Cowper ! — but we must allow for difference of taste . Elinor has not my feelings , and therefore she may overlook it , and be happy with him . But it would have broke MY heart , had I loved him , to hear him read with so little sensibility . Mama , the more I know of the world , the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love . I require so much ! He must have all Edward 's virtues , and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm . "
5880	5933	5319	5319	she	86	" Remember , my love , that you are not seventeen . It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness . Why should you be less fortunate than your mother ? In one circumstance only , my Marianne , may your destiny be different from her 's ! "
5934	5943	5945	5945	Marianne	89	" What a pity it is , Elinor , "
5947	5957	5945	5945	Marianne	89	" that Edward should have no taste for drawing . "
5958	5964	5966	5966	Elinor	88	" No taste for drawing ! "
5968	6082	5966	5966	Elinor	88	" why should you think so ? He does not draw himself , indeed , but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people , and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste , though he has not had opportunities of improving it . Had he ever been in the way of learning , I think he would have drawn very well . He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much , that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture ; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste , which in general direct him perfectly right . "
6160	6166	6168	6168	Elinor	88	" I hope , Marianne , "
6170	6221	6168	6168	Elinor	88	" you do not consider him as deficient in general taste . Indeed , I think I may say that you can not , for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial , and if THAT were your opinion , I am sure you could never be civil to him . "
6259	6336	6256	6256	she	89	" Do not be offended , Elinor , if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits . I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind , his inclinations and tastes , as you have ; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense . I think him every thing that is worthy and amiable . "
6337	6342	6344	6344	Elinor	88	" I am sure , "
6350	6377	6344	6344	Elinor	88	" that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that . I do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly . "
6389	6397	6399	6399	Elinor	88	" Of his sense and his goodness , "
6401	6664	6399	6399	Elinor	88	" no one can , I think , be in doubt , who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation . The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent . You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth . But of his minuter propensities , as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself . He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together , while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother . I have seen a great deal of him , have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste ; and , upon the whole , I venture to pronounce that his mind is well - informed , enjoyment of books exceedingly great , his imagination lively , his observation just and correct , and his taste delicate and pure . His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person . At first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his person can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance , is perceived . At present , I know him so well , that I think him really handsome ; or at least , almost so . What say you , Marianne ? "
6665	6711	6755	6755	she	88	" I shall very soon think him handsome , Elinor , if I do not now . When you tell me to love him as a brother , I shall no more see imperfection in his face , than I now do in his heart . "
6821	6829	6831	6831	she	88	" I do not attempt to deny , "
6833	6852	6831	6831	she	88	" that I think very highly of him — that I greatly esteem , that I like him . "
6860	6899	6853	6853	Marianne	89	" Esteem him ! Like him ! Cold - hearted Elinor ! Oh ! worse than cold - hearted ! Ashamed of being otherwise . Use those words again , and I will leave the room this moment . "
6906	6910	6912	6912	she	88	" Excuse me , "
6914	7157	6912	6912	she	88	" and be assured that I meant no offence to you , by speaking , in so quiet a way , of my own feelings . Believe them to be stronger than I have declared ; believe them , in short , to be such as his merit , and the suspicion — the hope of his affection for me may warrant , without imprudence or folly . But farther than this you must not believe . I am by no means assured of his regard for me . There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you can not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is . In my heart I feel little — scarcely any doubt of his preference . But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination . He is very far from being independent . What his mother really is we can not know ; but , from Fanny 's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank . "
7177	7187	7189	7189	she	89	" And you really are not engaged to him ! "
7191	7267	7189	7189	she	89	" Yet it certainly soon will happen . But two advantages will proceed from this delay . I shall not lose you so soon , and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity . Oh ! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself , how delightful it would be ! "
8322	8345	8346	8346	She	87	" Devonshire ! Are you , indeed , going there ? So far from hence ! And to what part of it ? "
8360	8367	8368	8368	she	87	" It is but a cottage , "
8371	8419	8368	8368	she	87	" but I hope to see many of my friends in it . A room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , I am sure I will find none in accommodating them . "
9206	9212	9214	9214	Marianne	89	" Dear , dear Norland ! "
9233	9342	9217	9217	she	89	" when shall I cease to regret you!—when learn to feel a home elsewhere!—Oh ! happy house , could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps I may view you no more!—And you , ye well - known trees!—but you will continue the same.—No leaf will decay because we are removed , nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer!—No ; you will continue the same ; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion , and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade!—But who will remain to enjoy you ? "
9853	9864	9866	9866	she	86	" As for the house itself , to be sure , "
9868	10063	9866	9866	she	86	" it is too small for our family , but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present , as it is too late in the year for improvements . Perhaps in the spring , if I have plenty of money , as I dare say I shall , we may think about building . These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here ; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other , and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance ; this , with a new drawing room which may be easily added , and a bed - chamber and garret above , will make it a very snug little cottage . I could wish the stairs were handsome . But one must not expect every thing ; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them . I shall see how much I am before - hand with the world in the spring , and we will plan our improvements accordingly . "
12724	12818	12678	12679	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" But at least , Mamma , you can not deny the absurdity of the accusation , though you may not think it intentionally ill - natured . Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings , but he is old enough to be MY father ; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love , must have long outlived every sensation of the kind . It is too ridiculous ! When is a man to be safe from such wit , if age and infirmity will not protect him ? "
12819	12822	12824	12824	Elinor	88	" Infirmity ! "
12826	12868	12824	12824	Elinor	88	" do you call Colonel Brandon infirm ? I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother ; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs ! "
12869	12891	12678	12679	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism ? and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life ? "
12892	12897	12899	12900	her mother	338	" My dearest child , "
12904	12939	12899	12900	her mother	338	" at this rate you must be in continual terror of MY decay ; and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty . "
12940	12994	12678	12679	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" Mamma , you are not doing me justice . I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature . He may live twenty years longer . But thirty - five has nothing to do with matrimony . "
12995	12998	13000	13000	Elinor	88	" Perhaps , "
13002	13058	13000	13000	Elinor	88	" thirty - five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together . But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty , I should not think Colonel Brandon 's being thirty - five any objection to his marrying HER . "
13059	13067	13069	13069	Marianne	89	" A woman of seven and twenty , "
13076	13197	13069	13069	Marianne	89	" can never hope to feel or inspire affection again , and if her home be uncomfortable , or her fortune small , I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse , for the sake of the provision and security of a wife . In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable . It would be a compact of convenience , and the world would be satisfied . In my eyes it would be no marriage at all , but that would be nothing . To me it would seem only a commercial exchange , in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other . "
13198	13207	13209	13209	Elinor	88	" It would be impossible , I know , "
13211	13292	13209	13209	Elinor	88	" to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty - five anything near enough to love , to make him a desirable companion to her . But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber , merely because he chanced to complain yesterday ( a very cold damp day ) of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders . "
13293	13301	13303	13303	Marianne	89	" But he talked of flannel waistcoats , "
13305	13336	13303	13303	Marianne	89	" and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches , cramps , rheumatisms , and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble . "
13337	13383	13069	13069	Marianne	89	" Had he been only in a violent fever , you would not have despised him half so much . Confess , Marianne , is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek , hollow eye , and quick pulse of a fever ? "
13395	13398	13400	13400	Marianne	89	" Mamma , "
13402	13463	13400	13400	Marianne	89	" I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I can not conceal from you . I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well . We have now been here almost a fortnight , and yet he does not come . Nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay . What else can detain him at Norland ? "
13464	13475	13477	13478	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" Had you any idea of his coming so soon ? "
13480	13536	13477	13478	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" I had none . On the contrary , if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject , it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation , when I talked of his coming to Barton . Does Elinor expect him already ? "
13537	13552	13303	13303	Marianne	89	" I have never mentioned it to her , but of course she must . "
13553	13605	13477	13478	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" I rather think you are mistaken , for when I was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber , she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it , as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time . "
13606	13756	13303	13303	Marianne	89	" How strange this is ! what can be the meaning of it ! But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable ! How cold , how composed were their last adieus ! How languid their conversation the last evening of their being together ! In Edward 's farewell there was no distinction between Elinor and me : it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both . Twice did I leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning , and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room . And Elinor , in quitting Norland and Edward , cried not as I did . Even now her self - command is invariable . When is she dejected or melancholy ? When does she try to avoid society , or appear restless and dissatisfied in it ? "
14269	14278	14280	14280	Marianne	89	" Is there a felicity in the world , "
14282	14296	14280	14280	Marianne	89	" superior to this?—Margaret , we will walk here at least two hours . "
15106	15109	15111	15112	Sir John	99	" Willoughby ! "
15114	15143	15111	15112	Sir John	99	" what , is HE in the country ? That is good news however ; I will ride over tomorrow , and ask him to dinner on Thursday . "
15144	15150	15152	15153	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" You know him then , "
15155	15174	15111	15112	Sir John	99	" Know him ! to be sure I do . Why , he is down here every year . "
15175	15186	15111	15112	Sir John	99	" And what sort of a young man is he ? "
15187	15217	15111	15112	Sir John	99	" As good a kind of fellow as ever lived , I assure you . A very decent shot , and there is not a bolder rider in England . "
15218	15229	15231	15231	Marianne	89	" And is that all you can say for him ? "
15235	15256	15231	15231	Marianne	89	" But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance ? What his pursuits , his talents , and genius ? "
15263	15268	15270	15270	he	99	" Upon my soul , "
15272	15317	15270	15270	he	99	" I do not know much about him as to all THAT . But he is a pleasant , good humoured fellow , and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw . Was she out with him today ? "
15347	15353	15355	15355	Elinor	88	" But who is he ? "
15357	15371	15355	15355	Elinor	88	" Where does he come from ? Has he a house at Allenham ? "
15432	15515	15384	15384	he	99	" Yes , yes , he is very well worth catching I can tell you , Miss Dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides ; and if I were you , I would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills . Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself . Brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care . "
15516	15522	15524	15525	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" I do not believe , "
15533	15612	15524	15525	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what you call CATCHING him . It is not an employment to which they have been brought up . Men are very safe with us , let them be ever so rich . I am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible . "
15613	15630	15632	15633	Sir John	99	" He is as good a sort of fellow , I believe , as ever lived , "
15635	15661	15632	15633	Sir John	99	" I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park , he danced from eight o'clock till four , without once sitting down . "
15662	15667	15669	15669	Marianne	89	" Did he indeed ? "
15674	15682	15669	15669	Marianne	89	" and with elegance , with spirit ? "
15683	15698	15524	15525	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" Yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert . "
15699	15738	15669	15669	Marianne	89	" That is what I like ; that is what a young man ought to be . Whatever be his pursuits , his eagerness in them should know no moderation , and leave him no sense of fatigue . "
15739	15751	15753	15754	Sir John	99	" Aye , aye , I see how it will be , "
15756	15781	15753	15754	Sir John	99	" I see how it will be . You will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor Brandon . "
15782	15791	15793	15793	Marianne	89	" That is an expression , Sir John , "
15797	15867	15793	15793	Marianne	89	" which I particularly dislike . I abhor every common - place phrase by which wit is intended ; and ' setting one 's cap at a man , ' or ' making a conquest , ' are the most odious of all . Their tendency is gross and illiberal ; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever , time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity . "
15891	15946	15878	15878	he	99	" Ay , you will make conquests enough , I dare say , one way or other . Poor Brandon ! he is quite smitten already , and he is very well worth setting your cap at , I can tell you , in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles . "
16505	16510	16512	16512	Elinor	88	" Well , Marianne , "
16522	16642	16512	16512	Elinor	88	" for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well . You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby 's opinion in almost every matter of importance . You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott ; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought , and you have received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper . But how is your acquaintance to be long supported , under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse ? You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic . Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty , and second marriages , and then you can have nothing farther to ask . "
16644	16647	16649	16649	Marianne	89	" Elinor , "
16651	16749	16649	16649	Marianne	89	" is this fair ? is this just ? are my ideas so scanty ? But I see what you mean . I have been too much at my ease , too happy , too frank . I have erred against every common - place notion of decorum ; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been reserved , spiritless , dull , and deceitful — had I talked only of the weather and the roads , and had I spoken only once in ten minutes , this reproach would have been spared . "
16750	16754	16756	16757	her mother	338	" My love , "
16759	16798	16756	16757	her mother	338	" you must not be offended with Elinor — she was only in jest . I should scold her myself , if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend . "
17582	17591	17593	17593	Willoughby	106	" Brandon is just the kind of man , "
17605	17632	17593	17593	Willoughby	106	" whom every body speaks well of , and nobody cares about ; whom all are delighted to see , and nobody remembers to talk to . "
17633	17643	17645	17645	Marianne	89	" That is exactly what I think of him , "
17647	17656	17658	17658	Elinor	88	" Do not boast of it , however , "
17660	17696	17658	17658	Elinor	88	" for it is injustice in both of you . He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park , and I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him . "
17697	17705	17707	17707	Willoughby	106	" That he is patronised by YOU , "
17709	17762	17707	17707	Willoughby	106	" is certainly in his favour ; but as for the esteem of the others , it is a reproach in itself . Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings , that could command the indifference of any body else ? "
17763	17814	17658	17658	Elinor	88	" But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother . If their praise is censure , your censure may be praise , for they are not more undiscerning , than you are prejudiced and unjust . "
17815	17827	17707	17707	Willoughby	106	" In defence of your protege you can even be saucy . "
17828	17918	17658	17658	Elinor	88	" My protege , as you call him , is a sensible man ; and sense will always have attractions for me . Yes , Marianne , even in a man between thirty and forty . He has seen a great deal of the world ; has been abroad , has read , and has a thinking mind . I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects ; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good - breeding and good nature . "
17919	17925	17927	17927	Marianne	89	" That is to say , "
17930	17952	17927	17927	Marianne	89	" he has told you , that in the East Indies the climate is hot , and the mosquitoes are troublesome . "
17953	17986	17658	17658	Elinor	88	" He WOULD have told me so , I doubt not , had I made any such inquiries , but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed . "
17987	17990	17992	17992	Willoughby	106	" Perhaps , "
17994	18012	17992	17992	Willoughby	106	" his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs , gold mohrs , and palanquins . "
18013	18037	17658	17658	Elinor	88	" I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much further than your candour . But why should you dislike him ? "
18038	18098	17992	17992	Willoughby	106	" I do not dislike him . I consider him , on the contrary , as a very respectable man , who has every body 's good word , and nobody 's notice ; who , has more money than he can spend , more time than he knows how to employ , and two new coats every year . "
18099	18104	18106	18106	Marianne	89	" Add to which , "
18108	18138	18106	18106	Marianne	89	" that he has neither genius , taste , nor spirit . That his understanding has no brilliancy , his feelings no ardour , and his voice no expression . "
18139	18151	18153	18153	Elinor	88	" You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass , "
18155	18216	18153	18153	Elinor	88	" and so much on the strength of your own imagination , that the commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid . I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man , well - bred , well - informed , of gentle address , and , I believe , possessing an amiable heart . "
18217	18221	18223	18223	Willoughby	106	" Miss Dashwood , "
18225	18377	18223	18223	Willoughby	106	" you are now using me unkindly . You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason , and to convince me against my will . But it will not do . You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful . I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon ; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine ; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle , and I can not persuade him to buy my brown mare . If it will be any satisfaction to you , however , to be told , that I believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable , I am ready to confess it . And in return for an acknowledgment , which must give me some pain , you can not deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever . "
19438	19452	19430	19430	he	106	" Your sister , I understand , does not approve of second attachments . "
19453	19456	19458	19458	Elinor	88	" No , "
19460	19467	19430	19430	he	106	" her opinions are all romantic . "
19468	19483	19430	19430	he	106	" Or rather , as I believe , she considers them impossible to exist . "
19484	19556	19430	19430	he	106	" I believe she does . But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father , who had himself two wives , I know not . A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation ; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are , by any body but herself . "
19557	19565	19566	19566	he	106	" This will probably be the case , "
19569	19602	19566	19566	he	106	" and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind , that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions . "
19603	19612	19614	19614	Elinor	88	" I can not agree with you there , "
19616	19675	19614	19614	Elinor	88	" There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne 's , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for . Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage . "
19688	19748	19680	19680	he	106	" Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ? or is it equally criminal in every body ? Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice , whether from the inconstancy of its object , or the perverseness of circumstances , to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives ? "
19749	19785	19680	19680	he	106	" Upon my word , I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment 's being pardonable . "
19786	19789	19791	19791	he	106	" This , "
19793	19890	19791	19791	he	106	" can not hold ; but a change , a total change of sentiments — No , no , do not desire it ; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way , how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common , and too dangerous ! I speak from experience . I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an inforced change — from a series of unfortunate circumstances "
20183	20196	20197	20197	she	88	" He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it , "
20200	20238	20197	20197	she	88	" and when it arrives we will ride every day . You shall share its use with me . Imagine to yourself , my dear Elinor , the delight of a gallop on some of these downs . "
20358	20365	20367	20367	she	88	" You are mistaken , Elinor , "
20370	20500	20367	20367	she	88	" in supposing I know very little of Willoughby . I have not known him long indeed , but I am much better acquainted with him , than I am with any other creature in the world , except yourself and mama . It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy ; — it is disposition alone . Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others . I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother , than from Willoughby . Of John I know very little , though we have lived together for years ; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed . "
20705	20755	20698	20698	he	106	voice,—"But , Marianne , the horse is still yours , though you can not use it now . I shall keep it only till you can claim it . When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home , Queen Mab shall receive you . "
20932	20937	20938	20938	she	90	" Oh , Elinor ! "
20941	20966	20938	20938	she	90	" I have such a secret to tell you about Marianne . I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon . "
20967	20973	20975	20975	Elinor	88	" You have said so , "
20977	21031	20975	20975	Elinor	88	" almost every day since they first met on High - church Down ; and they had not known each other a week , I believe , before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck ; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle . "
21032	21061	20938	20938	she	90	" But indeed this is quite another thing . I am sure they will be married very soon , for he has got a lock of her hair . "
21062	21081	20975	20975	Elinor	88	" Take care , Margaret . It may be only the hair of some great uncle of HIS . "
21082	21197	20938	20938	she	90	" But , indeed , Elinor , it is Marianne 's . I am almost sure it is , for I saw him cut it off . Last night after tea , when you and mama went out of the room , they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be , and he seemed to be begging something of her , and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair , for it was all tumbled down her back ; and he kissed it , and folded it up in a piece of white paper ; and put it into his pocket - book . "
21302	21313	21291	21291	Margaret	90	" I must not tell , may I , Elinor ? "
21393	21410	21370	21370	she	89	" Remember that whatever your conjectures may be , you have no right to repeat them . "
21411	21420	21422	21422	Margaret	90	" I never had any conjectures about it , "
21424	21435	21422	21422	Margaret	90	" it was you who told me of it yourself . "
21454	21469	21471	21472	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Oh ! pray , Miss Margaret , let us know all about it , "
21474	21482	21471	21472	Mrs. Jennings	103	" What is the gentleman 's name ? "
21483	21508	21370	21370	she	89	" I must not tell , ma'am . But I know very well what it is ; and I know where he is too . "
21509	21542	21471	21472	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Yes , yes , we can guess where he is ; at his own house at Norland to be sure . He is the curate of the parish I dare say . "
21543	21559	21370	21370	she	89	" No , THAT he is not . He is of no profession at all . "
21560	21563	21565	21565	Marianne	89	" Margaret , "
21570	21593	21565	21565	Marianne	89	" you know that all this is an invention of your own , and that there is no such person in existence . "
21594	21624	21370	21370	she	89	" Well , then , he is lately dead , Marianne , for I am sure there was such a man once , and his name begins with an F. "
21640	21647	21370	21370	she	89	" that it rained very hard , "
22153	22161	22163	22164	Sir John	99	" What is the matter with Brandon ? "
22170	22180	22182	22183	Lady Middleton	100	" I hope he has had no bad news , "
22185	22203	22182	22183	Lady Middleton	100	" It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly . "
22211	22221	22223	22224	Mrs. Jennings	103	" No bad news , Colonel , I hope ; "
22234	22245	22182	22183	Lady Middleton	100	" None at all , ma'am , I thank you . "
22246	22265	22182	22183	Lady Middleton	100	" Was it from Avignon ? I hope it is not to say that your sister is worse . "
22266	22284	22182	22183	Lady Middleton	100	" No , ma'am . It came from town , and is merely a letter of business . "
22285	22326	22182	22183	Lady Middleton	100	" But how came the hand to discompose you so much , if it was only a letter of business ? Come , come , this wo n't do , Colonel ; so let us hear the truth of it . "
22327	22332	22334	22335	Lady Middleton	100	" My dear madam , "
22337	22344	22334	22335	Lady Middleton	100	" recollect what you are saying . "
22345	22359	22361	22362	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married ? "
22372	22381	22182	22183	Lady Middleton	100	" No , indeed , it is not . "
22382	22403	22334	22335	Lady Middleton	100	" Well , then , I know who it is from , Colonel . And I hope she is well . "
22404	22412	22414	22414	he	877	" Whom do you mean , ma'am ? "
22420	22429	22334	22335	Lady Middleton	100	" Oh ! you know who I mean . "
22430	22438	22440	22440	he	877	" I am particularly sorry , ma'am , "
22446	22468	22440	22440	he	877	" that I should receive this letter today , for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town . "
22469	22473	22475	22476	Mrs. Jennings	103	" In town ! "
22478	22493	22475	22476	Mrs. Jennings	103	" What can you have to do in town at this time of year ? "
22494	22501	22502	22502	he	877	" My own loss is great , "
22505	22537	22502	22502	he	877	" in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party ; but I am the more concerned , as I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell . "
22547	22561	22563	22563	Marianne	89	" But if you write a note to the housekeeper , Mr. Brandon , "
22567	22574	22563	22563	Marianne	89	" will it not be sufficient ? "
22580	22585	22587	22588	Sir John.—"It	115	" We must go , "
22588	22616	22587	22588	Sir John.—"It	115	John.—"It shall not be put off when we are so near it . You can not go to town till tomorrow , Brandon , that is all . "
22617	22642	22587	22588	Sir John.—"It	115	" I wish it could be so easily settled . But it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day ! "
22643	22656	22658	22659	Mrs. Jennings	103	" If you would but let us know what your business is , "
22661	22674	22658	22659	Mrs. Jennings	103	" we might see whether it could be put off or not . "
22675	22684	22686	22686	Willoughby	106	" You would not be six hours later , "
22688	22700	22686	22686	Willoughby	106	" if you were to defer your journey till our return . "
22701	22711	22587	22588	Sir John.—"It	115	" I can not afford to lose ONE hour . "
22726	22779	22716	22716	Willoughby	106	" There are some people who can not bear a party of pleasure . Brandon is one of them . He was afraid of catching cold I dare say , and invented this trick for getting out of it . I would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing . "
22780	22788	22790	22790	Marianne	89	" I have no doubt of it , "
22792	22810	22812	22813	Sir John	99	" There is no persuading you to change your mind , Brandon , I know of old , "
22815	22879	22812	22813	Sir John	99	" when once you are determined on anything . But , however , I hope you will think better of it . Consider , here are the two Miss Careys come over from Newton , the three Miss Dashwoods walked up from the cottage , and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time , on purpose to go to Whitwell . "
22906	22918	22812	22813	Sir John	99	" Well , then , when will you come back again ? "
22919	22929	22931	22932	her ladyship	577	" I hope we shall see you at Barton , "
22934	22957	22931	22932	her ladyship	577	" as soon as you can conveniently leave town ; and we must put off the party to Whitwell till you return . "
22958	22991	22812	22813	Sir John	99	" You are very obliging . But it is so uncertain , when I may have it in my power to return , that I dare not engage for it at all . "
22992	23002	23004	23005	Sir John	99	" Oh ! he must and shall come back , "
23007	23026	23004	23005	Sir John	99	" If he is not here by the end of the week , I shall go after him . "
23027	23036	23038	23039	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Ay , so do , Sir John , "
23041	23054	23038	23039	Mrs. Jennings	103	" and then perhaps you may find out what his business is . "
23055	23078	22812	22813	Sir John	99	" I do not want to pry into other men 's concerns . I suppose it is something he is ashamed of . "
23086	23099	23101	23102	Sir John	99	" You do not go to town on horseback , do you ? "
23104	23117	23004	23005	Sir John	99	" No . Only to Honiton . I shall then go post . "
23118	23143	23038	23039	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Well , as you are resolved to go , I wish you a good journey . But you had better change your mind . "
23144	23155	23004	23005	Sir John	99	" I assure you it is not in my power . "
23165	23185	23038	23039	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? "
23186	23195	23038	23039	Mrs. Jennings	103	" I am afraid , none at all . "
23196	23214	23038	23039	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do . "
23225	23229	23231	23232	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Come Colonel , "
23234	23249	23231	23232	Mrs. Jennings	103	" before you go , do let us know what you are going about . "
23299	23310	23312	23313	Mrs. Jennings	103	" I can guess what his business is , however , "
23316	23322	23324	23326	almost every body	885	" Can you , ma'am ? "
23328	23341	23412	23412	her	89	" Yes ; it is about Miss Williams , I am sure . "
23342	23349	23351	23351	Marianne	89	" And who is Miss Williams ? "
23353	23408	23417	23417	she	89	" What ! do not you know who Miss Williams is ? I am sure you must have heard of her before . She is a relation of the Colonel 's , my dear ; a very near relation . We will not say how near , for fear of shocking the young ladies . "
23422	23429	23417	23417	she	89	" She is his natural daughter . "
23430	23433	23412	23412	her	89	" Indeed ! "
23434	23460	23412	23412	her	89	" Oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare . I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune . "
23733	23754	23713	23713	she	103	" I have found you out in spite of all your tricks . I know where you spent the morning . "
23763	23768	23755	23755	Marianne	89	" Where , pray ? "
23770	23776	23778	23778	Willoughby	106	" Did not you know , "
23780	23790	23778	23778	Willoughby	106	" that we had been out in my curricle ? "
23791	23871	23872	23872	Marianne	89	" Yes , yes , Mr. Impudence , I know that very well , and I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to . — I hope you like your house , Miss Marianne . It is a very large one , I know ; and when I come to see you , I hope you will have new - furnished it , for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago . "
24035	24071	24025	24025	Marianne	89	" Why should you imagine , Elinor , that we did not go there , or that we did not see the house ? Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself ? "
24072	24097	24012	24012	she	88	" Yes , Marianne , but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there , and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby . "
24098	24144	24025	24025	Marianne	89	" Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion . I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life . "
24145	24150	24152	24152	Elinor	88	" I am afraid , "
24154	24168	24152	24152	Elinor	88	" that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety . "
24169	24231	24025	24025	Marianne	89	" On the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , Elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did , I should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure . "
24232	24265	24152	24152	Elinor	88	" But , my dear Marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ? "
24266	24342	24025	24025	Marianne	89	" If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct , we are all offending every moment of our lives . I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation . I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs. Smith 's grounds , or in seeing her house . They will one day be Mr. Willoughby 's , and — "
24343	24367	24152	24152	Elinor	88	" If they were one day to be your own , Marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done . "
24408	24585	24394	24394	she	904	" Perhaps , Elinor , it WAS rather ill - judged in me to go to Allenham ; but Mr. Willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place ; and it is a charming house , I assure you.—There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful . It is a corner room , and has windows on two sides . On one side you look across the bowling - green , behind the house , to a beautiful hanging wood , and on the other you have a view of the church and village , and , beyond them , of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired . I did not see it to advantage , for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture,—but if it were newly fitted up — a couple of hundred pounds , Willoughby says , would make it one of the pleasantest summer - rooms in England . "
24725	24738	24740	24740	she	103	" Something very melancholy must be the matter , I am sure , "
24742	24982	24740	24740	she	103	" I could see it in his face . Poor man ! I am afraid his circumstances may be bad . The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year , and his brother left everything sadly involved . I do think he must have been sent for about money matters , for what else can it be ? I wonder whether it is so . I would give anything to know the truth of it . Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and , by the bye , I dare say it is , because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her . May be she is ill in town ; nothing in the world more likely , for I have a notion she is always rather sickly . I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams . It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances NOW , for he is a very prudent man , and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time . I wonder what it can be ! May be his sister is worse at Avignon , and has sent for him over . His setting off in such a hurry seems very like it . Well , I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart , and a good wife into the bargain . "
25485	25488	25489	25489	he	106	" What ! "
25490	25527	25468	25468	he	106	exclaimed—"Improve this dear cottage ! No . THAT I will never consent to . Not a stone must be added to its walls , not an inch to its size , if my feelings are regarded . "
25528	25534	25536	25537	Miss Dashwood	107	" Do not be alarmed , "
25539	25560	25536	25537	Miss Dashwood	107	" nothing of the kind will be done ; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it . "
25561	25569	25570	25570	he	106	" I am heartily glad of it , "
25573	25589	25570	25570	he	106	" May she always be poor , if she can employ her riches no better . "
25590	25687	25468	25468	he	106	" Thank you , Willoughby . But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours , or of any one whom I loved , for all the improvements in the world . Depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain , when I make up my accounts in the spring , I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you . But are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it ? "
25688	25692	25694	25694	he	930	" I am , "
25696	25747	25694	25694	he	930	" To me it is faultless . Nay , more , I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable , and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down , and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage . "
25748	25762	25764	25764	Elinor	88	" With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes , I suppose , "
25766	25769	25771	25771	he	930	" Yes , "
25778	25828	25771	25771	he	930	" with all and every thing belonging to it;—in no one convenience or INconvenience about it , should the least variation be perceptible . Then , and then only , under such a roof , I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton . "
25829	25834	25836	25836	Elinor	88	" I flatter myself , "
25838	25867	25836	25836	Elinor	88	" that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase , you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this . "
25868	25874	25876	25876	Willoughby	106	" There certainly are circumstances , "
25878	25906	25876	25876	Willoughby	106	" which might greatly endear it to me ; but this place will always have one claim of my affection , which no other can possibly share . "
25934	25941	25943	25943	he	106	" How often did I wish , "
25945	26058	25943	25943	he	106	" when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth , that Barton cottage were inhabited ! I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation , and grieving that no one should live in it . How little did I then think that the very first news I should hear from Mrs. Smith , when I next came into the country , would be that Barton cottage was taken : and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event , which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it , can account for . Must it not have been so , Marianne ? "
26076	26173	26073	26073	he	106	" And yet this house you would spoil , Mrs. Dashwood ? You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement ! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began , and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together , you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance , and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford . "
26189	26196	26197	26197	he	106	" You are a good woman , "
26201	26270	26197	26197	he	106	" Your promise makes me easy . Extend it a little farther , and it will make me happy . Tell me that not only your house will remain the same , but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling ; and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me . "
26295	26304	26306	26307	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner ? "
26315	26341	26306	26307	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" I do not ask you to come in the morning , for we must walk to the park , to call on Lady Middleton . "
26578	26586	26588	26589	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" Is anything the matter with her ? "
26592	26596	26591	26591	she	86	entered—"is she ill ? "
26597	26602	26603	26603	he	106	" I hope not , "
26619	26642	26603	26603	he	106	" It is I who may rather expect to be ill — for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment ! "
26643	26646	26591	26591	she	86	" Disappointment ? "
26647	26715	26603	26603	he	106	" Yes , for I am unable to keep my engagement with you . Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin , by sending me on business to London . I have just received my dispatches , and taken my farewell of Allenham ; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you . "
26716	26725	26591	26591	she	86	" To London!—and are you going this morning ? "
26726	26731	26603	26603	he	106	" Almost this moment . "
26732	26756	26591	26591	she	86	" This is very unfortunate . But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;—and her business will not detain you from us long I hope . "
26763	26792	26757	26757	He	945	" You are very kind , but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately . My visits to Mrs. Smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth . "
26793	26830	26831	26831	His	945	" And is Mrs. Smith your only friend ? Is Allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome ? For shame , Willoughby , can you wait for an invitation here ? "
26847	26853	26843	26843	he	945	" You are too good . "
26881	26948	26876	26877	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" I have only to add , my dear Willoughby , that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome ; for I will not press you to return here immediately , because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith ; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination . "
26949	26955	26957	26957	Willoughby	106	" My engagements at present , "
26961	26975	26957	26957	Willoughby	106	" are of such a nature — that — I dare not flatter myself "
27007	27039	26998	26998	Willoughby	106	" It is folly to linger in this manner . I will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy . "
27312	27325	27327	27327	she	338	" Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton , Elinor , "
27336	27347	27327	27327	she	338	" and with how heavy a heart does he travel ? "
27348	27458	27327	27327	she	338	" It is all very strange . So suddenly to be gone ! It seems but the work of a moment . And last night he was with us so happy , so cheerful , so affectionate ? And now , after only ten minutes notice — Gone too without intending to return!—Something more than what he owned to us must have happened . He did not speak , he did not behave like himself . YOU must have seen the difference as well as I. What can it be ? Can they have quarrelled ? Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here ? "
27460	27517	27327	27327	she	338	" It was not inclination that he wanted , Elinor ; I could plainly see THAT . He had not the power of accepting it . I have thought it all over I assure you , and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you . "
27518	27524	27327	27327	she	338	" Can you , indeed ! "
27525	27747	27327	27327	she	338	" Yes . I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;—but you , Elinor , who love to doubt where you can — it will not satisfy YOU , I know ; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it . I am persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne , disapproves of it , ( perhaps because she has other views for him , ) and on that account is eager to get him away ; — and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him . This is what I believe to have happened . He is , moreover , aware that she DOES disapprove the connection , he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne , and he feels himself obliged , from his dependent situation , to give into her schemes , and absent himself from Devonshire for a while . You will tell me , I know , that this may or may NOT have happened ; but I will listen to no cavil , unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this . And now , Elinor , what have you to say ? "
27748	27758	27327	27327	she	338	" Nothing , for you have anticipated my answer . "
27759	27930	27327	27327	she	338	" Then you would have told me , that it might or might not have happened . Oh , Elinor , how incomprehensible are your feelings ! You had rather take evil upon credit than good . You had rather look out for misery for Marianne , and guilt for poor Willoughby , than an apology for the latter . You are resolved to think him blameable , because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn . And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence , or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment ? Are no probabilities to be accepted , merely because they are not certainties ? Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love , and no reason in the world to think ill of ? To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves , though unavoidably secret for a while ? And , after all , what is it you suspect him of ? "
27931	28049	27327	27327	she	338	" I can hardly tell myself . But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him . There is great truth , however , in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him , and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body . Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct , and I will hope that he has . But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at once . Secrecy may be advisable ; but still I can not help wondering at its being practiced by him . "
28050	28093	27327	27327	she	338	" Do not blame him , however , for departing from his character , where the deviation is necessary . But you really do admit the justice of what I have said in his defence?—I am happy — and he is acquitted . "
28094	28151	27327	27327	she	338	" Not entirely . It may be proper to conceal their engagement ( if they ARE engaged ) from Mrs. Smith — and if that is the case , it must be highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present . But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us . "
28152	28188	27327	27327	she	338	" Concealing it from us ! my dear child , do you accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealment ? This is strange indeed , when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness . "
28189	28198	28200	28200	Elinor	88	" I want no proof of their affection , "
28202	28210	28200	28200	Elinor	88	" but of their engagement I do . "
28211	28219	27327	27327	she	338	" I am perfectly satisfied of both . "
28220	28239	28200	28200	Elinor	88	" Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject , by either of them . "
28240	28392	27327	27327	she	338	" I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly . Has not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us , for at least the last fortnight , declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife , and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation ? Have we not perfectly understood each other ? Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks , his manner , his attentive and affectionate respect ? My Elinor , is it possible to doubt their engagement ? How could such a thought occur to you ? How is it to be supposed that Willoughby , persuaded as he must be of your sister 's love , should leave her , and leave her perhaps for months , without telling her of his affection;—that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence ? "
28393	28397	28399	28399	Elinor	88	" I confess , "
28401	28436	28399	28399	Elinor	88	" that every circumstance except ONE is in favour of their engagement ; but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject , and with me it almost outweighs every other . "
28437	28501	27327	27327	she	338	" How strange this is ! You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby , if , after all that has openly passed between them , you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together . Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time ? Do you suppose him really indifferent to her ? "
28502	28521	28399	28399	Elinor	88	" No , I can not think that . He must and does love her I am sure . "
28522	28552	27327	27327	she	338	" But with a strange kind of tenderness , if he can leave her with such indifference , such carelessness of the future , as you attribute to him . "
28553	28612	28399	28399	Elinor	88	" You must remember , my dear mother , that I have never considered this matter as certain . I have had my doubts , I confess ; but they are fainter than they were , and they may soon be entirely done away . If we find they correspond , every fear of mine will be removed . "
28613	28722	27327	27327	she	338	" A mighty concession indeed ! If you were to see them at the altar , you would suppose they were going to be married . Ungracious girl ! But I require no such proof . Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt ; no secrecy has been attempted ; all has been uniformly open and unreserved . You can not doubt your sister 's wishes . It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect . But why ? Is he not a man of honour and feeling ? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm ? can he be deceitful ? "
28723	28732	28734	28734	Elinor	88	" I hope not , I believe not , "
28736	28974	28734	28734	Elinor	88	" I love Willoughby , sincerely love him ; and suspicion of his integrity can not be more painful to yourself than to me . It has been involuntary , and I will not encourage it . I was startled , I confess , by the alteration in his manners this morning;—he did not speak like himself , and did not return your kindness with any cordiality . But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed . He had just parted from my sister , had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction ; and if he felt obliged , from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith , to resist the temptation of returning here soon , and yet aware that by declining your invitation , by saying that he was going away for some time , he should seem to act an ungenerous , a suspicious part by our family , he might well be embarrassed and disturbed . In such a case , a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour I think , as well as more consistent with his general character;—but I will not raise objections against any one 's conduct on so illiberal a foundation , as a difference in judgment from myself , or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent . "
28975	29096	29140	29140	Marianne	89	" You speak very properly . Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected . Though WE have not known him long , he is no stranger in this part of the world ; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage ? Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately , it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once : but this is not the case . It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun , for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance ; and even secrecy , as far as it can be observed , may now be very advisable . "
29720	29725	29727	29727	she	86	" Remember , Elinor , "
29729	29781	29727	29727	she	86	" how very often Sir John fetches our letters himself from the post , and carries them to it . We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary , and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through Sir John 's hands . "
29849	29859	29861	29861	she	86	" Why do you not ask Marianne at once , "
29863	29922	29861	29861	she	86	" whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby ? From you , her mother , and so kind , so indulgent a mother , the question could not give offence . It would be the natural result of your affection for her . She used to be all unreserve , and to you more especially . "
29923	30061	30062	30062	Elinor	88	" I would not ask such a question for the world . Supposing it possible that they are not engaged , what distress would not such an enquiry inflict ! At any rate it would be most ungenerous . I should never deserve her confidence again , after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one . I know Marianne 's heart : I know that she dearly loves me , and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known , when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible . I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one ; of a child much less ; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct . "
30162	30207	30149	30150	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" We have never finished Hamlet , Marianne ; our dear Willoughby went away before we could get through it . We will put it by , that when he comes again ... But it may be months , perhaps , before THAT happens . "
30208	30211	30213	30213	Marianne	89	" Months ! "
30219	30226	30213	30213	Marianne	89	" No — nor many weeks . "
30540	30550	30536	30536	Marianne	89	" It is he ; it is indeed;—I know it is!"—and
30562	30593	30558	30558	Elinor	88	" Indeed , Marianne , I think you are mistaken . It is not Willoughby . The person is not tall enough for him , and has not his air . "
30594	30601	30603	30603	Marianne	89	" He has , he has , "
30605	30629	30603	30603	Marianne	89	" I am sure he has . His air , his coat , his horse . I knew how soon he would come . "
31040	31044	31045	31045	she	89	" A fortnight ! "
31084	31092	31094	31094	Elinor	88	" Have you been lately in Sussex ? "
31096	31106	31070	31070	he	93	" I was at Norland about a month ago . "
31107	31117	31119	31119	Marianne	89	" And how does dear , dear Norland look ? "
31121	31127	31129	31129	Elinor	88	" Dear , dear Norland , "
31131	31156	31129	31129	Elinor	88	" probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year . The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves . "
31157	31160	31162	31162	Marianne	89	" Oh , "
31164	31241	31162	31162	Marianne	89	" with what transporting sensation have I formerly seen them fall ! How have I delighted , as I walked , to see them driven in showers about me by the wind ! What feelings have they , the season , the air altogether inspired ! Now there is no one to regard them . They are seen only as a nuisance , swept hastily off , and driven as much as possible from the sight . "
31242	31249	31251	31251	Elinor	88	" It is not every one , "
31253	31262	31251	31251	Elinor	88	" who has your passion for dead leaves . "
31263	31282	31283	31283	she	89	" No ; my feelings are not often shared , not often understood . But SOMETIMES they are . "—As
31300	31305	31307	31307	she	89	" Now , Edward , "
31316	31386	31307	31307	she	89	" here is Barton valley . Look up to it , and be tranquil if you can . Look at those hills ! Did you ever see their equals ? To the left is Barton park , amongst those woods and plantations . You may see the end of the house . And there , beneath that farthest hill , which rises with such grandeur , is our cottage . "
31387	31394	31395	31395	he	1011	" It is a beautiful country , "
31398	31408	31395	31395	he	1011	" but these bottoms must be dirty in winter . "
31409	31423	31505	31505	her	89	" How can you think of dirt , with such objects before you ? "
31424	31427	31429	31429	he	1011	" Because , "
31433	31450	31429	31429	he	1011	" among the rest of the objects before me , I see a very dirty lane . "
31451	31455	31459	31459	herself	89	" How strange ! "
31465	31479	31429	31429	he	1011	" Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here ? Are the Middletons pleasant people ? "
31480	31486	31488	31488	Marianne	89	" No , not all , "
31490	31499	31488	31488	Marianne	89	" we could not be more unfortunately situated . "
31500	31503	31505	31506	her sister	343	" Marianne , "
31508	31558	31505	31506	her sister	343	" how can you say so ? How can you be so unjust ? They are a very respectable family , Mr. Ferrars ; and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner . Have you forgot , Marianne , how many pleasant days we have owed to them ? "
31559	31562	31564	31564	Marianne	89	" No , "
31571	31578	31564	31564	Marianne	89	" nor how many painful moments . "
31886	31900	31902	31902	she	274	" What are Mrs. Ferrars 's views for you at present , Edward ? "
31916	31930	31902	31902	she	274	" are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself ? "
31931	31954	32118	32118	Marianne	89	" No . I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life ! "
31955	32003	31902	31902	she	274	" But how is your fame to be established ? for famous you must be to satisfy all your family ; and with no inclination for expense , no affection for strangers , no profession , and no assurance , you may find it a difficult matter . "
32004	32042	32118	32118	Marianne	89	" I shall not attempt it . I have no wish to be distinguished ; and have every reason to hope I never shall . Thank Heaven ! I can not be forced into genius and eloquence . "
32043	32059	31902	31902	she	274	" You have no ambition , I well know . Your wishes are all moderate . "
32060	32109	32118	32118	Marianne	89	" As moderate as those of the rest of the world , I believe . I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy ; but , like every body else it must be in my own way . Greatness will not make me so . "
32110	32116	32118	32118	Marianne	89	" Strange that it would ! "
32120	32131	32118	32118	Marianne	89	" What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness ? "
32132	32138	32140	32140	Elinor	88	" Grandeur has but little , "
32142	32152	32140	32140	Elinor	88	" but wealth has much to do with it . "
32153	32159	32161	32161	Marianne	89	" Elinor , for shame ! "
32163	32197	32161	32161	Marianne	89	" money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it . Beyond a competence , it can afford no real satisfaction , as far as mere self is concerned . "
32198	32201	32203	32203	Elinor	88	" Perhaps , "
32207	32270	32203	32203	Elinor	88	" we may come to the same point . YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much alike , I dare say ; and without them , as the world goes now , we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting . Your ideas are only more noble than mine . Come , what is your competence ? "
32271	32286	32373	32373	Elinor	88	" About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year ; not more than THAT . "
32290	32308	32287	32287	Elinor	88	" TWO thousand a year ! ONE is my wealth ! I guessed how it would end . "
32309	32323	32325	32325	Marianne	89	" And yet two thousand a - year is a very moderate income , "
32327	32372	32325	32325	Marianne	89	" A family can not well be maintained on a smaller . I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands . A proper establishment of servants , a carriage , perhaps two , and hunters , can not be supported on less . "
32391	32394	32373	32373	Elinor	88	" Hunters ! "
32396	32409	32410	32410	Marianne	89	Edward—"but why must you have hunters ? Every body does not hunt . "
32416	32422	32410	32410	Marianne	89	" But most people do . "
32423	32427	32429	32429	Margaret	90	" I wish , "
32437	32449	32429	32429	Margaret	90	" that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece ! "
32450	32456	32458	32458	Marianne	89	" Oh that they would ! "
32478	32490	32492	32492	Elinor	88	" We are all unanimous in that wish , I suppose , "
32494	32503	32492	32492	Elinor	88	" in spite of the insufficiency of wealth . "
32504	32508	32510	32510	Margaret	90	" Oh dear ! "
32512	32528	32510	32510	Margaret	90	" how happy I should be ! I wonder what I should do with it ! "
32541	32554	32556	32557	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself , "
32559	32571	32556	32557	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" if my children were all to be rich my help . "
32572	32582	32584	32584	Elinor	88	" You must begin your improvements on this house , "
32586	32594	32584	32584	Elinor	88	" and your difficulties will soon vanish . "
32595	32607	32609	32609	Edward	93	" What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London , "
32611	32761	32609	32609	Edward	93	" in such an event ! What a happy day for booksellers , music - sellers , and print - shops ! You , Miss Dashwood , would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you — and as for Marianne , I know her greatness of soul , there would not be music enough in London to content her . And books!—Thomson , Cowper , Scott — she would buy them all over and over again : she would buy up every copy , I believe , to prevent their falling into unworthy hands ; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree . Should not you , Marianne ? Forgive me , if I am very saucy . But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our old disputes . "
32762	32835	32556	32557	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" I love to be reminded of the past , Edward — whether it be melancholy or gay , I love to recall it — and you will never offend me by talking of former times . You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent — some of it , at least — my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books . "
32836	32856	32609	32609	Edward	93	" And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs . "
32857	32872	32556	32557	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" No , Edward , I should have something else to do with it . "
32873	32924	32609	32609	Edward	93	" Perhaps , then , you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim , that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life — your opinion on that point is unchanged , I presume ? "
32925	32955	32556	32557	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" Undoubtedly . At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed . It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them . "
32956	32967	32969	32969	Elinor	88	" Marianne is as steadfast as ever , you see , "
32971	32979	32969	32969	Elinor	88	" she is not at all altered . "
32980	32993	32556	32557	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" She is only grown a little more grave than she was . "
32994	32999	33001	33001	Marianne	89	" Nay , Edward , "
33003	33017	33001	33001	Marianne	89	" you need not reproach me . You are not very gay yourself . "
33018	33025	33027	33027	he	1027	" Why should you think so ! "
33033	33044	33027	33027	he	1027	" But gaiety never was a part of MY character . "
33045	33057	33059	33059	Elinor	88	" Nor do I think it a part of Marianne 's , "
33061	33101	33059	33059	Elinor	88	" I should hardly call her a lively girl — she is very earnest , very eager in all she does — sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation — but she is not often really merry . "
33102	33109	33110	33110	he	1027	" I believe you are right , "
33113	33127	33110	33110	he	1027	" and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl . "
33128	33140	33142	33142	Elinor	88	" I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes , "
33144	33219	33142	33142	Elinor	88	" in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other : fancying people so much more gay or grave , or ingenious or stupid than they really are , and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated . Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves , and very frequently by what other people say of them , without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge . "
33220	33230	33232	33232	Marianne	89	" But I thought it was right , Elinor , "
33234	33273	33232	33232	Marianne	89	" to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people . I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours . This has always been your doctrine , I am sure . "
33274	33354	33142	33142	Elinor	88	" No , Marianne , never . My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding . All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour . You must not confound my meaning . I am guilty , I confess , of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention ; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters ? "
33355	33373	33375	33375	Edward	93	" You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility , "
33379	33386	33375	33375	Edward	93	" Do you gain no ground ? "
33387	33392	33394	33394	Elinor	88	" Quite the contrary , "
33401	33405	33406	33406	he	93	" My judgment , "
33409	33494	33406	33406	he	93	" is all on your side of the question ; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister 's . I never wish to offend , but I am so foolishly shy , that I often seem negligent , when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness . I have frequently thought that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company , I am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility ! "
33495	33507	33509	33509	Elinor	88	" Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers , "
33511	33523	33525	33525	Edward	93	" She knows her own worth too well for false shame , "
33527	33564	33525	33525	Edward	93	" Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other . If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful , I should not be shy . "
33565	33573	33575	33575	Marianne	89	" But you would still be reserved , "
33577	33583	33575	33575	Marianne	89	" and that is worse . "
33585	33593	33525	33525	Edward	93	started—"Reserved ! Am I reserved , Marianne ? "
33594	33599	33584	33584	Edward	93	" Yes , very . "
33600	33607	33609	33609	he	93	" I do not understand you , "
33613	33632	33609	33609	he	93	" Reserved!—how , in what manner ? What am I to tell you ? What can you suppose ? "
33653	33694	33648	33648	she	88	" Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means ? Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast , and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself ? "
33892	33904	33906	33906	he	93	" I am going into the village to see my horses , "
33908	33925	33906	33906	he	93	" as you are not yet ready for breakfast ; I shall be back again presently . "
34032	34238	34026	34026	Edward	93	" You must not enquire too far , Marianne — remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque , and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars . I shall call hills steep , which ought to be bold ; surfaces strange and uncouth , which ought to be irregular and rugged ; and distant objects out of sight , which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere . You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give . I call it a very fine country — the hills are steep , the woods seem full of fine timber , and the valley looks comfortable and snug — with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there . It exactly answers my idea of a fine country , because it unites beauty with utility — and I dare say it is a picturesque one too , because you admire it ; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories , grey moss and brush wood , but these are all lost on me . I know nothing of the picturesque . "
34239	34249	34251	34251	Marianne	89	" I am afraid it is but too true , "
34253	34262	34251	34251	Marianne	89	" but why should you boast of it ? "
34263	34267	34269	34269	Elinor	88	" I suspect , "
34271	34339	34269	34269	Elinor	88	" that to avoid one kind of affectation , Edward here falls into another . Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel , and is disgusted with such pretensions , he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses . He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own . "
34340	34346	34348	34348	Marianne	89	" It is very true , "
34350	34426	34348	34348	Marianne	89	" that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon . Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was . I detest jargon of every kind , and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself , because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning . "
34427	34432	34434	34434	Edward	93	" I am convinced , "
34436	34567	34434	34434	Edward	93	" that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel . But , in return , your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess . I like a fine prospect , but not on picturesque principles . I do not like crooked , twisted , blasted trees . I admire them much more if they are tall , straight , and flourishing . I do not like ruined , tattered cottages . I am not fond of nettles or thistles , or heath blossoms . I have more pleasure in a snug farm - house than a watch - tower — and a troop of tidy , happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the world . "
34653	34665	34666	34666	she	89	" I never saw you wear a ring before , Edward , "
34669	34696	34666	34666	she	89	" Is that Fanny 's hair ? I remember her promising to give you some . But I should have thought her hair had been darker . "
34746	34769	34731	34731	He	93	" Yes ; it is my sister 's hair . The setting always casts a different shade on it , you know . "
35143	35153	35155	35155	he	99	" You MUST drink tea with us to night , "
35157	35182	35155	35155	he	99	" for we shall be quite alone — and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us , for we shall be a large party . "
35189	35200	35202	35202	she	103	" And who knows but you may raise a dance , "
35204	35214	35202	35202	she	103	" And that will tempt YOU , Miss Marianne . "
35215	35219	35221	35221	Marianne	89	" A dance ! "
35223	35231	35221	35221	Marianne	89	" Impossible ! Who is to dance ? "
35232	35264	35202	35202	she	103	" Who ! why yourselves , and the Careys , and Whitakers to be sure.—What ! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone ! "
35265	35273	35275	35276	Sir John	99	" I wish with all my soul , "
35278	35286	35275	35276	Sir John	99	" that Willoughby were among us again . "
35300	35306	35308	35308	he	93	" And who is Willoughby ? "
35384	35397	35371	35371	he	93	" I have been guessing . Shall I tell you my guess ? "
35398	35404	35371	35371	he	93	" What do you mean ? "
35405	35411	35371	35371	he	93	" Shall I tell you . "
35412	35415	35371	35371	he	93	" Certainly . "
35416	35427	35371	35371	he	93	" Well then ; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts . "
35457	35480	35435	35435	she	89	" Oh , Edward ! How can you?—But the time will come I hope ... I am sure you will like him . "
35481	35488	35490	35490	he	93	" I do not doubt it , "
36072	36078	36080	36081	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" I think , Edward , "
36092	36173	36080	36081	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions . Some inconvenience to your friends , indeed , might result from it — you would not be able to give them so much of your time . But ( with a smile ) you would be materially benefited in one particular at least — you would know where to go when you left them . "
36174	36180	36181	36181	he	1065	" I do assure you , "
36184	36497	36181	36181	he	1065	" that I have long thought on this point , as you think now . It has been , and is , and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me , that I have had no necessary business to engage me , no profession to give me employment , or afford me any thing like independence . But unfortunately my own nicety , and the nicety of my friends , have made me what I am , an idle , helpless being . We never could agree in our choice of a profession . I always preferred the church , as I still do . But that was not smart enough for my family . They recommended the army . That was a great deal too smart for me . The law was allowed to be genteel enough ; many young men , who had chambers in the Temple , made a very good appearance in the first circles , and drove about town in very knowing gigs . But I had no inclination for the law , even in this less abstruse study of it , which my family approved . As for the navy , it had fashion on its side , but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it — and , at length , as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all , as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one , idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable , and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing . I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since . "
36498	36510	36512	36513	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" The consequence of which , I suppose , will be , "
36515	36547	36512	36513	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" since leisure has not promoted your own happiness , that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits , employments , professions , and trades as Columella 's . "
36548	36555	36557	36557	he	1066	" They will be brought up , "
36564	36587	36557	36557	he	1066	" to be as unlike myself as is possible . In feeling , in action , in condition , in every thing . "
36588	36726	36512	36513	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" Come , come ; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits , Edward . You are in a melancholy humour , and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy . But remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times , whatever be their education or state . Know your own happiness . You want nothing but patience — or give it a more fascinating name , call it hope . Your mother will secure to you , in time , that independence you are so anxious for ; it is her duty , and it will , it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent . How much may not a few months do ? "
36727	36731	36733	36733	Edward	93	" I think , "
36735	36749	36733	36733	Edward	93	" that I may defy many months to produce any good to me . "
37431	37434	37436	37436	he	99	" Well , "
37438	37452	37436	37436	he	99	" we have brought you some strangers . How do you like them ? "
37453	37461	37556	37557	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Hush ! they will hear you . "
37462	37495	37436	37436	he	99	" Never mind if they do . It is only the Palmers . Charlotte is very pretty , I can tell you . You may see her if you look this way . "
37520	37541	37556	37557	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Where is Marianne ? Has she run away because we are come ? I see her instrument is open . "
37542	37550	37572	37572	she	103	" She is walking , I believe . "
37584	37710	37577	37577	She	103	" How do you do , my dear ? How does Mrs. Dashwood do ? And where are your sisters ? What ! all alone ! you will be glad of a little company to sit with you . I have brought my other son and daughter to see you . Only think of their coming so suddenly ! I thought I heard a carriage last night , while we were drinking our tea , but it never entered my head that it could be them . I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again "
38006	38091	37993	37993	her	128	" Well ! what a delightful room this is ! I never saw anything so charming ! Only think , Mamma , how it is improved since I was here last ! I always thought it such a sweet place , ma'am ! ( turning to Mrs. Dashwood ) but you have made it so charming ! Only look , sister , how delightful every thing is ! How I should like such a house for myself ! Should not you , Mr. Palmer ? "
38110	38118	38120	38120	she	128	" Mr. Palmer does not hear me , "
38124	38135	38120	38120	she	128	" he never does sometimes . It is so ridiculous ! "
38243	38256	38258	38259	Mrs. Jennings	103	" You may believe how glad we all were to see them , "
38295	38382	38274	38274	she	103	" but , however , I ca n't help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast , nor made such a long journey of it , for they came all round by London upon account of some business , for you know ( nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter ) it was wrong in her situation . I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning , but she would come with us ; she longed so much to see you all ! "
38397	38406	38408	38409	Mrs. Jennings	103	" She expects to be confined in February , "
38438	38445	38446	38446	he	129	" No , none at all , "
38453	38458	38460	38461	Sir John	99	" Here comes Marianne , "
38463	38476	38460	38461	Sir John	99	" Now , Palmer , you shall see a monstrous pretty girl . "
38577	38616	38570	38570	She	128	" Oh ! dear , how beautiful these are ! Well ! how delightful ! Do but look , mama , how sweet ! I declare they are quite charming ; I could look at them for ever . "
38664	38673	38675	38676	his wife	286	" My love , have you been asleep ? "
38888	38895	38897	38897	Marianne	89	" Why should they ask us ? "
38906	38948	38897	38897	Marianne	89	" The rent of this cottage is said to be low ; but we have it on very hard terms , if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them , or with us . "
38949	38963	38965	38965	Elinor	88	" They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now , "
38967	39010	38965	38965	Elinor	88	" by these frequent invitations , than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago . The alteration is not in them , if their parties are grown tedious and dull . We must look for the change elsewhere . "
39069	39078	39080	39080	she	128	" I am so glad to see you ! "
39089	39210	39080	39080	she	128	" for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come , which would be a shocking thing , as we go away again tomorrow . We must go , for the Westons come to us next week you know . It was quite a sudden thing our coming at all , and I knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door , and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I would go with him to Barton . He is so droll ! He never tells me any thing ! I am so sorry we can not stay longer ; however we shall meet again in town very soon , I hope . "
39223	39229	39231	39232	Mrs. Palmer	128	" Not go to town ! "
39238	39306	39231	39232	Mrs. Palmer	128	" I shall be quite disappointed if you do not . I could get the nicest house in world for you , next door to ours , in Hanover - square . You must come , indeed . I am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am confined , if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public . "
39320	39326	39328	39329	Mrs. Palmer	128	" Oh , my love , "
39339	39355	39356	39356	Her	128	room—"you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter . "
39376	39383	39385	39385	he	324	" How horrid all this is ! "
39387	39454	39385	39385	he	324	" Such weather makes every thing and every body disgusting . Dullness is as much produced within doors as without , by rain . It makes one detest all one 's acquaintance . What the devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house ? How few people know what comfort is ! Sir John is as stupid as the weather . "
39464	39472	39474	39475	Sir John	99	" I am afraid , Miss Marianne , "
39477	39492	39474	39475	Sir John	99	" you have not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today . "
39501	39512	39514	39515	Mrs. Palmer	128	" Oh , do n't be so sly before us , "
39517	39570	39514	39515	Mrs. Palmer	128	" for we know all about it , I assure you ; and I admire your taste very much , for I think he is extremely handsome . We do not live a great way from him in the country , you know . Not above ten miles , I dare say . "
39571	39576	39578	39579	her husband	324	" Much nearer thirty , "
39581	39609	39514	39515	Mrs. Palmer	128	" Ah , well ! there is not much difference . I never was at his house ; but they say it is a sweet pretty place . "
39610	39623	39625	39626	Mr. Palmer	129	" As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life , "
39644	39650	39652	39653	Mrs. Palmer—"then	132	" Is it very ugly ? "
39653	39667	39652	39653	Mrs. Palmer—"then	132	Palmer—"then it must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose . "
39690	39694	39696	39696	he	99	" My dear , "
39701	39726	39696	39696	he	99	" it is very provoking that we should be so few . Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today ? "
39727	39759	39807	39808	his wife	286	" Did not I tell you , Sir John , when you spoke to me about it before , that it could not be done ? They dined with us last . "
39760	39768	39770	39771	Mrs. Jennings	103	" You and I , Sir John , "
39773	39781	39770	39771	Mrs. Jennings	103	" should not stand upon such ceremony . "
39782	39792	39794	39795	Mr. Palmer	129	" Then you would be very ill - bred , "
39797	39805	39810	39810	her	286	" My love you contradict every body , "
39814	39824	39810	39810	her	286	" Do you know that you are quite rude ? "
39825	39842	39770	39771	Mrs. Jennings	103	" I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill - bred . "
39843	39854	39856	39861	the good - natured old lady	1139	" Ay , you may abuse me as you please , "
39863	39890	39856	39861	the good - natured old lady	1139	" you have taken Charlotte off my hands , and can not give her back again . So there I have the whip hand of you . "
39980	39987	39989	39989	she	127	" Mr. Palmer is so droll ! "
39998	40006	39989	39989	she	127	" He is always out of humour . "
40180	40188	40190	40191	Mrs. Palmer	128	" Oh , my dear Miss Dashwood , "
40195	40251	40190	40191	Mrs. Palmer	128	" I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister . Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas ? Now , pray do,—and come while the Westons are with us . You can not think how happy I shall be ! It will be quite delightful!—My love , "
40257	40271	40190	40191	Mrs. Palmer	128	" do n't you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland ? "
40272	40275	40276	40276	he	324	" Certainly , "
40281	40290	40276	40276	he	324	sneer—"I came into Devonshire with no other view . "
40291	40293	40294	40295	his lady	604	" There now,"—said
40297	40313	40276	40276	he	324	" you see Mr. Palmer expects you ; so you can not refuse to come . "
40323	40432	40294	40295	his lady	604	" But indeed you must and shall come . I am sure you will like it of all things . The Westons will be with us , and it will be quite delightful . You can not think what a sweet place Cleveland is ; and we are so gay now , for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election ; and so many people came to dine with us that I never saw before , it is quite charming ! But , poor fellow ! it is very fatiguing to him ! for he is forced to make every body like him . "
40450	40457	40459	40459	Charlotte	127	" How charming it will be , "
40461	40517	40459	40459	Charlotte	127	" when he is in Parliament!—won't it ? How I shall laugh ! It will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an M.P.—But do you know , he says , he will never frank for me ? He declares he wo n't . Do n't you , Mr. Palmer ? "
40526	40536	40537	40537	she	127	" He can not bear writing , you know , "
40540	40548	40537	40537	she	127	" he says it is quite shocking . "
40549	40552	40554	40554	he	129	" No , "
40556	40576	40554	40554	he	129	" I never said any thing so irrational . Do n't palm all your abuses of languages upon me . "
40577	40627	40628	40628	She	127	" There now ; you see how droll he is . This is always the way with him ! Sometimes he wo n't speak to me for half a day together , and then he comes out with something so droll — all about any thing in the world . "
40654	40657	40659	40659	Elinor	88	" Certainly , "
40661	40667	40659	40659	Elinor	88	" he seems very agreeable . "
40668	40731	40646	40646	she	88	" Well — I am so glad you do . I thought you would , he is so pleasant ; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell you , and you ca n't think how disappointed he will be if you do n't come to Cleveland.—I ca n't imagine why you should object to it . "
40846	40858	40860	40861	Mrs. Palmer;—"Not	3236	" Oh dear , yes ; I know him extremely well , "
40861	41035	40823	40823	She	88	Palmer;—"Not that I ever spoke to him , indeed ; but I have seen him for ever in town . Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was at Allenham . Mama saw him here once before ; — but I was with my uncle at Weymouth . However , I dare say we should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire , if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never have been in the country together . He is very little at Combe , I believe ; but if he were ever so much there , I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him , for he is in the opposition , you know , and besides it is such a way off . I know why you inquire about him , very well ; your sister is to marry him . I am monstrous glad of it , for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know . "
41036	41041	41043	41043	Elinor	88	" Upon my word , "
41045	41068	41043	41043	Elinor	88	" you know much more of the matter than I do , if you have any reason to expect such a match . "
41069	41101	40823	40823	She	88	" Do n't pretend to deny it , because you know it is what every body talks of . I assure you I heard of it in my way through town . "
41102	41108	41043	41043	Elinor	88	" My dear Mrs. Palmer ! "
41109	41139	40823	40823	She	88	" Upon my honour I did.—I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in Bond - street , just before we left town , and he told me of it directly . "
41140	41192	41043	41043	Elinor	88	" You surprise me very much . Colonel Brandon tell you of it ! Surely you must be mistaken . To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it , even if it were true , is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do . "
41193	41320	40823	40823	She	88	" But I do assure you it was so , for all that , and I will tell you how it happened . When we met him , he turned back and walked with us ; and so we began talking of my brother and sister , and one thing and another , and I said to him , ' So , Colonel , there is a new family come to Barton cottage , I hear , and mama sends me word they are very pretty , and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna . Is it true , pray ? for of course you must know , as you have been in Devonshire so lately . ' "
41321	41329	41043	41043	Elinor	88	" And what did the Colonel say ? "
41330	41378	40823	40823	She	88	" Oh — he did not say much ; but he looked as if he knew it to be true , so from that moment I set it down as certain . It will be quite delightful , I declare ! When is it to take place ? "
41379	41388	41043	41043	Elinor	88	" Mr. Brandon was very well I hope ? "
41389	41414	40823	40823	She	88	" Oh ! yes , quite well ; and so full of your praises , he did nothing but say fine things of you . "
41415	41436	41043	41043	Elinor	88	" I am flattered by his commendation . He seems an excellent man ; and I think him uncommonly pleasing . "
41437	41497	40823	40823	She	88	" So do I.—He is such a charming man , that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull . Mamma says HE was in love with your sister too . — I assure you it was a great compliment if he was , for he hardly ever falls in love with any body . "
41498	41510	41512	41512	Elinor	88	" Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire ? "
41514	41666	40823	40823	She	88	" Oh ! yes , extremely well ; that is , I do not believe many people are acquainted with him , because Combe Magna is so far off ; but they all think him extremely agreeable I assure you . Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes , and so you may tell your sister . She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him , upon my honour ; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her , because she is so very handsome and agreeable , that nothing can be good enough for her . However , I do n't think her hardly at all handsomer than you , I assure you ; for I think you both excessively pretty , and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure , though we could not get him to own it last night . "
41693	41705	40823	40823	She	88	" I am so glad we are got acquainted at last , "
41707	41788	40823	40823	She	88	Charlotte.—"And now I hope we shall always be great friends . You ca n't think how much I longed to see you ! It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage ! Nothing can be like it , to be sure ! And I am so glad your sister is going to be well married ! I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna . It is a sweet place , by all accounts . "
41789	41803	40823	40823	She	88	" You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon , have not you ? "
41804	41831	41832	41832	she	1157	" Yes , a great while ; ever since my sister married . — He was a particular friend of Sir John 's . I believe , "
41839	41896	41832	41832	she	1157	" he would have been very glad to have had me , if he could . Sir John and Lady Middleton wished it very much . But mama did not think the match good enough for me , otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel , and we should have been married immediately . "
41897	41925	41832	41832	she	1157	" Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John 's proposal to your mother before it was made ? Had he never owned his affection to yourself ? "
41926	41989	41832	41832	she	1157	" Oh , no ; but if mama had not objected to it , I dare say he would have liked it of all things . He had not seen me then above twice , for it was before I left school . However , I am much happier as I am . Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like . "
42568	42573	42551	42552	philanthropic man	1190	" Do come now , "
42575	42737	42551	42552	philanthropic man	1190	he—"pray come — you must come — I declare you shall come — You ca n't think how you will like them . Lucy is monstrous pretty , and so good humoured and agreeable ! The children are all hanging about her already , as if she was an old acquaintance . And they both long to see you of all things , for they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world ; and I have told them it is all very true , and a great deal more . You will be delighted with them I am sure . They have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children . How can you be so cross as not to come ? Why they are your cousins , you know , after a fashion . YOU are my cousins , and they are my wife 's , so you must be related . "
43182	43190	43192	43192	she	100	" John is in such spirits today ! "
43208	43215	43195	43195	his	1207	window—"He is full of monkey tricks . "
43239	43245	43235	43235	she	100	" How playful William is ! "
43246	43255	43256	43256	she	100	" And here is my sweet little Annamaria , "
43281	43300	43256	43256	she	100	" And she is always so gentle and quiet — Never was there such a quiet little thing ! "
43605	43610	43612	43613	Miss Steele	137	" Poor little creatures ! "
43622	43632	43612	43613	Miss Steele	137	" It might have been a very sad accident . "
43633	43640	43642	43642	Marianne	89	" Yet I hardly know how , "
43644	43675	43642	43642	Marianne	89	" unless it had been under totally different circumstances . But this is the usual way of heightening alarm , where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality . "
43676	43685	43687	43688	Lucy Steele	137	" What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is ! "
43759	43765	43767	43769	the elder sister	1226	" And Sir John too , "
43771	43779	43767	43769	the elder sister	1226	" what a charming man he is ! "
43812	43849	43767	43769	the elder sister	1226	" And what a charming little family they have ! I never saw such fine children in my life.—I declare I quite doat upon them already , and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children . "
43850	43856	43858	43858	Elinor	88	" I should guess so , "
43864	43873	43858	43858	Elinor	88	" from what I have witnessed this morning . "
43874	43880	43882	43882	Lucy	137	" I have a notion , "
43884	43941	43882	43882	Lucy	137	" you think the little Middletons rather too much indulged ; perhaps they may be the outside of enough ; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton ; and for my part , I love to see children full of life and spirits ; I can not bear them if they are tame and quiet . "
43942	43946	43948	43948	Elinor	88	" I confess , "
43950	43971	43948	43948	Elinor	88	" that while I am at Barton Park , I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence . "
44002	44023	43984	43985	Miss Steele	137	" And how do you like Devonshire , Miss Dashwood ? I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex . "
44052	44064	44066	44067	Miss Steele	137	" Norland is a prodigious beautiful place , is not it ? "
44069	44079	44081	44081	Lucy	137	" We have heard Sir John admire it excessively , "
44097	44106	44108	44108	Elinor	88	" I think every one MUST admire it , "
44110	44135	44108	44108	Elinor	88	" who ever saw the place ; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do . "
44136	44174	44081	44081	Lucy	137	" And had you a great many smart beaux there ? I suppose you have not so many in this part of the world ; for my part , I think they are a vast addition always . "
44175	44182	44184	44184	Lucy	137	" But why should you think , "
44192	44207	44184	44184	Lucy	137	" that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex ? "
44208	44407	44081	44081	Lucy	137	" Nay , my dear , I 'm sure I do n't pretend to say that there an't . I 'm sure there 's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter ; but you know , how could I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland ; and I was only afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton , if they had not so many as they used to have . But perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux , and had as lief be without them as with them . For my part , I think they are vastly agreeable , provided they dress smart and behave civil . But I ca n't bear to see them dirty and nasty . Now there 's Mr. Rose at Exeter , a prodigious smart young man , quite a beau , clerk to Mr. Simpson , you know , and yet if you do but meet him of a morning , he is not fit to be seen . — I suppose your brother was quite a beau , Miss Dashwood , before he married , as he was so rich ? "
44408	44413	44415	44415	Elinor	88	" Upon my word , "
44417	44467	44415	44415	Elinor	88	" I can not tell you , for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word . But this I can say , that if he ever was a beau before he married , he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him . "
44468	44490	44081	44081	Lucy	137	" Oh ! dear ! one never thinks of married men 's being beaux — they have something else to do . "
44491	44496	44528	44528	she	88	" Lord ! Anne , "
44501	44520	44528	44528	she	88	" you can talk of nothing but beaux;—you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else . "
44872	44889	44891	44891	she	1245	" ' Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure , "
44893	44929	44891	44891	she	1245	" and I hear he is quite a beau , and prodigious handsome . And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,—but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already . "
45147	45153	45155	45155	he	99	" His name is Ferrars , "
45163	45178	45155	45155	he	99	" but pray do not tell it , for it 's a great secret . "
45179	45182	45184	45185	Miss Steele	137	" Ferrars ! "
45187	45227	45184	45185	Miss Steele	137	" Mr. Ferrars is the happy man , is he ? What ! your sister - in - law 's brother , Miss Dashwood ? a very agreeable young man to be sure ; I know him very well . "
45228	45237	45239	45239	Lucy	137	" How can you say so , Anne ? "
45253	45280	45239	45239	Lucy	137	" Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle 's , it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well . "
45290	45307	45281	45281	Elinor	88	" And who was this uncle ? Where did he live ? How came they acquainted ? "
45758	45772	45774	45774	Lucy	137	" You will think my question an odd one , I dare say , "
45790	45810	45811	45811	Elinor	88	cottage—"but pray , are you personally acquainted with your sister - in - law 's mother , Mrs. Ferrars ? "
45838	45841	45843	45843	Lucy	137	" Indeed ! "
45845	45880	45843	45843	Lucy	137	" I wonder at that , for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes . Then , perhaps , you can not tell me what sort of a woman she is ? "
45881	45884	45886	45886	Elinor	88	" No , "
45910	45917	45891	45891	her	88	" I know nothing of her . "
45918	45937	45939	45939	Lucy	137	" I am sure you think me very strange , for enquiring about her in such a way , "
45948	45983	45939	45939	Lucy	137	" but perhaps there may be reasons — I wish I might venture ; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent . "
46020	46124	46006	46006	Lucy	137	" I can not bear to have you think me impertinently curious . I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours . And I am sure I should not have the smallest fear of trusting YOU ; indeed , I should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation as I am ; but , however , there is no occasion to trouble YOU . I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars . "
46125	46133	46135	46135	Elinor	88	" I am sorry I do NOT , "
46141	46193	46135	46135	Elinor	88	" if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her . But really I never understood that you were at all connected with that family , and therefore I am a little surprised , I confess , at so serious an inquiry into her character . "
46194	46264	46265	46265	She	1262	" I dare say you are , and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it . But if I dared tell you all , you would not be so much surprised . Mrs. Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present — but the time MAY come — how soon it will come must depend upon herself — when we may be very intimately connected . "
46291	46295	46297	46297	Elinor	88	" Good heavens ! "
46299	46317	46297	46297	Elinor	88	" what do you mean ? Are you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars ? Can you be ? "
46337	46340	46342	46342	Lucy	137	" No , "
46344	46361	46342	46342	Lucy	137	" not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars — I never saw him in my life ; but , "
46368	46374	46342	46342	Lucy	137	" to his eldest brother . "
46452	46459	46461	46461	Lucy	137	" You may well be surprised , "
46463	46638	46461	46461	Lucy	137	" for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before ; for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family ; because it was always meant to be a great secret , and I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour . Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne , and I never should have mentioned it to you , if I had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy ; and I really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars must seem so odd , that it ought to be explained . And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased , when he knows I have trusted you , because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family , and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own sisters . "—She
46693	46705	46676	46676	she	88	" May I ask if your engagement is of long standing ? "
46706	46715	46676	46676	she	88	" We have been engaged these four years . "
46716	46720	46676	46676	she	88	" Four years ! "
46721	46724	46676	46676	she	88	" Yes . "
46738	46744	46746	46746	she	88	" I did not know , "
46748	46759	46746	46746	she	88	" that you were even acquainted till the other day . "
46760	46787	46676	46676	she	88	" Our acquaintance , however , is of many years date . He was under my uncle 's care , you know , a considerable while . "
46788	46792	46746	46746	she	88	" Your uncle ! "
46793	46809	46676	46676	she	88	" Yes ; Mr. Pratt . Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt ? "
46810	46816	46818	46818	Elinor	88	" I think I have , "
46834	46985	46676	46676	she	88	" He was four years with my uncle , who lives at Longstaple , near Plymouth . It was there our acquaintance begun , for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle , and it was there our engagement was formed , though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil ; but he was almost always with us afterwards . I was very unwilling to enter into it , as you may imagine , without the knowledge and approbation of his mother ; but I was too young , and loved him too well , to be so prudent as I ought to have been . — Though you do not know him so well as me , Miss Dashwood , you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him . "
46986	46989	46991	46991	Elinor	88	" Certainly , "
47023	47068	47006	47006	she	88	falsehood—"Engaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars!—I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me , that really — I beg your pardon ; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name . We can not mean the same Mr. Ferrars . "
47069	47076	47078	47078	Lucy	137	" We can mean no other , "
47082	47141	47078	47078	Lucy	137	" Mr. Edward Ferrars , the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars , of Park Street , and brother of your sister - in - law , Fanny , is the person I mean ; you must allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends . "
47142	47147	47149	47149	Elinor	88	" It is strange , "
47157	47170	47149	47149	Elinor	88	" that I should never have heard him even mention your name . "
47171	47248	47319	47319	she	1266	" No ; considering our situation , it was not strange . Our first care has been to keep the matter secret . — You knew nothing of me , or my family , and , therefore , there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name to you ; and , as he was always particularly afraid of his sister 's suspecting any thing , THAT was reason enough for his not mentioning it . "
47267	47275	47277	47277	she	1266	" Four years you have been engaged , "
47283	47309	47319	47319	she	1266	" Yes ; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait . Poor Edward ! It puts him quite out of heart . "
47322	47376	47319	47319	she	1266	" To prevent the possibility of mistake , be so good as to look at this face . It does not do him justice , to be sure , but yet I think you can not be deceived as to the person it was drew for.—I have had it above these three years . "
47440	47447	47449	47449	Lucy	137	" I have never been able , "
47451	47492	47449	47449	Lucy	137	" to give him my picture in return , which I am very much vexed at , for he has been always so anxious to get it ! But I am determined to set for it the very first opportunity . "
47493	47501	47503	47503	Elinor	88	" You are quite in the right , "
47519	47524	47526	47526	she	137	" I am sure , "
47528	47591	47526	47526	she	137	" I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret , because you must know of what importance it is to us , not to have it reach his mother ; for she would never approve of it , I dare say . I shall have no fortune , and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman . "
47592	47601	47603	47603	Elinor	88	" I certainly did not seek your confidence , "
47605	47663	47603	47603	Elinor	88	" but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on . Your secret is safe with me ; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication . You must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety . "
47705	47721	47723	47723	she	88	" I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you , "
47725	47988	47723	47723	she	88	" in telling you all this . I have not known you long to be sure , personally at least , but I have known you and all your family by description a great while ; and as soon as I saw you , I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance . Besides in the present case , I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward 's mother ; and I am so unfortunate , that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask . Anne is the only person that knows of it , and she has no judgment at all ; indeed , she does me a great deal more harm than good , for I am in constant fear of her betraying me . She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t'other day , when Edward 's name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all . You ca n't think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether . I only wonder that I am alive after what I have suffered for Edward 's sake these last four years . Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty ; and seeing him so seldom — we can hardly meet above twice a - year . I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke . "
48004	48007	48009	48009	Lucy	137	" Sometimes . "
48016	48035	48009	48009	Lucy	137	" I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely . "
48048	48135	48041	48041	she	1268	" But then at other times I have not resolution enough for it . — I can not bear the thoughts of making him so miserable , as I know the very mention of such a thing would do . And on my own account too — so dear as he is to me — I do n't think I could be equal to it . What would you advise me to do in such a case , Miss Dashwood ? What would you do yourself ? "
48136	48140	48142	48142	Elinor	88	" Pardon me , "
48149	48168	48142	48142	Elinor	88	" but I can give you no advice under such circumstances . Your own judgment must direct you . "
48169	48174	48176	48176	Lucy	137	" To be sure , "
48187	48250	48176	48176	Lucy	137	" his mother must provide for him sometime or other ; but poor Edward is so cast down by it ! Did you not think him dreadful low - spirited when he was at Barton ? He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple , to go to you , that I was afraid you would think him quite ill . "
48251	48267	48142	48142	Elinor	88	" Did he come from your uncle 's , then , when he visited us ? "
48268	48291	48176	48176	Lucy	137	" Oh , yes ; he had been staying a fortnight with us . Did you think he came directly from town ? "
48292	48295	48297	48297	Elinor	88	" No , "
48313	48333	48297	48297	Elinor	88	" I remember he told us , that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth . "
48365	48376	48378	48378	Lucy	137	" Did not you think him sadly out of spirits ? "
48380	48393	48297	48297	Elinor	88	" We did , indeed , particularly so when he first arrived . "
48394	48468	48473	48473	her	137	" I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter ; but it made him so melancholy , not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us , and seeing me so much affected . — Poor fellow!—I am afraid it is just the same with him now ; for he writes in wretched spirits . I heard from him just before I left Exeter ; "
48483	48529	48473	48473	her	137	" You know his hand , I dare say , a charming one it is ; but that is not written so well as usual.—He was tired , I dare say , for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible . "
48645	48651	48653	48653	Lucy	137	" Writing to each other , "
48662	48755	48653	48653	Lucy	137	" is the only comfort we have in such long separations . Yes , I have one other comfort in his picture , but poor Edward has not even THAT . If he had but my picture , he says he should be easy . I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last , and that was some comfort to him , he said , but not equal to a picture . Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him ? "
48756	48760	48762	48762	Elinor	88	" I did , "
50819	50824	50826	50827	Lady Middleton	100	" I am glad , "
50831	50889	50826	50827	Lady Middleton	100	" you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria 's basket this evening ; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight . And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to - morrow , and then I hope she will not much mind it . "
50902	50972	50897	50897	herself	137	" Indeed you are very much mistaken , Lady Middleton ; I am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me , or I should have been at my filigree already . I would not disappoint the little angel for all the world : and if you want me at the card - table now , I am resolved to finish the basket after supper . "
50973	51038	51077	51078	Lady Middleton	100	" You are very good , I hope it wo n't hurt your eyes — will you ring the bell for some working candles ? My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed , I know , if the basket was not finished tomorrow , for though I told her it certainly would not , I am sure she depends upon having it done . "
51110	51146	51152	51152	she	89	" Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME — you know I detest cards . I shall go to the piano - forte ; I have not touched it since it was tuned . "
51179	51193	51195	51195	Elinor	88	" Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know , ma'am , "
51204	51228	51195	51195	Elinor	88	" and I do not much wonder at it ; for it is the very best toned piano - forte I ever heard . "
51239	51242	51244	51244	Elinor	88	" Perhaps , "
51246	51321	51244	51244	Elinor	88	" if I should happen to cut out , I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele , in rolling her papers for her ; and there is so much still to be done to the basket , that it must be impossible I think for her labour singly , to finish it this evening . I should like the work exceedingly , if she would allow me a share in it . "
51322	51336	51338	51338	Lucy	137	" Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help , "
51340	51372	51338	51338	Lucy	137	" for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was ; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all . "
51373	51383	51385	51386	Miss Steele	137	" Oh ! that would be terrible , indeed , "
51388	51399	51385	51386	Miss Steele	137	" Dear little soul , how I do love her ! "
51400	51406	51408	51409	Lady Middleton	100	" You are very kind , "
51413	51445	51408	51409	Lady Middleton	100	" and as you really like the work , perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber , or will you take your chance now ? "
51608	51650	51604	51604	Elinor	88	" I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with , if I felt no desire for its continuance , or no farther curiosity on its subject . I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again . "
51651	51655	51657	51657	Lucy	137	" Thank you , "
51660	51695	51657	51657	Lucy	137	" for breaking the ice ; you have set my heart at ease by it ; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I told you that Monday . "
51696	51709	51711	51711	Elinor	88	" Offended me ! How could you suppose so ? Believe me , "
51719	51753	51711	51711	Elinor	88	" nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea . Could you have a motive for the trust , that was not honourable and flattering to me ? "
51754	51762	51764	51764	Lucy	137	" And yet I do assure you , "
51774	51893	51764	51764	Lucy	137	" there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable . I felt sure that you was angry with me ; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since , for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs . But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy , and that you really do not blame me . If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life , your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am sure . "
51894	51978	51711	51711	Elinor	88	" Indeed , I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you , to acknowledge your situation to me , and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it . Your case is a very unfortunate one ; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties , and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them . Mr. Ferrars , I believe , is entirely dependent on his mother . "
51979	52110	51764	51764	Lucy	137	" He has only two thousand pounds of his own ; it would be madness to marry upon that , though for my own part , I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh . I have been always used to a very small income , and could struggle with any poverty for him ; but I love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him , perhaps , of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her . We must wait , it may be for many years . With almost every other man in the world , it would be an alarming prospect ; but Edward 's affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know . "
52111	52172	51711	51711	Elinor	88	" That conviction must be every thing to you ; and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your 's . If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed , as between many people , and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years ' engagement , your situation would have been pitiable , indeed . "
52198	52205	52207	52207	Lucy	137	" Edward 's love for me , "
52209	52272	52207	52207	Lucy	137	" has been pretty well put to the test , by our long , very long absence since we were first engaged , and it has stood the trial so well , that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now . I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment 's alarm on that account from the first . "
52289	52430	52285	52285	Lucy	137	" I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature , and from our different situations in life , from his being so much more in the world than me , and our continual separation , I was enough inclined for suspicion , to have found out the truth in an instant , if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met , or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for , or if he had talked more of one lady than another , or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he used to be . I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick - sighted in general , but in such a case I am sure I could not be deceived . "
52431	52435	52437	52437	Elinor	88	" All this , "
52439	52453	52285	52285	Lucy	137	" is very pretty ; but it can impose upon neither of us . "
52454	52458	52460	52460	she	88	" But what , "
52466	52534	52460	52460	she	88	" are your views ? or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars 's death , which is a melancholy and shocking extremity?—Is her son determined to submit to this , and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you , rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth ? "
52535	52600	52285	52285	Lucy	137	" If we could be certain that it would be only for a while ! But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman , and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it , would very likely secure every thing to Robert , and the idea of that , for Edward 's sake , frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures . "
52601	52618	52460	52460	she	88	" And for your own sake too , or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason . "
52629	52637	52639	52639	Elinor	88	" Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars ? "
52641	52667	52460	52460	she	88	" Not at all — I never saw him ; but I fancy he is very unlike his brother — silly and a great coxcomb . "
52668	52673	52675	52676	Miss Steele	137	" A great coxcomb ! "
52694	52709	52675	52676	Miss Steele	137	" Oh , they are talking of their favourite beaux , I dare say . "
52710	52714	52716	52716	Lucy	137	" No sister , "
52718	52732	52716	52716	Lucy	137	" you are mistaken there , our favourite beaux are NOT great coxcombs . "
52733	52746	52748	52749	Mrs. Jennings	103	" I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood 's is not , "
52754	52793	52748	52749	Mrs. Jennings	103	" for he is one of the modestest , prettiest behaved young men I ever saw ; but as for Lucy , she is such a sly little creature , there is no finding out who SHE likes . "
52794	52797	52799	52800	Miss Steele	137	" Oh , "
52808	52827	52799	52800	Miss Steele	137	" I dare say Lucy 's beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood 's . "
52885	53050	52871	52871	Marianne	89	" I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head , for bringing matters to bear ; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret , for you are a party concerned . I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession ; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can , and then through your interest , which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him , and I hope out of some regard to me , your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living ; which I understand is a very good one , and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while . That would be enough for us to marry upon , and we might trust to time and chance for the rest . "
53051	53058	53060	53060	Elinor	88	" I should always be happy , "
53062	53108	53060	53060	Elinor	88	" to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars ; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary ? He is brother to Fanny — THAT must be recommendation enough to her husband . "
53109	53123	52871	52871	Marianne	89	" But Fanny would not much approve of Edward 's going into orders . "
53124	53137	53060	53060	Elinor	88	" Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little . "
53155	53220	53148	53148	Lucy	137	" I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement . We seem so beset with difficulties on every side , that though it would make us miserable for a time , we should be happier perhaps in the end . But you will not give me your advice , Miss Dashwood ? "
53221	53224	53226	53226	Elinor	88	" No , "
53238	53272	53226	53226	Elinor	88	" on such a subject I certainly will not . You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you , unless it were on the side of your wishes . "
53273	53279	53281	53281	Lucy	137	" Indeed you wrong me , "
53287	53358	53281	53281	Lucy	137	" I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours ; and I do really believe , that if you was to say to me , ' I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars , it will be more for the happiness of both of you , ' I should resolve upon doing it immediately . "
53373	53417	53359	53359	Elinor	88	" This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one . It raises my influence much too high ; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person . "
53418	53428	53430	53430	Lucy	137	" ' Tis because you are an indifferent person , "
53445	53481	53430	53430	Lucy	137	" that your judgment might justly have such weight with me . If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings , your opinion would not be worth having . "
53543	53555	53557	53557	she	137	" Shall you be in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? "
53564	53568	53534	53534	Lucy	137	" Certainly not . "
53569	53576	53578	53579	the other	784	" I am sorry for that , "
53589	53629	53582	53582	her	784	" it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there ! But I dare say you will go for all that . To be sure , your brother and sister will ask you to come to them . "
53630	53646	53534	53534	Lucy	137	" It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do . "
53647	53722	53582	53582	her	784	" How unlucky that is ! I had quite depended upon meeting you there . Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years ! But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward . He will be there in February , otherwise London would have no charms for me ; I have not spirits for it . "
54265	54482	54261	54261	her	103	" Oh , Lord ! I am sure your mother can spare you very well , and I DO beg you will favour me with your company , for I 've quite set my heart upon it . Do n't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me , for I sha n't put myself at all out of my way for you . It will only be sending Beta by the coach , and I hope I can afford THAT . We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise ; and when we are in town , if you do not like to go wherever I do , well and good , you may always go with one of my daughters . I am sure your mother will not object to it ; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if I do n't get one of you at least well married before I have done with you , it shall not be my fault . I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men , you may depend upon it . "
54483	54489	54491	54492	Sir John	99	" I have a notion , "
54494	54567	54491	54492	Sir John	99	" that Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme , if her elder sister would come into it . It is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure , because Miss Dashwood does not wish it . So I would advise you two , to set off for town , when you are tired of Barton , without saying a word to Miss Dashwood about it . "
54568	54571	54573	54574	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Nay , "
54576	54724	54573	54574	Mrs. Jennings	103	" I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne 's company , whether Miss Dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say I , and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my old ways behind my back . But one or the other , if not both of them , I must have . Lord bless me ! how do you think I can live poking by myself , I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me . Come , Miss Marianne , let us strike hands upon the bargain , and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye , why so much the better . "
54725	54736	54738	54738	Marianne	89	" I thank you , ma'am , sincerely thank you , "
54743	54835	54738	54738	Marianne	89	" your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever , and it would give me such happiness , yes , almost the greatest happiness I am capable of , to be able to accept it . But my mother , my dearest , kindest mother,—I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged , and if she were to be made less happy , less comfortable by our absence — Oh ! no , nothing should tempt me to leave her . It should not , must not be a struggle . "
55176	55184	55185	55185	she	86	" I am delighted with the plan , "
55188	55372	55185	55185	she	86	" it is exactly what I could wish . Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves . When you and the Middletons are gone , we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music ! You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again ! I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too , which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one . It is very right that you SHOULD go to town ; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London . You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt . And in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when I consider whose son he is , I can not bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other . "
55373	55383	55385	55385	Elinor	88	" Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness , "
55387	55421	55385	55385	Elinor	88	" you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you , there is still one objection which , in my opinion , can not be so easily removed . "
55427	55431	55433	55434	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" And what , "
55436	55468	55433	55434	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest ? What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward ? Do let me hear a word about the expense of it . "
55469	55506	55515	55516	her mother	338	" My objection is this ; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings 's heart , she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure , or whose protection will give us consequence . "
55507	55513	55515	55516	her mother	338	" That is very true , "
55518	55552	55515	55516	her mother	338	" but of her society , separately from that of other people , you will scarcely have any thing at all , and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton . "
55553	55566	55568	55568	Marianne	89	" If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings , "
55570	55607	55568	55568	Marianne	89	" at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation . I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . "
55746	55754	55756	55757	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" I will have you BOTH go , "
55759	55823	55756	55757	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" these objections are nonsensical . You will have much pleasure in being in London , and especially in being together ; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment , she would foresee it there from a variety of sources ; she would , perhaps , expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister - in - law 's family . "
55888	55934	55885	55885	she	88	" I like Edward Ferrars very much , and shall always be glad to see him ; but as to the rest of the family , it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , whether I am ever known to them or not . "
56997	57005	57007	57007	Elinor	88	" I am writing home , Marianne , "
57009	57023	57007	57007	Elinor	88	" had not you better defer your letter for a day or two ? "
57024	57035	57037	57037	Marianne	89	" I am NOT going to write to my mother , "
57423	57436	57417	57417	she	89	" Oh , Elinor , it is Willoughby , indeed it is ! "
57561	57567	57569	57569	he	106	" Is your sister ill ? "
57751	57754	57755	57755	he	106	" Yes , "
57762	57793	57755	57755	he	106	" almost ever since ; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days , but it has never been in my power to return to Barton . "
57859	57864	57866	57866	she	88	" Oh ! Colonel , "
57874	57990	57866	57866	she	88	" I am monstrous glad to see you — sorry I could not come before — beg your pardon , but I have been forced to look about me a little , and settle my matters ; for it is a long while since I have been at home , and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time ; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with — Lord , I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner ! But pray , Colonel , how came you to conjure out that I should be in town today ? "
57991	58010	57866	57866	she	88	" I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer 's , where I have been dining . "
58011	58046	57866	57866	she	88	" Oh , you did ; well , and how do they all do at their house ? How does Charlotte do ? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time . "
58047	58072	57866	57866	she	88	" Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well , and I am commissioned to tell you , that you will certainly see her to - morrow . "
58073	58252	57866	57866	she	88	" Ay , to be sure , I thought as much . Well , Colonel , I have brought two young ladies with me , you see — that is , you see but one of them now , but there is another somewhere . Your friend , Miss Marianne , too — which you will not be sorry to hear . I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby will do between you about her . Ay , it is a fine thing to be young and handsome . Well ! I was young once , but I never was very handsome — worse luck for me . However , I got a very good husband , and I do n't know what the greatest beauty can do more . Ah ! poor man ! he has been dead these eight years and better . But Colonel , where have you been to since we parted ? And how does your business go on ? Come , come , let 's have no secrets among friends . "
58475	58486	58488	58488	she	1417	" Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you , "
58490	58520	58488	58488	she	1417	" What do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mamma ? I forget what it was now , but it was something so droll ! "
58825	58839	58841	58841	she	88	" Has no letter been left here for me since we went out ? "
58859	58867	58868	58868	she	88	" Are you quite sure of it ? "
58871	58888	58868	58868	she	88	" Are you certain that no servant , no porter has left any letter or note ? "
58896	58901	58903	58903	she	88	" How very odd ! "
58920	58926	58930	58930	herself	88	" How odd , indeed ! "
58938	59038	58930	58930	herself	88	" If she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him , as she did ; she would have written to Combe Magna ; and if he is in town , how odd that he should neither come nor write ! Oh ! my dear mother , you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young , a man so little known , to be carried on in so doubtful , so mysterious a manner ! I long to inquire ; and how will MY interference be borne . "
59252	59261	59263	59264	Mrs. Jennings	103	" If this open weather holds much longer , "
59275	59321	59263	59264	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week ; ' tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day 's pleasure . Poor souls ! I always pity them when they do ; they seem to take it so much to heart . "
59322	59327	59329	59329	Marianne	89	" That is true , "
59350	59368	59329	59329	Marianne	89	" I had not thought of that . This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country . "
59384	59393	59394	59394	she	89	" It is charming weather for THEM indeed , "
59410	59419	59394	59394	she	89	" How much they must enjoy it ! But "
59428	59499	59394	59394	she	89	" it can not be expected to last long . At this time of the year , and after such a series of rain , we shall certainly have very little more of it . Frosts will soon set in , and in all probability with severity . In another day or two perhaps ; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer — nay , perhaps it may freeze tonight ! "
59500	59505	59507	59507	Elinor	88	" At any rate , "
59526	59547	59512	59513	Mrs. Jennings	103	" I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week . "
59548	59568	59507	59507	Elinor	88	" Ay , my dear , I 'll warrant you we do . Mary always has her own way . "
59569	59573	59576	59576	Elinor	88	" And now , "
59578	59590	59576	59576	Elinor	88	" she will write to Combe by this day 's post . "
59730	59799	59702	59702	Marianne	89	" Do n't you find it colder than it was in the morning , Elinor ? There seems to me a very decided difference . I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff . It was not so yesterday , I think . The clouds seem parting too , the sun will be out in a moment , and we shall have a clear afternoon . "
60111	60115	60117	60117	Marianne	89	" Good God ! "
60119	60129	60117	60117	Marianne	89	" he has been here while we were out . "
60147	60158	60165	60165	her	88	" Depend upon it , he will call again tomorrow . "
60309	60313	60315	60315	Marianne	89	" For me ! "
60321	60330	60315	60315	Marianne	89	" No , ma'am , for my mistress . "
60342	60353	60332	60332	Marianne	89	" It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings ; how provoking ! "
60354	60363	60365	60365	Elinor	88	" You are expecting a letter , then ? "
60373	60382	60332	60332	Marianne	89	" Yes , a little — not much . "
60388	60398	60332	60332	Marianne	89	" You have no confidence in me , Marianne . "
60399	60417	60332	60332	Marianne	89	" Nay , Elinor , this reproach from YOU — you who have confidence in no one ! "
60418	60421	60423	60423	Elinor	88	" Me ! "
60428	60439	60423	60423	Elinor	88	" indeed , Marianne , I have nothing to tell . "
60440	60444	60446	60446	Marianne	89	" Nor I , "
60450	60483	60446	60446	Marianne	89	" our situations then are alike . We have neither of us any thing to tell ; you , because you do not communicate , and I , because I conceal nothing . "
60985	60994	60996	60996	he	129	" I thought you were both in Devonshire , "
60998	61002	61004	61004	Elinor	88	" Did you ? "
61006	61014	60972	60972	himself	104	" When do you go back again ? "
61015	61021	61030	61030	Marianne	89	" I do not know . "
61066	61071	61073	61074	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Aye , aye , "
61076	61132	61073	61074	Mrs. Jennings	103	" we know the reason of all that very well ; if a certain person who shall be nameless , had been there , you would not have been a bit tired : and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited . "
61133	61136	61138	61138	Marianne	89	" Invited ! "
61140	61162	61163	61163	Marianne	89	" So my daughter Middleton told me , for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning . "
61496	61505	61549	61549	his	104	" your sister looks unwell to - day , "
61507	61515	61516	61516	he	104	" your sister seems out of spirits , "
61611	61624	61603	61603	He	104	" your sister 's engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known . "
61625	61633	61635	61635	Elinor	88	" It can not be generally known , "
61637	61647	61635	61635	Elinor	88	" for her own family do not know it . "
61654	61691	61648	61648	He	104	" I beg your pardon , I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent ; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended , as they openly correspond , and their marriage is universally talked of . "
61692	61707	61603	61603	He	104	" How can that be ? By whom can you have heard it mentioned ? "
61708	61907	61648	61648	He	104	" By many — by some of whom you know nothing , by others with whom you are most intimate , Mrs. Jennings , Mrs. Palmer , and the Middletons . But still I might not have believed it , for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced , it will always find something to support its doubts , if I had not , when the servant let me in today , accidentally seen a letter in his hand , directed to Mr. Willoughby in your sister 's writing . I came to inquire , but I was convinced before I could ask the question . Is every thing finally settled ? Is it impossible to- ? But I have no right , and I could have no chance of succeeding . Excuse me , Miss Dashwood . I believe I have been wrong in saying so much , but I hardly know what to do , and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence . Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on , that any attempt , that in short concealment , if concealment be possible , is all that remains . "
62143	62161	62131	62131	his	106	" to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness ; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her,"—took
62685	62689	62690	62690	she	1507	" Good heavens ! "
62693	62720	62690	62690	she	1507	" he is there — he is there — Oh ! why does he not look at me ? why can not I speak to him ? "
62721	62728	62730	62730	Elinor	88	" Pray , pray be composed , "
62732	62753	62730	62730	Elinor	88	" and do not betray what you feel to every body present . Perhaps he has not observed you yet . "
62928	62956	62917	62917	she	1507	" Good God ! Willoughby , what is the meaning of this ? Have you not received my letters ? Will you not shake hands with me ? "
63016	63058	63011	63011	he	106	" I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday , and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home . My card was not lost , I hope . "
63059	63068	63070	63070	Marianne	89	" But have you not received my notes ? "
63076	63114	63070	63070	Marianne	89	" Here is some mistake I am sure — some dreadful mistake . What can be the meaning of it ? Tell me , Willoughby ; for heaven 's sake tell me , what is the matter ? "
63166	63193	63157	63157	he	106	" Yes , I had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town , which you were so good as to send me , "
63251	63258	63259	63259	she	89	" Go to him , Elinor , "
63269	63325	63259	63259	she	89	" and force him to come to me . Tell him I must see him again — must speak to him instantly . — I can not rest — I shall not have a moment 's peace till this is explained — some dreadful misapprehension or other . — Oh go to him this moment . "
63326	63356	63361	63361	she	89	" How can that be done ? No , my dearest Marianne , you must wait . This is not the place for explanations . Wait only till tomorrow . "
64028	64035	64072	64072	she	89	" Marianne , may I ask- ? "
64036	64041	64042	64042	she	88	" No , Elinor , "
64045	64055	64042	64042	she	88	" ask nothing ; you will soon know all . "
64530	64620	64527	64527	she	88	" Upon my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life ! MY girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature . I hope , from the bottom of my heart , he wo n't keep her waiting much longer , for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn . Pray , when are they to be married ? "
64654	64733	64635	64635	herself	88	" And have you really , Ma'am , talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister 's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby ? I thought it had been only a joke , but so serious a question seems to imply more ; and I must beg , therefore , that you will not deceive yourself any longer . I do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married . "
64734	64879	64927	64928	Mrs. Jennings	103	" For shame , for shame , Miss Dashwood ! how can you talk so ? Do n't we all know that it must be a match , that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met ? Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day , and all day long ; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes ? Come , come , this wo n't do . Because you are so sly about it yourself , you think nobody else has any senses ; but it is no such thing , I can tell you , for it has been known all over town this ever so long . I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte . "
64880	64885	64887	64887	Elinor	88	" Indeed , Ma'am , "
64892	64926	64887	64887	Elinor	88	" you are mistaken . Indeed , you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report , and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now . "
65141	65147	65148	65148	MY	0	" Bond Street , January . "
65152	65401	65148	65148	MY	0	" I have just had the honour of receiving your letter , for which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments . I am much concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation ; and though I am quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so unfortunate as to offend you , I entreat your forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional . I shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire without the most grateful pleasure , and flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension of my actions . My esteem for your whole family is very sincere ; but if I have been so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than I felt , or meant to express , I shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that esteem . That I should ever have meant more you will allow to be impossible , when you understand that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere , and it will not be many weeks , I believe , before this engagement is fulfilled . It is with great regret that I obey your commands in returning the letters with which I have been honoured from you , and the lock of hair , which you so obligingly bestowed on me .
65402	65409	65410	65415	Your most obedient " humble servant	3534	" I am , dear Madam , "
65413	65417	65418	65419	JOHN WILLOUGHBY	156	" humble servant , "
65421	65421	65418	65419	JOHN WILLOUGHBY	156	"
66021	66031	66005	66005	she	343	" Poor Elinor ! how unhappy I make you ! "
66032	66037	66039	66040	her sister	343	" I only wish , "
66042	66059	66039	66040	her sister	343	" there were any thing I COULD do , which might be of comfort to you . "
66088	66099	66085	66085	her	89	" Oh ! Elinor , I am miserable , indeed , "
66122	66129	66130	66130	she	343	" Exert yourself , dear Marianne , "
66133	66167	66130	66130	she	343	" if you would not kill yourself and all who love you . Think of your mother ; think of her misery while YOU suffer : for her sake you must exert yourself . "
66168	66177	66179	66179	Marianne	89	" I can not , I can not , "
66181	66244	66179	66179	Marianne	89	" leave me , leave me , if I distress you ; leave me , hate me , forget me ! but do not torture me so . Oh ! how easy for those , who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion ! Happy , happy Elinor , YOU can not have an idea of what I suffer . "
66245	66274	66130	66130	she	343	" Do you call ME happy , Marianne ? Ah ! if you knew!—And can you believe me to be so , while I see you so wretched ! "
66275	66282	66179	66179	Marianne	89	" Forgive me , forgive me , "
66292	66335	66179	66179	Marianne	89	" I know you feel for me ; I know what a heart you have ; but yet you are — you must be happy ; Edward loves you — what , oh what , can do away such happiness as that ? "
66336	66342	66344	66344	Elinor	88	" Many , many circumstances , "
66348	66355	66357	66357	Marianne	89	" No , no , no , "
66360	66375	66357	66357	Marianne	89	" he loves you , and only you . You CAN have no grief . "
66376	66390	66179	66179	Marianne	89	" I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state . "
66391	66410	66357	66357	Marianne	89	" And you will never see me otherwise . Mine is a misery which nothing can do away . "
66411	66513	66179	66179	Marianne	89	" You must not talk so , Marianne . Have you no comforts ? no friends ? Is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation ? Much as you suffer now , think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period — if your engagement had been carried on for months and months , as it might have been , before he chose to put an end to it . Every additional day of unhappy confidence , on your side , would have made the blow more dreadful . "
66514	66517	66519	66519	Marianne	89	" Engagement ! "
66521	66528	66519	66519	Marianne	89	" there has been no engagement . "
66529	66533	66179	66179	Marianne	89	" No engagement ! "
66534	66555	66519	66519	Marianne	89	" No , he is not so unworthy as you believe him . He has broken no faith with me . "
66556	66566	66179	66179	Marianne	89	" But he told you that he loved you . "
66567	66598	66519	66519	Marianne	89	" Yes — no — never absolutely . It was every day implied , but never professedly declared . Sometimes I thought it had been — but it never was . "
66599	66606	66179	66179	Marianne	89	" Yet you wrote to him ? "
66608	66628	66519	66519	Marianne	89	" Yes — could that be wrong after all that had passed ? — But I can not talk . "
66686	66777	66781	66781	Her	343	" How surprised you will be , Willoughby , on receiving this ; and I think you will feel something more than surprise , when you know that I am in town . An opportunity of coming hither , though with Mrs. Jennings , was a temptation we could not resist . I wish you may receive this in time to come here to - night , but I will not depend on it . At any rate I shall expect you to - morrow . For the present , adieu .
66778	66780	66781	66781	Her	343	" M.D. "
66806	66981	66781	66781	Her	343	" I can not express my disappointment in having missed you the day before yesterday , nor my astonishment at not having received any answer to a note which I sent you above a week ago . I have been expecting to hear from you , and still more to see you , every hour of the day . Pray call again as soon as possible , and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain . You had better come earlier another time , because we are generally out by one . We were last night at Lady Middleton 's , where there was a dance . I have been told that you were asked to be of the party . But could it be so ? You must be very much altered indeed since we parted , if that could be the case , and you not there . But I will not suppose this possible , and I hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise .
66982	66984	66781	66781	Her	343	" M.D. "
66997	67280	66781	66781	Her	343	" What am I to imagine , Willoughby , by your behaviour last night ? Again I demand an explanation of it . I was prepared to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally produced , with the familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared to me to justify . I was repulsed indeed ! I have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting ; but though I have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for your behaviour , I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of it . You have perhaps been misinformed , or purposely deceived , in something concerning me , which may have lowered me in your opinion . Tell me what it is , explain the grounds on which you acted , and I shall be satisfied , in being able to satisfy you . It would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill of you ; but if I am to do it , if I am to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed you , that your regard for us all was insincere , that your behaviour to me was intended only to deceive , let it be told as soon as possible . My feelings are at present in a state of dreadful indecision ; I wish to acquit you , but certainty on either side will be ease to what I now suffer . If your sentiments are no longer what they were , you will return my notes , and the lock of my hair which is in your possession .
67281	67283	66781	66781	Her	343	" M.D. "
67396	67401	67402	67402	she	88	" I felt myself , "
67405	67427	67402	67402	she	88	" to be as solemnly engaged to him , as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other . "
67428	67434	67436	67436	Elinor	88	" I can believe it , "
67438	67448	67436	67436	Elinor	88	" but unfortunately he did not feel the same . "
67449	67595	67615	67615	she	1563	" He DID feel the same , Elinor — for weeks and weeks he felt it . I know he did . Whatever may have changed him now , ( and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it ) , I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish . This lock of hair , which now he can so readily give up , was begged of me with the most earnest supplication . Had you seen his look , his manner , had you heard his voice at that moment ! Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton ? The morning that we parted too ! When he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again — his distress — can I ever forget his distress ? "
67623	67637	67615	67615	she	1563	" Elinor , I have been cruelly used ; but not by Willoughby . "
67638	67654	67615	67615	she	1563	" Dearest Marianne , who but himself ? By whom can he have been instigated ? "
67655	67762	67615	67615	she	1563	" By all the world , rather than by his own heart . I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion , than believe his nature capable of such cruelty . This woman of whom he writes — whoever she be — or any one , in short , but your own dear self , mama , and Edward , may have been so barbarous to bely me . Beyond you three , is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby , whose heart I know so well ? "
67772	67824	67615	67615	she	1563	" Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy , let them be cheated of their malignant triumph , my dear sister , by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits . It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence . "
67825	67830	67832	67832	Marianne	158	" No , no , "
67834	67919	67832	67832	Marianne	158	" misery such as mine has no pride . I care not who knows that I am wretched . The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world . Elinor , Elinor , they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like — may resist insult , or return mortification — but I can not . I must feel — I must be wretched — and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can . "
67920	67930	67615	67615	she	1563	" But for my mother 's sake and mine — "
67931	67958	67832	67832	Marianne	158	" I would do more than for my own . But to appear happy when I am so miserable — Oh ! who can require it ? "
68039	68153	68407	68407	Elinor	88	" It is too much ! Oh , Willoughby , Willoughby , could this be yours ! Cruel , cruel — nothing can acquit you . Elinor , nothing can . Whatever he might have heard against me — ought he not to have suspended his belief ? ought he not to have told me of it , to have given me the power of clearing myself ? ' The lock of hair , ( repeating it from the letter , ) which you so obligingly bestowed on me'—That is unpardonable . Willoughby , where was your heart when you wrote those words ? Oh , barbarously insolent!—Elinor , can he be justified ? "
68154	68164	68407	68407	Elinor	88	" No , Marianne , in no possible way . "
68165	68227	68407	68407	Elinor	88	" And yet this woman — who knows what her art may have been?—how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her!—Who is she?—Who can she be?—Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance?—Oh ! no one , no one — he talked to me only of myself . "
68242	68266	68407	68407	Elinor	88	" Elinor , I must go home . I must go and comfort mama . Can not we be gone to - morrow ? "
68267	68274	68407	68407	Elinor	88	" To - morrow , Marianne ! "
68275	68303	68407	68407	Elinor	88	" Yes , why should I stay here ? I came only for Willoughby 's sake — and now who cares for me ? Who regards me ? "
68304	68339	68407	68407	Elinor	88	" It would be impossible to go to - morrow . We owe Mrs. Jennings much more than civility ; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that . "
68340	68406	68407	68407	Elinor	88	" Well then , another day or two , perhaps ; but I can not stay here long , I can not stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people . The Middletons and Palmers — how am I to bear their pity ? The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton ! Oh , what would HE say to that ! "
68554	68560	68561	68561	she	103	" How do you do my dear?"—said
68581	68855	68561	68561	she	103	" How is she , Miss Dashwood?—Poor thing ! she looks very bad . — No wonder . Ay , it is but too true . He is to be married very soon — a good - for - nothing fellow ! I have no patience with him . Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago , and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself , else I am sure I should not have believed it ; and I was almost ready to sink as it was . Well , said I , all I can say is , that if this be true , he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill , and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out . And so I shall always say , my dear , you may depend on it . I have no notion of men 's going on in this way ; and if ever I meet him again , I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day . But there is one comfort , my dear Miss Marianne ; he is not the only young man in the world worth having ; and with your pretty face you will never want admirers . Well , poor thing ! I wo n't disturb her any longer , for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with . The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know , and that will amuse her . "
68907	68931	68932	68932	Elinor	88	" no , she would go down ; she could bear it very well , and the bustle about her would be less . "
69323	69327	69329	69330	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Poor soul ! "
69339	69455	69329	69330	Mrs. Jennings	103	" how it grieves me to see her ! And I declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine ! And the dried cherries too ! Lord ! nothing seems to do her any good . I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like , I would send all over the town for it . Well , it is the oddest thing to me , that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill ! But when there is plenty of money on one side , and next to none on the other , Lord bless you ! they care no more about such things ! — "
69456	69473	69312	69312	she	89	" The lady then — Miss Grey I think you called her — is very rich ? "
69474	69699	69329	69330	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Fifty thousand pounds , my dear . Did you ever see her ? a smart , stylish girl they say , but not handsome . I remember her aunt very well , Biddy Henshawe ; she married a very wealthy man . But the family are all rich together . Fifty thousand pounds ! and by all accounts , it wo n't come before it 's wanted ; for they say he is all to pieces . No wonder ! dashing about with his curricle and hunters ! Well , it do n't signify talking ; but when a young man , be who he will , comes and makes love to a pretty girl , and promises marriage , he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor , and a richer girl is ready to have him . Why do n't he , in such a case , sell his horses , let his house , turn off his servants , and make a thorough reform at once ? I warrant you , Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round . But that wo n't do now - a - days ; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age . "
69700	69720	69312	69312	she	89	" Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is ? Is she said to be amiable ? "
69721	69782	69329	69330	Mrs. Jennings	103	" I never heard any harm of her ; indeed I hardly ever heard her mentioned ; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning , that one day Miss Walker hinted to her , that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married , for she and Mrs. Ellison could never agree . "
69784	69791	69312	69312	she	89	" And who are the Ellisons ? "
69792	69820	69312	69312	she	89	" Her guardians , my dear . But now she is of age and may choose for herself ; and a pretty choice she has made!—What now , "
69824	69909	69312	69312	she	89	moment—"your poor sister is gone to her own room , I suppose , to moan by herself . Is there nothing one can get to comfort her ? Poor dear , it seems quite cruel to let her be alone . Well , by - and - by we shall have a few friends , and that will amuse her a little . What shall we play at ? She hates whist I know ; but is there no round game she cares for ? "
69910	69956	69312	69312	she	89	" Dear ma'am , this kindness is quite unnecessary . Marianne , I dare say , will not leave her room again this evening . I shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed , for I am sure she wants rest . "
69957	70142	69312	69312	she	89	" Aye , I believe that will be best for her . Let her name her own supper , and go to bed . Lord ! no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two , for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that . And so the letter that came today finished it ! Poor soul ! I am sure if I had had a notion of it , I would not have joked her about it for all my money . But then you know , how should I guess such a thing ? I made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter , and you know young people like to be laughed at about them . Lord ! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they hear it ! If I had my senses about me I might have called in Conduit Street in my way home , and told them of it . But I shall see them tomorrow . "
70143	70238	69312	69312	she	89	" It would be unnecessary I am sure , for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby , or making the slightest allusion to what has passed , before my sister . Their own good - nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present ; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject , the more my feelings will be spared , as you my dear madam will easily believe . "
70239	70363	69312	69312	she	89	" Oh ! Lord ! yes , that I do indeed . It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of ; and as for your sister , I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world . You saw I did not all dinner time . No more would Sir John , nor my daughters , for they are all very thoughtful and considerate ; especially if I give them a hint , as I certainly will . For my part , I think the less that is said about such things , the better , the sooner ' tis blown over and forgot . And what does talking ever do you know ? "
70364	70433	69312	69312	she	89	" In this affair it can only do harm ; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind , for it has been attended by circumstances which , for the sake of every one concerned in it , make it unfit to become the public conversation . I must do THIS justice to Mr. Willoughby — he has broken no positive engagement with my sister . "
70434	70473	69312	69312	she	89	" Law , my dear ! Do n't pretend to defend him . No positive engagement indeed ! after taking her all over Allenham House , and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter ! "
70544	70933	70536	70536	her	103	" Well , my dear , ' tis a true saying about an ill - wind , for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon . He will have her at last ; aye , that he will . Mind me , now , if they an't married by Mid - summer . Lord ! how he 'll chuckle over this news ! I hope he will come tonight . It will be all to one a better match for your sister . Two thousand a year without debt or drawback — except the little love - child , indeed ; aye , I had forgot her ; but she may be ' prenticed out at a small cost , and then what does it signify ? Delaford is a nice place , I can tell you ; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place , full of comforts and conveniences ; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit - trees in the country ; and such a mulberry tree in one corner ! Lord ! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there ! Then , there is a dove - cote , some delightful stew - ponds , and a very pretty canal ; and every thing , in short , that one could wish for ; and , moreover , it is close to the church , and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike - road , so ' tis never dull , for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house , you may see all the carriages that pass along . Oh ! ' tis a nice place ! A butcher hard by in the village , and the parsonage - house within a stone 's throw . To my fancy , a thousand times prettier than Barton Park , where they are forced to send three miles for their meat , and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother . Well , I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can . One shoulder of mutton , you know , drives another down . If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head ! "
70934	70945	70947	70947	Elinor	88	" Ay , if we can do THAT , Ma'am , "
70949	70961	70947	70947	Elinor	88	" we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon . "
71013	71020	71026	71027	her sister	343	" You had better leave me , "
71032	71038	71040	71040	Elinor	88	" I will leave you , "
71042	71050	71040	71040	Elinor	88	" if you will go to bed . "
71149	71153	71155	71155	she	103	" My dear , "
71159	71238	71155	71155	she	103	" I have just recollected that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted , so I have brought a glass of it for your sister . My poor husband ! how fond he was of it ! Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout , he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world . Do take it to your sister . "
71239	71243	71245	71245	Elinor	88	" Dear Ma'am , "
71260	71313	71245	71245	Elinor	88	" how good you are ! But I have just left Marianne in bed , and , I hope , almost asleep ; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest , if you will give me leave , I will drink the wine myself . "
71472	71496	71455	71455	she	103	" The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see . He knows nothing of it ; do tell him , my dear . "
71527	71533	71535	71535	she	103	" Marianne is not well , "
71537	71555	71535	71535	she	103	" She has been indisposed all day , and we have persuaded her to go to bed . "
71556	71561	71562	71562	he	104	" Perhaps , then , "
71566	71590	71562	71562	he	104	" what I heard this morning may be — there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at first . "
71591	71597	71535	71535	she	103	" What did you hear ? "
71598	71647	71562	71562	he	104	" That a gentleman , whom I had reason to think — in short , that a man , whom I KNEW to be engaged — but how shall I tell you ? If you know it already , as surely you must , I may be spared . "
71648	71652	71654	71654	Elinor	88	" You mean , "
71660	71709	71654	71654	Elinor	88	" Mr. Willoughby 's marriage with Miss Grey . Yes , we DO know it all . This seems to have been a day of general elucidation , for this very morning first unfolded it to us . Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable ! Where did you hear it ? "
71710	71925	71562	71562	he	104	" In a stationer 's shop in Pall Mall , where I had business . Two ladies were waiting for their carriage , and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match , in a voice so little attempting concealment , that it was impossible for me not to hear all . The name of Willoughby , John Willoughby , frequently repeated , first caught my attention ; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey — it was no longer to be a secret — it would take place even within a few weeks , with many particulars of preparations and other matters . One thing , especially , I remember , because it served to identify the man still more:—as soon as the ceremony was over , they were to go to Combe Magna , his seat in Somersetshire . My astonishment!—but it would be impossible to describe what I felt . The communicative lady I learnt , on inquiry , for I stayed in the shop till they were gone , was a Mrs. Ellison , and that , as I have been since informed , is the name of Miss Grey 's guardian . "
71926	71957	71654	71654	Elinor	88	" It is . But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds ? In that , if in any thing , we may find an explanation . "
71958	71972	71562	71562	he	104	" It may be so ; but Willoughby is capable — at least I think"—he
71988	71997	71562	71562	he	104	" And your sister — how did she — "
71998	72082	71654	71654	Elinor	88	" Her sufferings have been very severe . I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short . It has been , it is a most cruel affliction . Till yesterday , I believe , she never doubted his regard ; and even now , perhaps — but I am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her . He has been very deceitful ! and , in some points , there seems a hardness of heart about him . "
72083	72086	72088	72089	Colonel Brandon	104	" Ah ! "
72091	72118	72088	72089	Colonel Brandon	104	" there is , indeed ! But your sister does not — I think you said so — she does not consider quite as you do ? "
72119	72139	72140	72140	He	104	" You know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could . "
72459	72471	72472	72472	she	89	" No , no , no , it can not be , "
72475	72513	72472	72472	she	89	" she can not feel . Her kindness is not sympathy ; her good - nature is not tenderness . All that she wants is gossip , and she only likes me now because I supply it . "
72728	72747	72721	72721	she	103	" Now , my dear , I bring you something that I am sure will do you good . "
73333	73339	73341	73341	Elinor	88	" Who can this be ? "
73343	73355	73341	73341	Elinor	88	" So early too ! I thought we HAD been safe . "
73362	73368	73370	73370	she	89	" It is Colonel Brandon ! "
73375	73383	73370	73370	she	89	" We are never safe from HIM . "
73384	73398	73356	73356	Marianne	89	" He will not come in , as Mrs. Jennings is from home . "
73399	73407	73370	73370	she	89	" I will not trust to THAT , "
73414	73437	73370	73370	she	89	" A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others . "
73508	73517	73519	73519	he	104	" I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street , "
73526	73689	73690	73690	He	1620	" and she encouraged me to come on ; and I was the more easily encouraged , because I thought it probable that I might find you alone , which I was very desirous of doing . My object — my wish — my sole wish in desiring it — I hope , I believe it is — is to be a means of giving comfort;—no , I must not say comfort — not present comfort — but conviction , lasting conviction to your sister 's mind . My regard for her , for yourself , for your mother — will you allow me to prove it , by relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincere regard — nothing but an earnest desire of being useful — I think I am justified — though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right , is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong ? "
73693	73698	73700	73700	Elinor	88	" I understand you , "
73702	73768	73700	73700	Elinor	88	" You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby , that will open his character farther . Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne . MY gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end , and HERS must be gained by it in time . Pray , pray let me hear it . "
73769	73843	73955	73955	He	1621	" You shall ; and , to be brief , when I quitted Barton last October,—but this will give you no idea — I must go farther back . You will find me a very awkward narrator , Miss Dashwood ; I hardly know where to begin . A short account of myself , I believe , will be necessary , and it SHALL be a short one . On such a subject , "
73847	73857	73955	73955	He	1621	" can I have little temptation to be diffuse . "
73875	73939	73700	73700	Elinor	88	" You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation — ( it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you)—a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park — it was the evening of a dance — in which I alluded to a lady I had once known , as resembling , in some measure , your sister Marianne . "
73940	73943	73945	73945	Elinor	88	" Indeed , "
73947	73954	73955	73955	He	1621	" I have NOT forgotten it . "
73965	74580	74581	74581	he	1622	" If I am not deceived by the uncertainty , the partiality of tender recollection , there is a very strong resemblance between them , as well in mind as person . The same warmth of heart , the same eagerness of fancy and spirits . This lady was one of my nearest relations , an orphan from her infancy , and under the guardianship of my father . Our ages were nearly the same , and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends . I can not remember the time when I did not love Eliza ; and my affection for her , as we grew up , was such , as perhaps , judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity , you might think me incapable of having ever felt . Her 's , for me , was , I believe , fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was , though from a different cause , no less unfortunate . At seventeen she was lost to me for ever . She was married — married against her inclination to my brother . Her fortune was large , and our family estate much encumbered . And this , I fear , is all that can be said for the conduct of one , who was at once her uncle and guardian . My brother did not deserve her ; he did not even love her . I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty , and for some time it did ; but at last the misery of her situation , for she experienced great unkindness , overcame all her resolution , and though she had promised me that nothing — but how blindly I relate ! I have never told you how this was brought on . We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland . The treachery , or the folly , of my cousin 's maid betrayed us . I was banished to the house of a relation far distant , and she was allowed no liberty , no society , no amusement , till my father 's point was gained . I had depended on her fortitude too far , and the blow was a severe one — but had her marriage been happy , so young as I then was , a few months must have reconciled me to it , or at least I should not have now to lament it . This however was not the case . My brother had no regard for her ; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been , and from the first he treated her unkindly . The consequence of this , upon a mind so young , so lively , so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon 's , was but too natural . She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation ; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned . But can we wonder that , with such a husband to provoke inconstancy , and without a friend to advise or restrain her ( for my father lived only a few months after their marriage , and I was with my regiment in the East Indies ) she should fall ? Had I remained in England , perhaps — but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years , and for that purpose had procured my exchange . The shock which her marriage had given me , "
74591	74631	74581	74581	he	1622	" was of trifling weight — was nothing to what I felt when I heard , about two years afterwards , of her divorce . It was THAT which threw this gloom,—even now the recollection of what I suffered — "
74706	75089	75098	75098	Elinor	88	" It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned to England . My first care , when I DID arrive , was of course to seek for her ; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy . I could not trace her beyond her first seducer , and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin . Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune , nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance , and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person . He imagined , and calmly could he imagine it , that her extravagance , and consequent distress , had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief . At last , however , and after I had been six months in England , I DID find her . Regard for a former servant of my own , who had since fallen into misfortune , carried me to visit him in a spunging - house , where he was confined for debt ; and there , the same house , under a similar confinement , was my unfortunate sister . So altered — so faded — worn down by acute suffering of every kind ! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me , to be the remains of the lovely , blooming , healthful girl , on whom I had once doted . What I endured in so beholding her — but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it — I have pained you too much already . That she was , to all appearance , in the last stage of a consumption , was — yes , in such a situation it was my greatest comfort . Life could do nothing for her , beyond giving time for a better preparation for death ; and that was given . I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings , and under proper attendants ; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life : I was with her in her last moments . "
75117	75129	75131	75131	he	1624	" Your sister , I hope , can not be offended , "
75133	75722	75131	75131	he	1624	" by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation . Their fates , their fortunes , can not be the same ; and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind , or a happier marriage , she might have been all that you will live to see the other be . But to what does all this lead ? I seem to have been distressing you for nothing . Ah ! Miss Dashwood — a subject such as this — untouched for fourteen years — it is dangerous to handle it at all ! I WILL be more collected — more concise . She left to my care her only child , a little girl , the offspring of her first guilty connection , who was then about three years old . She loved the child , and had always kept it with her . It was a valued , a precious trust to me ; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense , by watching over her education myself , had the nature of our situations allowed it ; but I had no family , no home ; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school . I saw her there whenever I could , and after the death of my brother , ( which happened about five years ago , and which left to me the possession of the family property , ) she visited me at Delaford . I called her a distant relation ; but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her . It is now three years ago ( she had just reached her fourteenth year , ) that I removed her from school , to place her under the care of a very respectable woman , residing in Dorsetshire , who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life ; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation . But last February , almost a twelvemonth back , she suddenly disappeared . I had allowed her , ( imprudently , as it has since turned out , ) at her earnest desire , to go to Bath with one of her young friends , who was attending her father there for his health . I knew him to be a very good sort of man , and I thought well of his daughter — better than she deserved , for , with a most obstinate and ill - judged secrecy , she would tell nothing , would give no clue , though she certainly knew all . He , her father , a well - meaning , but not a quick - sighted man , could really , I believe , give no information ; for he had been generally confined to the house , while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose ; and he tried to convince me , as thoroughly as he was convinced himself , of his daughter 's being entirely unconcerned in the business . In short , I could learn nothing but that she was gone ; all the rest , for eight long months , was left to conjecture . What I thought , what I feared , may be imagined ; and what I suffered too . "
75723	75727	75729	75729	Elinor	88	" Good heavens ! "
75731	75739	75729	75729	Elinor	88	" could it be — could Willoughby ! "
75741	75751	75752	75752	he	1626	" The first news that reached me of her , "
75755	75969	75752	75752	he	1626	" came in a letter from herself , last October . It was forwarded to me from Delaford , and I received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell ; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly , which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body , and which I believe gave offence to some . Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine , I suppose , when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party , that I was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable ; but HAD he known it , what would it have availed ? Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister ? No , he had already done that , which no man who CAN feel for another would do . He had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced , in a situation of the utmost distress , with no creditable home , no help , no friends , ignorant of his address ! He had left her , promising to return ; he neither returned , nor wrote , nor relieved her . "
75970	75977	75979	75979	Elinor	88	" This is beyond every thing ! "
75981	76394	76530	76530	Elinor	88	" His character is now before you ; expensive , dissipated , and worse than both . Knowing all this , as I have now known it many weeks , guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever , and on being assured that she was to marry him : guess what I must have felt for all your sakes . When I came to you last week and found you alone , I came determined to know the truth ; though irresolute what to do when it WAS known . My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then ; but now you will comprehend it . To suffer you all to be so deceived ; to see your sister — but what could I do ? I had no hope of interfering with success ; and sometimes I thought your sister 's influence might yet reclaim him . But now , after such dishonorable usage , who can tell what were his designs on her . Whatever they may have been , however , she may now , and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own condition , when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza , when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl , and pictures her to herself , with an affection for him so strong , still as strong as her own , and with a mind tormented by self - reproach , which must attend her through life . Surely this comparison must have its use with her . She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing . They proceed from no misconduct , and can bring no disgrace . On the contrary , every friend must be made still more her friend by them . Concern for her unhappiness , and respect for her fortitude under it , must strengthen every attachment . Use your own discretion , however , in communicating to her what I have told you . You must know best what will be its effect ; but had I not seriously , and from my heart believed it might be of service , might lessen her regrets , I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions , with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others . "
76426	76433	76435	76435	she	88	" I have been more pained , "
76437	76489	76490	76490	she	88	" by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do . Now , though at first she will suffer much , I am sure she will soon become easier . Have you , "
76498	76510	76490	76490	she	88	" ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton ? "
76511	76514	76515	76515	he	1627	" Yes , "
76519	76529	76515	76515	he	1627	" once I have . One meeting was unavoidable . "
76544	76553	76530	76530	Elinor	88	" What ? have you met him to — "
76554	76623	76530	76530	Elinor	88	" I could meet him no other way . Eliza had confessed to me , though most reluctantly , the name of her lover ; and when he returned to town , which was within a fortnight after myself , we met by appointment , he to defend , I to punish his conduct . We returned unwounded , and the meeting , therefore , never got abroad . "
76647	76650	76652	76653	Colonel Brandon	104	" Such , "
76659	76682	76652	76653	Colonel Brandon	104	" has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter ! and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust ! "
76683	76690	76735	76735	he	104	" Is she still in town ? "
76691	76728	76735	76735	he	104	" No ; as soon as she recovered from her lying - in , for I found her near her delivery , I removed her and her child into the country , and there she remains . "
77817	77952	77807	77808	Sir John	99	" A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well ! Such a good - natured fellow ! He did not believe there was a bolder rider in England ! It was an unaccountable business . He wished him at the devil with all his heart . He would not speak another word to him , meet him where he might , for all the world ! No , not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert , and they were kept watching for two hours together . Such a scoundrel of a fellow ! such a deceitful dog ! It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of Folly 's puppies ! and this was the end of it ! "
77964	78055	77953	77954	Mrs. Palmer	128	" She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately , and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all . She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland ; but it did not signify , for it was a great deal too far off to visit ; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again , and she should tell everybody she saw , how good - for - nothing he was . "
78278	78286	78255	78255	her	100	" It is very shocking , indeed ! "
78968	78984	78986	78986	she	88	" I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here STILL , "
78997	79106	78986	78986	she	88	" But I always thought I SHOULD . I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile ; though you TOLD me , you know , at Barton , that you should not stay above a MONTH . But I thought , at the time , that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point . It would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came . And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone . I am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD . "
79131	79137	79139	79140	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Well , my dear , "
79142	79149	79139	79140	Mrs. Jennings	103	" and how did you travel ? "
79150	79160	79162	79163	Miss Steele	137	" Not in the stage , I assure you , "
79169	79225	79162	79163	Miss Steele	137	" we came post all the way , and had a very smart beau to attend us . Dr. Davies was coming to town , and so we thought we 'd join him in a post - chaise ; and he behaved very genteelly , and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did . "
79226	79231	79233	79234	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Oh , oh ! "
79236	79254	79233	79234	Mrs. Jennings	103	" very pretty , indeed ! and the Doctor is a single man , I warrant you . "
79255	79259	79261	79262	Miss Steele	137	" There now , "
79267	79367	79261	79262	Miss Steele	137	" everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor , and I can not think why . My cousins say they are sure I have made a conquest ; but for my part I declare I never think about him from one hour 's end to another . ' Lord ! here comes your beau , Nancy , ' my cousin said t'other day , when she saw him crossing the street to the house . My beau , indeed ! said I — I can not think who you mean . The Doctor is no beau of mine . "
79368	79394	79402	79403	her cousin	1690	" Aye , aye , that is very pretty talking — but it wo n't do — the Doctor is the man , I see . "
79395	79400	79261	79262	Miss Steele	137	" No , indeed ! "
79409	79426	79261	79262	Miss Steele	137	" and I beg you will contradict it , if you ever hear it talked of . "
79449	79472	79474	79474	Lucy	137	" I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister , Miss Dashwood , when they come to town , "
79489	79499	79427	79428	Mrs. Jennings	103	" No , I do not think we shall . "
79500	79511	79552	79553	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Oh , yes , I dare say you will . "
79521	79542	79427	79428	Mrs. Jennings	103	" What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together ! "
79543	79550	79552	79553	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Long a time , indeed ! "
79555	79565	79552	79553	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Why , their visit is but just begun ! "
79570	79584	79586	79587	Miss Steele	137	" I am sorry we can not see your sister , Miss Dashwood , "
79589	79598	79586	79587	Miss Steele	137	" I am sorry she is not well — "
79609	79652	79600	79600	Marianne	89	" You are very good . My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you ; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head - aches , which make her unfit for company or conversation . "
79653	79689	79586	79587	Miss Steele	137	" Oh , dear , that is a great pity ! but such old friends as Lucy and me!—I think she might see US ; and I am sure we would not speak a word . "
79725	79733	79735	79736	Miss Steele	137	" Oh , if that 's all , "
79738	79749	79735	79736	Miss Steele	137	" we can just as well go and see HER . "
80464	80475	80477	80477	he	85	" I wished very much to call upon you yesterday , "
80479	80643	80477	80477	he	85	" but it was impossible , for we were obliged to take Harold to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange ; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars . Harold was vastly pleased . THIS morning I had fully intended to call on you , if I could possibly find a spare half hour , but one has always so much to do on first coming to town . I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal . But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street , and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings . I understand she is a woman of very good fortune . And the Middletons too , you must introduce me to THEM . As my mother - in - law 's relations , I shall be happy to show them every respect . They are excellent neighbours to you in the country , I understand . "
80644	80667	80819	80820	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Excellent indeed . Their attention to our comfort , their friendliness in every particular , is more than I can express . "
80668	80791	80477	80477	he	85	" I am extremely glad to hear it , upon my word ; extremely glad indeed . But so it ought to be ; they are people of large fortune , they are related to you , and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected . And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing ! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place : the most complete thing of its kind , he said , that ever was , and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing . It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it , I assure you . "
80903	80925	80882	80882	He	346	" but she was so much engaged with her mother , that really she had no leisure for going any where . "
81086	81099	81205	81205	himself	1727	" Who is Colonel Brandon ? Is he a man of fortune ? "
81100	81111	81040	81040	he	346	" Yes ; he has very good property in Dorsetshire . "
81112	81147	81205	81205	himself	1727	" I am glad of it . He seems a most gentlemanlike man ; and I think , Elinor , I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life . "
81148	81158	81040	81040	he	346	" Me , brother ! what do you mean ? "
81159	81183	81205	81205	himself	1727	" He likes you . I observed him narrowly , and am convinced of it . What is the amount of his fortune ? "
81184	81193	81040	81040	he	346	" I believe about two thousand a year . "
81194	81201	81214	81214	he	1727	" Two thousand a - year ; "
81217	81236	81214	81214	he	1727	" Elinor , I wish with all my heart it were TWICE as much , for your sake . "
81237	81243	81245	81245	Elinor	88	" Indeed I believe you , "
81247	81265	81245	81245	Elinor	88	" but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME . "
81266	81451	81452	81452	his	1728	" You are mistaken , Elinor ; you are very much mistaken . A very little trouble on your side secures him . Perhaps just at present he may be undecided ; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back ; his friends may all advise him against it . But some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him , in spite of himself . And there can be no reason why you should not try for him . It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side — in short , you know as to an attachment of that kind , it is quite out of the question , the objections are insurmountable — you have too much sense not to see all that . Colonel Brandon must be the man ; and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family . It is a match that must give universal satisfaction . In short , it is a kind of thing that"—lowering
81457	81465	81471	81471	he	1728	whisper—"will be exceedingly welcome to ALL PARTIES . "
81474	81545	81471	81471	he	1728	" That is , I mean to say — your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled ; Fanny particularly , for she has your interest very much at heart , I assure you . And her mother too , Mrs. Ferrars , a very good - natured woman , I am sure it would give her great pleasure ; she said as much the other day . "
81553	81562	81563	81563	he	1728	" It would be something remarkable , now , "
81566	81594	81563	81563	he	1728	" something droll , if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the same time . And yet it is not very unlikely . "
81595	81601	81603	81603	Elinor	88	" Is Mr. Edward Ferrars , "
81608	81614	81603	81603	Elinor	88	" going to be married ? "
81615	81806	81807	81807	He	1729	" It is not actually settled , but there is such a thing in agitation . He has a most excellent mother . Mrs. Ferrars , with the utmost liberality , will come forward , and settle on him a thousand a year , if the match takes place . The lady is the Hon . Miss Morton , only daughter of the late Lord Morton , with thirty thousand pounds . A very desirable connection on both sides , and I have not a doubt of its taking place in time . A thousand a - year is a great deal for a mother to give away , to make over for ever ; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit . To give you another instance of her liberality:—The other day , as soon as we came to town , aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now , she put bank - notes into Fanny 's hands to the amount of two hundred pounds . And extremely acceptable it is , for we must live at a great expense while we are here . "
81822	81843	81816	81816	she	1730	" Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable ; but your income is a large one . "
81844	81995	81807	81807	He	1729	" Not so large , I dare say , as many people suppose . I do not mean to complain , however ; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one , and I hope will in time be better . The enclosure of Norland Common , now carrying on , is a most serious drain . And then I have made a little purchase within this half year ; East Kingham Farm , you must remember the place , where old Gibson used to live . The land was so very desirable for me in every respect , so immediately adjoining my own property , that I felt it my duty to buy it . I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands . A man must pay for his convenience ; and it HAS cost me a vast deal of money . "
81996	82007	81816	81816	she	1730	" More than you think it really and intrinsically worth . "
82008	82088	81807	81807	He	1729	" Why , I hope not that . I might have sold it again , the next day , for more than I gave : but , with regard to the purchase - money , I might have been very unfortunate indeed ; for the stocks were at that time so low , that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker 's hands , I must have sold out to very great loss . "
82094	82226	81816	81816	she	1730	" Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to Norland . Our respected father , as you well know , bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at Norland ( and very valuable they were ) to your mother . Far be it from me to repine at his doing so ; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose , but , in consequence of it , we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen , china , & c. to supply the place of what was taken away . You may guess , after all these expenses , how very far we must be from being rich , and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars 's kindness is . "
82227	82230	82232	82232	Elinor	88	" Certainly , "
82234	82253	82232	82232	Elinor	88	" and assisted by her liberality , I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances . "
82254	82265	82266	82266	he	1731	" Another year or two may do much towards it , "
82270	82309	82266	82266	he	1731	" but however there is still a great deal to be done . There is not a stone laid of Fanny 's green - house , and nothing but the plan of the flower - garden marked out . "
82310	82320	82232	82232	Elinor	88	" Where is the green - house to be ? "
82321	82390	82266	82266	he	1731	" Upon the knoll behind the house . The old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it . It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park , and the flower - garden will slope down just before it , and be exceedingly pretty . We have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow . "
82475	82573	82461	82461	he	1731	" She seems a most valuable woman indeed — Her house , her style of living , all bespeak an exceeding good income ; and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto , but in the end may prove materially advantageous.—Her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour ; and indeed , it speaks altogether so great a regard for you , that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten . — She must have a great deal to leave . "
82574	82598	82461	82461	he	1731	" Nothing at all , I should rather suppose ; for she has only her jointure , which will descend to her children . "
82599	82637	82461	82461	he	1731	" But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income . Few people of common prudence will do THAT ; and whatever she saves , she will be able to dispose of . "
82638	82660	82461	82461	he	1731	" And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters , than to us ? "
82661	82754	82461	82461	he	1731	" Her daughters are both exceedingly well married , and therefore I can not perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther . Whereas , in my opinion , by her taking so much notice of you , and treating you in this kind of way , she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration , which a conscientious woman would not disregard . Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour ; and she can hardly do all this , without being aware of the expectation it raises . "
82755	82781	82461	82461	he	1731	" But she raises none in those most concerned . Indeed , brother , your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far . "
82782	82789	82791	82791	he	1735	" Why , to be sure , "
82798	82844	82791	82791	he	1735	" people have little , have very little in their power . But , my dear Elinor , what is the matter with Marianne ? — she looks very unwell , has lost her colour , and is grown quite thin . Is she ill ? "
82845	82863	82461	82461	he	1731	" She is not well , she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks . "
82864	83061	82791	82791	he	1735	" I am sorry for that . At her time of life , any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever ! Her 's has been a very short one ! She was as handsome a girl last September , as I ever saw ; and as likely to attract the man . There was something in her style of beauty , to please them particularly . I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU , but so it happened to strike her . She will be mistaken , however . I question whether Marianne NOW , will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a - year , at the utmost , and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better . Dorsetshire ! I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors . "
83258	83270	83272	83272	he	85	" I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny , "
83282	83422	83272	83272	he	85	" Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman ! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know . And Mrs. Jennings too , an exceedingly well - behaved woman , though not so elegant as her daughter . Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with . But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both . "
84487	84495	84497	84497	Lucy	137	" Pity me , dear Miss Dashwood ! "
84526	84567	84569	84569	Elinor	88	time—"There is nobody here but you , that can feel for me.—I declare I can hardly stand . Good gracious!—In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness depends on — that is to be my mother ! "
85582	85591	85593	85593	he	85	" These are done by my eldest sister , "
85595	85644	85593	85593	he	85	" and you , as a man of taste , will , I dare say , be pleased with them . I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before , but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well . "
85748	85749	85750	85752	Mrs. Ferrars—"very pretty,"—and	185	" Hum"—said
85751	85752	85750	85752	Mrs. Ferrars—"very pretty,"—and	185	Ferrars—"very pretty,"—and
85788	85799	85784	85784	she	87	" They are very pretty , ma'am — an't they ? "
85826	85854	85822	85822	she	87	" Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton 's style of painting , Ma'am?—She DOES paint most delightfully!—How beautifully her last landscape is done ! "
85855	85866	85822	85822	she	87	" Beautifully indeed ! But SHE does every thing well . "
85916	85950	85895	85895	she	87	" This is admiration of a very particular kind ! — what is Miss Morton to us?—who knows , or who cares , for her?—it is Elinor of whom WE think and speak . "
86003	86012	85989	85989	herself	98	" Miss Morton is Lord Morton 's daughter . "
86187	86206	86150	86150	she	87	" Dear , dear Elinor , do n't mind them . Do n't let them make YOU unhappy . "
86265	86271	86259	86259	Jennings	103	" Ah ! poor dear , "
86364	86368	86370	86371	her brother	346	" Poor Marianne ! "
86391	86467	86373	86374	Colonel Brandon	104	" She has not such good health as her sister,—she is very nervous,—she has not Elinor 's constitution;—and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions . You would not think it perhaps , but Marianne WAS remarkably handsome a few months ago ; quite as handsome as Elinor . — Now you see it is all gone . "
86785	86790	86792	86792	Lucy	137	" My dear friend , "
86802	86898	86792	86792	Lucy	137	" I come to talk to you of my happiness . Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars 's way of treating me yesterday ? So exceeding affable as she was!—You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her ; — but the very moment I was introduced , there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say , she had quite took a fancy to me . Now was not it so ? — You saw it all ; and was not you quite struck with it ? "
86899	86908	86964	86964	Lucy	137	" She was certainly very civil to you . "
86909	86954	86792	86792	Lucy	137	" Civil!—Did you see nothing but only civility ? — I saw a vast deal more . Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!—No pride , no hauteur , and your sister just the same — all sweetness and affability ! "
86987	86997	86999	86999	she	88	" Undoubtedly , if they had known your engagement , "
87001	87018	86999	86999	she	88	" nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you;—but as that was not the case "
87020	87026	87027	87027	Lucy	137	" I guessed you would say so"—replied
87028	87126	86999	86999	she	88	quickly—"but there was no reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me , if she did not , and her liking me is every thing . You sha n't talk me out of my satisfaction . I am sure it will all end well , and there will be no difficulties at all , to what I used to think . Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman , and so is your sister . They are both delightful women , indeed!—I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs. Dashwood was ! "
87142	87160	87027	87027	Lucy	137	" Are you ill , Miss Dashwood?—you seem low — you do n't speak;—sure you an't well . "
87161	87169	87027	87027	Lucy	137	" I never was in better health . "
87170	87221	87027	87027	Lucy	137	" I am glad of it with all my heart ; but really you did not look it . I should be sorry to have YOU ill ; you , that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world!—Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship . "
87249	87393	87245	87245	she	137	" Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to Edward 's love , it is the greatest comfort I have.—Poor Edward!—But now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for Lady Middleton 's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street , I dare say , and Edward spends half his time with his sister — besides , Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now ; — and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me . — They are such charming women!—I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of her , you can not speak too high . "
87414	87523	87411	87411	Lucy	137	" I am sure I should have seen it in a moment , if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me . If she had only made me a formal courtesy , for instance , without saying a word , and never after had took any notice of me , and never looked at me in a pleasant way — you know what I mean — if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way , I should have gave it all up in despair . I could not have stood it . For where she DOES dislike , I know it is most violent . "
88141	88145	88146	88146	she	137	" Dear Edward ! "
88149	88165	88146	88146	she	137	" this is a moment of great happiness!—This would almost make amends for every thing ? "
88271	88280	88281	88281	she	137	" Oh , do n't think of me ! "
88298	88321	88281	88281	she	137	" do n't think of MY health . Elinor is well , you see . That must be enough for us both . "
88355	88361	88363	88363	Edward	93	" Do you like London ? "
88376	88420	88421	88421	She	89	" Not at all . I expected much pleasure in it , but I have found none . The sight of you , Edward , is the only comfort it has afforded ; and thank Heaven ! you are what you always were ! "
88428	88434	88435	88435	she	89	" I think , Elinor , "
88439	88485	88435	88435	she	89	" we must employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton . In a week or two , I suppose , we shall be going ; and , I trust , Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge . "
88534	88572	88579	88579	she	89	" We spent such a day , Edward , in Harley Street yesterday ! So dull , so wretchedly dull!—But I have much to say to you on that head , which can not be said now . "
88611	88625	88579	88579	she	89	" But why were you not there , Edward?—Why did you not come ? "
88626	88632	88584	88584	her	89	" I was engaged elsewhere . "
88633	88649	88579	88579	she	89	" Engaged ! But what was that , when such friends were to be met ? "
88650	88656	88658	88658	Lucy	137	" Perhaps , Miss Marianne , "
88668	88693	88658	88658	Lucy	137	" you think young men never stand upon engagements , if they have no mind to keep them , little as well as great . "
88713	88848	88709	88709	she	89	" Not so , indeed ; for , seriously speaking , I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street . And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world ; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement , however minute , and however it may make against his interest or pleasure . He is the most fearful of giving pain , of wounding expectation , and the most incapable of being selfish , of any body I ever saw . Edward , it is so , and I will say it . What ! are you never to hear yourself praised!—Then you must be no friend of mine ; for those who will accept of my love and esteem , must submit to my open commendation . "
88897	88902	88904	88904	Marianne	89	" Going so soon ! "
88906	88916	88904	88904	Marianne	89	" my dear Edward , this must not be . "
88968	88977	88979	88979	Marianne	89	" What can bring her here so often ? "
88986	89000	88979	88979	Marianne	89	" Could not she see that we wanted her gone!—how teazing to Edward ! "
89001	89037	89038	89038	Marianne	89	" Why so?—we were all his friends , and Lucy has been the longest known to him of any . It is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves . "
89047	89119	89038	89038	Marianne	89	" You know , Elinor , that this is a kind of talking which I can not bear . If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted , as I must suppose to be the case , you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it . I can not descend to be tricked out of assurances , that are not really wanted . "
90668	90689	90659	90659	she	89	" her word she looked vastly smart , and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests . "
91220	91225	91226	91226	he	143	" Upon my soul , "
91229	91371	91226	91226	he	143	" I believe it is nothing more ; and so I often tell my mother , when she is grieving about it . ' My dear Madam , ' I always say to her , ' you must make yourself easy . The evil is now irremediable , and it has been entirely your own doing . Why would you be persuaded by my uncle , Sir Robert , against your own judgment , to place Edward under private tuition , at the most critical time of his life ? If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself , instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt 's , all this would have been prevented . ' This is the way in which I always consider the matter , and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error . "
91413	91420	91421	91421	his	1949	" You reside in Devonshire , I think,"—was
91425	91432	91421	91421	his	1949	" in a cottage near Dawlish . "
91473	91479	91481	91481	he	1949	" For my own part , "
91483	91655	91481	91481	he	1949	" I am excessively fond of a cottage ; there is always so much comfort , so much elegance about them . And I protest , if I had any money to spare , I should buy a little land and build one myself , within a short distance of London , where I might drive myself down at any time , and collect a few friends about me , and be happy . I advise every body who is going to build , to build a cottage . My friend Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice , and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi 's . I was to decide on the best of them . ' My dear Courtland , ' said I , immediately throwing them all into the fire , ' do not adopt either of them , but by all means build a cottage . ' And that I fancy , will be the end of it .
91656	91893	91894	91894	Elinor	88	" Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations , no space in a cottage ; but this is all a mistake . I was last month at my friend Elliott 's , near Dartford . Lady Elliott wished to give a dance . ' But how can it be done ? ' said she ; ' my dear Ferrars , do tell me how it is to be managed . There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple , and where can the supper be ? ' I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it , so I said , ' My dear Lady Elliott , do not be uneasy . The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease ; card - tables may be placed in the drawing - room ; the library may be open for tea and other refreshments ; and let the supper be set out in the saloon . ' Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought . We measured the dining - room , and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple , and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan . So that , in fact , you see , if people do but know how to set about it , every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling . "
92049	92060	92062	92062	she	87	" I do not see how it can be done , "
92064	92129	92062	92062	she	87	" without affronting Lady Middleton , for they spend every day with her ; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it . You know I am always ready to pay them any attention in my power , as my taking them out this evening shews . But they are Lady Middleton 's visitors . How can I ask them away from her ? "
92147	92181	92130	92131	Her husband	324	" They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit Street , and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the same number of days to such near relations . "
92196	92326	92182	92182	Fanny	87	" My love I would ask them with all my heart , if it was in my power . But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us . They are very well behaved , good kind of girls ; and I think the attention is due to them , as their uncle did so very well by Edward . We can ask your sisters some other year , you know ; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more . I am sure you will like them ; indeed , you DO like them , you know , very much already , and so does my mother ; and they are such favourites with Harold ! "
92958	92972	92941	92941	her	88	" Lord ! my dear Miss Dashwood ! have you heard the news ? "
92973	92982	92908	92909	Mrs. Palmer	128	" No , ma'am . What is it ? "
92983	93271	92941	92941	her	88	" Something so strange ! But you shall hear it all . — When I got to Mr. Palmer 's , I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child . She was sure it was very ill — it cried , and fretted , and was all over pimples . So I looked at it directly , and , ' Lord ! my dear , ' says I , ' it is nothing in the world , but the red gum — ' and nurse said just the same . But Charlotte , she would not be satisfied , so Mr. Donavan was sent for ; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street , so he stepped over directly , and as soon as ever he saw the child , be said just as we did , that it was nothing in the world but the red gum , and then Charlotte was easy . And so , just as he was going away again , it came into my head , I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it , but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news . So upon that , he smirked , and simpered , and looked grave , and seemed to know something or other , and at last he said in a whisper , ' For fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sister 's indisposition , I think it advisable to say , that I believe there is no great reason for alarm ; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will do very well . ' "
93272	93279	92908	92909	Mrs. Palmer	128	" What ! is Fanny ill ? "
93280	94237	92941	92941	her	88	" That is exactly what I said , my dear . ' Lord ! ' says I , ' is Mrs. Dashwood ill ? ' So then it all came out ; and the long and the short of the matter , by all I can learn , seems to be this . Mr. Edward Ferrars , the very young man I used to joke with you about ( but however , as it turns out , I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it ) , Mr. Edward Ferrars , it seems , has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!—There 's for you , my dear!—And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter , except Nancy!—Could you have believed such a thing possible ? — There is no great wonder in their liking one another ; but that matters should be brought so forward between them , and nobody suspect it!—THAT is strange!—I never happened to see them together , or I am sure I should have found it out directly . Well , and so this was kept a great secret , for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter ; — till this very morning , poor Nancy , who , you know , is a well - meaning creature , but no conjurer , popt it all out . ' Lord ! ' thinks she to herself , ' they are all so fond of Lucy , to be sure they will make no difficulty about it ; ' and so , away she went to your sister , who was sitting all alone at her carpet - work , little suspecting what was to come — for she had just been saying to your brother , only five minutes before , that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord 's daughter or other , I forget who . So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride . She fell into violent hysterics immediately , with such screams as reached your brother 's ears , as he was sitting in his own dressing - room down stairs , thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country . So up he flew directly , and a terrible scene took place , for Lucy was come to them by that time , little dreaming what was going on . Poor soul ! I pity HER . And I must say , I think she was used very hardly ; for your sister scolded like any fury , and soon drove her into a fainting fit . Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do . Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house , and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too , to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes . THEN she fell into hysterics again , and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan , and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar . The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away , and they were just stepping in as he came off ; poor Lucy in such a condition , he says , she could hardly walk ; and Nancy , she was almost as bad . I declare , I have no patience with your sister ; and I hope , with all my heart , it will be a match in spite of her . Lord ! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of it ! To have his love used so scornfully ! for they say he is monstrous fond of her , as well he may . I should not wonder , if he was to be in the greatest passion!—and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same . He and I had a great deal of talk about it ; and the best of all is , that he is gone back again to Harley Street , that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it , for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house , for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too ; and so she may , for what I care . I have no pity for either of them . I have no notion of people 's making such a to - do about money and greatness . There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry ; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son , and though Lucy has next to nothing herself , she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing ; I dare say , if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a - year , she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight . Lord ! how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours — or a little bigger — with two maids , and two men ; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid , for my Beta has a sister out of place , that would fit them exactly . "
94992	95010	95063	95063	she	89	" How long has this been known to you , Elinor ? has he written to you ? "
95011	95039	95063	95063	she	89	" I have known it these four months . When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November , she told me in confidence of her engagement . "
95066	95076	95063	95063	she	89	" Four months!—Have you known of this four months ? "
95081	95104	95063	95063	she	89	" What!—while attending me in all my misery , has this been on your heart?—And I have reproached you for being happy ! "
95106	95123	95063	95063	she	89	" It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse ! "
95124	95126	95127	95127	Marianne	89	" Four months!"—cried
95128	95139	95063	95063	she	89	again.—"So calm ! — so cheerful!—how have you been supported ? "
95141	95208	95063	95063	she	89	" By feeling that I was doing my duty.—My promise to Lucy , obliged me to be secret . I owed it to her , therefore , to avoid giving any hint of the truth ; and I owed it to my family and friends , not to create in them a solicitude about me , which it could not be in my power to satisfy . "
95214	95227	95229	95229	Elinor	88	" I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother , "
95231	95255	95229	95229	Elinor	88	" and once or twice I have attempted it ; — but without betraying my trust , I never could have convinced you . "
95256	95264	95063	95063	she	89	" Four months!—and yet you loved him ! "
95266	95527	95229	95229	Elinor	88	" Yes . But I did not love only him;—and while the comfort of others was dear to me , I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt . Now , I can think and speak of it with little emotion . I would not have you suffer on my account ; for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself . I have many things to support me . I am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own , I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther . I acquit Edward of essential misconduct . I wish him very happy ; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty , that though now he may harbour some regret , in the end he must become so . Lucy does not want sense , and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.—And after all , Marianne , after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment , and all that can be said of one 's happiness depending entirely on any particular person , it is not meant — it is not fit — it is not possible that it should be so . — Edward will marry Lucy ; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex ; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to HER . "
95529	95538	95540	95540	Marianne	89	" If such is your way of thinking , "
95542	95588	95540	95540	Marianne	89	" if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else , your resolution , your self - command , are , perhaps , a little less to be wondered at.—They are brought more within my comprehension . "
95589	95959	95961	95961	Marianne	89	" I understand you.—You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.—For four months , Marianne , I have had all this hanging on my mind , without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature ; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you , yet unable to prepare you for it in the least . — It was told me,—it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself , whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects ; and told me , as I thought , with triumph . — This person 's suspicions , therefore , I have had to oppose , by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested;—and it has not been only once;—I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again . — I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever , without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.—Nothing has proved him unworthy ; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me . — I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister , and the insolence of his mother ; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment , without enjoying its advantages . — And all this has been going on at a time , when , as you know too well , it has not been my only unhappiness . — If you can think me capable of ever feeling — surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW . The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter , the consolation that I have been willing to admit , have been the effect of constant and painful exertion;—they did not spring up of themselves ; — they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first . — No , Marianne.—THEN , if I had not been bound to silence , perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely — not even what I owed to my dearest friends — from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy . "
95967	95972	95973	95973	she	89	" Oh ! Elinor , "
95976	96048	95973	95973	she	89	" you have made me hate myself for ever.—How barbarous have I been to you ! — you , who have been my only comfort , who have borne with me in all my misery , who have seemed to be only suffering for me!—Is this my gratitude?—Is this the only return I can make you?—Because your merit cries out upon myself , I have been trying to do it away . "
96201	96206	96209	96209	her	103	" Yes , ma'am . "—She
96296	96304	96306	96306	he	335	" You have heard , I suppose , "
96318	96332	96306	96306	he	335	" of the very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday . "
96348	96352	96353	96353	he	335	" Your sister , "
96356	96609	96353	96353	he	335	" has suffered dreadfully . Mrs. Ferrars too — in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress — but I will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome . Poor Fanny ! she was in hysterics all yesterday . But I would not alarm you too much . Donavan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended ; her constitution is a good one , and her resolution equal to any thing . She has borne it all , with the fortitude of an angel ! She says she never shall think well of anybody again ; and one can not wonder at it , after being so deceived ! — meeting with such ingratitude , where so much kindness had been shewn , so much confidence had been placed ! It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart , that she had asked these young women to her house ; merely because she thought they deserved some attention , were harmless , well - behaved girls , and would be pleasant companions ; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us , while your kind friend there , was attending her daughter . And now to be so rewarded ! ' I wish , with all my heart , ' says poor Fanny in her affectionate way , ' that we had asked your sisters instead of them . ' "
96625	96970	96621	96621	he	2000	" What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered , when first Fanny broke it to her , is not to be described . While she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him , was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!—such a suspicion could never have entered her head ! If she suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere , it could not be in THAT quarter . ' THERE , to be sure , ' said she , ' I might have thought myself safe . ' She was quite in an agony . We consulted together , however , as to what should be done , and at last she determined to send for Edward . He came . But I am sorry to relate what ensued . All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement , assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments , and Fanny 's entreaties , was of no avail . Duty , affection , every thing was disregarded . I never thought Edward so stubborn , so unfeeling before . His mother explained to him her liberal designs , in case of his marrying Miss Morton ; told him she would settle on him the Norfolk estate , which , clear of land - tax , brings in a good thousand a - year ; offered even , when matters grew desperate , to make it twelve hundred ; and in opposition to this , if he still persisted in this low connection , represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match . His own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all ; she would never see him again ; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance , that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support , she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it . "
96988	96997	96981	96981	her	89	" Gracious God ! can this be possible ! "
96998	97006	97008	97009	her brother	346	" Well may you wonder , Marianne , "
97011	97029	97008	97009	her brother	346	" at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these . Your exclamation is very natural . "
97045	97051	97052	97052	he	346	" All this , however , "
97055	97102	97052	97052	he	346	" was urged in vain . Edward said very little ; but what he did say , was in the most determined manner . Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement . He would stand to it , cost him what it might . "
97103	97106	97108	97109	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Then , "
97121	97198	97108	97109	Mrs. Jennings	103	" he has acted like an honest man ! I beg your pardon , Mr. Dashwood , but if he had done otherwise , I should have thought him a rascal . I have some little concern in the business , as well as yourself , for Lucy Steele is my cousin , and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world , nor one who more deserves a good husband . "
97238	97406	97230	97230	He	85	" I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours , madam . Miss Lucy Steele is , I dare say , a very deserving young woman , but in the present case you know , the connection must be impossible . And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle 's care , the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars , is perhaps , altogether a little extraordinary . In short , I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard for , Mrs. Jennings . We all wish her extremely happy ; and Mrs. Ferrars 's conduct throughout the whole , has been such as every conscientious , good mother , in like circumstances , would adopt . It has been dignified and liberal . Edward has drawn his own lot , and I fear it will be a bad one . "
97441	97446	97448	97449	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Well , sir , "
97451	97458	97448	97449	Mrs. Jennings	103	" and how did it end ? "
97459	97520	97410	97410	her	89	" I am sorry to say , ma'am , in a most unhappy rupture : — Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother 's notice . He left her house yesterday , but where he is gone , or whether he is still in town , I do not know ; for WE of course can make no inquiry . "
97521	97532	97448	97449	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Poor young man!—and what is to become of him ? "
97533	97657	97410	97410	her	89	" What , indeed , ma'am ! It is a melancholy consideration . Born to the prospect of such affluence ! I can not conceive a situation more deplorable . The interest of two thousand pounds — how can a man live on it?—and when to that is added the recollection , that he might , but for his own folly , within three months have been in the receipt of two thousand , five hundred a - year ( for Miss Morton has thirty thousand pounds , ) I can not picture to myself a more wretched condition . We must all feel for him ; and the more so , because it is totally out of our power to assist him . "
97658	97663	97665	97666	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Poor young man ! "
97668	97718	97665	97666	Mrs. Jennings	103	" I am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house ; and so I would tell him if I could see him . It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now , at lodgings and taverns . "
97742	97754	97756	97757	John Dashwood	85	" If he would only have done as well by himself , "
97759	97868	97756	97757	John Dashwood	85	" as all his friends were disposed to do by him , he might now have been in his proper situation , and would have wanted for nothing . But as it is , it must be out of anybody 's power to assist him . And there is one thing more preparing against him , which must be worse than all — his mother has determined , with a very natural kind of spirit , to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately , which might have been Edward 's , on proper conditions . I left her this morning with her lawyer , talking over the business . "
97869	97872	97874	97875	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Well ! "
97877	97912	97874	97875	Mrs. Jennings	103	" that is HER revenge . Everybody has a way of their own . But I do n't think mine would be , to make one son independent , because another had plagued me . "
97922	97935	97937	97937	John	85	" Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man , "
97939	97967	97937	97937	John	85	" than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own ? Poor Edward ! I feel for him sincerely . "
98705	98735	98698	98699	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Get it all out of her , my dear . She will tell you any thing if you ask . You see I can not leave Mrs. Clarke . "
98770	98779	98781	98782	Miss Steele	137	" I am so glad to meet you ; "
98789	98802	98806	98806	her	103	arm—"for I wanted to see you of all things in the world . "
98809	98824	98806	98806	her	103	" I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it . Is she angry ? "
98825	98836	98806	98806	her	103	" Not at all , I believe , with you . "
98837	98852	98806	98806	her	103	" That is a good thing . And Lady Middleton , is SHE angry ? "
98853	98864	98806	98806	her	103	" I can not suppose it possible that she should . "
98865	99050	99051	99051	She	2022	" I am monstrous glad of it . Good gracious ! I have had such a time of it ! I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life . She vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet , nor do any thing else for me again , so long as she lived ; but now she is quite come to , and we are as good friends as ever . Look , she made me this bow to my hat , and put in the feather last night . There now , YOU are going to laugh at me too . But why should not I wear pink ribbons ? I do not care if it IS the Doctor 's favourite colour . I am sure , for my part , I should never have known he DID like it better than any other colour , if he had not happened to say so . My cousins have been so plaguing me ! I declare sometimes I do not know which way to look before them . "
99082	99089	99051	99051	She	2022	" Well , but Miss Dashwood , "
99093	99164	99051	99051	She	2022	" people may say what they chuse about Mr. Ferrars 's declaring he would not have Lucy , for it is no such thing I can tell you ; and it is quite a shame for such ill - natured reports to be spread abroad . Whatever Lucy might think about it herself , you know , it was no business of other people to set it down for certain . "
99165	99182	99184	99184	Elinor	88	" I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before , I assure you , "
99186	99956	99051	99051	She	2022	" Oh , did not you ? But it WAS said , I know , very well , and by more than one ; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks , that nobody in their senses could expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton , with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune , for Lucy Steele that had nothing at all ; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself . And besides that , my cousin Richard said himself , that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off ; and when Edward did not come near us for three days , I could not tell what to think myself ; and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost ; for we came away from your brother 's Wednesday , and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday , Friday , and Saturday , and did not know what was become of him . Once Lucy thought to write to him , but then her spirits rose against that . However this morning he came just as we came home from church ; and then it all came out , how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street , and been talked to by his mother and all of them , and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy , and nobody but Lucy would he have . And how he had been so worried by what passed , that as soon as he had went away from his mother 's house , he had got upon his horse , and rid into the country , some where or other ; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday , on purpose to get the better of it . And after thinking it all over and over again , he said , it seemed to him as if , now he had no fortune , and no nothing at all , it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement , because it must be for her loss , for he had nothing but two thousand pounds , and no hope of any thing else ; and if he was to go into orders , as he had some thoughts , he could get nothing but a curacy , and how was they to live upon that?—He could not bear to think of her doing no better , and so he begged , if she had the least mind for it , to put an end to the matter directly , and leave him shift for himself . I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be . And it was entirely for HER sake , and upon HER account , that he said a word about being off , and not upon his own . I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her , or of wishing to marry Miss Morton , or any thing like it . But , to be sure , Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking ; so she told him directly ( with a great deal about sweet and love , you know , and all that — Oh , la ! one ca n't repeat such kind of things you know)—she told him directly , she had not the least mind in the world to be off , for she could live with him upon a trifle , and how little so ever he might have , she should be very glad to have it all , you know , or something of the kind . So then he was monstrous happy , and talked on some time about what they should do , and they agreed he should take orders directly , and they must wait to be married till he got a living . And just then I could not hear any more , for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach , and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens ; so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them , to ask Lucy if she would like to go , but she did not care to leave Edward ; so I just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons . "
99957	99969	99971	99971	Elinor	88	" I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them , "
99973	99987	99971	99971	Elinor	88	" you were all in the same room together , were not you ? "
99988	100056	99051	99051	She	2022	" No , indeed , not us . La ! Miss Dashwood , do you think people make love when any body else is by ? Oh , for shame!—To be sure you must know better than that . ( Laughing affectedly.)—No , no ; they were shut up in the drawing - room together , and all I heard was only by listening at the door . "
100057	100060	100062	100062	Elinor	88	" How ! "
100064	100126	100062	100062	Elinor	88	" have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door ? I am sorry I did not know it before ; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself . How could you behave so unfairly by your sister ? "
100127	100209	99051	99051	She	2022	" Oh , la ! there is nothing in THAT . I only stood at the door , and heard what I could . And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me ; for a year or two back , when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together , she never made any bones of hiding in a closet , or behind a chimney - board , on purpose to hear what we said . "
100239	100248	100250	100250	she	88	" Edward talks of going to Oxford soon , "
100252	100521	100250	100250	she	88	" but now he is lodging at No . — , Pall Mall . What an ill - natured woman his mother is , an't she ? And your brother and sister were not very kind ! However , I sha n't say anything against them to YOU ; and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot , which was more than I looked for . And for my part , I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before ; but , however , nothing was said about them , and I took care to keep mine out of sight . Edward have got some business at Oxford , he says ; so he must go there for a time ; and after THAT , as soon as he can light upon a Bishop , he will be ordained . I wonder what curacy he will get!—Good gracious ! ( giggling as she spoke ) I 'd lay my life I know what my cousins will say , when they hear of it . They will tell me I should write to the Doctor , to get Edward the curacy of his new living . I know they will ; but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the world . — ' La ! ' I shall say directly , ' I wonder how you could think of such a thing ? I write to the Doctor , indeed ! ' "
100522	100525	100527	100527	Elinor	88	" Well , "
100529	100548	100527	100527	Elinor	88	" it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst . You have got your answer ready . "
100572	100762	100549	100550	Miss Steele	137	" Oh , la ! here come the Richardsons . I had a vast deal more to say to you , but I must not stay away from them not any longer . I assure you they are very genteel people . He makes a monstrous deal of money , and they keep their own coach . I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about it myself , but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and Lady Middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and Mrs. Jennings should want company , I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes . I suppose Lady Middleton wo n't ask us any more this bout . Good - by ; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here . Remember me kindly to her . La ! if you have not got your spotted muslin on!—I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn . "
100997	101125	100990	100991	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Wait for his having a living!—ay , we all know how THAT will end:—they will wait a twelvemonth , and finding no good comes of it , will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a - year , with the interest of his two thousand pounds , and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can give her.—Then they will have a child every year ! and Lord help 'em ! how poor they will be!—I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house . Two maids and two men , indeed!—as I talked of t'other day.—No , no , they must get a stout girl of all works . — Beta 's sister would never do for them NOW . "
101148	101154	101612	101612	she	88	" Bartlett 's Building , March .
101155	101593	101612	101612	she	88	" I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing to her ; but I know your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear Edward , after all the troubles we have went through lately , therefore will make no more apologies , but proceed to say that , thank God ! though we have suffered dreadfully , we are both quite well now , and as happy as we must always be in one another 's love . We have had great trials , and great persecutions , but however , at the same time , gratefully acknowledge many friends , yourself not the least among them , whose great kindness I shall always thankfully remember , as will Edward too , who I have told of it . I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother 's anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow , am very sure you will not forget us , and dear Mrs. Jennings too , trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John , or Mr. Palmer , or any friend that may be able to assist us.—Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did , but she did it for the best , so I say nothing ; hope Mrs. Jennings wo n't think it too much trouble to give us a call , should she come this way any morning , ' twould be a great kindness , and my cousins would be proud to know her.—My paper reminds me to conclude ; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her , and to Sir John , and Lady Middleton , and the dear children , when you chance to see them , and love to Miss Marianne ,
101594	101600	101612	101612	she	88	" I am , & c. "
101644	101771	101612	101612	she	88	" Very well indeed!—how prettily she writes!—aye , that was quite proper to let him be off if he would . That was just like Lucy.—Poor soul ! I wish I COULD get him a living , with all my heart.—She calls me dear Mrs. Jennings , you see . She is a good - hearted girl as ever lived.—Very well upon my word . That sentence is very prettily turned . Yes , yes , I will go and see her , sure enough . How attentive she is , to think of every body!—Thank you , my dear , for shewing it me . It is as pretty a letter as ever I saw , and does Lucy 's head and heart great credit . "
102061	102062	102053	102053	her	89	" Cleveland!"—she
102069	102079	102053	102053	her	89	" No , I can not go to Cleveland . "
102081	102085	102087	102087	Elinor	88	" You forget , "
102090	102106	102087	102087	Elinor	88	" that its situation is not ... that it is not in the neighbourhood of ... "
102107	102139	102053	102053	her	89	" But it is in Somersetshire.—I can not go into Somersetshire.—There , where I looked forward to going ... No , Elinor , you can not expect me to go there . "
102398	102416	102433	102433	her	89	" Ah ! Colonel , I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss Dashwoods;"—was
102435	102471	102433	102433	her	89	settled—"for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers;—and how forlorn we shall be , when I come back!—Lord ! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats . "
102807	102819	102800	102801	the Colonel	104	" I am afraid it can not take place very soon . "
102839	102845	102831	102831	she	88	" Lord ! what should hinder it?"—but
102857	102870	102910	102911	Mrs. Jennings	103	" This is very strange!—sure he need not wait to be older . "
102931	102943	102928	102928	she	88	" I shall always think myself very much obliged to you . "
103018	103023	103025	103025	he	675	" I have heard , "
103031	103083	103025	103025	he	675	" of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family ; for if I understand the matter right , he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman . — Have I been rightly informed?—Is it so ? — "
103091	103097	103084	103084	Elinor	88	" The cruelty , the impolitic cruelty,"—he
103102	103368	103084	103084	Elinor	88	feeling,—"of dividing , or attempting to divide , two young people long attached to each other , is terrible . — Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing — what she may drive her son to . I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street , and am much pleased with him . He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time , but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake , and as a friend of yours , I wish it still more . I understand that he intends to take orders . Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford , now just vacant , as I am informed by this day 's post , is his , if he think it worth his acceptance — but THAT , perhaps , so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now , it may be nonsense to appear to doubt ; I only wish it were more valuable . — It is a rectory , but a small one ; the late incumbent , I believe , did not make more than 200 L per annum , and though it is certainly capable of improvement , I fear , not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income . Such as it is , however , my pleasure in presenting him to it , will be very great . Pray assure him of it . "
103750	103757	103759	103759	she	88	" The smallness of the house , "
103761	103783	103759	103759	she	88	" I can not imagine any inconvenience to them , for it will be in proportion to their family and income . "
103842	103995	103838	103838	he	93	" This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor ; it can not enable him to marry . I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this ; and my interest is hardly more extensive . If , however , by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther , I must think very differently of him from what I now do , if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present . What I am now doing indeed , seems nothing at all , since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal , his only object of happiness . His marriage must still be a distant good;—at least , I am afraid it can not take place very soon . — "
104073	104079	104081	104082	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Well , Miss Dashwood , "
104095	104161	104081	104082	Mrs. Jennings	103	" I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you ; for though , upon my honour , I TRIED to keep out of hearing , I could not help catching enough to understand his business . And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life , and I wish you joy of it with all my heart . "
104162	104168	104170	104170	Elinor	88	" Thank you , ma'am , "
104172	104225	104170	104170	Elinor	88	" It is a matter of great joy to me ; and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly . There are not many men who would act as he has done . Few people who have so compassionate a heart ! I never was more astonished in my life . "
104226	104264	104081	104082	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Lord ! my dear , you are very modest . I an't the least astonished at it in the world , for I have often thought of late , there was nothing more likely to happen . "
104265	104294	104170	104170	Elinor	88	" You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel 's general benevolence ; but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur . "
104295	104298	104300	104301	Mrs. Jennings—"Oh	216	" Opportunity ! "
104301	104370	104170	104170	Elinor	88	Jennings—"Oh ! as to that , when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing , somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity . Well , my dear , I wish you joy of it again and again ; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world , I think I shall soon know where to look for them . "
104371	104383	104385	104385	Elinor	88	" You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose , "
104392	104437	104170	104170	Elinor	88	" Aye , my dear , that I do , indeed . And as to the house being a bad one , I do not know what the Colonel would be at , for it is as good a one as ever I saw . "
104438	104448	104170	104170	Elinor	88	" He spoke of its being out of repair . "
104449	104473	104170	104170	Elinor	88	" Well , and whose fault is that ? why do n't he repair it ? — who should do it but himself ? "
104503	104584	104170	104170	Elinor	88	" Well , my dear , I must be gone before I have had half my talk out . But , however , we may have it all over in the evening ; for we shall be quite alone . I do not ask you to go with me , for I dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company ; and besides , you must long to tell your sister all about it . "
104595	104620	104170	104170	Elinor	88	" Certainly , ma'am , I shall tell Marianne of it ; but I shall not mention it at present to any body else . "
104621	104627	104629	104630	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Oh ! very well , "
104634	104659	104629	104630	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy , for I think of going as far as Holborn to - day . "
104660	104737	104170	104170	Elinor	88	" No , ma'am , not even Lucy if you please . One day 's delay will not be very material ; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars , I think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else . I shall do THAT directly . It is of importance that no time should be lost with him , for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination . "
104788	104865	104784	104784	she	103	" Oh , ho!—I understand you . Mr. Ferrars is to be the man . Well , so much the better for him . Ay , to be sure , he must be ordained in readiness ; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you . But , my dear , is not this rather out of character ? Should not the Colonel write himself?—sure , he is the proper person . "
104896	104921	104881	104881	she	88	" Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man , that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself . "
104922	104988	104784	104784	she	103	" And so YOU are forced to do it . Well THAT is an odd kind of delicacy ! However , I will not disturb you ( seeing her preparing to write . ) You know your own concerns best . So goodby , my dear . I have not heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed . "
105001	105073	104784	104784	she	103	" I have just been thinking of Beta 's sister , my dear . I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress . But whether she would do for a lady 's maid , I am sure I ca n't tell . She is an excellent housemaid , and works very well at her needle . However , you will think of all that at your leisure . "
105074	105079	105081	105081	Elinor	88	" Certainly , ma'am , "
105440	105446	105448	105448	he	93	" Mrs. Jennings told me , "
105450	105534	105448	105448	he	93	" that you wished to speak with me , at least I understood her so — or I certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner ; though at the same time , I should have been extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister ; especially as it will most likely be some time — it is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again . I go to Oxford tomorrow . "
105535	105544	105546	105546	Elinor	88	" You would not have gone , however , "
105566	105758	105557	105557	she	88	" without receiving our good wishes , even if we had not been able to give them in person . Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said . I have something of consequence to inform you of , which I was on the point of communicating by paper . I am charged with a most agreeable office ( breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke . ) Colonel Brandon , who was here only ten minutes ago , has desired me to say , that understanding you mean to take orders , he has great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant , and only wishes it were more valuable . Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well - judging a friend , and to join in his wish that the living — it is about two hundred a - year — were much more considerable , and such as might better enable you to — as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself — such , in short , as might establish all your views of happiness . "
105813	105817	105806	105806	he	93	" Colonel Brandon ! "
105818	105821	105823	105823	Elinor	88	" Yes , "
105837	105914	105823	105823	Elinor	88	" Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed — for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you — a concern which I am sure Marianne , myself , and all your friends , must share ; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character , and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion . "
105915	105926	105806	105806	he	93	" Colonel Brandon give ME a living!—Can it be possible ? "
105927	105944	105823	105823	Elinor	88	" The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where . "
105945	105948	105806	105806	he	93	" No , "
105956	106005	105806	105806	he	93	" not to find it in YOU ; for I can not be ignorant that to you , to your goodness , I owe it all.—I feel it — I would express it if I could — but , as you well know , I am no orator . "
106006	106127	105823	105823	Elinor	88	" You are very much mistaken . I do assure you that you owe it entirely , at least almost entirely , to your own merit , and Colonel Brandon 's discernment of it . I have had no hand in it . I did not even know , till I understood his design , that the living was vacant ; nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift . As a friend of mine , of my family , he may , perhaps — indeed I know he HAS , still greater pleasure in bestowing it ; but , upon my word , you owe nothing to my solicitation . "
106210	106256	106207	106207	he	93	" Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability . I have always heard him spoken of as such , and your brother I know esteems him highly . He is undoubtedly a sensible man , and in his manners perfectly the gentleman . "
106257	106260	106262	106262	Elinor	88	" Indeed , "
106264	106322	106262	106262	Elinor	88	" I believe that you will find him , on farther acquaintance , all that you have heard him to be , and as you will be such very near neighbours ( for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion - house , ) it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this . "
106373	106386	106388	106388	he	93	" Colonel Brandon , I think , lodges in St. James Street , "
106407	106445	106398	106398	Elinor	88	" I must hurry away then , to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give YOU ; to assure him that he has made me a very — an exceedingly happy man . "
106505	106512	106514	106514	Elinor	88	" When I see him again , "
106525	106535	106516	106516	herself	88	" I shall see him the husband of Lucy . "
106640	106646	106647	106647	she	103	" Well , my dear , "
106650	106685	106647	106647	she	103	" I sent you up to the young man . Did not I do right?—And I suppose you had no great difficulty — You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal ? "
106686	106697	106599	106599	she	103	" No , ma'am ; THAT was not very likely . "
106698	106716	106647	106647	she	103	" Well , and how soon will he be ready?—For it seems all to depend upon that . "
106717	106720	106722	106722	Elinor	88	" Really , "
106724	106763	106722	106722	Elinor	88	" I know so little of these kind of forms , that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time , or the preparation necessary ; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination . "
106764	106770	106772	106773	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Two or three months ! "
106775	106862	106772	106773	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Lord ! my dear , how calmly you talk of it ; and can the Colonel wait two or three months ! Lord bless me!—I am sure it would put ME quite out of patience!—And though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars , I do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him . Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well ; somebody that is in orders already . "
106863	106868	106870	106870	Elinor	88	" My dear ma'am , "
106872	106897	106870	106870	Elinor	88	" what can you be thinking of ? — Why , Colonel Brandon 's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars . "
106898	106929	106772	106773	Mrs. Jennings	103	" Lord bless you , my dear!—Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars ! "
106986	106999	107001	107001	she	103	" Aye , aye , the parsonage is but a small one , "
107014	107119	107001	107001	she	103	" and very likely MAY be out of repair ; but to hear a man apologising , as I thought , for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground - floor , and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds ! — and to you too , that had been used to live in Barton cottage ! — It seems quite ridiculous . But , my dear , we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage , and make it comfortable for them , before Lucy goes to it . "
107120	107143	107217	107217	her	88	" But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living 's being enough to allow them to marry . "
107144	107212	107001	107001	she	103	" The Colonel is a ninny , my dear ; because he has two thousand a - year himself , he thinks that nobody else can marry on less . Take my word for it , that , if I am alive , I shall be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas ; and I am sure I sha n't go if Lucy an't there . "
107794	107805	107864	107864	Elinor	88	" Fanny is in her own room , I suppose , "
107807	107862	107864	107864	Elinor	88	he:—"I will go to her presently , for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU . — Very far from it , indeed . NOW especially there can not be — but however , you and Marianne were always great favourites.—Why would not Marianne come ? "
107873	107883	107884	107884	he	2110	" I am not sorry to see you alone , "
107887	107934	107884	107884	he	2110	" for I have a good deal to say to you . This living of Colonel Brandon's — can it be true?—has he really given it to Edward?—I heard it yesterday by chance , and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it . "
107935	107950	107864	107864	Elinor	88	" It is perfectly true.—Colonel Brandon has given the living of Delaford to Edward . "
107951	107975	107884	107884	he	2110	" Really!—Well , this is very astonishing!—no relationship!—no connection between them!—and now that livings fetch such a price!—what was the value of this ? "
107976	107983	107864	107864	Elinor	88	" About two hundred a year . "
107984	108152	107884	107884	he	2110	" Very well — and for the next presentation to a living of that value — supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly , and likely to vacate it soon — he might have got I dare say — fourteen hundred pounds . And how came he not to have settled that matter before this person 's death?—NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it , but a man of Colonel Brandon 's sense!—I wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common , such natural , concern!—Well , I am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character . I suppose , however — on recollection — that the case may probably be THIS . Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation , is old enough to take it.—Aye , aye , that is the fact , depend upon it . "
108203	108207	108213	108213	she	88	" It is truly astonishing!"—he
108214	108222	108302	108302	she	88	said—"what could be the Colonel 's motive ? "
108223	108237	108302	108302	she	88	" A very simple one — to be of use to Mr. Ferrars . "
108238	108290	108302	108302	she	88	" Well , well ; whatever Colonel Brandon may be , Edward is a very lucky man.—You will not mention the matter to Fanny , however , for though I have broke it to her , and she bears it vastly well,—she will not like to hear it much talked of . "
108331	108335	108337	108337	he	93	" Mrs. Ferrars , "
108351	108395	108337	108337	he	93	" knows nothing about it at present , and I believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be . — When the marriage takes place , I fear she must hear of it all . "
108396	108545	108340	108340	his	93	" But why should such precaution be used?—Though it is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon,—for THAT must be quite out of the question ; yet why , upon her late behaviour , is she supposed to feel at all?—She has done with her son , she cast him off for ever , and has made all those over whom she had any influence , cast him off likewise . Surely , after doing so , she can not be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account — she can not be interested in any thing that befalls him . — She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child , and yet retain the anxiety of a parent ! "
108546	108551	108553	108553	John	85	" Ah ! Elinor , "
108555	108630	108553	108553	John	85	" your reasoning is very good , but it is founded on ignorance of human nature . When Edward 's unhappy match takes place , depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him ; and , therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event , must be concealed from her as much as possible . Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son . "
108631	108650	108340	108340	his	93	" You surprise me ; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by THIS time . "
108651	108670	108553	108553	John	85	" You wrong her exceedingly . Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world . "
108675	108678	108679	108680	Mr. Dashwood	85	" We think NOW,"—said
108687	108695	108679	108680	Mr. Dashwood	85	" of ROBERT 'S marrying Miss Morton . "
108714	108728	108340	108340	his	93	" The lady , I suppose , has no choice in the affair . "
108729	108735	108340	108340	his	93	" Choice!—how do you mean ? "
108736	108765	108340	108340	his	93	" I only mean that I suppose , from your manner of speaking , it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert . "
108766	108816	108340	108340	his	93	" Certainly , there can be no difference ; for Robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;—and as to any thing else , they are both very agreeable young men : I do not know that one is superior to the other . "
108835	108844	108340	108340	his	93	" Of ONE thing , my dear sister , "
108855	109150	108340	108340	his	93	whisper,—"I may assure you ; — and I WILL do it , because I know it must gratify you . I have good reason to think — indeed I have it from the best authority , or I should not repeat it , for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it — but I have it from the very best authority — not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself — but her daughter DID , and I have it from her — That in short , whatever objections there might be against a certain — a certain connection — you understand me — it would have been far preferable to her , it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does . I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that light — a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all . ' It would have been beyond comparison , ' she said , ' the least evil of the two , and she would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse . ' But however , all that is quite out of the question — not to be thought of or mentioned — as to any attachment you know — it never could be — all that is gone by . But I thought I would just tell you of this , because I knew how much it must please you . Not that you have any reason to regret , my dear Elinor . There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well — quite as well , or better , perhaps , all things considered . Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately ? "
109544	109553	109555	109555	he	143	" We may treat it as a joke , "
109575	109881	109555	109555	he	143	moment—"but , upon my soul , it is a most serious business . Poor Edward ! he is ruined for ever . I am extremely sorry for it — for I know him to be a very good - hearted creature ; as well - meaning a fellow perhaps , as any in the world . You must not judge of him , Miss Dashwood , from YOUR slight acquaintance.—Poor Edward!—His manners are certainly not the happiest in nature.—But we are not all born , you know , with the same powers,—the same address . — Poor fellow!—to see him in a circle of strangers ! — to be sure it was pitiable enough!—but upon my soul , I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom ; and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life , as when it all burst forth . I could not believe it . — My mother was the first person who told me of it ; and I , feeling myself called on to act with resolution , immediately said to her , ' My dear madam , I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion , but as for myself , I must say , that if Edward does marry this young woman , I never will see him again . ' That was what I said immediately . — I was most uncommonly shocked , indeed!—Poor Edward!—he has done for himself completely — shut himself out for ever from all decent society!—but , as I directly said to my mother , I am not in the least surprised at it ; from his style of education , it was always to be expected . My poor mother was half frantic . "
109882	109890	109555	109555	he	143	" Have you ever seen the lady ? "
109891	110159	110160	110160	He	2124	" Yes ; once , while she was staying in this house , I happened to drop in for ten minutes ; and I saw quite enough of her . The merest awkward country girl , without style , or elegance , and almost without beauty . — I remember her perfectly . Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward . I offered immediately , as soon as my mother related the affair to me , to talk to him myself , and dissuade him from the match ; but it was too late THEN , I found , to do any thing , for unluckily , I was not in the way at first , and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place , when it was not for me , you know , to interfere . But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier — I think it is most probable — that something might have been hit on . I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light . ' My dear fellow , ' I should have said , ' consider what you are doing . You are making a most disgraceful connection , and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving . ' I can not help thinking , in short , that means might have been found . But now it is all too late . He must be starved , you know ; — that is certain ; absolutely starved . "

113906	113912	113880	113880	Marianne	89	" Is mama coming ? — "
113913	113917	113919	113920	the other	784	" Not yet , "
113934	113963	113919	113920	the other	784	" but she will be here , I hope , before it is long . It is a great way , you know , from hence to Barton . "
113964	113974	113976	113976	Marianne	89	" But she must not go round by London , "
113984	113997	113976	113976	Marianne	89	" I shall never see her , if she goes by London . "
116369	116388	116353	116353	his	106	" Miss Dashwood , for half an hour — for ten minutes — I entreat you to stay . "
116389	116394	116395	116395	she	88	" No , sir , "
116400	116433	116395	116395	she	88	" I shall NOT stay . Your business can not be with ME . The servants , I suppose , forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house . "

116446	116479	116441	116441	he	106	" that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil , it would not have turned me from the door . My business is with you , and only you . "
116480	116482	116395	116395	she	88	" With me!"—in

116502	116512	116395	116395	she	88	" Sit down , and I will be both . "
116611	116616	116617	116617	Elinor	88	" Pray be quick , sir,"—said
116622	116630	116617	116617	Elinor	88	" I have no time to spare . "
116648	116652	116654	116654	he	106	" Your sister , "
116661	116685	116654	116654	he	106	afterwards—"is out of danger . I heard it from the servant . God be praised!—But is it true ? is it really true ? "
116700	116719	116691	116691	He	106	" For God 's sake tell me , is she out of danger , or is she not ? "
116720	116726	116654	116654	he	106	" We hope she is . "

116803	116815	116758	116758	he	106	" do you think me most a knave or a fool ? "
116862	116907	116856	116856	she	88	" Mr. Willoughby , I advise you at present to return to Combe — I am not at leisure to remain with you longer . — Whatever your business may be with me , will it be better recollected and explained to - morrow . "
116908	116913	116914	116914	he	106	" I understand you , "
116928	116955	116914	116914	he	106	" yes , I am very drunk . — A pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was enough to over - set me . "
116956	116958	116959	116959	Elinor	88	" At Marlborough!"—cried
116975	117007	117018	117018	his	106	" Yes,—I left London this morning at eight o'clock , and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough . "
117055	117103	117046	117046	she	88	" Mr. Willoughby , you OUGHT to feel , and I certainly DO — that after what has passed — your coming here in this manner , and forcing yourself upon my notice , requires a very particular excuse.—What is it , that you mean by it ? "
117105	117107	117108	117108	he	106	" I mean,"—said
117112	117189	117046	117046	she	88	energy—"if I can , to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW . I mean to offer some kind of explanation , some kind of apology , for the past ; to open my whole heart to you , and by convincing you , that though I have been always a blockhead , I have not been always a rascal , to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma — from your sister . "
117190	117200	117046	117046	she	88	" Is this the real reason of your coming ? "
117201	117206	117207	117207	his	106	" Upon my soul it is,"—was
117234	117257	117046	117046	she	88	" If that is all , you may be satisfied already , — for Marianne DOES — she has LONG forgiven you . "
117258	117260	117207	117207	his	106	" Has she?"—he
117270	117302	117207	117207	his	106	" Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it . But she shall forgive me again , and on more reasonable grounds.—NOW will you listen to me ? "
117308	117314	117316	117316	he	106	" I do not know , "
117331	117546	117330	117330	his	106	own,—"how YOU may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister , or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me . — Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,—it is worth the trial however , and you shall hear every thing . When I first became intimate in your family , I had no other intention , no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire , more pleasantly than I had ever done before . Your sister 's lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me ; and her behaviour to me almost from the first , was of a kind — It is astonishing , when I reflect on what it was , and what SHE was , that my heart should have been so insensible ! But at first I must confess , my vanity only was elevated by it . Careless of her happiness , thinking only of my own amusement , giving way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging , I endeavoured , by every means in my power , to make myself pleasing to her , without any design of returning her affection . "
117571	117623	117555	117555	her	107	" It is hardly worth while , Mr. Willoughby , for you to relate , or for me to listen any longer . Such a beginning as this can not be followed by any thing . — Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject . "
117624	117635	117636	117636	he	2341	" I insist on you hearing the whole of it , "
117639	117930	117636	117636	he	2341	" My fortune was never large , and I had always been expensive , always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself . Every year since my coming of age , or even before , I believe , had added to my debts ; and though the death of my old cousin , Mrs. Smith , was to set me free ; yet that event being uncertain , and possibly far distant , it had been for some time my intention to re - establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune . To attach myself to your sister , therefore , was not a thing to be thought of;—and with a meanness , selfishness , cruelty — which no indignant , no contemptuous look , even of yours , Miss Dashwood , can ever reprobate too much — I was acting in this manner , trying to engage her regard , without a thought of returning it.—But one thing may be said for me : even in that horrid state of selfish vanity , I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated , because I did not THEN know what it was to love . But have I ever known it?—Well may it be doubted ; for , had I really loved , could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity , to avarice?—or , what is more , could I have sacrificed hers ? — But I have done it . To avoid a comparative poverty , which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors , I have , by raising myself to affluence , lost every thing that could make it a blessing . "
117931	117936	117938	117938	Elinor	88	" You did then , "
117944	117954	117938	117938	Elinor	88	" believe yourself at one time attached to her ? "
117955	118242	118243	118243	he	2342	" To have resisted such attractions , to have withstood such tenderness!—Is there a man on earth who could have done it?—Yes , I found myself , by insensible degrees , sincerely fond of her ; and the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly honourable , and my feelings blameless . Even THEN , however , when fully determined on paying my addresses to her , I allowed myself most improperly to put off , from day to day , the moment of doing it , from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed . I will not reason here — nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity , and the worse than absurdity , of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound . The event has proved , that I was a cunning fool , providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever . At last , however , my resolution was taken , and I had determined , as soon as I could engage her alone , to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her , and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display . But in the interim — in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass , before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private — a circumstance occurred — an unlucky circumstance , to ruin all my resolution , and with it all my comfort . A discovery took place,"—here
118247	118290	118291	118291	he	2342	down.—"Mrs . Smith had somehow or other been informed , I imagine by some distant relation , whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour , of an affair , a connection — but I need not explain myself farther , "
118304	118318	118291	118291	he	2342	eye—"your particular intimacy — you have probably heard the whole story long ago . "
118319	118323	118325	118325	Elinor	88	" I have , "
118341	118371	118325	118325	Elinor	88	" I have heard it all . And how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business , I confess is beyond my comprehension . "
118372	118375	118377	118377	Willoughby	106	" Remember , "
118379	118570	118377	118377	Willoughby	106	" from whom you received the account . Could it be an impartial one ? I acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me . I do not mean to justify myself , but at the same time can not leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge — that because she was injured she was irreproachable , and because I was a libertine , SHE must be a saint . If the violence of her passions , the weakness of her understanding — I do not mean , however , to defend myself . Her affection for me deserved better treatment , and I often , with great self - reproach , recall the tenderness which , for a very short time , had the power of creating any return . I wish — I heartily wish it had never been . But I have injured more than herself ; and I have injured one , whose affection for me—(may I say it ? ) was scarcely less warm than hers ; and whose mind — Oh ! how infinitely superior ! "
118572	118672	118325	118325	Elinor	88	" Your indifference , however , towards that unfortunate girl — I must say it , unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well be — your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her . Do not think yourself excused by any weakness , any natural defect of understanding on her side , in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours . You must have known , that while you were enjoying yourself in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes , always gay , always happy , she was reduced to the extremest indigence . "
118673	118686	118687	118687	he	2343	" But , upon my soul , I did NOT know it , "
118691	118719	118687	118687	he	2343	" I did not recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction ; and common sense might have told her how to find it out . "
118720	118731	118325	118325	Elinor	88	" Well , sir , and what said Mrs. Smith ? "
118732	119153	118687	118687	he	2343	" She taxed me with the offence at once , and my confusion may be guessed . The purity of her life , the formality of her notions , her ignorance of the world — every thing was against me . The matter itself I could not deny , and vain was every endeavour to soften it . She was previously disposed , I believe , to doubt the morality of my conduct in general , and was moreover discontented with the very little attention , the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her , in my present visit . In short , it ended in a total breach . By one measure I might have saved myself . In the height of her morality , good woman ! she offered to forgive the past , if I would marry Eliza . That could not be — and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house . The night following this affair — I was to go the next morning — was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be . The struggle was great — but it ended too soon . My affection for Marianne , my thorough conviction of her attachment to me — it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty , or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches , which I was naturally inclined to feel , and expensive society had increased . I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife , if I chose to address her , and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do . A heavy scene however awaited me , before I could leave Devonshire;—I was engaged to dine with you on that very day ; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement . But whether I should write this apology , or deliver it in person , was a point of long debate . To see Marianne , I felt , would be dreadful , and I even doubted whether I could see her again , and keep to my resolution . In that point , however , I undervalued my own magnanimity , as the event declared ; for I went , I saw her , and saw her miserable , and left her miserable — and left her hoping never to see her again . "
119154	119163	119165	119165	Elinor	88	" Why did you call , Mr. Willoughby ? "
119169	119186	119165	119165	Elinor	88	" a note would have answered every purpose . — Why was it necessary to call ? "
119187	119428	118687	118687	he	2343	" It was necessary to my own pride . I could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead you , or the rest of the neighbourhood , to suspect any part of what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself — and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage , in my way to Honiton . The sight of your dear sister , however , was really dreadful ; and , to heighten the matter , I found her alone . You were all gone I do not know where . I had left her only the evening before , so fully , so firmly resolved within my self on doing right ! A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever ; and I remember how happy , how gay were my spirits , as I walked from the cottage to Allenham , satisfied with myself , delighted with every body ! But in this , our last interview of friendship , I approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling . Her sorrow , her disappointment , her deep regret , when I told her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately — I never shall forget it — united too with such reliance , such confidence in me!—Oh , God!—what a hard - hearted rascal I was ! "
119442	119453	118687	118687	he	2343	" Did you tell her that you should soon return ? "
119454	119464	119465	119465	he	2345	" I do not know what I told her , "
119470	119669	119465	119465	he	2345	" less than was due to the past , beyond a doubt , and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future . I can not think of it.—It wo n't do.—Then came your dear mother to torture me farther , with all her kindness and confidence . Thank Heaven ! it DID torture me . I was miserable . Miss Dashwood , you can not have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery . I owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid , rascally folly of my own heart , that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now . Well , I went , left all that I loved , and went to those to whom , at best , I was only indifferent . My journey to town — travelling with my own horses , and therefore so tediously — no creature to speak to — my own reflections so cheerful — when I looked forward every thing so inviting!—when I looked back at Barton , the picture so soothing!—oh , it was a blessed journey ! "
119673	119678	119680	119680	Elinor	88	" Well , sir , "
119694	119700	119680	119680	Elinor	88	" and this is all ? "
119701	119721	119465	119465	he	2345	" Ah!—no,—have you forgot what passed in town ? — That infamous letter — Did she shew it you ? "
119722	119732	119680	119680	Elinor	88	" Yes , I saw every note that passed . "
119733	119869	119465	119465	he	2345	" When the first of hers reached me ( as it immediately did , for I was in town the whole time , ) what I felt is — in the common phrase , not to be expressed ; in a more simple one — perhaps too simple to raise any emotion — my feelings were very , very painful.—Every line , every word was — in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer , were she here , would forbid — a dagger to my heart . To know that Marianne was in town was — in the same language — a thunderbolt.—Thunderbolts and daggers!—what a reproof would she have given me!—her taste , her opinions — I believe they are better known to me than my own,—and I am sure they are dearer . "
119907	119934	119680	119680	Elinor	88	" This is not right , Mr. Willoughby.—Remember that you are married . Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear . "
119935	120238	119680	119680	Elinor	88	" Marianne 's note , by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days , that in spite of the many , many weeks we had been separated , she was as constant in her own feelings , and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever , awakened all my remorse . I say awakened , because time and London , business and dissipation , had in some measure quieted it , and I had been growing a fine hardened villain , fancying myself indifferent to her , and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me ; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle , trifling business , shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so , and silencing every reproach , overcoming every scruple , by secretly saying now and then , ' I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married . ' — But this note made me know myself better . I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world , and that I was using her infamously . But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me . To retreat was impossible . All that I had to do , was to avoid you both . I sent no answer to Marianne , intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice ; and for some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street;—but at last , judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool , common acquaintance than anything else , I watched you all safely out of the house one morning , and left my name . "
120239	120247	119680	119680	Elinor	88	" Watched us out of the house ! "
120248	120790	119680	119680	Elinor	88	" Even so . You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you , how often I was on the point of falling in with you . I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight , as the carriage drove by . Lodging as I did in Bond Street , there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you ; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side , a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight , could have separated us so long . I avoided the Middletons as much as possible , as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common . Not aware of their being in town , however , I blundered on Sir John , I believe , the first day of his coming , and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings 's . He asked me to a party , a dance at his house in the evening.—Had he NOT told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there , I should have felt it too certain a thing , to trust myself near him . The next morning brought another short note from Marianne — still affectionate , open , artless , confiding — everything that could make MY conduct most hateful . I could not answer it . I tried — but could not frame a sentence . But I thought of her , I believe , every moment of the day . If you CAN pity me , Miss Dashwood , pity my situation as it was THEN . With my head and heart full of your sister , I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!—Those three or four weeks were worse than all . Well , at last , as I need not tell you , you were forced on me ; and what a sweet figure I cut!—what an evening of agony it was ! — Marianne , beautiful as an angel on one side , calling me Willoughby in such a tone!—Oh , God!—holding out her hand to me , asking me for an explanation , with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face!—and Sophia , jealous as the devil on the other hand , looking all that was — Well , it does not signify ; it is over now . — Such an evening!—I ran away from you all as soon as I could ; but not before I had seen Marianne 's sweet face as white as death.—THAT was the last , last look I ever had of her ; — the last manner in which she appeared to me . It was a horrid sight!—yet when I thought of her to - day as really dying , it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those , who saw her last in this world . She was before me , constantly before me , as I travelled , in the same look and hue . "
120808	120830	119680	119680	Elinor	88	" Well , let me make haste and be gone . Your sister is certainly better , certainly out of danger ? "
120831	120838	119680	119680	Elinor	88	" We are assured of it . "
120839	120848	119680	119680	Elinor	88	" Your poor mother , too!—doting on Marianne . "
120849	120870	119680	119680	Elinor	88	" But the letter , Mr. Willoughby , your own letter ; have you any thing to say about that ? "
120871	121093	119680	119680	Elinor	88	" Yes , yes , THAT in particular . Your sister wrote to me again , you know , the very next morning . You saw what she said . I was breakfasting at the Ellisons,—and her letter , with some others , was brought to me there from my lodgings . It happened to catch Sophia 's eye before it caught mine — and its size , the elegance of the paper , the hand - writing altogether , immediately gave her a suspicion . Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire , and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was , and made her more jealous than ever . Affecting that air of playfulness , therefore , which is delightful in a woman one loves , she opened the letter directly , and read its contents . She was well paid for her impudence . She read what made her wretched . Her wretchedness I could have borne , but her passion — her malice — At all events it must be appeased . And , in short — what do you think of my wife 's style of letter - writing?—delicate — tender — truly feminine — was it not ? "
121094	121106	119680	119680	Elinor	88	" Your wife!—The letter was in your own hand - writing . "
121107	121422	119680	119680	Elinor	88	" Yes , but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to . The original was all her own — her own happy thoughts and gentle diction . But what could I do!—we were engaged , every thing in preparation , the day almost fixed — But I am talking like a fool . Preparation!—day!—In honest words , her money was necessary to me , and in a situation like mine , any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture . And after all , what did it signify to my character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends , in what language my answer was couched?—It must have been only to one end . My business was to declare myself a scoundrel , and whether I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance . — ' I am ruined for ever in their opinion — ' said I to myself—'I am shut out for ever from their society , they already think me an unprincipled fellow , this letter will only make them think me a blackguard one . ' Such were my reasonings , as , in a sort of desperate carelessness , I copied my wife 's words , and parted with the last relics of Marianne . Her three notes — unluckily they were all in my pocketbook , or I should have denied their existence , and hoarded them for ever — I was forced to put them up , and could not even kiss them . And the lock of hair — that too I had always carried about me in the same pocket - book , which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,—the dear lock — all , every memento was torn from me . "
121423	121435	121437	121437	Elinor	88	" You are very wrong , Mr. Willoughby , very blamable , "
121453	121545	121440	121440	her	88	" you ought not to speak in this way , either of Mrs. Willoughby or my sister . You had made your own choice . It was not forced on you . Your wife has a claim to your politeness , to your respect , at least . She must be attached to you , or she would not have married you . To treat her with unkindness , to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne — nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience . "
121546	121556	121558	121558	he	2348	" Do not talk to me of my wife , "
121565	121659	121558	121558	he	2348	" She does not deserve your compassion.—She knew I had no regard for her when we married.—Well , married we were , and came down to Combe Magna to be happy , and afterwards returned to town to be gay.—And now do you pity me , Miss Dashwood?—or have I said all this to no purpose ? — Am I — be it only one degree — am I less guilty in your opinion than I was before?—My intentions were not always wrong . Have I explained away any part of my guilt ? "
121660	121724	121440	121440	her	88	" Yes , you have certainly removed something — a little . — You have proved yourself , on the whole , less faulty than I had believed you . You have proved your heart less wicked , much less wicked . But I hardly know — the misery that you have inflicted — I hardly know what could have made it worse . "
121725	121844	121558	121558	he	2348	" Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered , what I have been telling you?—Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours . You tell me that she has forgiven me already . Let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart , and of my present feelings , will draw from her a more spontaneous , more natural , more gentle , less dignified , forgiveness . Tell her of my misery and my penitence — tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her , and if you will , that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever . "
121845	121887	121440	121440	her	88	" I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called , your justification . But you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now , nor how you heard of her illness . "
121888	122198	121558	121558	he	2348	" Last night , in Drury Lane lobby , I ran against Sir John Middleton , and when he saw who I was — for the first time these two months — he spoke to me.—That he had cut me ever since my marriage , I had seen without surprise or resentment . Now , however , his good - natured , honest , stupid soul , full of indignation against me , and concern for your sister , could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to — though probably he did not think it WOULD — vex me horridly . As bluntly as he could speak it , therefore , he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland — a letter that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent — the Palmers are all gone off in a fright , & c.—I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John . His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer ; and so much of his ill - will was done away , that when we parted , he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy . What I felt on hearing that your sister was dying — and dying too , believing me the greatest villain upon earth , scorning , hating me in her latest moments — for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed ? ONE person I was sure would represent me as capable of any thing — What I felt was dreadful!—My resolution was soon made , and at eight o'clock this morning I was in my carriage . Now you know all . "
122457	122471	122433	122433	Willoughby	106	" There is no use in staying here ; I must be off . "
122472	122480	122433	122433	Willoughby	106	" Are you going back to town ? "
122481	122506	122433	122433	Willoughby	106	" No — to Combe Magna . I have business there ; from thence to town in a day or two . Good bye . "
122526	122537	122538	122538	he	2349	" And you DO think something better of me than you did?"—said
122603	122608	122610	122610	he	2349	" As to that , "
122612	122702	122610	122610	he	2349	" I must rub through the world as well as I can . Domestic happiness is out of the question . If , however , I am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions , it may be the means — it may put me on my guard — at least , it may be something to live for . Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever . Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again — "
122710	122711	122703	122703	Elinor	88	" Well,"—he
122712	122730	122703	122703	Elinor	88	replied—"once more good bye . I shall now go away and live in dread of one event . "
122731	122737	122703	122703	Elinor	88	" What do you mean ? "
122738	122744	122703	122703	Elinor	88	" Your sister 's marriage . "
122745	122764	122703	122703	Elinor	88	" You are very wrong . She can never be more lost to you than she is now . "
122765	122829	122703	122703	Elinor	88	" But she will be gained by some one else . And if that some one should be the very he whom , of all others , I could least bear — but I will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill , by shewing that where I have most injured I can least forgive . Good bye,—God bless you ! "
123587	123591	123585	123585	Willoughby	106	" poor Willoughby , "
123989	124020	124021	124021	Her	89	" At last we are alone . My Elinor , you do not yet know all my happiness . Colonel Brandon loves Marianne . He has told me so himself . "
124042	124108	124021	124021	Her	89	" You are never like me , dear Elinor , or I should wonder at your composure now . Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my family , I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon 's marrying one of you as the object most desirable . And I believe Marianne will be the most happy with him of the two . "
124172	124294	124164	124164	she	338	" He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled . It came out quite unawares , quite undesignedly . I , you may well believe , could talk of nothing but my child;—he could not conceal his distress ; I saw that it equalled my own , and he perhaps , thinking that mere friendship , as the world now goes , would not justify so warm a sympathy — or rather , not thinking at all , I suppose — giving way to irresistible feelings , made me acquainted with his earnest , tender , constant , affection for Marianne . He has loved her , my Elinor , ever since the first moment of seeing her . "
124333	124418	124445	124445	her	88	" His regard for her , infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby ever felt or feigned , as much more warm , as more sincere or constant — which ever we are to call it — has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne 's unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!—and without selfishness — without encouraging a hope!—could he have seen her happy with another — Such a noble mind ! — such openness , such sincerity!—no one can be deceived in HIM . "
124419	124425	124427	124427	Elinor	88	" Colonel Brandon 's character , "
124429	124439	124427	124427	Elinor	88	" as an excellent man , is well established . "
124440	124444	124445	124446	her mother	338	" I know it is"—replied
124449	124503	124445	124446	her mother	338	" or after such a warning , I should be the last to encourage such affection , or even to be pleased by it . But his coming for me as he did , with such active , such ready friendship , is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men . "
124504	124510	124512	124512	Elinor	88	" His character , however , "
124514	124633	124512	124512	Elinor	88	" does not rest on ONE act of kindness , to which his affection for Marianne , were humanity out of the case , would have prompted him . To Mrs. Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do I value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . What answer did you give him?—Did you allow him to hope ? "
124634	124796	124445	124446	her mother	338	" Oh ! my love , I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself . Marianne might at that moment be dying . But he did not ask for hope or encouragement . His was an involuntary confidence , an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend — not an application to a parent . Yet after a time I DID say , for at first I was quite overcome — that if she lived , as I trusted she might , my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage ; and since our arrival , since our delightful security , I have repeated it to him more fully , have given him every encouragement in my power . Time , a very little time , I tell him , will do everything;—Marianne 's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby . — His own merits must soon secure it . "
124797	124817	124512	124512	Elinor	88	" To judge from the Colonel 's spirits , however , you have not yet made him equally sanguine . "
124818	124986	124445	124446	her mother	338	" No.—He thinks Marianne 's affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time , and even supposing her heart again free , is too diffident of himself to believe , that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her . There , however , he is quite mistaken . His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage , as to make his character and principles fixed;—and his disposition , I am well convinced , is exactly the very one to make your sister happy . And his person , his manners too , are all in his favour . My partiality does not blind me ; he certainly is not so handsome as Willoughby — but at the same time , there is something much more pleasing in his countenance . — There was always a something,—if you remember,—in Willoughby 's eyes at times , which I did not like . "
125003	125124	124992	124993	her mother	338	" And his manners , the Colonel 's manners are not only more pleasing to me than Willoughby 's ever were , but they are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching to Marianne . Their gentleness , their genuine attention to other people , and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition , than the liveliness — often artificial , and often ill - timed of the other . I am very sure myself , that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable , as he has proved himself the contrary , Marianne would yet never have been so happy with HIM , as she will be with Colonel Brandon . "
125148	125162	125164	125165	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" At Delaford , she will be within an easy distance of me , "
125167	125210	125164	125165	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" even if I remain at Barton ; and in all probability,—for I hear it is a large village,—indeed there certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by , that would suit us quite as well as our present situation . "
125227	125267	125164	125165	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" His fortune too!—for at my time of life you know , everybody cares about THAT;—and though I neither know nor desire to know , what it really is , I am sure it must be a good one . "
126463	126477	126479	126479	she	89	" When the weather is settled , and I have recovered my strength , "
126481	126702	126479	126479	she	89	" we will take long walks together every day . We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down , and see how the children go on ; we will walk to Sir John 's new plantations at Barton Cross , and the Abbeyland ; and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory , and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached . I know we shall be happy . I know the summer will pass happily away . I mean never to be later in rising than six , and from that time till dinner I shall divide every moment between music and reading . I have formed my plan , and am determined to enter on a course of serious study . Our own library is too well known to me , to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement . But there are many works well worth reading at the Park ; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon . By reading only six hours a - day , I shall gain in the course of a twelve - month a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want . "
126979	126983	126975	126975	Marianne	89	" There , exactly there,"—pointing
126988	127003	126975	126975	Marianne	89	" on that projecting mound,—there I fell ; and there I first saw Willoughby . "
127017	127043	127014	127014	she	89	" I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the spot!—shall we ever talk on that subject , Elinor ? "
127048	127068	127014	127014	she	89	said.—"Or will it be wrong?—I can talk of it now , I hope , as I ought to do . "
127078	127083	127085	127085	Marianne	89	" As for regret , "
127087	127184	127085	127085	Marianne	89	" I have done with that , as far as HE is concerned . I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him , but what they are NOW.—At present , if I could be satisfied on one point , if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS acting a part , not ALWAYS deceiving me;—but above all , if I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him , since the story of that unfortunate girl "
127198	127214	127195	127195	she	88	" If you could be assured of that , you think you should be easy . "
127215	127277	127189	127189	Elinor	88	" Yes . My peace of mind is doubly involved in it ; — for not only is it horrible to suspect a person , who has been what HE has been to ME , of such designs,—but what must it make me appear to myself?—What in a situation like mine , but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to "
127279	127283	127285	127286	her sister	343	" How then , "
127288	127296	127285	127286	her sister	343	" would you account for his behaviour ? "
127297	127318	127189	127189	Elinor	88	" I would suppose him,—Oh , how gladly would I suppose him , only fickle , very , very fickle . "
127360	127370	127372	127372	Marianne	89	" I am not wishing him too much good , "
127379	127402	127372	127372	Marianne	89	" when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own . He will suffer enough in them . "
127403	127412	127189	127189	Elinor	88	" Do you compare your conduct with his ? "
127413	127433	127372	127372	Marianne	89	" No . I compare it with what it ought to have been ; I compare it with yours . "
127434	127442	127189	127189	Elinor	88	" Our situations have borne little resemblance . "
127443	128012	127372	127372	Marianne	89	" They have borne more than our conduct.—Do not , my dearest Elinor , let your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure . My illness has made me think — It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection . Long before I was enough recovered to talk , I was perfectly able to reflect . I considered the past : I saw in my own behaviour , since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn , nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself , and want of kindness to others . I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings , and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave . My illness , I well knew , had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health , as I had felt even at the time to be wrong . Had I died,—it would have been self - destruction . I did not know my danger till the danger was removed ; but with such feelings as these reflections gave me , I wonder at my recovery,—wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live , to have time for atonement to my God , and to you all , did not kill me at once . Had I died , — in what peculiar misery should I have left you , my nurse , my friend , my sister!—You , who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days ; who had known all the murmurings of my heart!—How should I have lived in YOUR remembrance!—My mother too ! How could you have consoled her!—I can not express my own abhorrence of myself . Whenever I looked towards the past , I saw some duty neglected , or some failing indulged . Every body seemed injured by me . The kindness , the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings , I had repaid with ungrateful contempt . To the Middletons , to the Palmers , the Steeles , to every common acquaintance even , I had been insolent and unjust ; with a heart hardened against their merits , and a temper irritated by their very attention.—To John , to Fanny,—yes , even to them , little as they deserve , I had given less than their due . But you,—you above all , above my mother , had been wronged by me . I , and only I , knew your heart and its sorrows ; yet to what did it influence me?—not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself.—Your example was before me ; but to what avail?—Was I more considerate of you and your comfort ? Did I imitate your forbearance , or lessen your restraints , by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?—No ; — not less when I knew you to be unhappy , than when I had believed you at ease , did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship ; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me , regretting only THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me , and leaving you , for or I professed an unbounded affection , to be miserable for my sake . "
128062	128263	128055	128055	Marianne	89	" You are very good.—The future must be my proof . I have laid down my plan , and if I am capable of adhering to it — my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved . They shall no longer worry others , nor torture myself . I shall now live solely for my family . You , my mother , and Margaret , must henceforth be all the world to me ; you will share my affections entirely between you . From you , from my home , I shall never again have the smallest incitement to move ; and if I do mix in other society , it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled , my heart amended , and that I can practise the civilities , the lesser duties of life , with gentleness and forbearance . As for Willoughby — to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him , would be idle . His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions . But it shall be regulated , it shall be checked by religion , by reason , by constant employment . "
128274	128288	128264	128264	She	2449	" If I could but know HIS heart , everything would become easy . "
128554	128558	128561	128561	her	89	" Tell mama , "
128927	128935	128937	128937	she	89	" I wish to assure you both , "
128939	128954	128937	128937	she	89	" that I see every thing — as you can desire me to do . "
128994	129021	128990	128990	Marianne	89	" It is a great relief to me — what Elinor told me this morning — I have now heard exactly what I wished to hear . "—For
129041	129095	129033	129033	she	89	before—"I am now perfectly satisfied , I wish for no change . I never could have been happy with him , after knowing , as sooner or later I must have known , all this.—I should have had no confidence , no esteem . Nothing could have done it away to my feelings . "
129096	129105	129107	129108	her mother	338	" I know it — I know it , "
129110	129172	129033	129033	she	89	" Happy with a man of libertine practices!—With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends , and the best of men!—No — my Marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man!—Her conscience , her sensitive conscience , would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt . "
129179	129186	129173	129173	Marianne	89	" I wish for no change . "
129187	129193	129195	129195	Elinor	88	" You consider the matter , "
129197	129493	129195	129195	Elinor	88	" exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it ; and I dare say you perceive , as well as myself , not only in this , but in many other circumstances , reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments , in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection , on his side , much less certain . Had you married , you must have been always poor . His expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself , and his whole conduct declares that self - denial is a word hardly understood by him . His demands and your inexperience together , on a small , very small income , must have brought on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you , from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before . YOUR sense of honour and honesty would have led you , I know , when aware of your situation , to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible : and , perhaps , as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort , you might have been suffered to practice it , but beyond that — and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage ? — Beyond THAT , had you endeavoured , however reasonably , to abridge HIS enjoyments , is it not to be feared , that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it , you would have lessened your own influence on his heart , and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties ? "
129504	129507	129500	129500	she	89	" Selfish ? "
129512	129519	129500	129500	she	89	implied—"do you really think him selfish ? "
129520	129527	129529	129529	Elinor	88	" The whole of his behaviour , "
129531	129604	129529	129529	Elinor	88	" from the beginning to the end of the affair , has been grounded on selfishness . It was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections ; which afterwards , when his own were engaged , made him delay the confession of it , and which finally carried him from Barton . His own enjoyment , or his own ease , was , in every particular , his ruling principle . "
129605	129618	129500	129500	she	89	" It is very true . MY happiness never was his object . "
129619	129623	129625	129625	Elinor	88	" At present , "
129627	129796	129625	129625	Elinor	88	" he regrets what he has done . And why does he regret it?—Because he finds it has not answered towards himself . It has not made him happy . His circumstances are now unembarrassed — he suffers from no evil of that kind ; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself . But does it follow that had he married you , he would have been happy?—The inconveniences would have been different . He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which , because they are removed , he now reckons as nothing . He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint , but he would have been always necessitous — always poor ; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance , even to domestic happiness , than the mere temper of a wife . "
129797	129806	129808	129808	Marianne	89	" I have not a doubt of it , "
129810	129824	129808	129808	Marianne	89	" and I have nothing to regret — nothing but my own folly . "
129825	129836	129838	129839	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" Rather say your mother 's imprudence , my child , "
129841	129847	129838	129839	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" SHE must be answerable . "
129892	129949	129880	129880	she	88	" One observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story — that all Willoughby 's difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams . That crime has been the origin of every lesser one , and of all his present discontents . "
130181	130210	130171	130171	John	99	" We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward , and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject , but conclude him to be still at Oxford ; "
130299	130313	130277	130277	he	2478	" I suppose you know , ma'am , that Mr. Ferrars is married . "
130524	130536	130852	130853	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married , Thomas ? "
130537	130732	130477	130477	her	88	" I see Mr. Ferrars myself , ma'am , this morning in Exeter , and his lady too , Miss Steele as was . They was stopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn , as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park to her brother , who is one of the post - boys . I happened to look up as I went by the chaise , and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss Steele ; so I took off my hat , and she knew me and called to me , and inquired after you , ma'am , and the young ladies , especially Miss Marianne , and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars 's , their best compliments and service , and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you , but they was in a great hurry to go forwards , for they was going further down for a little while , but howsever , when they come back , they 'd make sure to come and see you . "
130733	130745	130852	130853	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" But did she tell you she was married , Thomas ? "
130746	130797	130477	130477	her	88	" Yes , ma'am . She smiled , and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts . She was always a very affable and free - spoken young lady , and very civil behaved . So , I made free to wish her joy . "
130798	130808	130852	130853	Mrs. Dashwood	86	" Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her ? "
130809	130837	130477	130477	her	88	" Yes , ma'am , I just see him leaning back in it , but he did not look up;—he never was a gentleman much for talking . "
130860	130870	130477	130477	her	88	" Was there no one else in the carriage ? "
130871	130880	130477	130477	her	88	" No , ma'am , only they two . "
130881	130890	130477	130477	her	88	" Do you know where they came from ? "
130891	130907	130477	130477	her	88	" They come straight from town , as Miss Lucy — Mrs. Ferrars told me . "
130908	130916	130477	130477	her	88	" And are they going farther westward ? "
130917	130945	130477	130477	her	88	" Yes , ma'am — but not to bide long . They will soon be back again , and then they 'd be sure and call here . "
131026	131038	131016	131016	Elinor	88	" Did you see them off , before you came away ? "
131039	131066	131020	131020	she	88	" No , ma'am — the horses were just coming out , but I could not bide any longer ; I was afraid of being late . "
131067	131074	131016	131016	Elinor	88	" Did Mrs. Ferrars look well ? "
131075	131107	131020	131020	she	88	" Yes , ma'am , she said how she was very well ; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady — and she seemed vastly contented . "
131865	131876	131886	131886	her	88	" When do you write to Colonel Brandon , ma'am ? "
131894	131945	131977	131980	a man on horseback	995	" I wrote to him , my love , last week , and rather expect to see , than to hear from him again . I earnestly pressed his coming to us , and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow , or any day . "
132069	132093	132062	132062	She	88	" He comes from Mr. Pratt 's purposely to see us . I WILL be calm ; I WILL be mistress of myself . "
132526	132533	132512	132512	herself	88	" Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple ? "
132534	132538	132539	132539	he	1014	" At Longstaple ! "
132549	132558	132539	132539	he	1014	" No , my mother is in town . "
132559	132563	132565	132565	Elinor	88	" I meant , "
132575	132582	132565	132565	Elinor	88	" to inquire for Edward 's wife "
132617	132631	132599	132599	He	1014	" Perhaps you mean — my brother — you mean Robert 's wife . "
132632	132635	132640	132641	her mother	338	" Mrs. Robert Ferrars!"—was
132723	132752	132753	132753	His	1014	" Perhaps you do not know — you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to — to the youngest — to Miss Lucy Steele . "
132790	132793	132795	132795	he	1014	" Yes , "
132797	132810	132795	132795	he	1014	" they were married last week , and are now at Dawlish . "
133385	133397	133399	133399	he	93	" It was a foolish , idle inclination on my side , "
133401	133773	133399	133399	he	93	" the consequence of ignorance of the world — and want of employment . Had my brother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the care of Mr. Pratt , I think — nay , I am sure , it would never have happened ; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought , at the time , a most unconquerable preference for his niece , yet had I then had any pursuit , any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months , I should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment , especially by mixing more with the world , as in such case I must have done . But instead of having any thing to do , instead of having any profession chosen for me , or being allowed to chuse any myself , I returned home to be completely idle ; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment , which belonging to the university would have given me ; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen . I had therefore nothing in the world to do , but to fancy myself in love ; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable , as I had no friend , no companion in my brother , and disliked new acquaintance , it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple , where I always felt myself at home , and was always sure of a welcome ; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen : Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging . She was pretty too — at least I thought so THEN ; and I had seen so little of other women , that I could make no comparisons , and see no defects . Considering everything , therefore , I hope , foolish as our engagement was , foolish as it has since in every way been proved , it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly . "
134434	134439	134428	134428	She	88	" THAT was exactly like Robert,"—was
134442	134445	134446	134446	he	143	observation.—"And THAT , "
134450	134488	134446	134446	he	143	" might perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between them first began . And Lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour . Other designs might afterward arise . "
134626	134629	134617	134617	He	143	" DEAR SIR ,
134630	134814	134617	134617	He	143	" Being very sure I have long lost your affections , I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another , and have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to think I might be with you ; but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another 's . Sincerely wish you happy in your choice , and it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends , as our near relationship now makes proper . I can safely say I owe you no ill - will , and am sure you will be too generous to do us any ill offices . Your brother has gained my affections entirely , and as we could not live without one another , we are just returned from the altar , and are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks , which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see , but thought I would first trouble you with these few lines , and shall always remain ,
134815	134827	134617	134617	He	143	" Your sincere well - wisher , friend , and sister , "
134831	134867	134617	134617	He	143	" I have burnt all your letters , and will return your picture the first opportunity . Please to destroy my scrawls — but the ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep . "
134877	134890	134617	134617	He	143	" I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition , "
134892	134972	134617	134617	He	143	Edward.—"For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOU in former days.—In a sister it is bad enough , but in a wife!—how I have blushed over the pages of her writing!—and I believe I may say that since the first half year of our foolish — business — this is the only letter I ever received from her , of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style . "
134973	134981	134983	134983	Elinor	88	" However it may have come about , "
134987	135084	134617	134617	He	143	pause,—"they are certainly married . And your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment . The independence she settled on Robert , through resentment against you , has put it in his power to make his own choice ; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a - year , to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do . She will hardly be less hurt , I suppose , by Robert 's marrying Lucy , than she would have been by your marrying her . "
135085	135118	134983	134983	Elinor	88	" She will be more hurt by it , for Robert always was her favourite.—She will be more hurt by it , and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner . "
135505	135512	135514	135514	he	93	" I thought it my duty , "
135516	135678	135514	135514	he	93	" independent of my feelings , to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not , when I was renounced by my mother , and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me . In such a situation as that , where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature , how could I suppose , when she so earnestly , so warmly insisted on sharing my fate , whatever it might be , that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement ? And even now , I can not comprehend on what motive she acted , or what fancied advantage it could be to her , to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard , and who had only two thousand pounds in the world . She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living . "
135679	135768	135800	135800	Elinor	88	" No ; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour ; that your own family might in time relent . And at any rate , she lost nothing by continuing the engagement , for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions . The connection was certainly a respectable one , and probably gained her consideration among her friends ; and , if nothing more advantageous occurred , it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single . "
135835	135843	135845	135845	she	88	" Your behaviour was certainly very wrong , "
135847	135882	135845	135845	she	88	" because — to say nothing of my own conviction , our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect WHAT , as you were THEN situated , could never be . "
135905	136041	136042	136042	Elinor	88	" I was simple enough to think , that because my FAITH was plighted to another , there could be no danger in my being with you ; and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour . I felt that I admired you , but I told myself it was only friendship ; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and Lucy , I did not know how far I was got . After that , I suppose , I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex , and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it , were no better than these:—The danger is my own ; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself . "
136096	136101	136103	136103	he	93	Delaford—"Which , at present , "
136105	136129	136103	136103	he	93	" after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion , he must think I have never forgiven him for offering . "
136884	136889	136890	136890	she	103	" I do think , "
136893	137103	136890	136890	she	103	" nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me . Not a soul suspected anything of the matter , not even Nancy , who , poor soul ! came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world;—so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again . And I must say that Lucy 's crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is worse than all . Poor Mr. Edward ! I can not get him out of my head , but you must send for him to Barton , and Miss Marianne must try to comfort him . "
137293	137424	137289	137289	He	85	" Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward 's name , which does not surprise us ; but , to our great astonishment , not a line has been received from him on the occasion . Perhaps , however , he is kept silent by his fear of offending , and I shall , therefore , give him a hint , by a line to Oxford , that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him , addressed perhaps to Fanny , and by her shewn to her mother , might not be taken amiss ; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars 's heart , and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children . "
137461	137468	137470	137470	he	93	" A letter of proper submission ! "
137472	137533	137470	137470	he	93	" would they have me beg my mother 's pardon for Robert 's ingratitude to HER , and breach of honour to ME?—I can make no submission — I am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed.—I am grown very happy ; but that would not interest.—I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make . "
137534	137543	137545	137545	Elinor	88	" You may certainly ask to be forgiven , "
137547	137581	137545	137545	Elinor	88	" because you have offended;—and I should think you might NOW venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother 's anger . "
137588	137619	137620	137620	He	93	" And when she has forgiven you , perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement , almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first . "

But , I confess , it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother . His property here , his place , his house , every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition!—and his woods!—I have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire , as there is now standing in Delaford Hanger!—And though , perhaps , Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him — yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you , for as Colonel Brandon seems a great deal at home , nobody can tell what may happen — for , when people are much thrown together , and see little of anybody else — and it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage , and so forth ; — in short , you may as well give her a chance — You understand me .
