376	412	413	413	He	177	" Yes , this is Mr. Heit speaking — Wallace Upham of Big Bittern . Why , yes , go on , Wallace — young couple drowned — all right , just wait a minute — "
431	435	413	413	He	177	" secretary to the coroner"—"Get
441	447	413	413	He	177	" Then into the telephone : "
712	712	705	705	Wallace	180	"
759	771	744	744	he	180	" You got all that down , did you , Earl ? "
772	777	744	744	he	180	" Yes , sir . "
778	906	744	744	he	180	" Well , you better get your hat and coat and come along with me . We 'll have to catch that 3:10 . You can fill in a few subpoenas on the train . I should say you better take fifteen or twenty — to be on the safe side , and take the names of such witnesses as we can find on the spot . And you better call up Mrs. Heit and say ' taint likely I 'll be home for dinner tonight or much before the down train . We may have to stay up there until tomorrow . You never can tell in these cases how they 're going to turn out and it 's best to be on the safe side . "
966	1018	962	962	himself	183	" I 'm just going in the sheriff 's office a minute , Earl . You 'd better call up the Republican and the Democrat and tell 'em about this , so they wo n't think we 're slightin ' 'em . Then I 'll meet you down at the station . "
1191	1207	1187	1187	she	183	" Hello , Earl . What 's the rush ? Where you going so fast ? "
1208	1241	1187	1187	she	183	" Double drowning up at Big Bittern , we hear . Maybe something worse . Mr. Heit 's going up and I 'm going along . We have to make that 3:10 . "
1242	1253	1187	1187	she	183	" Who said so ? Is it anyone from here ? "
1254	1303	1187	1187	she	183	" Do n't know yet , but do n't think so . There was a letter in the girl 's pocket addressed to some one in Biltz , Mimico County , a Mrs. Alden . I 'll tell you when we get back or I 'll telephone you . "
1304	1323	1187	1187	she	183	" My goodness , if it 's a crime , Mr. Mason'll be interested , wo n't he ? "
1324	1384	1187	1187	she	183	" Sure , I 'll telephone him , or Mr. Heit will . If you see Bud Parker or Karel Badnell , tell 'em I had to go out of town , and call up my mother for me , will you , Zillah , and tell her , too . I 'm afraid I wo n't have time . "
1385	1392	1187	1187	she	183	" Sure I will , Earl . "
1393	1396	1187	1187	she	183	" Thanks . "
1838	1867	1880	1880	he	553	" Why , the pore little thing ! She do n't seem to weigh more'n nothin' at all . It 's a wonder tuh me she coulda sunk . "
1931	1958	1927	1927	he	553	" I do declare , Joe ! Looka here . It does look like the child mighta been hit by somethin' ! Looka here , Joe ! "
2026	2057	1981	1981	Roberta	195	" Well , it looks kinda queer — them marks — an ' all,—don't it ? It 's curious a boat like that coulda upset on a day like yesterday . "
2058	2071	1981	1981	Roberta	195	" We 'll soon know if he 's down there or not ! "
2458	2474	2422	2422	he	564	" Grass Lake Inn , Grass Lake , N. Y. , Jack Evans , Prop . "
3502	3504	3537	3537	he	640	" Howdy "
3508	3523	3537	3537	he	640	" How do you do ? How far is it to Three Mile Bay ? "
3529	3534	3525	3525	they	620	" About seven mile . "
3745	3747	3713	3733	a youth of somewhat the same description and carrying a bag , but wearing a cap — not a straw hat	654	" Cygnus "
4921	4927	4909	4909	he	185	" Well , Colonel Heit ? "
4928	4967	4968	4968	Heit	207	" Well , Orville , I 'm just back from Big Bittern . It looks to me as though I 've got a case for you now that 's going to take quite a little of your time . "
4990	4998	5000	5002	the district attorney	517	" You mean that drowning up there ? "
5004	5012	5014	5015	the coroner	602	" Yes , sir . Just that , "
5017	5031	4909	4909	he	185	" You 've some reason for thinking there 's something wrong up there ? "
5032	5056	5057	5057	Heit	207	" Well , the truth is , Orville , I think there 's hardly a doubt that this is a case of murder . "
5064	5274	5057	5057	Heit	207	" Of course , it 's best to be on the safe side , and I 'm only telling you this in confidence , because even yet I 'm not absolutely positive that that young man 's body may not be in the lake . But it looks mighty suspicious to me , Orville . There 's been at least fifteen men up there in row - boats all day yesterday and to - day , dragging the south part of that lake . I had a number of the boys take soundings here and there , and the water ai n't more than twenty - five feet deep at any point . But so far they have n't found any trace of him . They brought her up about one o'clock yesterday , after they 'd been only dragging a few hours , and a mighty pretty girl she is too , Orville — quite young — not more than eighteen or twenty , I should say . But there are some very suspicious circumstances about it all that make me think that he ai n't in there . In fact , I never saw a case that I thought looked more like a devilish crime than this . "
5327	5340	5341	5341	he	709	" Well , this does look rather suspicious , do n't it ? "
5348	5374	5341	5341	he	709	" You say they have n't found him yet . Well , have you communicated with this woman to see what she knows about it ? "
5375	5384	5386	5386	Heit	207	" No , Orville , I have n't , "
5392	5591	5386	5386	Heit	207	" And I 'll tell you why . The fact is , I decided up there last night that this was something I had better talk over with you before I did anything at all . You know what the political situation here is just now . And how the proper handling of a case like this is likely to affect public opinion this fall . And while I certainly do n't think we ought to mix politics in with crime there certainly is no reason why we should n't handle this in such a way as to make it count in our favor . And so I thought I had better come and see you first . Of course , if you want me to , Orville , I 'll go over there . Only I was thinking that perhaps it would be better for you to go , and find out just who this fellow is and all about him . You know what a case like this might mean from a political point of view , if only we clean it up , and I know you 're the one to do it , Orville . "
5592	5599	5601	5601	Mason	185	" Thanks , Fred , thanks , "
5617	5654	5601	5601	Mason	185	" I 'm grateful to you for your opinion and you 've outlined the very best way to go about it , I think . You 're sure no one outside yourself has seen this letter ? "
5655	5742	5386	5386	Heit	207	" Only the envelope . And no one but Mr. Hubbard , the proprietor of the inn up there , has seen that , and he told me that he found it in her pocket and took charge of it for fear it might disappear or be opened before I got there . He said he had a feeling there might be something wrong the moment he heard of the drowning . The young man had acted so nervous — strange - like , he said . "
5743	5786	5601	5601	Mason	185	" Very good , Fred . Then do n't say anything more about it to any one for the present , will you ? I 'll go right over there , of course . But what else did you find , anything ? "
5812	5817	5819	5820	the coroner	602	" Plenty , plenty , "
5827	5923	5819	5820	the coroner	602	" There were some suspicious cuts or marks under the girl 's right eye and above the left temple , Orville , and across the lip and nose , as though the poor little thing mighta been hit by something — a stone or a stick or one of those oars that they found floating up there . She 's just a child yet , Orville , in looks and size , anyhow — a very pretty girl — but not as good as she might have been , as I 'll show you presently . "
5954	6069	5927	5928	the coroner	602	" I did n't have time to get a doctor up there and besides I 'm going to hold the inquest down here , Monday , if I can . I 've ordered the Lutz boys to go up there to - day and bring her body down . But the most suspicious of all the evidence that has come to light so far , Orville , is the testimony of two men and a boy who live up at Three Mile Bay and who were walking up to Big Bittern on Thursday night to hunt and fish . I had Earl take down their names and subpoena 'em for the inquest next Monday . "
6085	6090	6092	6094	the district attorney	517	" Well , well ! "
6099	6107	6109	6110	the coroner	602	" Then , another thing , Orville , "
6112	6296	6109	6110	the coroner	602	" I had Earl telephone the Three Mile Bay people , the owner of the hotel there as well as the postmaster and the town marshal , but the only person who appears to have seen the young man is the captain of that little steamboat that runs from Three Mile Bay to Sharon . You know the man , I guess , Captain Mooney . I left word with Earl to subpoena him too . According to him , about eight - thirty , Friday morning , or just before his boat started for Sharon on its first trip , this same young man , or some one very much like the description furnished , carrying a suitcase and wearing a cap — he had on a straw hat when those three men met him — came on board and paid his way to Sharon and got off there . Good - looking young chap , the captain says . Very spry and well - dressed , more like a young society man than anything else , and very stand - offish . "
6297	6302	6304	6304	Mason	185	" Yes , yes , "
6306	6519	6520	6520	He	720	" I also had Earl telephone the people at Sharon — whoever he could reach — to see if he had been seen there getting off , but up to the time I left last night no one seemed to remember him . But I left word for Earl to telegraph a description of him to all the resort hotels and stations hereabouts so that if he 's anywhere around , they 'll be on the lookout for him . I thought you 'd want me to do that . But I think you 'd better give me a writ for that bag at Gun Lodge station . That may contain something we ought to know . I 'll go up and get it myself . Then I want to go to Grass Lake and Three Mile Bay and Sharon yet to - day , if I can , and see what else I can find . But I 'm afraid , Orville , it 's a plain case of murder . The way he took that young girl to that hotel up there at Grass Lake and then registered under another name at Big Bittern , and the way he had her leave her bag and took his own with him ! "
6527	6575	6520	6520	He	720	" Those are not the actions of an honest young man , Orville , and you know it . What I ca n't understand is how her parents could let her go off like that anywhere with a man without knowing about him in the first place . "
6576	6581	6583	6583	Mason	185	" That 's true , "
6709	6717	6718	6718	he	720	" Well , I 'll be switched , "
6737	6820	6821	6821	he	720	" I do believe we 're on the trail of something important , Fred . I really think so . It looks very black to me — a most damnable outrage . I suppose the first thing to do , really , is to telephone over there and see if there is such a family as Alden and exactly where they live . It 's not more than fifty miles direct by car , if that much . Poor roads , though , "
6826	6846	6821	6821	he	720	" That poor woman . I dread that scene . It will be a painful one , I know . "
6881	6894	6878	6878	he	720	" The first thing to do will be to get Burton back here "
6916	7017	7018	7018	He	720	" and put him in charge so as to furnish you whatever you need in the way of writs and so on , Fred , while I go right over to see this poor woman . And then , if you 'll have Earl go back up there and get that suitcase , I 'll be most obliged to you . I 'll bring the father back with me , too , to identify the body . But do n't say anything at all about this letter now or my going over there until I see you later , see . "
7026	7031	7032	7032	he	720	" In the meantime , "
7050	7080	7032	7032	he	720	" I want to thank you , Fred . I certainly do , and I wo n't forget it , either . You know that , do n't you ? "
7091	7147	7081	7081	He	720	" This may turn out better than we think . It looks to be the biggest and most important case in all my term of office , and if we can only clean it up satisfactorily and quickly , before things break here this fall , it may do us all some good , eh ? "
7148	7157	7159	7160	Fred Heit	177	" Quite so , Orville , quite so , "
7162	7193	7194	7194	he	720	" Not , as I said before , that I think we ought to mix politics in with a thing like this , but since it has come about so — "
7199	7205	7207	7209	the district attorney	517	" And in the meantime , "
7210	7283	7286	7286	he	720	" if you 'll have Earl have some pictures made of the exact position where the boat , oars , and hat were found , as well as mark the spot where the body was found , and subpoena as many witnesses as you can , I 'll have vouchers for it all put through with the auditor . And to - morrow or Monday I 'll pitch in and help myself . "
7532	7539	7509	7509	Titus	182	" Is this Mr. Titus Alden ? "
7540	7550	7509	7509	Titus	182	" Yes , sir , that 's my name . "
7551	7571	7509	7509	Titus	182	" Mr. Alden , my name is Mason . I am from Bridgeburg , district attorney of Cataraqui County . "
7572	7577	7579	7579	Titus	182	" Yes , sir , "
7673	7677	7679	7679	Mason	185	" Mr. Alden , "
7691	7724	7679	7679	Mason	185	" you are the father of a girl by the name of Bert , or possibly Alberta , are you not ? I 'm not sure that I have the name right . "
7725	7728	7730	7731	Titus Alden	182	" Roberta , "
7777	7799	7748	7748	Mason	185	" By the way , do you happen to know a young man around here by the name of Clifford Golden ? "
7800	7814	7816	7816	Titus	182	" I do n't recall that I ever hard of any such person , "
7820	7825	7748	7748	Mason	185	" Or Carl Graham ? "
7826	7842	7748	7748	Mason	185	" No , sir . No one by that name either that I recall now . "
7843	7848	7850	7850	Mason	185	" I thought so , "
7859	7864	7850	7850	Mason	185	" By the way , "
7870	7877	7850	7850	Mason	185	" where is your daughter now ? "
7878	7912	7913	7913	He	185	" Why , she 's in Lycurgus at present . She works there . But why do you ask ? Has she done anything she shouldn't — been to see you about anything ? "
7932	7939	7941	7941	Mason	185	" One moment , Mr. Alden , "
7951	7973	7975	7975	he	185	" I will explain everything to you in a moment . Just now I want to ask a few necessary questions . "
7983	7996	7975	7975	he	185	" How long has it been since you last saw your daughter ? "
7997	8027	7941	7941	Mason	185	" Why , she left here last Tuesday morning to go back to Lycurgus . She works down there for the Griffiths Collar & Shirt Company . But — ? "
8028	8034	8036	8038	the district attorney	517	" Now , one moment , "
8041	8066	8036	8038	the district attorney	517	" I 'll explain all in a moment . She was up here over the week - end , possibly . Is that it ? "
8067	8080	8082	8082	Titus	182	" She was up here on a vacation for about a month , "
8088	8137	8138	8138	He	182	" She was n't feeling so very good and she came home to rest up a bit . But she was all right when she left . You do n't mean to tell me , Mr. Mason , that anything has gone wrong with her , do you ? "
8158	8169	8170	8170	He	182	" If I thought there was anything like that — ? "
8180	8193	8194	8194	Mason	209	" Have you had any word from her since she left here ? "
8214	8226	8194	8194	Mason	209	" Any information that she was going anywhere but back there ? "
8227	8277	8278	8278	He	182	" No , sir , we have n't . She 's not hurt in any way , is she ? She 's not done anything that 's got her into trouble ? But , no , that could n't be . But your questions ! The way you talk . "
8333	8342	8317	8317	Roberta	195	" Is that the handwriting of your daughter ? "
8343	8353	8355	8355	Titus	182	" Yes , sir , that 's her handwriting , "
8362	8385	8386	8386	He	182	" But what is this , Mr. District Attorney ? How do you come to have that ? What 's in there ? "
8409	8437	8438	8438	He	182	" What is this — this — what has she written in that letter ? You must tell me — if anything has happened to my girl ! "
8498	8550	8472	8472	Mason	209	" Mr. Alden , this is one of those dark times in the lives of some of us when all the courage we have is most needed . I hesitate to tell you because I am a man who has seen something of life and I know how you will suffer . "
8551	8562	8564	8564	Titus	182	" She is hurt . She is dead , maybe , "
8580	8594	8595	8595	His	182	" Roberta ! My first born ! My God ! Our Heavenly Father ! "
8614	8632	8633	8633	He	182	" But how ? Where ? In the factory by a machine ? Oh , dear God ! "
8657	8744	8644	8651	the strong , scar - nosed district attorney	756	" One moment , Mr. Alden , one moment . You must not go to your wife yet . I know this is very hard , terrible , but let me explain . Not in Lycurgus . Not by any machine . No ! No — drowned ! In Big Bittern . She was up there on an outing on Thursday , do you understand ? Do you hear ? Thursday . She was drowned in Big Bittern on Thursday in a boat . It overturned . "
8871	8963	8964	8964	He	759	" My Roberta dead ! My daughter ! Oh , no , no , Roberta ! Oh , my God ! Not drowned ! It ca n't be . And her mother speaking of her only an hour ago . This will be the death of her when she hears it . It will kill me , too . Yes , it will . Oh , my poor , dear , dear girl . My darling ! I 'm not strong enough to stand anything like this , Mr. District Attorney . "
9013	9020	9021	9021	he	759	" Who 's to tell her ? "
9024	9033	9021	9021	he	759	" How is any one to tell her ? "
9034	9040	9042	9042	Mason	185	" But , Mr. Alden , "
9044	9148	9042	9042	Mason	185	" for your own sake , for your wife 's sake , I must ask you now to calm yourself and help me consider this matter as seriously as you would if it were not your daughter . There is much more to this than I have been able to tell you . But you must be calm . You must allow me to explain . This is all very terrible and I sympathize with you wholly . I know what it means . But there are some dreadful and painful facts that you will have to know about . Listen . Listen . "
9196	9244	9245	9245	He	182	" A crime ! A crime , Mr. Alden ! That 's what we think over in Bridgeburg , or at least that 's what we 're afraid of — plain murder , Mr. Alden , to use a hard , cold word in connection with it . "
9278	9425	9274	9274	Mason	185	" And as much as I respect your feelings , still as the chief representative of the law in my county , I felt it to be my personal duty to come here to - day in order to find out whether there is anything that you or your wife or any of your family know about this Clifford Golden , or Carl Graham , or whoever he is who lured your daughter to that lonely lake up there . And while I know that the blackest of suffering is yours right now , Mr. Alden , I maintain that it should be your wish , as well as your duty , to do whatever you can to help us clear up this matter . This letter here seems to indicate that your wife at least knows something concerning this individual — his name , anyhow . "
9787	9794	9795	9795	he	762	" If there is a God , "
9799	9828	9829	9829	he	762	" He will not let such a scoundrel as this go unpunished ! Oh , no , He will not ! ' I have yet to see , ' "
9833	9849	9863	9863	he	762	" ' the children of the righteous forsaken or their seed begging for bread . ' "
9866	9976	9863	9863	he	762	" I must talk to my wife about this right away . Oh , yes , I must . No , no , you wait here . I must tell her first , and alone . I 'll be back . I 'll be back . You just wait here . I know it will kill her . But she must know about this . Maybe she can tell us who this is and then we can catch him before he manages to get too far away . But , oh , my poor girl ! My poor , dear Roberta ! My good , kind , faithful daughter ! "
10124	10137	10083	10084	Mrs. Alden	187	" Titus ! For goodness ' sake ! Whatever is the matter ? "
10165	10168	10227	10228	Mrs. Alden	187	" Roberta ! "
10169	10184	10227	10228	Mrs. Alden	187	" What about her ? What about her ? Titus — what about her ? "
10201	10210	10213	10213	his	784	"Dead ! She 's been — been drowned ! "
10270	10291	10263	10263	his	182	" Quite right . So should it be . Momentary escape for her from the contemplation of this horrible fact . "
10514	10523	10524	10524	He	784	" Is there a doctor anywhere near here ? "
10537	10546	10527	10527	Titus	182	" In Biltz — yes — Dr. Crane . "
10547	10559	10524	10524	He	784	" Have you — has any one around here a telephone ? "
10560	10564	10565	10565	He	784	" Mr. Wilcox . "
10583	10593	10524	10524	He	784	" Just watch her . I 'll be back . "
11309	11319	11326	11327	the intitials	840	" Clifford Golden ! Carl Graham ! Clyde Griffiths ! "
11920	11993	11994	11994	He	182	" I want you to find the scoundrel who did this , Mr. District Attorney . I want him to be made to suffer as this pure , good girl has been made to suffer . She 's been murdered — that 's all . No one but a murderer would take a girl out on a lake like that and strike her as any one can see she has been struck . "
12001	12025	11994	11994	He	182	" I have no money to help prosecute a scoundrel like that . But I will work . I will sell my farm . "
12066	12195	12047	12048	Orville Mason	185	" Come away , Mr. Alden . We know this is your daughter . I swear all you gentlemen as witnesses to this identification . And if it shall be proved that this little girl of yours was murdered , as it now seems , I promise you , Mr. Alden , faithfully and dutifully as the district attorney of this county , that no time or money or energy on my part will be spared to track down this scoundrel and hale him before the proper authorities ! And if the justice of Cataraqui County is what I think it is , you can leave him to any jury which our local court will summon . And you wo n't need to sell your farm , either . "
12259	12278	12241	12241	Ed	224	" That 's the ticket , Orville . You 're the kind of a district attorney we like . "
12286	12307	12280	12281	Everett Beeker	221	" Go to it , Mr. Mason . We 're with you to a man when it comes to that . "
12353	12399	12349	12349	Earl	181	" More power to you , Mr. Mason . We 'll do all we can , you bet . And do n't forget that bag that she left at Gun Lodge is over at your office . I gave it to Burton two hours ago . "
12400	12413	12415	12415	Mason	209	" That 's right , too . I was almost forgetting that , "
12869	12878	12865	12865	Clyde	197	" For Bert from Clyde — Merry Xmas . "
13074	13099	13063	13064	Earl Newcomb	181	" I 'm not positive , Mr. Mason , but that looks to me like the writing on the register up at Big Bittern . "
13106	13119	13103	13103	Mason	209	" Well , it wo n't take long to establish the fact . "
13151	13174	13148	13148	he	209	" Well , Fred , you see it was just as you thought . She did know who she was going with . "
13203	13218	13219	13219	He	209	" But you could n't guess in a thousand years unless I told you . "
13228	13244	13219	13219	He	209	" I do n't doubt it , Orville . I have n't the slightest idea . "
13245	13258	13219	13219	He	209	" Well , you know of Griffiths & Company , of Lycurgus ? "
13259	13265	13219	13219	He	209	" Not the collar people ? "
13266	13273	13219	13219	He	209	" Yes , the collar people . "
13274	13279	13219	13219	He	209	" Not the son . "
13304	13314	13292	13292	His	209	" No , not the son . A nephew ! "
13315	13325	13326	13336	The old , moral - religious , politic - commercial coroner	906	" Nephew ! Of Samuel Griffiths ? Not truly ! "
13344	13429	13292	13292	His	209	" The fact seems to point that way , Fred , now at least . I 'm going down there yet to - night , though , and I hope to know a lot more to - morrow . But this Alden girl — they're the poorest kind of farm people , you know — worked for Griffiths & Company in Lycurgus and this nephew , Clyde Griffiths , as I understand it , is in charge of the department in which she worked . "
13430	13437	13439	13440	the coroner	602	" Tst ! Tst ! Tst ! "
13442	13451	13453	13453	he	209	" She was home for a month — sick "
13458	13500	13501	13501	He	209	" just before she went on this trip last Tuesday . And during that time she wrote him at least ten letters , and maybe more . I got that from the rural delivery man . I have his affidavit here . "
13506	13562	13501	13501	He	209	" All addressed to Clyde Griffiths in Lycurgus . I even have his house number . And the name of the family with whom she lived . I telephoned down there from Biltz . I 'm going to take the old man with me tonight in case anything comes up that he might know about . "
13563	13580	13584	13584	he	209	" Yes , yes , Orville . I understand . I see . But a Griffiths ! "
13590	13604	13608	13608	Mason	185	" But what I want to talk to you about is the inquest , "
13613	13650	13652	13652	he	185	" You know I 've been thinking that it could n't have been just because he did n't want to marry her that he wanted to kill her . That does n't seem reasonable to me , "
13678	13687	13688	13688	Mason	185	" Well , then that means an autopsy , "
13691	13822	13688	13688	Mason	185	" As well as medical opinion as to the nature of those wounds . We 'll have to know beyond a shadow of a doubt , Fred , and before that body is taken away from here , whether that girl was killed before she was thrown out of that boat , or just stunned and then thrown out , or the boat upset . That 's very vital to the case , as you know . We 'll never be able to do anything unless we 're positive about those things . But what about the medical men around here ? Do you think any of them will be able to do all these things in a shipshape way so that what they say will hold water in court . "
13834	13843	13844	13844	Heit	177	" Well , as to that , Orville , "
13848	13912	13844	13844	Heit	177	" I ca n't say exactly . You 'd be a better judge , maybe , than I would . I 've already asked Dr. Mitchell to step over to - morrow and take a look at her . Also Betts . But if there 's any other doctor you 'd rather have — Bavo or Lincoln of Coldwater — how about Bavo ? "
13913	13923	13926	13926	Mason	185	" I 'd rather have Webster , of Utica , "
13928	13951	13926	13926	Mason	185	" or Beemis , or both . Four or five opinions in a case like this wo n't be any too many . "
13969	14019	13953	13953	Heit	177	" Well , I guess you 're right , Orville . Maybe four or five would be better than one or two . That means , though , that the inquest will have to be postponed for a day or two more , till we get these men here . "
14020	14027	14030	14030	Mason	185	" Quite right ! Quite right , "
14032	14177	14030	14030	Mason	185	" but that will be a good thing , too , as long as I 'm going down to Lycurgus to - night to see what I can find out . You never can tell . I may catch up with him . I hope so , anyhow , or if not that , then I may come upon something that 'll throw some extra light on this . For this is going to be a big thing , Fred . I can see that — the most difficult case that ever came my way , or yours , either,—and we ca n't be too careful as to how we move from now on . He 's likely to be rich , you see , and if he is he 'll fight . Besides there 's that family down there to back him up . "
14192	14261	14178	14178	He	908	" Well , that 's all right too . The next thing to do is to get Beemis and Webster of Utica — better wire them to - night , eh , or call them up . And Sprull of Albany , and then , to keep peace in the family around here , perhaps we 'd better have Lincoln and Betts over here . And maybe Bavo . "
14272	14346	14262	14262	He	908	" In the meantime , I 'll be going along , Fred . Arrange to have them come up Monday or Tuesday , instead of to - morrow . I expect to be back by then and if so I can be with you . If you can , better get 'em up here , Monday — see — the quicker the better — and we 'll see what we know by then . "
14764	14818	14820	14820	she	233	" Not Mr. Clyde Griffiths ! Oh , how ridiculous ! Why , he 's the nephew of Mr. Samuel Griffiths and very well known here . I 'm sure they can tell you all about him at their residence , if you must know . But anything like — oh , impossible ! "
14902	14936	14950	14950	she	233	" I am sorry , Madam , but I am compelled to ask you to show us his room . This is a search warrant and this officer is here at my direction . "

25492	25745	25476	25476	he	197	" Bridgeburg , N. Y. , July 9.—The body of an unknown girl , presumably the wife of a young man who registered first on Wednesday morning at Grass Lake Inn , Grass Lake , N. Y. , as Carl Graham and wife , and later , Thursday noon , at Big Bittern Lodge , Big Bittern , as Clifford Golden and wife was taken from the waters of the south end of Big Bittern just before noon yesterday . Because of an upturned boat , as well as a man 's straw hat found floating on the water in Moon Cove , dredging with hooks and lines had been going on all morning ... Up to seven o'clock last evening , however , the body of the man had not as yet been recovered , and according to Coroner Heit of Bridgeburg , who by two o'clock had been summoned to the scene of the tragedy , it was not considered at all likely that it would be . Several marks and abrasions found upon the dead girl 's head and face , as well as the testimony of three men who arrived on the scene while the search was still on and testified to having met a young man who answered to the description of Golden or Graham in the woods to the south of the lake the night before , caused many to conclude that a murder had been committed and that the murderer was seeking to make his escape .
25746	25824	25476	25476	he	197	" The girl 's brown leather traveling bag , as well as a hat and coat belonging to her , were left , the bag in the ticket agent 's room at Gun Lodge , which is the railway station five miles east of Big Bittern , and the hat and coat in the coatroom of the inn at the Lake , whereas Graham or Golden is said to have taken his suitcase with him into the boat .
25825	26037	25476	25476	he	197	" According to the innkeeper at Big Bittern , the couple on their arrival registered as Clifford Golden and wife of Albany . They remained in the inn but a few minutes before Golden walked to the boat - landing just outside and procured a light boat , in which , accompanied by the girl and his suitcase , he went out on the lake . They did not return , and yesterday morning the boat was found bottomside up in what is known as Moon Cove , a small bay or extension at the extreme south end of the lake , from the waters of which soon afterwards the body of the young woman was recovered . As there are no known rocks in the lake at that point , and the wounds upon the face are quite marked , suspicion was at once aroused that the girl might have been unfairly dealt with . This , together with the testimony of the three men , as well as the fact that a man 's straw hat found nearby contained no lining or other method of identification , has caused Coroner Heit to assert that unless the body of the man is found he will assume that murder has been committed .
26038	26129	25476	25476	he	197	" Golden or Graham , as described by innkeepers and guests and guides at Grass Lake and Big Bittern , is not more than twenty - four or twenty - five years of age , slender , dark , and not more than five feet eight or nine inches tall . At the time he arrived he was dressed in a light gray suit , tan shoes , and a straw hat and carried a brown suitcase to which was attached an umbrella and some other object , presumably a cane .
26130	26155	25476	25476	he	197	" The hat and coat left by the girl at the inn were of dark and light tan respectively , her dress a dark blue .
26156	26226	25476	25476	he	197	" Notice has been sent to all railroad stations in this vicinity to be on the lookout for Golden , or Graham , in order that he may be arrested if he is alive and attempts to make his escape . The body of the drowned girl is to be removed to Bridgeburg , the county seat of this county , where an inquest is later to be held . "
28113	28141	28143	28143	Clyde	197	" Whatever matter wissum sweet to - day ? Face all dark . Cantum be happy out here wis Sondra and all these nicey good - baddies ? "
28395	28464	28376	28376	Sondra	238	" How ridiculous , sweetum ! But do n't you mind . I just laughed and agreed because I do n't want to aggravate her just now . But I did ask her how I was to avoid meeting you here or anywhere now since you are as popular as you are . My sweetum is so good - looking . Everybody thinks so — even the boys . "
28544	28570	28516	28517	three assistants	1341	" He has gone to Bear Lake . We must follow and trap him before news reaches him in any way that he is wanted . "
28647	28649	28643	28649	Captain Mooney of the " Cygnus "	210	" Cygnus "
29491	29515	29487	29488	Harley Baggott	259	" Listen to the guys shooting game out of season , will you . It 's against the law , is n't it ? "
29516	29521	29522	29523	Grant Cranston	253	" Hey , you ! "
29526	29538	29522	29523	Grant Cranston	253	" Those are my ducks down there ! Let 'em alone . "
29539	29558	29561	29561	Bertine	252	" If they ca n't shoot any better than you , Granty , they will let 'em alone . "
30045	30058	30037	30038	Harley Baggott	259	" Why , yes , sure . He 's around here somewhere . "
30064	30071	30060	30061	Stuart Finchley	256	" Eh - o , Griffiths ! "
30454	30479	30481	30481	Clyde	197	" Hold on a moment , mister ! Do n't move . Your name do n't happen to be Clyde Griffiths , does it ? "
30586	30589	30581	30581	himself	197	" No ! "
30600	30610	30581	30581	himself	197	" Why , yes , that 's my name . "
30611	30627	30711	30712	Mr. Kraut	290	" You 're with this camping party just west of here , are n't you ? "
30628	30636	30581	30581	himself	197	" Yes , sir , I am . "
30637	30707	30711	30712	Mr. Kraut	290	" All right , Mr. Griffiths . Excuse the revolver . I 'm told to get you , whatever happens , that 's all . My name is Kraut . Nicholas Kraut . I 'm a deputy sheriff of Cataraqui County . And I have a warrant here for your arrest . I suppose you know what for , and that you 're prepared to come with me peaceably . "
30736	30747	30749	30749	Clyde	197	" Why — why — no — I do n't , "
30761	30789	30755	30755	his	197	" But if you have a warrant for my arrest , I 'll go with you , certainly . But what — what — I do n't understand "
30800	30810	30798	30798	he	197	this—"is — is why you want to arrest me ? "
30811	30840	30798	30798	he	197	" You do n't , eh ? You were n't up at either Big Bittern or Grass Lake by any chance on last Wednesday or Thursday , eh ? "
30841	30852	30854	30854	Clyde	197	" Why , no , sir , I was n't , "
30858	30895	30798	30798	he	197	" And you do n't happen to know anything about the drowning of a girl up there that you were supposed to be with — Roberta Alden , of Biltz , New York , I believe . "
30896	30904	30906	30906	Clyde	197	" Why , my God , no ! "
30952	30962	30963	30963	he	1436	" Am I supposed to have committed a murder ? "
30974	30997	30998	30999	Mr. Kraut	290	" Then you do n't know that she was drowned last Thursday ? And you were n't with her at that time ? "
31011	31023	31025	31025	Clyde	197	" Why , no , of course , I was n't , "
31052	31077	30998	30999	Mr. Kraut	290	" And you did n't meet three men walking south last Thursday night from Big Bittern to Three Mile Bay at about eleven o'clock ? "
31078	31101	30998	30999	Mr. Kraut	290	" Why , no , sir . Of course I did n't . I was n't up there , I told you . "
31102	31143	31144	31144	He	197	" Very well , Mr. Griffiths , I have n't anything more to say . All I 'm supposed to do is to arrest you , Clyde Griffiths , for the murder of Roberta Alden . You 're my prisoner . "
31182	31193	31194	31194	he	197	" You need n't put those on me , mister , "
31197	31221	31194	31194	he	197	" I wish you would n't . I never had anything like that on before . I 'll go with you without them . "
31249	31255	31257	31259	the redoubtable Kraut	290	" Very well , then , "
31261	31270	31272	31272	he	197	" So long as you come along peaceful . "
31283	31294	31296	31296	Clyde	197	" Do you mind if I ask you something else , "
31344	31360	31322	31322	Sondra	238	" Are you , are you intending to take me to that camp back there ? "
31361	31398	31322	31322	Sondra	238	" Yes , sir , that 's where I 'm intending to take you now . Them 's my orders . That 's where the district attorney and the sheriff of Cataraqui County are just now . "
31399	31408	31410	31410	Clyde	197	" Oh , I know , I know , "
31424	31515	31417	31417	he	197	" but could n't you — couldn't you — so long as I go along just as you want — those are all my friends , you know , back there , and I 'd hate ... couldn't you just take me around the camp somewhere to wherever you want to take me ? I have a very special reason — that is — I — I , oh , God , I hope you wo n't take me back there right now — will you please , Mr. Kraut ? "
31632	31735	31618	31618	he	1443	" Very well , young man , I do n't want to be too hard on you . After all , I 'm not the sheriff or the district attorney — just the arresting officer . There are others down there who are going to be able to say what to do about you — and when we get down to where they are , you can ask 'em , and it may be that they wo n't find it necessary to take you back in there . But how about your clothes ? They 're back there , ai n't they ? "
31736	31747	31749	31749	Clyde	197	" Oh , yes , but that does n't matter , "
31755	31779	31749	31749	Clyde	197	" I can get those any time . I just do n't want to go back now , if I can help it . "
31780	31789	31791	31792	Mr. Kraut	290	" All right , then , come along , "
32313	32323	32287	32287	he	197	" A delightful place for a camp , eh ? "
32324	32331	32287	32287	he	197	" Yeh , we think so . "
32332	32347	32287	32287	he	197	" Just a group from the estates and hotels about Sharon , I suppose ? "
32348	32358	32287	32287	he	197	" Yeh . The south and west shore principally . "
32359	32374	32287	32287	he	197	" Not any of the Griffiths , other than Mr. Clyde , I presume ? "
32375	32388	32287	32287	he	197	" No , they 're still over at Greenwood , I think . "
32389	32400	32287	32287	he	197	" You know Mr. Clyde Griffiths personally , I suppose ? "
32401	32413	32287	32287	he	197	" Oh , sure — he 's one of the party . "
32414	32442	32287	32287	he	197	" You do n't happen to know how long he 's been up here this time , I presume — up with the Cranstons , I mean . "
32443	32472	32474	32474	Baggott	259	" Since Friday , I think . I saw him Friday morning , anyhow . But he 'll be back here soon and you can ask him yourself , "
32519	32525	32503	32504	Frank Harriet	249	" Where to , Frankie ? "
32526	32539	32598	32598	Mason	209	" To try those courts Harrison laid out up here this morning . "
32540	32544	32503	32504	Frank Harriet	249	" Who with ? "
32545	32552	32598	32598	Mason	209	" Violet , Nadine and Stuart . "
32553	32560	32503	32504	Frank Harriet	249	" Any room for another court ? "
32561	32583	32598	32598	Mason	209	" Sure , there 's two . Why not get Bert , and Clyde , and Sondra , and come up ? "
32584	32596	32503	32504	Frank Harriet	249	" Well , maybe , after I get this thing set . "
32668	32679	32665	32665	Bertine	252	" Oh , say , Harley , seen Nadine anywhere ? "
32680	32707	32665	32665	Bertine	252	" No , but Frank just went by . He said he was going up to the courts to play with her and Violet and Stew . "
32708	32732	32665	32665	Bertine	252	" Yes ? Well , then , come on , Sondra . You too , Wynette . We 'll see how it looks . "
32848	32864	32842	32842	Sondra	238	" If you see Clyde , tell him to come on up , will you ? "
32869	32882	32866	32866	he	209	" Do you think that shadow of yours needs to be told ? "
33160	33170	33111	33111	he	209	" So you are Clyde Griffiths , are you ? "
33171	33176	33111	33111	he	209	" Yes , sir . "
33177	33224	33111	33111	he	209	" Well , Mr. Griffiths , my name is Orville Mason . I am the district attorney of the county in which Big Bittern and Grass Lake are situated . I suppose you are familiar enough with those two places by now , are n't you ? "
33264	33277	33249	33249	Clyde	197	" No , sir , I ca n't say that I am . "
33528	33543	33511	33511	he	209	" You know what you are charged with , Mr. Griffiths , of course . "
33544	33558	33584	33584	his	197	" Yes , sir , I just heard it from this man here . "
33559	33565	33511	33511	he	209	" And you admit it ? "
33566	33580	33582	33582	Clyde	197	" Why , no sir , of course I do n't admit it , "
33609	33634	33511	33511	he	209	" Why , what nonsense ! What effrontery ! You deny being up to Grass Lake and Big Bittern on last Wednesday and Thursday ? "
33635	33640	33511	33511	he	209	" Yes , sir . "
33641	33646	33649	33649	Mason	185	" Well , then , "
33663	33790	33651	33651	himself	185	" I suppose you are going to deny knowing Roberta Alden — the girl you took to Grass Lake , and then out on Big Bittern in that boat last Thursday — the girl you knew in Lycurgus all last year , who lived at Mrs. Gilpin 's and worked under you in your department at Griffiths & Company — the girl to whom you gave that toilet set last Christmas ! I suppose you 're going to say that your name is n't Clyde Griffiths and that you have n't been living with Mrs. Peyton in Taylor Street , and that these are n't letters and cards from your trunk there — from Roberta Alden and from Miss Finchley , all these cards and notes . "
33991	34020	34258	34258	his	1494	" My name 's Clyde Griffiths all right , but the rest of this is n't true . I do n't know anything about the rest of it . "
34021	34253	34258	34258	his	1494	" Oh , come now , Mr. Griffiths ! Do n't begin by trying to play fast and loose with me . We wo n't get anywhere that way . You wo n't help yourself one bit by that with me , and besides I have n't any time for that now . Remember these men here are witnesses to what you say . I 've just come from Lycurgus — your room at Mrs. Peyton's — and I have in my possession your trunk and this Miss Alden 's letters to you — indisputable proof that you did know this girl , that you courted and seduced her last winter , and that since then — this spring — when she became pregnant on your account , you induced her first to go home and then later to go away with you on this trip in order , as you told her , to marry her . Well , you married her all right — to the grave — that 's how you married her — to the water at the bottom of Big Bittern Lake ! And you can actually stand here before me now , when I tell you that I have all the evidence I need right on my person , and say that you do n't even know her ! Well , I 'll be damned ! "
34335	34340	34331	34331	he	1494	" Yes , sir . "
34341	34349	34351	34351	Mason	185	" Well , I 'll be damned ! "
34353	34448	34351	34351	Mason	185	" I can well believe now that you would kill a girl and sneak away in just such a way as you did — and with her in that condition ! But then to try to deny her own letters to you ! Why , you might as well try to deny that you 're here and alive . These cards and notes here — what about them ? I suppose they 're not from Miss Finchley ? How about those ? Do you mean to tell me these are not from her either ? "
34483	34496	34458	34458	Clyde	197	" No , I do n't deny that those are from her . "
34497	34519	34449	34449	He	185	" Very good . But these others from your trunk in the same room are not from Miss Alden to you ? "
34520	34531	34532	34532	he	197	" I do n't care to say as to that , "
34546	34557	34559	34559	Mason	185	" Tst ! Tst ! Tst ! Of all things , "
34564	34683	34686	34686	he	1496	" Such nonsense ! Such effrontery ! Oh , very well , we wo n't worry about all that now . I can easily prove it all when the time comes . But how you can stand there and deny it , knowing that I have the evidence , is beyond me ! A card in your own handwriting which you forgot to take out of the bag you had her leave at Gun Lodge while you took yours with you . Mr. Carl Graham , Mr. Clifford Golden , Mr. Clyde Griffiths,—a card on which you wrote ' From Clyde to Bert , Merry Xmas . ' Do you remember that ? Well , here it is . "
34710	34722	34686	34686	he	1496	" Have you forgotten that , too ? Your own handwriting ! "
34734	34780	34686	34686	he	1496	" Why , what a dunce you are ! — what a poor plotter , without even the brains not to use your own initials in getting up those fake names you had hoped to masquerade under — Mr. Carl Graham — Mr. Clifford Golden ! "
34858	34869	34870	34870	he	197	" You see , it 's this way , Griffiths , "
34880	35193	34870	34870	he	197	" Lying or just foolish thoughtless denial under such circumstances as these ca n't help you in the least . It can only harm you , and that 's the truth . You may think I 've been a little rough so far , but it was only because I 've been under a great strain myself in connection with this case , trying to catch up with some one I thought would be a very different type from yourself . But now that I see you and see how you feel about it all — how really frightened you are by what has happened — it just occurs to me that there may be something in connection with this case , some extenuating circumstances , which , if they were related by you now , might throw a slightly different light on all this . Of course , I do n't know . You yourself ought to be the best judge , but I 'm laying the thought before you for what it 's worth . For , of course , here are these letters . Besides , when we get to Three Mile Bay to - morrow , as we will , I hope , there will be those three men who met you the other night walking south from Big Bittern . And not only those , but the innkeeper from Grass Lake , the innkeeper from Big Bittern , the boatkeeper up there who rented that boat , and the driver who drove you and Roberta Alden over from Gun Lodge . They will identify you . Do you think they wo n't know you — not any of them — not be able to say whether you were up there with her or not , or that a jury when the time comes wo n't believe them ? "
35215	35221	35224	35224	Mason	185	" And not only that , "
35232	35353	35224	35224	Mason	185	" but there 's Mrs. Peyton . She saw me take these letters and cards out of that trunk of yours in your room and from the top drawer of your chiffonier . Next , there are all those girls in that factory where you and Miss Alden worked . Do you suppose they 're not going to remember all about you and her when they learn that she is dead ? Oh , what nonsense ! You ought to be able to see that for yourself , whatever you think . You certainly ca n't expect to get away with that . It makes a sort of a fool out of you . You can see that for yourself . "
35388	35704	35383	35383	Mason	185	" All right , Griffiths , I 'm now going to tell you one more thing , and I could n't give you better advice if you were my own son or brother and I were trying to get you out of this instead of merely trying to get you to tell the truth . If you hope to do anything at all for yourself now , it 's not going to help you to deny everything in the way you are doing . You are simply making trouble and condemning yourself in other people 's eyes . Why not say that you did know her and that you were up there with her and that she wrote you those letters , and be done with it ? You ca n't get out of that , whatever else you may hope to get out of . Any sane person — your own mother , if she were here — would tell you the same thing . It 's too ridiculous and indicates guilt rather than innocence . Why not come clean here and now as to those facts , anyhow , before it 's too late to take advantage of any mitigating circumstances in connection with all this — if there are any ? And if you do now , and I can help you in any way , I promise you here and now that I 'll be only too glad to do so . For , after all , I 'm not out here just to hound a man to death or make him confess to something that he has n't done , but merely to get at the truth in the case . But if you 're going to deny that you even knew this girl when I tell you I have all the evidence and can prove it , why then — "
35827	35847	35818	35818	Mason	185	" Oh , very well , then . So you 've finally decided not to talk , have you ? "
35857	35875	35849	35849	Clyde	197	" I had nothing to do with her death . That 's all I can say now , "
36026	36035	36017	36017	he	197	" Then you admit that you knew her ? "
36036	36041	36017	36017	he	197	" No , sir . "
36042	36048	36049	36049	he	197	" Very well , then , "
36058	36134	36049	36049	he	197	" I suppose there 's nothing for it but to take him back there and see what they know about him . Perhaps that will get something out of this fine bird — to confront him with his friends . His bag and things are still back there in one of those tents , I believe . Suppose we take him down there , gentlemen , and see what these other people know about him . "
36159	36191	36145	36145	Clyde	197	" Oh , please , no ! You do n't mean to do that , do you ? Oh , you wo n't do that ! Oh , please , no ! "
36202	36224	36196	36196	Kraut	289	" He asked me back there in the woods if I would n't ask you not to take him in there . "
36225	36240	36242	36242	Mason	185	" Oh , so that 's the way the wind blows , is it ? "
36246	36314	36242	36242	Mason	185	" Too thin - skinned to be shown up before ladies and gentlemen of the Twelfth Lake colony , but not even willing to admit that you knew the poor little working - girl who worked for you . Very good . Well , then , my fine friend , suppose you come through with what you really do know now , or down there you go . "
36328	36358	36316	36316	he	185	" We 'll call all those people together and explain just how things are , and then see if you will be willing to stand there and deny everything ! "
36372	36379	36368	36368	he	185	" Bring him along , boys . "
36415	36489	36410	36410	he	185	" Oh , please , no ! Oh , I hope you wo n't do anything like that , will you , Mr. Mason ? Oh , I do n't want to go back there if you do n't mind . It is n't that I 'm guilty , but you can get all my things without my going back there . And besides it will mean so much to me just now . "
36509	36518	36520	36520	Mason	209	" Do n't want to go , eh ? "
36528	36590	36520	36520	Mason	209	" It would hurt your pride , would it , to have 'em know ? Well , then , supposing you just answer some of the things I want to know — and come clean and quick , or off we go — and that without one more moment 's delay ! Now , will you answer or wo n't you ? "
36615	36894	36597	36597	Clyde	197	" Of course I knew her . Of course I did . Sure ! Those letters show that . But what of it ? I did n't kill her . And I did n't go up there with her with any intention of killing her , either . I did n't . I did n't , I tell you ! It was all an accident . I did n't even want to take her up there . She wanted me to go — to go away with her somewhere , because — because , well you know — her letters show . And I was only trying to get her to go off somewhere by herself , so she would let me alone , because I did n't want to marry her . That 's all . And I took her out there , not to kill her at all , but to try to persuade her , that 's all . And I did n't upset the boat — at least , I did n't mean to . The wind blew my hat off , and we — she and I — got up at the same time to reach for it and the boat upset — that 's all . And the side of it hit her on the head . I saw it , only I was too frightened the way she was struggling about in the water to go near her , because I was afraid that if I did she might drag me down . And then she went down . And I swam ashore . And that 's the God 's truth ! "
36984	37012	36976	36976	Mason	209	" Now , let 's see as to this a minute . You say you did n't take her up there with any intention of killing her ? "
37013	37022	36976	36976	Mason	209	" No , sir , I did n't . "
37023	37053	36976	36976	Mason	209	" Well , then , how was it that you decided to write your name two different ways on those registers up there at Big Bittern and Grass Lake ? "
37054	37072	36976	36976	Mason	209	" Because I did n't want any one to know that I was up there with her . "
37073	37093	36976	36976	Mason	209	" Oh , I see . Did n't want any scandal in connection with the condition she was in ? "
37094	37106	36976	36976	Mason	209	" No , sir . Yes , sir , that is . "
37107	37125	36976	36976	Mason	209	" But you did n't mind if her name was scandalized in case she was found afterwards ? "
37126	37139	37141	37141	Clyde	197	" But I did n't know she was going to be drowned , "
37153	37177	36976	36976	Mason	209	" But you did know that you yourself were n't coming back , of course . You knew that , did n't you ? "
37178	37201	36976	36976	Mason	209	" Why , no , sir , I did n't know that I was n't coming back . I thought I was . "
37202	37209	37211	37211	Mason	209	" Pretty clever . Pretty clever , "
37225	37266	37211	37211	Mason	209	" And so in order to make everything easy and natural as possible for you to come back , you took your own bag with you and left hers up there . Is that the way ? How about that ? "
37267	37289	36976	36976	Mason	209	" But I did n't take it because I was going away . We decided to put our lunch in it . "
37290	37296	37211	37211	Mason	209	" We , or you ? "
37297	37300	36976	36976	Mason	209	" We . "
37301	37337	37211	37211	Mason	209	" And so you had to carry that big bag in order to take a little lunch along , eh ? Could n't you have taken it in a paper , or in her bag ? "
37338	37358	36976	36976	Mason	209	" Well , her bag was full , and I did n't like to carry anything in a paper . "
37359	37411	37211	37211	Mason	209	" Oh , I see . Too proud and sensitive , eh ? But not too proud to carry a heavy bag all the way , say twelve miles , in the night to Three Mile Bay , and not ashamed to be seen doing it , either , were you ? "
37412	37441	36976	36976	Mason	209	" Well , after she was drowned and I did n't want to be known as having been up there with her , and had to go along — "
37599	37667	37594	37594	he	1505	" Oh , well , I tell you , Griffiths , we 'll let you rest here for the present . It may be that what you are saying is so — I do n't know . I most certainly hope it is , for your sake . At any rate , you go along there with Mr. Kraut . He 'll show you where to go . "
37679	37772	37676	37676	he	1505	" All right , boys . I 'll tell you how we 'll do . It 's getting late and we 'll have to hurry a little if we expect to get anywhere yet tonight . Mr. Kraut , suppose you take this young man down where those other two boats are and wait there . Just halloo a little as you go along to notify the sheriff and Sissel that we 're ready . And then Swenk and I 'll be along in the other boat as soon as we can . "
38084	38124	38081	38081	she	238	" I do n't believe a word of it ! It 's not true ! Why , it could n't be ! That poor boy ! Oh , Clyde ! Where is he ? Where have they taken him ? "
38422	38427	38419	38419	she	238	" endure this place , "
38729	38737	38698	38698	Clyde	197	" But was n't it thoroughly soaked ? "
38738	38741	38698	38698	Clyde	197	" Yes . "
38742	38755	38698	38698	Clyde	197	" Well , then , where was it cleaned and pressed afterward ? "
38756	38760	38698	38698	Clyde	197	" In Sharon . "
38761	38765	38698	38698	Clyde	197	" In Sharon ? "
38766	38771	38698	38698	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . "
38772	38778	38698	38698	Clyde	197	" By a tailor there ? "
38779	38784	38698	38698	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . "
38785	38789	38698	38698	Clyde	197	" What tailor ? "
38797	38815	38698	38698	Clyde	197	" Then you wore it crumpled and wet , did you , from Big Bittern to Sharon ? "
38816	38821	38698	38698	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . "
38822	38832	38698	38698	Clyde	197	" And no one noticed it , of course . "
38833	38841	38698	38698	Clyde	197	" Not that I remember — no . "
38842	38859	38864	38864	Clyde	197	" Not that you remember , eh ? Well , we 'll see about that later , "
38976	39007	39064	39064	Clyde	197	" That straw hat of yours that you say the wind blew in the water ? You did n't try to get that either at the time , did you ? "
39008	39013	39064	39064	Clyde	197	" No , sir . "
39014	39028	39064	39064	Clyde	197	" Did n't think of it , I suppose , in the excitement ? "
39029	39034	39064	39064	Clyde	197	" No , sir . "
39035	39062	39064	39064	Clyde	197	" But just the same , you had another straw hat when you went down through the woods there . Where did you get that one ? "
39130	39140	39148	39148	Mason	209	" But I did n't have another straw hat . "
39176	39193	39148	39148	Mason	209	" This one has a lining , I see . Bought this in Lycurgus , eh ? "
39194	39199	39250	39250	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . "
39200	39203	39148	39148	Mason	209	" When ? "
39204	39211	39250	39250	Clyde	197	" Oh , back in June . "
39212	39233	39148	39148	Mason	209	" But still you 're sure now it 's not the one you wore down through the woods that night ? "
39234	39239	39250	39250	Clyde	197	" No , sir . "
39240	39248	39148	39148	Mason	209	" Well , where was it then ? "
39326	39332	39334	39334	Mason	209	" Where was it then ? "
39342	39375	39337	39337	Clyde	197	" Oh , I was up here once before and wore it then . I forgot it when I went down the last time but I found it again the other day . "
39376	39389	39390	39390	He	197	" Oh , I see . Very convenient , I must say . "
39750	39770	39735	39736	some natives	1563	" We hear the feller that killed the girl over to Big Bittern is here — is that right ? "
40047	40071	40089	40089	his	197	" There he is , the dirty bastard ! You 'll swing for this yet , you young devil , wait and see ! "
40134	40156	40158	40158	Clyde	197	" Lookit , the dirty little sneak — the murderer ! You thought you 'd get away with it , didnja ? "
40933	40944	40921	40921	himself	4144	" Well , Griffiths , how are you this morning ? "
40947	40957	40921	40921	himself	4144	" Hello , anything we can do for you ? "
41162	41202	41157	41159	the five doctors	1616	" An injury to the mouth and nose ; the tip of the nose appears to have been slightly flattened , the lips swollen , one front tooth slightly loosened , and an abrasion of the mucous membrane within the lips"—all
41245	41250	41157	41159	the five doctors	1616	" some sharp instrument , "
41267	41280	41157	41159	the five doctors	1616	" signs of fracture and internal haemorrhage which might have produced death . "
41609	41612	41602	41602	Kraut	290	" playing up "
41654	41669	41727	41727	Clyde	197	" never would get a jury to believe that you did n't do it , "
41673	41725	41639	41639	Kraut	290	" if you would talk right out to Mason , he could do more for you with the judge and the governor than any one could — get you off , maybe , with life or twenty years , while this way you 're likely to get the chair , sure . "
42030	42036	41981	41992	the boatman who had seen Clyde drop his bag into the boat	1634	" yellow bundle of sticks , "
43772	43787	43761	43761	she	195	" And to think that she is dead . I ca n't believe it . "
43797	43996	43792	43793	her mother	752	" Only Monday a week ago she was about — a little depressed , I thought , but smiling , and for some reason which I thought odd at the time went all over the place Monday afternoon and evening , looking at things and gathering some flowers . And then she came over and put her arms around me and said : ' I wish I were a little girl again , Mamma , and that you would take me in your arms and rock me like you used to . ' And I said , ' Why , Roberta , what makes you so sad to - night , anyhow ? ' And she said , ' Oh , nothing . You know I 'm going back in the morning . And somehow I feel a little foolish about it to - night . ' And to think that it was this trip that was in her mind . I suppose she had a premonition that all would not work out as she had planned . And to think he struck my little girl , she who never could harm anything , not even a fly . "
44211	44217	44219	44219	Samuel	216	" Very well , then , "
44221	44248	44219	44219	Samuel	216	" Do n't act hastily , and above all , do n't talk to anyone outside of Smillie or Gotboy until I see you . Where 's Brookhart?"—referring
44260	44269	44271	44272	his son	1713	" He 's in Boston to - day , "
44274	44294	44271	44272	his son	1713	" I think he told me last Friday that he would n't be back here until Monday or Tuesday . "
44295	44357	44219	44219	Samuel	216	" Well , wire him that I want him to return at once . Incidentally , have Smillie see if he can arrange with the editors of The Star and Beacon down there to suspend any comment until I get back . I 'll be down in the morning . Also tell him to get in the car and run up there "
44361	44420	44271	44272	his son	1713	" to - day if he can . I must know from first hand all there is to know . Have him see Clyde if he can , also this district attorney , and bring down any news that he can get . And all the newspapers . I want to see for myself what has been published . "
44660	44686	44653	44653	his	767	" There , there ! For heaven 's sake , what 's happened to my little girl now ? Who 's done what and why ? "
44837	45045	45046	45046	He	1727	" Well , well , of all things ! Well , I 'll be damned ! I am amazed , my dear ! I am astounded ! This is a little too much , I must say . Accused of murder ! And with letters of yours in your own handwriting , you say , in his possession , or in the hands of this district attorney , for all we know by now . Tst ! Tst ! Tst ! Damned foolish , Sondra , damned foolish ! Your mother has been talking to me for months about this , and you know I was taking your word for it against hers . And now see what 's happened ! Why could n't you have told me or listened to her ? Why could n't you have talked all this over with me before going so far ? I thought we understood each other , you and I. Your mother and I have always acted for your own good , have n't we ? You know that . Besides , I certainly thought you had better sense . Really , I did . But a murder case , and you connected with it ! My God ! "
45090	45169	45081	45081	he	1727	" But , there , there ! There 's no use crying over it . Crying is n't going to fix it . Of course , we may be able to live it down in some way . I do n't know . I do n't know . I ca n't guess what effect this is likely to have on you personally . But one thing is sure . We do want to know something about those letters . "
45273	45280	45283	45283	Atterbury	310	" Well , let me see , "
45285	45412	45283	45283	Atterbury	310	" I would n't worry very much if I were you , Mr. Finchley . I think I can do something to straighten this out for you before any real public damage is done . Now , let me see . Who is the district attorney of Cataraqui County , anyhow ? I 'll have to look that up and get in touch with him and call you back . But never mind , I promise you I 'll be able to do something — keep the letters out of the papers , anyhow . Maybe out of the trial — I'm not sure — but I am sure I can fix it so that her name will not be mentioned , so do n't worry . "
46090	46101	46085	46085	he	308	" Why , how do you do , Mr. Smillie ? "
46113	46133	46104	46105	the latter	760	" Why , hello , Clyde , certainly sorry to see you tied up in a place like this . "
46138	46277	46104	46105	the latter	760	" The papers and the district attorney over here are full of a lot of stuff about some trouble you 're in , but I suppose there ca n't be much to it — there must be some mistake , of course . And that 's what I 'm up here to find out . Your uncle telephoned me this morning that I was to come up and see you to find out how they come to be holding you . Of course , you can understand how they feel down there . So they wanted me to come up and get the straight of it so as to get the charge dismissed , if possible — so now if you 'll just let me know the ins and outs of this — you know — that is — "
46331	46455	46319	46319	Clyde	197	" I suppose things do look pretty bad for me , Mr. Smillie . I did n't think at the time that I met Miss Alden that I would ever get into such a scrape as this . But I did n't kill her , and that 's the God 's truth . I never even wanted to kill her or take her up to that lake in the first place . And that 's the truth , and that 's what I told the district attorney . I know he has some letters from her to me , but they only show that she wanted me to go away with her — not that I wanted to go with her at all — "
46492	46506	46472	46472	Smillie	308	" Yes , I know . He was just showing them to me . "
46507	46513	46515	46515	Clyde	197	" I knew he would , "
46519	46531	46532	46532	his	1758	" But you know how it is sometimes , Mr. Smillie , "
46551	46666	46532	46532	his	1758	" A man can get in a jam with a girl when he never even intended to at first . You know that yourself . I did like Roberta at first , and that 's the truth , and I did get in with her just as those letters show . But you know that rule they have down there , that no one in charge of a department can have anything to do with any of the women under him . Well , that 's what started all the trouble for me , I guess . I was afraid to let any one know about it in the first place , you see . "
46667	46673	46686	46686	he	1760	" Oh , I see . "
46773	46814	46766	46766	Mason	209	" But what about those two hats , Clyde ? This man over here was telling me that you admit to having two straw hats — the one found on the lake and the one you wore away from there . "
46830	46854	46816	46816	Clyde	197	" But they 're wrong as to my wearing a straw hat away from there , Mr. Smillie , it was a cap . "
46855	46876	47104	47104	Smillie	308	" I see . But still you did have a straw hat up at Bear Lake , he tells me . "
46877	46924	46816	46816	Clyde	197	" Yes , I had one there , but as I told him , that was the one I had with me when I went up to the Cranstons ' the first time . I told him that . I forgot it and left it there . "
46925	46969	47104	47104	Smillie	308	" Oh , I see . But now there was something about a suit — a gray one , I believe — that he says you were seen wearing up there but that he ca n't find now ? Were you wearing one ? "
46970	47000	46816	46816	Clyde	197	" No . I was wearing the blue suit I had on when I came down here . They 've taken that away now and given me this one . "
47001	47044	47104	47104	Smillie	308	" But he says that you say you had it dry - cleaned at Sharon but that he ca n't find any one there who knows anything about it . How about that ? Did you have it dry - cleaned there ? "
47045	47050	46816	46816	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . "
47051	47055	47104	47104	Smillie	308	" By whom ? "
47056	47089	46816	46816	Clyde	197	" Well , I ca n't just remember now . But I think I can find the man if I were to go up there again — he 's near the depot , "
47296	47302	47285	47285	Smillie	308	" Oh , I see , "
47305	47310	47285	47285	Smillie	308	" To be sure , "
47312	47323	47285	47285	Smillie	308	" That 's the way it was , was it ? "
47478	47668	47456	47456	Smillie	308	" Well , I 'm afraid I 'll have to be going now , Clyde . The roads are pretty bad between here and Sharon . But I 've been mighty glad to hear your side of it . And I 'll present it to your uncle just as you have told it to me . But in the meantime , if I were you , I would n't do any more talking than I could help — not until you hear further from me . I was instructed to find an attorney up here to handle this case for you , if I could , but since it 's late and Mr. Brookhart , our chief counsel , will be back to - morrow , I think I 'll just wait until I can talk to him . So if you 'll take my advice , you 'll just not say anything until you hear from him or me . Either he 'll come or he 'll send some one — he'll bring a letter from me , whoever he is , and then he 'll advise you . "
47789	47819	47773	47774	Gilbert Griffiths	305	" Why , the little devil ! The little beast ! But what did I tell you , Dad ? Did n't I warn you against bringing him on ? "
48239	48245	48247	48247	Gilbert	305	" For God 's sake , "
48249	48264	48247	48247	Gilbert	305	" has n't he anything better than that to offer , the little fool ! "
48293	48298	48301	48301	Samuel	216	" Dreadful ! Dreadful ! "
48303	48335	48301	48301	Samuel	216	" I really ca n't grasp it yet . I ca n't ! It does n't seem possible that any one of my blood could be guilty of such a thing ! "
48460	48563	48452	48452	Griffiths	305	" Well , it does look bad , I must say . Still , in the face of what you tell me , I ca n't find it in me to condemn completely without more knowledge than we have here . There may be some other facts not as yet come to light — he wo n't talk , you say , about most things — some little details we do n't know about — some slight excuse of some kind — for without that this does appear to be a most atrocious crime . Has Mr. Brookhart got in from Boston ? "
48564	48573	48575	48575	Gilbert	305	" Yes , sir , he 's here , "
48577	48583	48575	48575	Gilbert	305	" He telephoned Mr. Smillie . "
48584	48838	48885	48885	Gilbert	305	" Well , have him come out here at two this afternoon to see me . I 'm too tired to talk more about this right now . Tell him all that you have told me , Smillie . And then come back here with him at two . It may be that he will have some suggestion to make that will be of value to us , although just what I ca n't see . Only one thing I want to say — I hope he is n't guilty . And I want every proper step taken to discover whether he is or not , and if not , to defend him to the limit of the law . But no more than that . No trying to save anybody who is guilty of such a thing as this — no , no , no!—not even if he is my nephew ! Not me ! I 'm not that kind of a man ! Trouble or no trouble — disgrace or no disgrace — I'll do what I can to help him if he 's innocent — if there 's even the faintest reason for believing so . But guilty ? No ! Never ! If this boy is really guilty , he 'll have to take the consequences . Not a dollar — not a penny — of my money will I devote to any one who could be guilty of such a crime , even if he is my nephew ! "
50551	50564	50548	50548	He	209	" allowed any grass to grow under his feet , you bet . "
51917	51921	51927	51927	Catchuman	314	" heart to heart "
52278	52421	52274	52274	he	324	" Come , come , Clyde ! This will never do . You must n't give up like this . Your case may n't be as hopeless as you think . Would n't you like to sit up and talk to a lawyer fellow who thinks he might be able to do something for you ? Belknap is my name — Alvin Belknap . I live right here in Bridgeburg and I have been sent over by that other fellow who was here a while ago — Catchuman , was n't that his name ? You did n't get along with him so very well , did you ? Well , I did n't either . He 's not our kind , I guess . But here 's a letter from him authorizing me to represent you . Want to see it ? "
52490	52497	52507	52507	his	324	" There , I thought so , "
52521	52722	52511	52511	he	324	" That 's better . I know we 're going to get along . I can feel it . You are going to be able to talk to me as easily and truthfully as you would to your mother . And without any fear that any word of anything you ever tell me is going to reach another ear , unless you want it to , see ? For I 'm going to be your lawyer , Clyde , if you 'll let me , and you 're going to be my client , and we 're going to sit down together to - morrow , or whenever you say so , and you 're going to tell me all you think I ought to know , and I 'm going to tell you what I think I ought to know , and whether I 'm going to be able to help you . And I 'm going to prove to you that in every way that you help me , you 're helping yourself , see ? And I 'm going to do my damnedest to get you out of this . Now , how 's that , Clyde ? "
53321	53747	53312	53312	his	324	" Well , that 'll be enough of this for to - day , Clyde , I think . I see how you felt and how it all came about — also I see how tired you are , and I 'm mighty glad you 've been able to give me the straight of this , because I know how hard it 's been for you to do it . But I do n't want you to talk any more now . There are going to be other days , and I have a few things I want to attend to before I take up some of the minor phases of this with you to - morrow or next day . Just you sleep and rest for the present . You 'll need all you can get for the work both of us will have to do a little later . But just now , you 're not to worry , because there 's no need of it , do you see ? I 'll get you out of this — or we will — my partner and I. I have a partner that I 'm going to bring around here presently . You 'll like him , too . But there are one or two things that I want you to think about and stick to — and one of these is that you 're not to let anybody frighten you into anything , because either myself or my partner will be around here once a day anyhow , and anything you have to say or want to know you can say or find out from us . Next you 're not to talk to anybody — Mason , the sheriff , these jailers , no one — unless I tell you to . No one , do you hear ! And above all things , do n't cry any more . For if you are as innocent as an angel , or as black as the devil himself , the worst thing you can do is to cry before any one . The public and these jail officers do n't understand that — they invariably look upon it as weakness or a confession of guilt . And I do n't want them to feel any such thing about you now , and especially when I know that you 're really not guilty . I know that now . I believe it . See ! So keep a stiff upper lip before Mason and everybody .
53748	53932	53312	53312	his	324	" In fact , from now on I want you to try and laugh a little — or at any rate , smile and pass the time of day with these fellows around here . There 's an old saying in law , you know , that the consciousness of innocence makes any man calm . Think and look innocent . Do n't sit and brood and look as though you had lost your last friend , because you have n't . I 'm here , and so is my partner , Mr. Jephson . I 'll bring him around here in a day or two , and you 're to look and act toward him exactly as you have toward me . Trust him , because in legal matters he 's even smarter than I am in some ways . And to - morrow I 'm going to bring you a couple of books and some magazines and papers , and I want you to read them or look at the pictures . They 'll help keep your mind off your troubles . "
53944	54055	53941	53941	his	197	" From now on , too,—I do n't know whether you 're at all religious — but whether you are or not , they hold services here in the jail on Sundays , and I want you to attend 'em regularly — that is , if they ask you to . For this is a religious community and I want you to make as good an impression as you can . Never mind what people say or how they look — you do as I tell you . And if this fellow Mason or any of those fellows around here get to pestering you any more , send me a note .
54056	54090	54105	54105	he	197	" And now I 'll be going , so give me a cheerful smile as I go out — and another one as I come in . And do n't talk , see ? "
54114	54334	54105	54105	he	197	" But do I really believe that this fellow is as innocent as he says ? Would it be possible for a fellow to strike a girl like that and not know that he was doing it intentionally ? And then swimming away afterwards , because , as he says , if he went near her he thought he might drown too . Bad . Bad ! What twelve men are going to believe that ? And that bag , those two hats , that missing suit ! And yet he swears he did n't intentionally strike her . But what about all that planning — the intent — which is just as bad in the eyes of the law . Is he telling the truth or is he lying even now — perhaps trying to deceive himself as well as me ? And that camera — we ought to get hold of that before Mason finds it and introduces it . And that suit . I ought to find that and mention it , maybe , so as to offset the look of its being hidden — say that we had it all the time — send it to Lycurgus to be cleaned . But no , no — wait a minute — I must think about that . "
54635	54654	54620	54620	he	197	" But he was n't in such a state when he went out there with her , though ? "
54655	54658	55203	55203	his	320	" No . "
54659	54667	54620	54620	he	197	" Nor when he swam away afterwards ? "
54668	54671	55203	55203	his	320	" No . "
54672	54694	54620	54620	he	197	" Nor when he went through those woods , or changed to another suit and hat , or hid that tripod ? "
54695	54698	55203	55203	his	320	" No . "
54699	54742	54620	54620	he	197	" Of course you know , constructively , in the eyes of the law , if we use his own story , he 's just as guilty as though he had struck her , and the judge would have to so instruct . "
54743	54756	55203	55203	his	320	" Yes , I know . I 've thought of all that . "
54757	54762	54620	54620	he	197	" Well , then — "
54763	54861	54862	54862	He	1942	" Well , I 'll tell you , Jephson , it 's a tough case and no mistake . It looks to me now as though Mason has all the cards . If we can get this chap off , we can get anybody off . But as I see it , I 'm not so sure that we want to mention that cataleptic business yet — at least not unless we want to enter a plea of insanity or emotional insanity , or something like that — about like that Harry Thaw case , for instance . "
54872	54882	54884	54884	Jephson	320	" You think he 's guilty , of course ? "
54888	55188	55228	55228	Belknap	323	" Well , now , as astonishing as it may seem to you , no . At least , I 'm not positive that I do . To tell you the truth , this is one of the most puzzling cases I have ever run up against . This fellow is by no means as hard as you think , or as cold — quite a simple , affectionate chap , in a way , as you 'll see for yourself — his manner , I mean . He 's only twenty - one or two . And for all his connections with these Griffiths , he 's very poor — just a clerk , really . And he tells me that his parents are poor , too . They run a mission of some kind out west — Denver , I believe — and before that in Kansas City . He has n't been home in four years . In fact , he got into some crazy boy scrape out there in Kansas City when he was working for one of the hotels as a bell - boy , and had to run away . That 's something we 've got to look out for in connection with Mason — whether he knows about that or not . It seems he and a bunch of other bell - hops took some rich fellow 's car without his knowing it , and then because they were afraid of being late , they ran over and killed a little girl . We 've got to find out about that and prepare for it , for if Mason does know about it , he 'll spring it at the trial , and just when he thinks we 're least expecting it . "
55189	55199	55201	55201	Jephson	320	" Well , he wo n't pull that one , "
55212	55226	55203	55203	his	320	" not if I have to go to Kansas City to find out . "
55329	55347	55349	55349	Jephson	320	" And notwithstanding all that , you feel a doubt as to whether he did kill her ? "
55358	55453	55456	55456	Belknap	323	" Yes , as I say , I 'm not at all sure that he did . But I do know that he is still hipped over this second girl . His manner changed whenever he or I happened to mention her . Once , for instance , I asked him about his relations with her — and in spite of the fact that he 's accused of seducing and killing this other girl , he looked at me as though I had said something I should n't have — insulted him or her . "
55483	55489	55490	55490	he	320	" You do n't say , "
55494	55500	55503	55503	Belknap	323	" And not only that , "
55505	55628	55503	55503	Belknap	323	" but he said , ' Why , no , of course not . She would n't allow anything like that , and besides , ' and then he stopped . ' And besides what , Clyde , ' I asked . ' Well , you do n't want to forget who she is . ' ' Oh , I see , ' I said . And then , will you believe it , he wanted to know if there was n't some way by which her name and those letters she wrote him could n't be kept out of the papers and this case — her family prevented from knowing so that she and they would n't be hurt too much . "
55629	55640	55503	55503	Belknap	323	" Not really ? But what about the other girl ? "
55641	55748	55503	55503	Belknap	323	" That 's just the point I 'm trying to make . He could plot to kill one girl and maybe even did kill her , for all I know , after seducing her , but because he was being so sculled around by his grand ideas of this other girl , he did n't quite know what he was doing , really . Do n't you see ? You know how it is with some of these young fellows of his age , and especially when they 've never had anything much to do with girls or money , and want to be something grand . "
55749	55761	55764	55764	Jephson	320	" You think that made him a little crazy , maybe ? "
55766	55842	55503	55503	Belknap	323	" Well , it 's possible — confused , hypnotized , loony — you know — a brain storm as they say down in New York . But he certainly is still cracked over that other girl . In fact , I think most of his crying in jail is over her . He was crying , you know , when I went in to see him , sobbing as if his heart would break . "
55850	55908	55911	55911	he	323	" But just the same , there certainly is something to this other idea — that his mind was turned by all this — that Alden girl forcing him on the one hand to marry her while the other girl was offering to marry him . I know . I was once in such a scrape myself . "
55919	55924	55925	55925	he	323	" By the way , "
55929	55954	55925	55925	he	323	" he says we can find that item about that other couple drowning in The Times - Union of about June 18th or 19th . "
55955	55959	55961	55961	Jephson	320	" All right , "
55963	55969	55961	55961	Jephson	320	" I 'll get it . "
55970	55981	55983	55983	Belknap	323	" What I want you to do to - morrow , "
55985	56029	55983	55983	Belknap	323	" is to go over there with me and see what impression you get of him . I 'll be there to see if he tells it all to you in the same way . I want your own individual viewpoint of him . "
56030	56038	56040	56040	Jephson	320	" You most certainly will get it , "
56333	56351	56353	56353	Jephson	320	" Of course , you know that those letters which Miss Alden wrote you are very strong ? "
56362	56367	56322	56322	Belknap	323	" Yes , sir . "
56368	56410	56322	56322	Belknap	323	" They 're very sad to any one who does n't know all of the facts , and on that account they are likely to prejudice any jury against you , especially when they 're put alongside Miss Finchley 's letters . "
56411	56419	56421	56421	Clyde	197	" Yes , I suppose they might , "
56423	56458	56421	56421	Clyde	197	" but then , she was n't always like that , either . It was only after she got in trouble and I wanted her to let me go that she wrote like that . "
56459	56497	56498	56498	he	197	" I know . I know . And that 's a point we want to think about and maybe bring out , if we can . If only there were some way to keep those letters out , "
56511	56538	56498	56498	he	197	" but what I want to ask you now is this — you were close to her for something like a year , were n't you ? "
56539	56542	56421	56421	Clyde	197	" Yes . "
56543	56582	56498	56498	he	197	" In all of that time that you were with her , or before , was she ever friendly , or maybe intimate , with any other young man anywhere — that is , that you know of ? "
56675	56700	56672	56672	he	197	" No , sir . I never heard of her going with any one else . In fact , I know she did n't . "
56701	56709	56711	56711	Jephson	320	" Very good ! That settles that , "
56713	56752	56711	56711	Jephson	320	" I judged from her letters that what you say is true . At the same time , we must know all the facts . It might make a very great difference if there were some one else . "
56820	56825	56828	56828	Jephson	320	" Well , then , "
56853	56901	56828	56828	Jephson	320	" here 's something else I want to ask you . In all the time that you knew her , either before you were intimate with her or afterwards , did she ever write you a mean or sarcastic or demanding or threatening letter of any kind ? "
56902	56916	56918	56918	Clyde	197	" No , sir , I ca n't say that she ever did , "
56920	56948	56918	56918	Clyde	197	" in fact , I know she did n't . No , sir . Except for those few last ones , maybe — the very last one . "
56949	56960	56828	56828	Jephson	320	" And you never wrote her any , I suppose ? "
56961	56973	56918	56918	Clyde	197	" No , sir , I never wrote her any letters . "
56974	56977	56828	56828	Jephson	320	" Why ? "
56978	57010	56918	56918	Clyde	197	" Well , she was right there in the factory with me , you see . Besides at the last there , after she went home , I was afraid to . "
57011	57015	56828	56828	Jephson	320	" I see . "
57150	57165	57127	57127	he	197	" So you really loved that Miss Finchley very much then , did you ? "
57166	57171	57127	57127	he	197	" Yes , sir . "
57172	57187	57127	57127	he	197	" And you could n't care for Roberta any more after you met her ? "
57188	57198	57127	57127	he	197	" No , no . I just could n't . "
57199	57203	57205	57205	Jephson	320	" I see , "
57294	57334	57290	57290	he	197	" You say something came over you when you were in the boat out there with her on that last day — that you really did n't know what you were doing at the time that you struck her ? "
57335	57345	57348	57348	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir , that 's the truth . "
57364	57375	57377	57377	Jephson	320	" All right , all right , I believe you , "
57394	57421	57422	57422	he	320	" But you know , of course , that no jury , in the face of all these other circumstances , is going to believe that , "
57426	57459	57460	57460	He	320	" There are too many things that 'll have to be explained and that we ca n't very well explain as things now stand . I do n't know about that idea . "
57468	57510	57511	57511	he	320	" Those two hats , that bag — unless we 're going to plead insanity or something like that . I 'm not so sure about all this . Was there ever any insanity in your family that you know of ? "
57521	57532	57511	57511	he	320	" No , sir , not that I know of . "
57533	57551	57511	57511	he	320	" No uncle or cousin or grandfather who had fits or strange ideas or anything like that ? "
57552	57564	57511	57511	he	320	" Not that I ever heard of , no , sir . "
57565	57598	57511	57511	he	320	" And your rich relatives down there in Lycurgus — I suppose they 'd not like it very much if I were to step up and try to prove anything like that ? "
57599	57611	57613	57613	Clyde	197	" I 'm afraid they would n't , no , sir , "
57619	57626	57629	57629	Jephson	320	" Well , let me see , "
57634	57656	57629	57629	Jephson	320	" That makes it rather hard . I do n't see , though , that anything else would be as safe . "
57746	57773	57775	57775	Belknap	323	" But what about his own story that the wind had blown his hat off , and in trying to save that he upset the boat ? "
57786	57837	57775	57775	Belknap	323	" Well , that 's true enough , too , but could n't we say that perhaps , since he was morally responsible for her condition , which in turn had caused her to take her life , he did not want to confess to the truth of her suicide ? "
57888	57904	57906	57906	Belknap	323	" But the false registrations ! The two hats — the suit — his bag ! "
57923	57943	57945	57945	Jephson	320	" Well , whatever theory we advance , those things will have to be accounted for in some way , "
57949	57993	57994	57994	He	197	" We ca n't admit the true story of his plotting without an insanity plea , not as I see it — at any rate . And unless we use that , we 've got that evidence to deal with whatever we do . "
58018	58021	58023	58023	Belknap	323	" But , "
58025	58078	58079	58079	he	323	" in the face of all that , and his refusal to marry her , after his promises referred to in her letters — why , it would only react against him , so that public opinion would be more prejudiced against him than ever . No , that wo n't do , "
58082	58100	58079	58079	he	323	" We 'll have to think of something which will create some sort of sympathy for him . "
58127	58134	58137	58137	Jephson	320	" You are a problem indeed . "
58141	58185	58186	58186	He	320	" And , oh , yes , that suit you dropped in that lake up there near the Cranstons ' — describe the spot to me as near as you can where you threw it — how far from the house was it ? "
58209	58224	58295	58295	he	323	" If I could go up there , I could find it quick enough . "
58225	58245	58246	58246	he	197	" Yes , I know , but they wo n't let you go up there without Mason being along , "
58249	58285	58295	58295	he	323	" And maybe not even then . You 're in prison now , and you ca n't be taken out without the state 's consent , you see . But we must get that suit . "
58298	58328	58295	58295	he	323	" We want to get it and have it cleaned and submit it as having been sent away to be cleaned by him — not hidden , you see . "
58329	58336	58338	58338	Belknap	323	" Yes , that 's so , "
58361	58439	58295	58295	he	323	" And now in regard to that camera that fell in the lake — we have to try and find that , too . I think maybe Mason may know about it or suspect that it 's there . At any rate it 's very important that we should find it before he does . You think that about where that pole was that day you were up there is where the boat was when it overturned ? "
58440	58445	58295	58295	he	323	" Yes , sir . "
58446	58458	58459	58459	he	323	" Well , we must see if we can get that , "
58466	58518	58459	58459	he	323	" We do n't want that turning up in the trial , if we can help it . For without that , they 'll have to be swearing that he struck her with that tripod or something that he did n't , and that 's where we may trip 'em up . "
58519	58528	58530	58530	Belknap	323	" Yes , that 's true , too , "
58532	58586	58459	58459	he	323	" And now in regard to the bag that Mason has . That 's another thing I have n't seen yet , but I will see it to - morrow . Did you put that suit , as wet as it was , in the bag when you came out of the water ? "
58587	58641	58295	58295	he	323	" No , sir , I wrung it out first . And then I dried it as much as I could . And then I wrapped it up in the paper that we had the lunch in and then put some dry pine needles underneath it in the bag and on top of it "
58642	58665	58459	58459	he	323	" So there were n't any wet marks in the bag after you took it out , as far as you know ? "
58666	58677	58295	58295	he	323	" No , sir , I do n't think so . "
58678	58685	58459	58459	he	323	" But you 're not sure ? "
58686	58700	58295	58295	he	323	" Not exactly sure now that you ask me — no , sir . "
58701	58742	58459	58459	he	323	" Well , I 'll see for myself to - morrow . And now as to those marks on her face , you have never admitted to any one around here or anywhere that you struck her in any way ? "
58743	58748	58295	58295	he	323	" No , sir . "
58749	58770	58459	58459	he	323	" And the mark on the top of her head was made by the boat , just as you said ? "
58771	58776	58295	58295	he	323	" Yes , sir . "
58777	58791	58459	58459	he	323	" But the others you think you might have made with the camera ? "
58792	58802	58295	58295	he	323	" Yes , sir . I suppose they were . "
58803	58817	58819	58819	Jephson	320	" Well , then , this is the way it looks to me , "
58826	58889	58890	58890	he	323	" I think we can safely say when the time comes that those marks were never made by him at all , see?—but by the hooks and the poles with which they were scraping around up there when they were trying to find her . We can try it , anyhow . And if the hooks and poles did n't do it , "
58899	58922	58890	58890	he	323	" certainly hauling her body from that lake to that railroad station and from there to here on the train might have . "
58923	58943	58945	58945	Belknap	323	" Yes , I think Mason would have a hard time proving that they were n't made that way , "
58947	59005	59021	59021	he	320	" And as for that tripod , well , we 'd better exhume the body and make our own measurements , and measure the thickness of the edge of that boat , so that it may not be so easy for Mason to make any use of the tripod now that he has it , after all . "

59434	59443	59445	59447	the sturdy Jephson	1964	" I want to tell you one thing ! "
59461	59565	59445	59447	the sturdy Jephson	1964	" These letters of this Alden girl are the toughest things we 're going to have to face . They 're likely to make any jury cry if they 're read right , and then to introduce those letters from that other girl on top of these would be fatal . It will be better , I think , if we do not mention hers at all , unless he does . It will only make it look as though he had killed that Alden girl to get rid of her . Mason could n't want anything better , as I see it . "
59786	59792	59794	59794	Belknap	323	" All well and good , "
59796	59832	59794	59794	Belknap	323	" But that involves his refusing to marry her , does n't it ? And what jury is going to sympathize with him for that or believe that he did n't want to kill her ? "
59833	59842	59844	59844	Jephson	320	" Wait a minute , wait a minute , "
59850	59876	59844	59844	Jephson	320	" So far it does . Sure . But you have n't heard me to the end yet . I said I had a plan . "
59877	59886	59888	59888	Belknap	323	" All right , then what is it ? "
59892	59968	59971	59971	he	323	" Well , I 'll tell you — my plan 's this — to leave all the facts just as they are , and just as he tells them , and just as Mason has discussed them so far , except , of course , his striking her — and then explain them — the letters , the wounds , the bag , the two hats , everything — not deny them in any way . "
60008	60016	60018	60018	Belknap	323	" All very good , but how ? "
60020	60031	60037	60037	himself	320	" There 's no other way , I tell you , "
60044	60053	60054	60054	He	323	" and I think this will do it . "
60073	60142	60145	60145	he	323	" He goes up there , you see , because he 's frightened and because he has to do something or be exposed . And he signs those registers just as he did because he 's afraid to have it known by anybody down there in Lycurgus that he is up there . And he has this plan about confessing to her about this other girl . but , "
60153	60244	60145	60145	he	323	" and this is the keystone of the whole thing — if this wo n't hold water , then down we go ! Listen ! He goes up there with her , frightened , and not to marry her or to kill her but to argue with her to go away . But once up there and he sees how sick she is , and tired , and sad — well , you know how much she still loves him , and he spends two nights with her , see ? "
60245	60251	60253	60253	Belknap	323	" Yes , I see , "
60264	60272	60253	60253	Belknap	323	" And that might explain those nights . "
60273	60278	60280	60280	Jephson	320	" Might ? Would ! "
60311	60333	60336	60336	his	320	" Well , while he 's up there with her under those conditions — so close to her again , you see "
60348	60397	60336	60336	his	320	" he experiences a change of heart . You get me ? He 's sorry for her . He 's ashamed of himself — his sin against her . That ought to appeal to these fellows around here , these religious and moral people , ought n't it ? "
60398	60402	60405	60405	Belknap	323	" It might , "
60419	60430	60432	60432	Jephson	320	" He sees that he 's done her a wrong , "
60448	60512	60432	60432	Jephson	320	" and in spite of all his affection for this other girl , he 's now ready to do the right thing by this Alden girl , do you see , because he 's sorry and ashamed of himself . That takes the black look off his plotting to kill her while spending those two nights in Utica and Grass Lake with her . "
60513	60523	60525	60525	Belknap	323	" He still loves the other girl , though ? "
60527	60594	60525	60525	Belknap	323	" Well , sure . He likes her at any rate , has been fascinated by that life down there and sort of taken out of himself , made over into a different person , but now he 's ready to marry Roberta , in case , after telling her all about this other girl and his love for her , she still wants him to . "
60595	60620	60432	60432	Jephson	320	" I see . But how about the boat now and that bag and his going up to this Finchley girl 's place afterwards ? "
60621	60637	60639	60639	Jephson	320	" Just a minute ! Just a minute ! I 'll tell you about that , "
60653	60826	60639	60639	Jephson	320	" Of course , he goes out in the boat with her , and of course he takes that bag , and of course he signs those registers falsely , and walks away through those woods to that other girl , after Roberta is drowned . But why ? Why ? Do you want to know why ? I 'll tell you ! He felt sorry for her , see , and he wanted to marry her , or at least he wanted to do the right thing by her at the very last there . Not before , not before , remember , but after he had spent a night with her in Utica and another one in Grass Lake . But once she was drowned — and accidentally , of course , as he says , there was his love for that other girl . He had n't ceased loving her even though he was willing to sacrifice her in order to do the right thing by Roberta . See ? "
60827	60831	60432	60432	Jephson	320	" I see . "
60832	60859	60639	60639	Jephson	320	" And how are they going to prove that he did n't experience a change of heart if he says he did and sticks to it ? "
60860	60875	60877	60877	Belknap	323	" I see , but he 'll have to tell a mighty convincing story , "
60883	60900	60877	60877	Belknap	323	" And how about those two hats ? They 're going to have to be explained . "
60901	61009	61010	61010	he	323	" Well , I 'm coming to those now . The one he had was a little soiled . And so he decided to buy another . As for that story he told Mason about wearing a cap , well , he was frightened and lied because he thought he would have to get out of it . Now , of course , before he goes to that other girl afterwards — while Roberta is still alive , I mean , there 's his relationship with the other girl , what he intends to do about her . He 's talking to Roberta , now you see , "
61013	61083	61010	61010	he	323	" and that has to be disposed of in some way . But , as I see it , that 's easy , for of course after he experiences a change of heart and wants to do the right thing by Roberta , all he has to do is to write that other girl or go to her and tell her — about the wrong he has done Roberta . "
61084	61087	60639	60639	Jephson	320	" Yes . "
61088	61123	61010	61010	he	323	" For , as I see it now , she ca n't be kept out of the case entirely , after all . We 'll have to ring her in , I 'm afraid . "
61124	61133	61135	61135	Belknap	323	" All right ; then we have to , "
61137	61194	61010	61010	he	323	" Because you see , if Roberta still feels that he ought to marry her — he'll go first and tell that Finchley girl that he ca n't marry her — that he 's going away — that is , if Roberta does n't object to his leaving her that long , do n't you see ? "
61195	61198	61010	61010	he	323	" Yes . "
61199	61219	61010	61010	he	323	" If she does , he 'll marry her , either at Three Mile Bay or some other place . "
61220	61223	61010	61010	he	323	" Yes . "
61224	61293	61010	61010	he	323	" But you do n't want to forget that while she 's still alive he 's puzzled and distressed . And it 's only after that second night , at Grass Lake , that he begins to see how wrong all his actions have been , you understand . Something happens . Maybe she cries or talks about wanting to die , like she does in those letters . "
61294	61297	61010	61010	he	323	" Yes . "
61298	61326	61010	61010	he	323	" And so he wants a quiet place where they can sit down in peace and talk , where no one else will see or hear them . "
61327	61335	61010	61010	he	323	" Yes , yes — go on . "
61336	61384	61010	61010	he	323	" Well , he thinks of Big Bittern . He 's been up there once before or they 're near there , then , and just below there , twelve miles , is Three Mile Bay , where , if they decide to marry , they can . "
61385	61389	61010	61010	he	323	" I see . "
61390	61431	61010	61010	he	323	" If not , if she does n't want to marry him after his full confession , he can row her back to the inn , ca n't he , and he or she can stay there or go on . "
61432	61437	61010	61010	he	323	" Yes , yes . "
61438	61530	61010	61010	he	323	" In the meantime , not to have any delay or be compelled to hang about that inn — it 's rather expensive , you know , and he has n't any too much money — he takes that lunch in his bag . Also his camera , because he wants to take some pictures . For if Mason should turn up with that camera , it 's got to be explained , and it will be better explained by us than it will be by him , wo n't it ? "
61531	61538	61540	61540	Belknap	323	" I see , I see , "
61556	61565	61010	61010	he	323	" So they go out on the lake . "
61566	61569	61010	61010	he	323	" Yes . "
61570	61576	61010	61010	he	323	" And they row around . "
61577	61580	61010	61010	he	323	" Yes . "
61581	61593	61010	61010	he	323	" And finally after lunch on shore , some pictures taken — "
61594	61597	61010	61010	he	323	" Yes . "
61598	61617	61010	61010	he	323	" He decides to tell her just how things stand with him . He 's ready , willing — "
61618	61623	61010	61010	he	323	" I get you . "
61624	61651	61010	61010	he	323	" Only just before doing that , he wants to take one or two more pictures of her there in the boat , just off shore . "
61652	61655	61010	61010	he	323	" Yes . "
61656	61666	61010	61010	he	323	" And then he 'll tell her , see ? "
61667	61670	61010	61010	he	323	" Yes . "
61671	61693	61010	61010	he	323	" And so they go out in the boat again for a little row , just as he did , see ? "
61694	61697	61010	61010	he	323	" Yes . "
61698	61725	61010	61010	he	323	" But because they intend to go ashore again for some flowers , he 's left the bag there , see ? That explains the bag . "
61726	61729	61010	61010	he	323	" Yes . "
61730	61798	61010	61010	he	323	" But before taking any more pictures there , in the boat on the water , he begins to tell her about his love for this other girl — that if she wants him to , now he 'll marry her and then write this Sondra a letter . Or , if she feels she does n't want to marry him with him loving this other girl ... "
61799	61805	61807	61807	Belknap	323	" Yes , go on ! "
61811	61814	61816	61816	Jephson	320	" Well , "
61818	61846	61816	61816	Jephson	320	" he 'll do his best to take care of her and support her out of the money he 'll have after he marries the rich girl . "
61847	61850	61010	61010	he	323	" Yes . "
61851	61866	61010	61010	he	323	" Well , she wants him to marry her and drop this Miss Finchley ! "
61867	61871	61010	61010	he	323	" I see . "
61872	61877	61010	61010	he	323	" And he agrees ? "
61878	61881	61010	61010	he	323	" Sure . "
61882	61907	61010	61010	he	323	" Also she 's so grateful that in her excitement , or gratitude , she jumps up to come toward him , you see ? "
61908	61911	61010	61010	he	323	" Yes . "
61912	61939	61010	61010	he	323	" And the boat rocks a little , and he jumps up to help her because he 's afraid she 's going to fall , see ? "
61940	61946	61010	61010	he	323	" Yes , I see . "
61947	61976	61010	61010	he	323	" Well , now if we wanted to we could have him have that camera of his in his hand or not , just as you think fit . "
61977	61988	61010	61010	he	323	" Yes , I see what you 're driving at . "
61989	62054	61010	61010	he	323	" Well , whether he keeps it in his hand or does n't , there 's some misstep on his part or hers , just as he says , or just the motion of the two bodies , causes the boat to go over , and he strikes her , or not , just as you think fit , but accidentally , of course . "
62055	62067	62069	62069	Belknap	323	" Yes , I see , and I 'll be damned ! "
62071	62082	62069	62069	Belknap	323	" Fine , Reuben ! Excellent ! Wonderful , really ! "
62083	62101	62104	62104	Jephson	320	" And the boat strikes her too , as well as him , a little , see ? "
62122	62132	62116	62116	he	320	" and makes him a little dizzy , too . "
62133	62137	61010	61010	he	323	" I see . "
62138	62169	62116	62116	he	320	" And he hears her cries and sees her , but he 's a little stunned himself , see ? And by the time he 's ready to do something — "
62170	62175	62177	62177	Belknap	323	" She 's gone , "
62181	62188	62177	62177	Belknap	323	" Drowned . I get you . "
62189	62235	62116	62116	he	320	" And then , because of all those other suspicious circumstances and false registrations — and because now she 's gone and he ca n't do anything more for her , anyhow — her relatives might not want to know her condition , you know — "
62236	62240	62177	62177	Belknap	323	" I see . "
62241	62285	62116	62116	he	320	" He slips away , frightened , a moral coward , just as we 'll have to contend from the first , anxious to stand well with his uncle and not lose his place in this world . Does n't that explain it ? "
62286	62365	62371	62371	he	1971	" About as well as anything could explain it , Reuben , I think . In fact , I think it 's a plausible explanation and I congratulate you . I do n't see how any one could hope to find a better . If that does n't get him off , or bring about a disagreement , at least we might get him off with , well , say , twenty years , do n't you think ? "
62387	62390	62371	62371	he	1971	" Fine ! "
62411	62421	62422	62422	Jephson	320	" But of course you know what that means ? "
62430	62459	62371	62371	he	1971	" That we have to put him on the witness stand ? Surely , surely . I see that well enough . But it 's his only chance . "
62460	62484	62371	62371	he	1971	" And he wo n't strike people as a very steady or convincing fellow , I 'm afraid — too nervous and emotional . "
62485	62493	62495	62495	Belknap	323	" Yes , I know all that , "
62499	62554	62495	62495	Belknap	323	" He 's easily rattled . And Mason will go after him like a wild bull . But we 'll have to coach him as to all this — drill him . Make him understand that it 's his only chance — that his very life depends on it . Drill him for months . "
62555	62583	62584	62584	Jephson	320	" If he fails , then he 's gone . If only we could do something to give him courage — teach him to act it out . "
62634	62645	62646	62646	He	320	" If it only were n't for these — here . "
62656	62659	62660	62660	he	320	" Christ ! "
62666	62709	62710	62710	he	320	" What a case ! But we 're not licked yet , not by a darn sight ! Why , we have n't begun to fight yet . And we 'll get a lot of publicity , anyhow . By the way , "
62713	62737	62710	62710	he	320	" I 'm having a fellow I know down near Big Bittern dredge for that camera to - night . Wish me luck . "
62738	62742	62745	62745	Belknap	323	" Do I ? "
62776	62782	62758	62758	Belknap	323	" perhaps the only way , "
63135	63137	63129	63129	Mason	209	" windy "
63153	63587	63129	63129	Mason	209	" What reason have I , a representative of all the people of this county , to railroad this man anywhere or make one single charge against him unless the charges make themselves ? Does n't the evidence itself show that he did kill this girl ? And has he ever said or done one thing to clear up any of the suspicious circumstances ? No ! Silence or lies . And until these circumstances are disproved by these very able gentlemen , I am going right ahead . I have all the evidence necessary to convict this young criminal now . And to delay it until January , when I shall be out of office , as they know , and when a new man will have to go over all this evidence with which I have familiarized myself , is to entail great expense to the county . For all the witnesses I have gotten together are right here now , easy to bring into Bridgeburg without any great expense to the county . But where will they be next January or February , especially after the defense has done its best to scatter them ? No , sir ! I will not agree to it . But , if within ten days or two weeks from now even , they can bring me something that will so much as make it look as though even some of the charges I have made are not true , I 'll be perfectly willing to go before the presiding judge with them , and if they can show him any evidence they have or hope to have , or that there are any distant known witnesses to be secured who can help prove this fellow 's innocence , why , then , well and good . I 'll be willing to ask the judge to grant them as much time as he may see fit , even if it throws the trial over until I am out of office . But if the trial comes up while I 'm here , as I honestly hope it will , I 'll prosecute it to the best of my ability , not because I 'm looking for an office of any kind but because I am now the district attorney and it is my duty to do so . And as for my being in politics , well , Mr. Belknap is in politics , is n't he ? He ran against me the last time , and I hear he desires to run again . "
63902	63910	63912	63913	Justice Oberwaltzer	326	" But where are you going then ? "
63920	63929	63912	63913	Justice Oberwaltzer	326	" The same material has been published everywhere . "
63930	63950	63961	63961	Mason	209	" But , your Honor , this crime which the district attorney here has been so busy in magnifying — "
63964	63972	63974	63974	Belknap	323	" But we contend just the same , "
63976	64001	63974	63974	Belknap	323	" that the public has been unduly stirred and deluded . You ca n't get twelve men now who will try this man fairly . "
64002	64006	64008	64008	Mason	209	" What nonsense ! "
64012	64111	64008	64008	Mason	209	" Mere twaddle ! Why , the newspapers themselves have gathered and published more evidence than I have . It 's the publicly discovered facts in this case that have aroused prejudice , if any has been aroused . But no more than would be aroused anywhere , I maintain . Besides , if this case is to be transferred to a distant county when the majority of the witnesses are right here , this county is going to be saddled with an enormous expense , which it can not afford and which the facts do not warrant .

66038	66127	66330	66330	Clyde	197	" Bridgeburg , N. Y. , Aug. 6 : A special Grand Jury appointed by Governor Stouderback , of this state , to sit in the case of Clyde Griffiths , the nephew of the wealthy collar manufacturer of the same name , of Lycurgus , New York , recently charged with the killing of Miss Roberta Alden , of Biltz , New York , at Big Bittern Lake in the Adirondacks on July 8th last , to - day returned an indictment charging murder in the first degree .
66128	66199	66330	66330	Clyde	197	" Subsequent to the indictment , Griffiths , who in spite of almost overwhelming evidence , has persisted in asserting that the alleged crime was an accident , and who , accompanied by his counsel , Alvin Belknap , and Reuben Jephson , of this city , was arraigned before Supreme Court Justice Oberwaltzer , pleaded not guilty . He was remanded for trial , which was set for October 15th .
66200	66302	66303	66303	Esta	250	" Young Griffiths , who is only twenty - two years of age , and up to the day of his arrest a respected member of Lycurgus smart society , is alleged to have stunned and then drowned his working - girl sweetheart , whom he had wronged and then planned to desert in favor of a richer girl . The lawyers in this case have been retained by his wealthy uncle of Lycurgus , who has hitherto remained aloof . But apart from this , it is locally asserted , no relative has come forward to aid in his defense . "

67411	67424	67427	67427	Esta	250	" Mamma , I just ca n't believe it can be Clyde , "
67432	67442	67427	67427	Esta	250	" It just ca n't be , can it ? "
67537	67540	67541	67541	she	335	" Ssh ! "
67555	67557	67541	67541	she	335	" He "
67562	67624	67541	67541	she	335	" must not know yet , anyhow . We must wire first , or write . You can have the answers come to you , maybe . I will give you the money . But I must sit down somewhere now for a minute . I feel a little weak . I 'll sit here . Let me have the Bible . "
67656	67666	67646	67646	she	335	" Lord , how are they increased that trouble . "
67667	67681	67736	67737	Mrs. Griffiths	335	" Hear me , when I call , O God of my righteousness . "
67715	67734	67736	67737	Mrs. Griffiths	335	" Oh , Mamma , I just ca n't believe it . Oh , this is too terrible ! "
67800	67836	67837	67837	she	335	" Now , we must think out what to say and who to send that telegram to — I mean to Clyde , of course — at that place , wherever it is — Bridgeburg , "
67850	67863	67837	67837	she	335	Bible—"By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us , O God ! "
67864	67895	67837	67837	she	335	" Or , maybe , those two lawyers — their names are there . I 'm afraid to wire Asa 's brother for fear he 'll wire back to him . "
67916	68028	68040	68040	she	2124	" But I suppose they would give it to him if we sent it care of that judge or those lawyers , do n't you think ? But it would be better if we could send it to him direct , I suppose . ( ' He leadeth me by the still waters . ' ) Just say that I have read about him and still have faith and love for him , but he is to tell me the truth and what to do . If he needs money we will have to see what we can do , I suppose . ( ' He restoreth my soul . ' ) "
68051	68106	68040	68040	she	2124	" Oh , it ca n't be true . Oh , dear , no ! After all , he is my son . We all love him and have faith . We must say that . God will deliver him . Watch and pray . Have faith . Under his wings shalt thou trust . "
68131	68155	68122	68122	Esta	250	" Yes , Mamma ! Oh , of course ! Yes , I will ! I know he 'll get it all right . "
68166	68208	68157	68157	she	2124	" My God ! My God ! What could be worse than this — to be accused of murder ! But , of course , it ca n't be true . It ca n't be true . If he should hear ! "
68218	68243	68157	68157	she	2124	" And after Russell , too . And Clyde 's trouble there in Kansas City . Poor Mamma . She has so much trouble . "
69285	69295	69270	69271	the latter	760	" Well , how 's tricks to - day ? "
69376	69394	69362	69362	he	197	" Any more preachers around to - day ? Any more country girls or Mason 's boys ? "
69505	69523	69547	69547	he	197	" Do you pray , brother ? Do you get right down on your knees and pray ? "
69565	69605	69547	69547	he	197	" Would you mind telling us the name of the girl you are supposed to be in love with , and where she is now ? We wo n't tell any one . Will she appear at the trial ? "
69724	69732	69734	69734	Jephson	320	" You can talk all you want , "
69738	69779	69781	69781	He	320	" so long as you do n't say anything . And the stiff upper lip , you know . And the smile that wo n't come off , see ? Not failing to go over that list , are you ? "
69850	69859	69862	69862	he	320	" That 's your litany , you know . "

71117	71121	71063	71063	Manigault	338	" Hot dogs ! "
71122	71144	71063	71063	Manigault	338	" Get the story of Clyde Griffiths , with all the letters of Roberta Alden . Only twenty - five cents ! "
71197	71201	71203	71203	Roberta	195	" the great plot "
71352	71516	71325	71340	the one on whom was to fall the burden of the opening presentation of the case	2249	" Now you 're not going to get frightened or show any evidence of nervousness at anything that may be said or done at any time , are you , Clyde ? We 're to be with you , you know , all through the trial . You sit right between us . And you 're going to smile and look unconcerned or interested , just as you wish , but never fearful — but not too bold or gay , you know , so that they 'd feel that you 're not taking this thing seriously . You understand — just a pleasant , gentlemanly , and sympathetic manner all the time . And not frightened . For that will be certain to do us and you great harm . Since you 're innocent , you have no real reason to be frightened — although you 're sorry , of course . You understand all that , I know , by now . "
71517	71525	71527	71527	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir , I understand , "
71529	71559	71527	71527	Clyde	197	" I will do just as you say . Besides , I never struck her intentionally , and that 's the truth . So why should I be afraid ? "
71629	71828	71609	71609	Jephson	320	" You 're not guilty ! You 're not guilty , Clyde , see ? You understand that fully by now , and you must always believe and remember that , because it 's true . You did n't intend to strike her , do you hear ? You swear to that . You have sworn it to me and Belknap here , and we believe you . Now , it does n't make the least bit of difference that because of the circumstances surrounding all this we are not going to be able to make the average jury see this or believe it just as you tell it . That 's neither here nor there . I 've told you that before . You know what the truth is — and so do we . But , in order to get justice for you , we 've had to get up something else — a dummy or substitute for the real fact , which is that you did n't strike her intentionally , but which we can not hope to make them see without disguising it in some way . You get that , do n't you ? "
71829	71834	71836	71836	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir , "
71848	71994	71995	71995	He	749	" And for that reason , as I 've so often told you , we 've invented this other story about a change of heart . It 's not quite true as to time , but it is true that you did experience a change of heart there in the boat . And that 's our justification . But they 'd never believe that under all of the peculiar circumstances , so we 're merely going to move that change of heart up a little , see ? Make it before you ever went into that boat at all . And while we know it is n't true that way , still neither is the charge that you intentionally struck her true , and they 're not going to electrocute you for something that is n't true — not with my consent , at least . "
72010	72153	71995	71995	He	749	" It 's this way , Clyde . It 's like having to pay for potatoes , or for suits of clothes , with corn or beans instead of money , when you have money to pay with but when , because of the crazy notions on the part of some one , they wo n't believe that the money you have is genuine . So you 've got to use the potatoes or beans . And beans is what we 're going to give 'em . But the justification is that you 're not guilty . You 're not guilty . You 've sworn to me that you did n't intend to strike her there at the last , whatever you might have been provoked to do at first . And that 's enough for me . You 're not guilty . "
72204	72415	72180	72180	he	749	" And now , whenever you get to feeling weak or nervous , or if , when you go on the stand , you think Mason is getting the best of you , I want you to remember this — just say to yourself—'I'm not guilty ! I 'm not guilty ! And they ca n't fairly convict me unless I really am . ' And if that do n't pull you together , look at me . I 'll be right there . All you have to do , if you feel yourself rattled , is to look at me — right into my eyes , just as I 'm looking at you now — and then you 'll know that I 'm wanting you to brace up and do what I 'm telling you to do now — swear to the things that we are asking you to swear to , however they may look like lies , and however you may feel about them . I 'm not going to have you convicted for something you did n't do , just because you ca n't be allowed to swear to what is the truth — not if I can help it . And now that 's all . "
72516	72518	72572	72572	he	320	" snap "
72533	72564	72572	72572	he	320	" Well , it 's about time , I guess . Looks as though all Cataraqui would like to get inside . We 're going to have quite an audience . "
72575	72608	72572	72572	he	320	" Now , you do n't want to let those people disturb you , Clyde . They 're nothing but a lot of country people come to town to see a show . "
72831	72840	72869	72871	his two protectors	2271	" Here he comes ! Here he comes ! "
72841	72846	72869	72871	his two protectors	2271	" There he is ! "
72847	72860	72869	72871	his two protectors	2271	" Would you believe that he could do a thing like that ? "
73281	73289	73336	73340	the whispering and stirring audience	2286	" Quite a full house , eh ? "
73316	73332	73336	73340	the whispering and stirring audience	2286	" Order in the Court ! His Honor , the Court ! Everybody please rise ! "
73443	73483	73434	73438	a smaller and older individual	2292	" Oyez ! Oyez ! All persons having business before the honorable , the Supreme Court of the State of New York , County of Cataraqui , draw near and give attention . This court is now in session ! "
73495	73505	73487	73489	this same individual	2293	" The State of New York against Clyde Griffiths . "
73520	73526	73507	73507	Mason	209	" The People are ready . "
73541	73547	73527	73528	Whereupon Belknap	342	" The defendant is ready . "
73571	73575	73549	73551	the same clerk	2294	" Simeon Dinsmore , "
73716	73724	73713	73713	he	209	" I most certainly do — for some people"—a
73745	73758	73739	73739	Belknap	342	" And they talk about the possibility of a fair trial here . "
73788	73803	73783	73783	his	209	" With the consent of the Court , the People will excuse the talesman . "
73847	73851	73828	73829	the clerk	2301	" Dudley Sheerline ! "
74422	74429	74432	74432	him	197	" You murderer ! You murderer ! "
74614	74623	74613	74614	his voice—"I	5007	voice—"I think I will ask the juror to step down"—as
74631	74634	74636	74636	Jephson	320	" Excused ! "
74646	74660	74636	74636	Jephson	320	" Better let him go , Alvin . Nothing in him for us . "
74671	74733	74666	74666	Jephson	320	" Sit up ! Sit up ! Look around ! Do n't sag down like that . Look people in the eye . Smile naturally , Clyde , if you 're going to smile at all , just look 'em in the eye . They 're not going to hurt you . They 're just a lot of farmers out sightseeing . "
75551	75557	75525	75525	he	2344	" Acceptable to the People ! "
75582	75597	75568	75568	Jephson	320	" Nothing in him for us , Alvin . As set as a bone . "
75661	75715	75654	75654	Jephson	320	" Well , Clyde , that 's the first round — not so very much to it , do you think ? And not very hard either , is it ? Better go over there and get a good meal , though . It 'll be just as long and dull this afternoon . "
75746	75763	75784	75784	she	2358	" There he is ! There he is ! Here he comes ! Here ! Here ! "
75788	75816	75784	75784	she	2358	" Let me see him ! I just want to get a good look at you , young man . I have two daughters of my own . "
76085	76091	76080	76080	Mason	209	" Gentlemen of the jury . "
76172	76177	76166	76167	some one	796	" Lights ! Camera ! "
76178	76200	76201	76201	he	197	" No doubt many of you have been wearied , as well as puzzled , at times during the past week , "
76204	76435	76201	76201	he	197	" by the exceeding care with which the lawyers in this case have passed upon the panels from which you twelve men have been chosen . It has been no light matter to find twelve men to whom all the marshaled facts in this astonishing cause could be submitted and by them weighed with all the fairness and understanding which the law commands . For my part , the care which I have exercised , gentlemen , has been directed by but one motive — that the state shall have justice done . No malice , no pre - conceived notions of any kind . So late as July 9th last I personally was not even aware of the existence of this defendant , nor of his victim , nor of the crime with which he is now charged . But , gentlemen , as shocked and unbelieving as I was at first upon hearing that a man of the age , training and connections of the defendant here could have placed himself in a position to be accused of such an offense , step by step I was compelled to alter and then dismiss forever from my mind my original doubts and to conclude from the mass of evidence that was literally thrust upon me , that it was my duty to prosecute this action in behalf of the people .
76436	76465	76468	76468	he	2380	" But , however that may be , let us proceed to the facts . There are two women in this action . One is dead . The other "
76491	76645	76468	76468	he	2380	" by agreement between the prosecution and the defense is to be nameless here , since no good can come from inflicting unnecessary injury . In fact , the sole purpose which I now announce to you to be behind every word and every fact as it will be presented by the prosecution is that exact justice , according to the laws of this state and the crime with which this defendant is charged , shall be done . Exact justice , gentlemen , exact and fair . But if you do not act honestly and render a true verdict according to the evidence , the people of the state of New York and the people of the county of Cataraqui will have a grievance and a serious one . For it is they who are looking to you for a true accounting for your reasoning and your final decision in this case . "
76672	76683	76686	76686	he	209	" The people of the state of New York charge , "
76706	76788	76686	76686	he	209	" that the crime of murder in the first degree has been committed by the prisoner at the bar — Clyde Griffiths . They charge that he willfully , and with malice and cruelty and deception , murdered and then sought to conceal forever from the knowledge and the justice of the world , the body of Roberta Alden , the daughter of a farmer who has for years resided near the village of Biltz , in Mimico County . They charge "
76827	76866	76686	76686	he	209	" that this same Clyde Griffiths , before ever this crime was committed by him , plotted for weeks the plan and commission of it , and then , with malice aforethought and in cold blood , executed it .
76867	76920	76923	76923	he	197	" And in charging these things , the people of the State of New York expect to , and will , produce before you substantiations of every one of them . You will be given facts , and of these facts you , not I , are to be the sole judge . "
76969	77021	76954	76954	he	197	" Gentlemen , it will not take me long to picture , nor will you fail to perceive for yourselves as this case proceeds , the type of girl this was whose life was so cruelly blotted out beneath the waters of Big Bittern . All the twenty years of her life "
77040	77108	76954	76954	he	197	" no person who ever knew her ever said one word in criticism of her character . And no evidence to that effect , I am positive , will be introduced in this trial . Somewhat over a year ago — on July 19 — she went to the city of Lycurgus , in order that by working with her own hands she might help her family . "
77128	77131	77134	77134	Mason	209	" Gentlemen , "
77332	77339	77340	77340	he	197	" But who is the individual , "
77350	77576	77340	77340	he	197	" against whom I charge all these things ? There he sits ! Is he the son of wastrel parents — a product of the slums — one who had been denied every opportunity for a proper or honorable conception of the values and duties of a decent and respectable life ? Is he ? On the contrary . His father is of the same strain that has given Lycurgus one of its largest and most constructive industries — the Griffiths Collar & Shirt Company . He was poor — yes — no doubt of that . But not more so than Roberta Alden — and her character appears not to have been affected by her poverty . His parents in Kansas City , Denver , and before that Chicago and Grand Rapids , Michigan , appear to have been unordained ministers of the proselytizing and mission - conducting type - people who , from all I can gather , are really , sincerely religious and right - principled in every sense . But this , their oldest son , and the one who might have been expected to be deeply influenced by them , early turned from their world and took to a more garish life . He became a bell - boy in a celebrated Kansas City hotel , the Green - Davidson . "
77701	77705	77706	77706	he	2392	" And yet , "
77709	77724	77706	77706	he	2392	" how much has been made here of the alleged youth of this defendant ? "
77735	77881	77706	77706	he	2392	" He has been called by his counsel and others in the newspapers a boy , over and over again . He is not a boy . He is a bearded man . He has had more social and educational advantages than any one of you in the jury box . He has traveled . In hotels and clubs and the society with which he was so intimately connected in Lycurgus , he has been in contact with decent , respectable , and even able and distinguished people . Why , as a matter of fact , at the time of his arrest two months ago , he was part of as smart a society and summer resort group as this region boasts . Remember that ! His mind is a mature , not , an immature one . It is fully developed and balanced perfectly .
77882	77894	77895	77895	he	2406	" Gentlemen , as the state will soon proceed to prove , "
77899	78004	77895	77895	he	2406	" it was no more than four months after his arrival in Lycurgus that this dead girl came to work for the defendant in the department of which he was the head . And it was not more than two months after that before he had induced her to move from the respectable and religious home which she had chosen in Lycurgus , to one concerning which she knew nothing and the principal advantage of which , as he saw it , was that it offered secrecy and seclusion and freedom from observation for that vile purpose which already he entertained in regard to her .
78005	78173	77706	77706	he	2392	" There was a rule of the Griffiths Company , as we will later show in this trial , which explains much — and that was that no superior officer or head of any department was permitted to have anything to do with any girls working under him , or for the factory , in or out of the factory . It was not conducive to either the morals or the honor of those working for this great company , and they would not allow it . And shortly after coming there , this man had been instructed as to that rule . But did that deter him ? Did the so recent and favorable consideration of his uncle in any way deter him ? Not in the least . Secrecy ! Secrecy ! From the very beginning ! Seduction ! Seduction ! The secret and intended and immoral and illegal and socially unwarranted and condemned use of her body outside the regenerative and ennobling pale of matrimony !
78174	78250	77895	77895	he	2406	" That was his purpose , gentlemen ! But was it generally known by any one in Lycurgus or elsewhere that such a relationship as this existed between him and Roberta Alden ? Not a soul ! Not a soul ! , as far as I have been able to ascertain , was ever so much as partially aware of this relationship until after this girl was dead . Not a soul ! Think of that !
78251	78257	78260	78260	his	2407	" Gentlemen of the jury , "
78269	78380	78260	78260	his	2407	" Roberta Alden loved this defendant with all the strength of her soul . She loved him with that love which is the crowning mystery of the human brain and the human heart , that transcends in its strength and its weakness all fear of shame or punishment from even the immortal throne above . She was a true and human and decent and kindly girl — a passionate and loving girl . And she loved as only a generous and trusting and self - sacrificing soul can love . And loving so , in the end she gave to him all that any woman can give the man she loves .
78381	78422	77895	77895	he	2406	" Friends , this thing has happened millions of times in this world of ours , and it will happen millions and millions of times in the days to come . It is not new and it will never be old .
78423	78487	78260	78260	his	2407	" But in January or February last , this girl , who is now dead in her grave , was compelled to come to this defendant , Clyde Griffiths , and tell him that she was about to become a mother . We shall prove to you that then and later she begged him to go away with her and make her his wife .
78488	78662	78664	78664	he	2408	" But did he ? Would he ? Oh , no ! For by that time a change had come over the dreams and the affections of Clyde Griffiths . He had had time to discover that the name of Griffiths in Lycurgus was one that would open the doors of Lycurgus exclusive circles — that the man who was no one in Kansas City or Chicago — was very much of a person here , and that it would bring him in contact with girls of education and means , girls who moved far from the sphere to which Roberta Alden belonged . Not only that , but he had found one girl to whom , because of her beauty , wealth , position , he had become enormously attached and beside her the little farm and factory girl in the pathetically shabby and secret room to which he had assigned her , looked poor indeed — good enough to betray but not good enough to marry . And he would not . "
78677	78817	78664	78664	he	2408	" But at no point have I been able to find the least modification or cessation of any of these social activities on his part which so entranced him . On the contrary , from January to July fifth last , and after — yes , even after she was finally compelled to say to him that unless he could take her away and marry her , she would have to appeal to the sense of justice in the community in which they moved , and after she was cold and dead under the waters of Big Bittern — dances , lawn fetes , automobile parties , dinners , gay trips to Twelfth Lake and Bear Lake , and without a thought , seemingly , that her great moral and social need should modify his conduct in any way . "
78900	79096	78895	78895	Mason	209	" But by this time , gentlemen , as I have indicated , Roberta Alden had become insistent that Griffiths make her his wife . And this he promised to do . Yet , as all the evidence here will show , he never intended to do anything of the kind . On the contrary , when her condition became such that he could no longer endure her pleas or the danger which her presence in Lycurgus unquestionably spelled for him , he induced her to go home to her father 's house , with the suggestion , apparently , that she prepare herself by making some necessary clothes , against the day when he would come for her and remove her to some distant city where they would not be known , yet where as his wife she could honorably bring their child into the world . And according to her letters to him , as I will show , that was to have been in three weeks from the time she departed for her home in Biltz . But did he come for her as he had promised ? No , he never did .
79097	79246	78895	78895	Mason	209	" Eventually , and solely because there was no other way out , he permitted her to come to him — on July sixth last — exactly two days before her death . But not before — but wait!—In the meantime , or from June fifth to July sixth , he allowed her to brood in that little , lonely farm - house on the outskirts of Biltz in Mimico County , with the neighbors coming in to watch and help her make some clothes , which even then she did not dare announce as her bridal trousseau . And she suspected and feared that this defendant would fail her . For daily , and sometimes twice daily , she wrote him , telling him of her fears and asking him to assure her by letter or word in some form that he would come and take her away .
79247	79329	79333	79333	Mason	209	" But did he even do that ? Never by letter ! Never ! Oh , no , gentlemen , oh , no ! On the contrary some telephone messages — things that could not be so easily traced or understood . And these so few and brief that she herself complained bitterly of his lack of interest and consideration for her at this time . So much so that at the end of five weeks , growing desperate , she wrote "
79352	79408	79333	79333	Mason	209	" ' This is to tell you that unless I hear from you either by telephone or letter before noon Friday , I will come to Lycurgus and the world will know how you have treated me . ' Those are the words , gentlemen , that this poor girl was at last compelled to write .
79409	79471	78895	78895	Mason	209	" But did Clyde Griffiths want the world to know how he had treated her ? Of course not ! And there and then began to form in his mind a plan by which he could escape exposure and seal Roberta Alden 's lips forever . And , gentlemen , the state will prove that he did so close her mouth . "
79591	79856	79588	79588	he	209	" Do n't forget , gentlemen , that although he had previously indicated to Roberta that this was to be their wedding journey , he did not want anybody to know that he was with his prospective bride — no , not even after they had reached Big Bittern . For he was seeking , not to marry but to find a wilderness in which to snuff out the life of this girl of whom he had tired . But did that prevent him , twenty - four and forty - eight hours before that time , from holding her in his arms and repeating the promises he had no intention of keeping ? Did it ? I will show you the registers of the two hotels in which they stayed , and where , because of their assumed approaching marriage , they occupied a single room together . Yet the only reason it was forty - eight instead of twenty - four hours was that he had made a mistake in regard to the solitude of Grass Lake . Finding it brisk with life , the center of a summer religious colony , he decided to leave and go to Big Bittern , which was more lonely . And so you have the astounding and bitter spectacle , gentlemen , of a supposedly innocent and highly misunderstood young man dragging this weary and heart - sick girl from place to place , in order to find a lake deserted enough in which to drown her . And with her but four months from motherhood !
79857	80001	79588	79588	he	209	" And then , having arrived at last at one lake lonely enough , putting her in a boat and taking her out from the inn where he had again falsely registered as Mr. Clifford Golden and wife , to her death . The poor little thing imagined that she was going for a brief outing before that marriage of which he talked and which was to seal and sanctify it . To seal and sanctify it ! To seal and sanctify , as closing waters seal and sanctify , but in no other way — no other way . And with him walking , whole and sly — as a wolf from its kill — to freedom , to marriage , to social and material and affectionate bliss and superiority and ease , while she slept still and nameless in her watery grave .
80002	80047	79588	79588	he	209	" But , oh , gentlemen , the ways of nature , or of God , and the Providence that shapes our ends , rough - hew them how we may ! It is man who proposes , but God — God — who disposes !
80048	80153	79588	79588	he	209	" The defendant is still wondering , I am sure , as to how I know that she thought she was still going to be married after leaving the inn at Big Bittern . And I have no doubt that he still has some comforting thoughts to the effect that I can not really and truly know it . But how shrewd and deep must be that mind that would foresee and forestall all the accidents and chances of life . For , as he sits there now , secure in the faith that his counsel may be able to extract him safely from this "
80179	80254	79588	79588	he	209	" he does not know that that girl , while in her room in the Grass Lake Inn , had written her mother a letter , which she had not had time to mail , and which was in the pocket of her coat left behind because of the heat of the day , and because she imagined she was coming back , of course . And which is here now upon this table . "
80324	80330	80333	80333	Mason	209	" But in that letter , "
80335	80350	80333	80333	Mason	209	" she tells why she was up there — to be married , no less "
80382	80390	80392	80392	Mason	209	" and within a day or two , "
80405	80572	80397	80397	he	209	" But Griffiths , or Graham , of Albany , or Syracuse , or anywhere , knew better . He knew he was not coming back . And he took all of his belongings with him in that boat . And all afternoon long , from noon until evening , he searched for a spot on that lonely lake — a spot not easily observed from any point of the shore , as we will show . And as evening fell , he found it . And walking south through the woods afterwards , with a new straw hat upon his head , a clean , dry bag in his hand , he imagined himself to be secure . Clifford Golden was no more — Carl Graham was no more — drowned — at the bottom of Big Bittern , along with Roberta Alden . But Clyde Griffiths was alive and free , and on his way to Twelfth Lake , to the society he so loved .
80573	80647	80397	80397	he	209	" Gentlemen , Clyde Griffiths killed Roberta Alden before he put her in that lake . He beat her on the head and face , and he believed no eye saw him . But , as her last death cry rang out over the water of Big Bittern , there was a witness , and before the prosecution has closed its case , that witness will be here to tell you the story . "
81097	81236	81078	81078	he	320	" I do n't believe it . He 's lying , I think , or bluffing . At any rate , we 'll wait and see . It 's a long time between now and our side of the story . Look at all those witnesses there . And we can cross - question them by the week , if we want to — until he 's out of office . Plenty of time to do a lot of things — find out about this witness in the meantime . And besides , there 's suicide , or there 's the actual thing that happened . We can let Clyde swear to what did happen — a cataleptic trance — no courage to do it . It 's not likely anybody can see that at five hundred feet . "
81257	81278	81247	81247	he	320	" We might be able to get him off with twenty years at the worst , do n't you think ? "
81446	81450	81424	81424	he	197	" Your name ? "
81451	81455	81512	81512	Belknap	323	" Titus Alden . "
81456	81465	81424	81424	he	197	" You are the father of Roberta Alden ? "
81466	81471	81512	81512	Belknap	323	" Yes , sir . "
81472	81499	81424	81424	he	197	" Now , Mr. Alden , just tell the jury how and under what circumstances it was that your daughter Roberta happened to go to Lycurgus . "
81500	81510	81512	81512	Belknap	323	" Objected to . Irrelevant , immaterial , incompetent , "
81514	81521	81524	81524	Mason	209	" I 'll connect it up , "
81549	81553	81424	81424	he	197	" connected up . "
81554	81562	81564	81564	Titus	182	" She went there to get work , "
81566	81577	81524	81524	Mason	209	" And why did she go there to get work ? "
81598	81634	81524	81524	Mason	209	" Well , the farm we have over there near Biltz has n't ever paid so very well , and it 's been necessary for the children to help out and Bobbie being the oldest — "
81635	81641	81524	81524	Mason	209	" Move to strike out ! "
81642	81647	81524	81524	Mason	209	" Strike it out . "
81648	81665	81524	81524	Mason	209	" ' Bobbie ' was the pet name you gave your daughter Roberta , was it ? "
81666	81670	81524	81524	Mason	209	" Objected to , "
81676	81679	81524	81524	Mason	209	" Exception . "
81680	81700	81524	81524	Mason	209	" Yes , sir . ' Bobbie ' was what we sometimes called her around there — just Bobbie . "

81938	81950	81991	81995	A deputy assistant district attorney	2448	" And what did she have with her when she left ? "
81951	81959	81991	81995	A deputy assistant district attorney	2448	" Her bag and her little trunk . "
81960	81976	81991	81995	A deputy assistant district attorney	2448	" And would you recognize the bag that she carried , if you saw it ? "
81977	81982	81991	81995	A deputy assistant district attorney	2448	" Yes , sir . "
81983	81989	81991	81995	A deputy assistant district attorney	2448	" Is this the bag ? "
82029	82034	82010	82010	Alden	195	" Yes , sir . "

82265	82277	82262	82262	Belknap	323	" The Republican candidate for county judge in this county , I believe!"—thus
82290	82381	82285	82285	Mason	209	" Your Honor , I protest ! This is an unethical and illegal attempt to inject into this case a political issue which has nothing to do with it . It is slyly and maliciously intended to convey to this jury that because I am the Republican nominee for judge of the county , it is impossible for me to properly and fairly conduct the prosecution of this case . And I now demand an apology , and will have it before I proceed one step further in this case . "

83730	83753	83725	83725	her	195	" But , Clyde , I ca n't wait that long . You know I ca n't . And I wo n't . "
83853	83863	83850	83850	her	2514	" under no circumstances would she wait that long , "

86515	86529	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" Between half past five and six in the afternoon , you say ? "
86530	86535	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" Yes , sir . "
86536	86543	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" And on what date again ? "
86544	86548	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" July eighth . "
86549	86559	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" And where were you exactly at that time ? "
86560	86564	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" We were — "
86565	86576	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" Not ' we . ' Where were you personally ? "
86577	86598	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" I was crossing what I have since learned was South Bay in a row - boat with my husband . "
86599	86608	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" Yes . Now tell what happened next . "
86609	86623	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" When we reached the middle of the bay I heard a cry . "
86624	86630	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" What was it like ? "
86631	86657	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" It was penetrating — like the cry of some one in pain — or in danger . It was sharp — a haunting cry . "
86662	86666	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" strike out , "
86680	86687	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" Where did it come from ? "
86688	86700	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" From a distance . From within or beyond the woods . "
86701	86723	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" Did you know at the time that there was another bay or cove there — below that strip of woods ? "
86724	86729	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" No , sir . "
86730	86753	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" Well , what did you think then — that it might have come from within the woods below where you were ? "
86763	86788	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" And now tell us , was it a man 's or a woman 's cry ? What kind of a cry was it ? "
86789	86837	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" It was a woman 's cry , and something like ' Oh , oh ! ' or ' Oh , my ! ' — very piercing and clear , but distant , of course . A double scream such as one might make when in pain . "
86838	86861	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" You are sure you could not be mistaken as to the kind of a cry it was — male or female . "
86862	86903	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" No , sir . I am positive . It was a woman 's . It was pitched too high for a man 's voice or a boy 's . It could not have been anything but a woman 's . "
86904	86933	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" I see . And now tell us , Mrs. Donahue — you see this dot on the map showing where the body of Roberta Alden was found ? "
86934	86939	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" Yes , sir . "
86940	86959	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" And you see this other dot , over those trees , showing approximately where your boat was ? "
86960	86965	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" Yes , sir . "
86966	86982	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" Do you think that voice came from where this dot in Moon Cove is ? "
86990	86997	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" And was that cry repeated ? "
86998	87029	87031	87031	Belknap	323	" No , sir . I waited , and I called my husband 's attention to it , too , and we waited , but did n't hear it again . "
87502	87769	87492	87493	the audience	2651	" You said I was not to worry or think so much about how I feel , and have a good time . That 's all right for you to say , when you 're in Lycurgus and surrounded by your friends and invited everywhere . It 's hard for me to talk over there at Wilcox 's with somebody always in earshot and with you constantly reminding me that I must n't say this or that . But I had so much to ask and no chance there . And all that you would say was that everything was all right . But you did n't say positively that you were coming on the 27th , that because of something I could n't quite make out — there was so much buzzing on the wire — you might not be able to start until later . But that ca n't be , Clyde . My parents are leaving for Hamilton where my uncle lives on the third . And Tom and Emily are going to my sister 's on the same day . But I ca n't and wo n't go there again . I ca n't stay here all alone . So you must , you really must come , as you agreed . I ca n't wait any longer than that , Clyde , in the condition that I 'm in , and so you just must come and take me away . Oh , please , please , I beg of you , not to torture me with any more delays now . "
87773	87933	87492	87493	the audience	2651	" Clyde , I came home because I thought I could trust you . You told me so solemnly before I left that if I would , you would come and get me in three weeks at the most — that it would not take you longer than that to get ready , have enough money for the time we would be together , or until you could get something to do somewhere else . But yesterday , although the third of July will be nearly a month since I left , you were not at all sure at first that you could come by then , and when as I told you my parents are surely leaving for Hamilton to be gone for ten days . Of course , afterwards , you said you would come , but you said it as though you were just trying to quiet me . It has been troubling me awfully ever since .
87934	87983	87492	87493	the audience	2651	" For I tell you , Clyde , I am sick , very . I feel faint nearly all the time . And besides , I am so worried as to what I shall do if you do n't come that I am nearly out of my mind . "
87984	88102	87492	87493	the audience	2651	" Clyde , I know that you do n't care for me any more like you did and that you are wishing things could be different . And yet , what am I to do ? I know you 'll say that it has all been as much my fault as yours . And the world , if it knew , might think so , too . But how often did I beg you not to make me do what I did not want to do , and which I was afraid even then I would regret , although I loved you too much to let you go , if you still insisted on having your way . "
88103	88255	87492	87493	the audience	2651	" Clyde , if I could only die . That would solve all this . And I have prayed and prayed that I would lately , yes I have . For life does not mean as much to me now as when I first met you and you loved me . Oh , those happy days ! If only things were different . If only I were out of your way . It would all be so much better for me and for all of us . But I ca n't now , Clyde , without a penny and no way to save the name of our child , except this . Yet if it were n't for the terrible pain and disgrace it would bring to my mother and father and all my family , I would be willing to end it all in another way . I truly would . "
88259	88363	87492	87493	the audience	2651	" Oh , Clyde , Clyde , life is so different to - day to what it was last year . Think — then we were going to Crum and those other lakes over near Fonda and Gloversville and Little Falls , but now — now . Only just now some boy and girl friends of Tom 's and Emily 's came by to get them to go after strawberries , and when I saw them go and knew I could n't , and that I could n't be like that any more ever , I cried and cried , ever so long . "
88367	88488	87492	87493	the audience	2651	" I have been bidding good - by to some places to - day . There are so many nooks , dear , and all of them so dear to me . I have lived here all my life , you know . First , there was the springhouse with its great masses of green moss , and in passing it I said good - by to it , for I wo n't be coming to it soon again — maybe never . And then the old apple tree where we had our playhouse years ago — Emily and Tom and Gifford and I. Then the ' Believe , ' a cute little house in the orchard where we sometimes played .
88489	88669	87492	87493	the audience	2651	" Oh , Clyde , you ca n't realize what all this means to me , I feel as though I shall never see my home again after I leave here this time . And mamma , poor dear mamma , how I do love her and how sorry I am to have deceived her so . She is never cross and she always helps me so much . Sometimes I think if I could tell her , but I ca n't . She has had trouble enough , and I could n't break her heart like that . No , if I go away and come back some time , either married or dead — it does n't make so much difference now — she will never know , and I will not have caused her any pain , and that means so much more than life itself to me . So good - by , Clyde , until I do meet you , as you telephoned . And forgive me all the trouble that I have caused you .
88670	88673	87492	87493	the audience	2651	" Your sorrowful ,

89695	89989	89679	89679	Belknap	323	" Gentlemen — somewhat over three weeks ago you were told by the district attorney that because of the evidence he was about to present he would insist that you jurors must find the prisoner at the bar guilty of the crime of which he stands indicted . It has been a long and tedious procedure since then . The foolish and inexperienced , yet in every case innocent and unintentional , acts of a boy of fifteen or sixteen have been gone into before you gentlemen as though they were the deeds of a hardened criminal , and plainly with the intention of prejudicing you against this defendant , who , with the exception of one misinterpreted accident in Kansas City — the most brutally and savagely misinterpreted accident it has ever been my professional misfortune to encounter — can be said to have lived as clean and energetic and blameless and innocent a life as any boy of his years anywhere . You have heard him called a man — a bearded man — a criminal and a crime - soaked product of the darkest vomiting of Hell . And yet he is but twenty - one . And there he sits . And I venture to say that if by some magic of the spoken word I could at this moment strip from your eye the substance of all the cruel thoughts and emotions which have been attributed to him by a clamorous and mistaken and I might say ( if I had not been warned not to do so ) , politically biased prosecution , you could no more see him in the light that you do than you could rise out of that box and fly through those windows .
89990	90048	90052	90052	he	2692	" Gentlemen of the jury , I have no doubt that you , as well as the district attorney and even the audience , have wondered how under the downpour of such linked and at times almost venomous testimony , I or my colleague or this defendant could have remained as calm and collected as we have . "
90073	90132	90052	90052	he	2692	" Yet , as you have seen , we have not only maintained but enjoyed the serenity of those who not only feel but know that they have the right and just end of any legal contest . You recall , of course , the words of the Avon bard—'Thrice armed is he who hath his quarrel just . '
90133	90340	89679	89679	Belknap	323	" In fact , we know , as the prosecution in this case unfortunately does not , the peculiarly strange and unexpected circumstances by which this dramatic and most unfortunate death came about . And before we are through you shall see for yourselves . In the meantime , let me tell you , gentlemen , that since this case opened I have believed that even apart from the light we propose to throw on this disheartening tragedy , you gentlemen are not at all sure that a brutal or bestial crime can be laid upon the shoulders of this defendant . You can not be ! For after all , love is love , and the ways of passion and the destroying emotion of love in either sex are not those of the ordinary criminal . Only remember , we were once all boys . And those of you who are grown women were girls , and know well — oh , how very well — the fevers and aches of youth that have nothing to do with a later practical life . ' Judge not , lest ye be judged and with whatsoever measure ye mete , it will be measured unto ye again . '
90341	90593	90052	90052	he	2692	" We admit the existence and charm and potent love spell of the mysterious Miss X and her letters , which we have not been able to introduce here , and their effect on this defendant . We admit his love for this Miss X , and we propose to show by witnesses of our own , as well as by analyzing some of the testimony that has been offered here , that perhaps the sly and lecherous overtures with which this defendant is supposed to have lured the lovely soul now so sadly and yet so purely accidentally blotted out , as we shall show , from the straight and narrow path of morality , were perhaps no more sly nor lecherous than the proceedings of any youth who finds the girl of his choice surrounded by those who see life only in the terms of the strictest and narrowest moral regime . And , gentlemen , as your own county district attorney has told you , Roberta Alden loved Clyde Griffiths . At the very opening of this relationship which has since proved to be a tragedy , this dead girl was deeply and irrevocably in love with him , just as at the time he imagined that he was in love with her . And people who are deeply and earnestly in love with each other are not much concerned with the opinions of others in regard to themselves . They are in love — and that is sufficient !
90594	90748	89679	89679	Belknap	323	" But , gentlemen , I am not going to dwell on that phase of the question so much as on this explanation which we are about to offer . Why did Clyde Griffiths go to Fonda , or to Utica , or to Grass Lake , or to Big Bittern , at all ? Do you think we have any reason for or any desire to deny or discolor in any way the fact of his having done so , or with Roberta Alden either ? Or why , after the suddenness and seeming strangeness and mystery of her death , he should have chosen to walk away as he did ? If you seriously think so for one fraction of a moment , you are the most hopelessly deluded and mistaken dozen jurymen it has been our privilege to argue before in all our twenty - seven years ' contact with juries .
90749	90955	90958	90958	he	2694	" Gentlemen , I have said to you that Clyde Griffiths is not guilty , and he is not . You may think , perhaps , that we ourselves must be believing in his guilt . But you are wrong . The peculiarity , the strangeness of life , is such that oftentimes a man may be accused of something that he did not do and yet every circumstance surrounding him at the time seem to indicate that he did do it . There have been many very pathetic and very terrible instances of miscarriages of justice through circumstantial evidence alone . Be sure ! Oh , be very sure that no such mistaken judgment based on any local or religious or moral theory of conduct or bias , because of presumed irrefutable evidence , is permitted to prejudice you , so that without meaning to , and with the best and highest - minded intentions , you yourselves see a crime , or the intention to commit a crime , when no such crime or any such intention ever truly or legally existed or lodged in the mind or acts of this defendant . Oh , be sure ! Be very , very sure ! "
91016	91077	90994	90994	Belknap	323	" When Roberta Alden 's body was taken out of the water at Big Bittern , gentlemen , it was examined by a physician . He declared at the time that the girl had been drowned . He will be here and testify and the defendant shall have the benefit of that testimony , and you must render it to him .
91078	91410	91414	91414	he	2695	" You were told by the district attorney that Roberta Alden and Clyde Griffiths were engaged to be married and that she left her home at Biltz and went forth with him on July sixth last on her wedding journey . Now , gentlemen , it is so easy to slightly distort a certain set of circumstances . ' Were engaged to be married ' was how the district attorney emphasized the incidents leading up to the departure on July sixth . As a matter of fact , not one iota of any direct evidence exists which shows that Clyde Griffiths was ever formally engaged to Roberta Alden , or that , except for some passages in her letters , he agreed to marry her . And those passages , gentlemen , plainly indicate that it was only under the stress of moral and material worry , due to her condition — for which he was responsible , of course , but which , nevertheless , was with the consent of both — a boy of twenty - one and a girl of twenty - three — that he agreed to marry her . Is that , I ask you , an open and proper engagement — the kind of an engagement you think of when you think of one at all ? Mind you , I am not seeking to flout or belittle or reflect in any way on this poor , dead girl . I am simply stating , as a matter of fact and of law , that this boy was not formally engaged to this dead girl . He had not given her his word beforehand that he would marry her ... Never ! There is no proof . You must give him the benefit of that . And only because of her condition , for which we admit he was responsible , he came forward with an agreement to marry her , in case ... in case "
91423	91600	91414	91414	he	2695	" she was not willing to release him . And since she was not willing to release him , as her various letters read here show , that agreement , on pain of a public exposure in Lycurgus , becomes , in the eyes and words of the district attorney , an engagement , and not only that but a sacred engagement which no one but a scoundrel and a thief and a murderer would attempt to sever ! But , gentlemen , many engagements , more open and sacred in the eyes of the law and of religion , have been broken . Thousands of men and thousands of women have seen their hearts change , their vows and faith and trust flouted , and have even carried their wounds into the secret places of their souls , or gone forth , and gladly , to death at their own hands because of them . As the district attorney said in his address , it is not new and it will never be old . Never !
91601	91725	90994	90994	Belknap	323	" But it is such a case as this last , I warn you , that you are now contemplating and are about to pass upon — a girl who is the victim of such a change of mood . But that is not a legal , however great a moral or social crime it may be . And it is only a curious and almost unbelievably tight and yet utterly misleading set of circumstances in connection with the death of this girl that chances to bring this defendant before you at this time . I swear it . I truly know it to be so . And it can and will be fully explained to your entire satisfaction before this case is closed .
91726	91752	91414	91414	he	2695	" However , in connection with this last statement , there is another which must be made as a preface to all that is to follow .
91753	91937	90994	90994	Belknap	323	" Gentlemen of the jury , the individual who is on trial here for his life is a mental as well as a moral coward — no more and no less — not a downright , hardhearted criminal by any means . Not unlike many men in critical situations , he is a victim of a mental and moral fear complex . Why , no one as yet has been quite able to explain . We all have one secret bugbear or fear . And it is these two qualities , and no others , that have placed him in the dangerous position in which he now finds himself . It was cowardice , gentlemen — fear of a rule of the factory of which his uncle is the owner , as well as fear of his own word given to the officials above him , that caused him first to conceal the fact that he was interested in the pretty country girl who had come to work for him . And later , to conceal the fact that he was going with her .
91938	92266	91414	91414	he	2695	" Yet no statutory crime of any kind there . You could not possibly try a man for that , whatever privately you might think . And it was cowardice , mental and moral , gentlemen , which prevented him , after he became convinced that he could no longer endure a relationship which had once seemed so beautiful , from saying outright that he could not , and would not continue with her , let alone marry her . Yet , will you slay a man because he is the victim of fear ? And again , after all , if a man has once and truly decided that he can not and will not endure a given woman , or a woman a man — that to live with her could only prove torturesome — what would you have that person do ? Marry her ? To what end ? That they may hate and despise and torture each other forever after ? Can you truly say that you agree with that as a rule , or a method , or a law ? Yet , as the defense sees it , a truly intelligent and fair enough thing , under the circumstances , was done in this instance . An offer , but without marriage — and alas , without avail — was made . A suggestion for a separate life , with him working to support her while she dwelt elsewhere . Her own letters , read only yesterday in this court , indicate something of the kind . But the oh , so often tragic insistence upon what in so many cases were best left undone ! And then that last , long , argumentative trip to Utica , Grass Lake , and Big Bittern . And all to no purpose . Yet with no intention to kill or betray unto death . Not the slightest . And we will show you why .
92267	92379	90994	90994	Belknap	323	" Gentlemen , once more I insist that it was cowardice , mental and moral , and not any plot or plan for any crime of any kind , that made Clyde Griffiths travel with Roberta Alden under various aliases to all the places I have just mentioned — that made him write ' Mr. and Mrs. Carl Graham , ' ' Mr. and Mrs. Clifford Golden ' — mental and moral fear of the great social mistake as well as sin that he had committed in pursuing and eventually allowing himself to fail into this unhallowed relationship with her — mental and moral fear or cowardice of what was to follow .
92380	92494	91414	91414	he	2695	" And again , it was mental and moral cowardice that prevented him there at Big Bittern , once the waters of the lake had so accidentally closed over her , from returning to Big Bittern Inn and making public her death . Mental and Moral Cowardice — and nothing more and nothing less . He was thinking of his wealthy relatives in Lycurgus , their rule which his presence here on the lake with this girl would show to have been broken — of the suffering and shame and rage of her parents . And besides , there was Miss X — the brightest star in the brightest constellation of all his dreams .
92495	92714	90994	90994	Belknap	323	" We admit all that , and we are completely willing to concede that he was , or must have been , thinking of all these things . The prosecution charges , and we admit that such is the fact , that he had been so completely ensnared by this Miss X , and she by him , that he was willing and eager to forsake this first love who had given herself to him , for one who , because of her beauty and her wealth , seemed so much more desirable — even as to Roberta Alden he seemed more desirable than others . And if she erred as to him — as plainly she did — might not — might not he have erred eventually in his infatuated following of one who in the ultimate — who can say ? — might not have cared so much for him . At any rate , one of his strongest fear thoughts at this time , as he himself has confessed to us , his counsel , was that if this Miss X learned that he had been up there with this other girl of whom she had not even so much as heard , well then , it would mean the end of her regard for him .
92715	92820	91414	91414	he	2695	" I know that as you gentlemen view such things , such conduct has no excuse for being . One may be the victim of an internal conflict between two illicit moods , yet nevertheless , as the law and the church see it , guilty of sin and crime . But the truth , none - the - less , is that they do exist in the human heart , law or no law , religion or no religion , and in scores of cases they motivate the actions of the victims . And we admit that they motivated the actions of Clyde Griffiths .
92821	92828	90994	90994	Belknap	323	" But did he kill Roberta Alden ?
92829	92831	91414	91414	he	2695	" No !
92832	92837	90994	90994	Belknap	323	" And again , no !
92838	92891	91414	91414	he	2695	" Or did he plot in any way , half - heartedly or otherwise , to drag her up there under the guise of various aliases and then , because she would not set him free , drown her ? Ridiculous ! Impossible ! Insane ! His plan was completely and entirely different .
92892	92897	92900	92900	he	2696	" But , gentlemen , "
92916	92980	92900	92900	he	2696	" perhaps you would be better satisfied with my argument and the final judgment you are to render if you were to have the testimony of one eye - witness at least of Roberta Alden 's death — one who , instead of just hearing a voice , was actually present , and who saw and hence knows how she met her death . "
93022	93079	93004	93004	Reuben	320	" Well , here we are , Clyde , it 's up to you now . Only I 'm going along with you , see ? I 've decided to examine you myself . I 've drilled and drilled you , and I guess you wo n't have any trouble in telling me , will you ? "
93138	93161	93127	93127	his	197	" Gee ! I 'm glad you 're going to do it . I 'll be all right now , I think . "
93230	93256	93225	93226	his clerk	2702	" Order ! Order ! Unless everybody is seated , all spectators will be dismissed ! The deputies will please see that all are seated . "
93269	93278	93266	93266	Belknap	323	" Clyde Griffiths , take the witness chair . "
93369	93405	93353	93353	Jephson	320	" Leave him to me , Alvin , I think it 's best . He looks a little too strained and shaky to suit me , but I feel sure I can pull him through . "
93544	93670	93538	93538	his	320	" Now , Clyde , the first thing we want to do is make sure that the jury and every one else hears our questions and answers . And next , when you 're all set , you 're going to begin with your life as you remember it — where you were born , where you came from , what your father did and your mother , too , and finally , what you did and why , from the time you went to work until now . I may interrupt you with a few questions now and then , but in the main I 'm going to let you tell it , because I know you can tell it better than any one . "
93755	93764	93787	93787	his	197	" Yay - uss — Yay - uss . "
93765	93770	93787	93787	his	197	" And then what ? "
93771	93775	93787	93787	his	197	" And then ? "
93818	93846	93787	93787	his	197	" I was born in Grand Rapids , Michigan . My parents were conducting a mission there at that time and used to hold open air meetings ... "
93918	93930	94061	94061	he	197	" Were you up with your classes in the public schools ? "
93931	93942	94061	94061	he	197	" No , sir . We had moved too much . "
93943	93956	94061	94061	he	197	" In what grade were you when you were twelve years old ? "
93957	93984	94061	94061	he	197	" Well , I should have been in the seventh but I was only in the sixth . That 's why I did n't like it . "
93985	93996	94061	94061	he	197	" And how about the religious work of your parents ? "
93997	94018	94061	94061	he	197	" Well , it was all right — only I never did like going out nights on the street corners . "
94065	94071	94073	94073	Jephson	320	" But now , Clyde , "
94168	94177	94165	94165	he	197	" And how long did you work there ? "
94178	94185	94165	94165	he	197	" A little over a year . "
94186	94193	94165	94165	he	197	" And why did you leave ? "
94194	94205	94165	94165	he	197	" Well , it was on account of an accident . "
94206	94213	94165	94165	he	197	" What kind of an accident ? "
94279	94288	94289	94289	he	209	" He 'd better go into all that , "
94317	94319	94307	94307	he	197	" spiking "
94331	94344	94307	94307	he	197	" How old were you then , Clyde , did you say ? "
94345	94351	94311	94311	he	320	" Between seventeen and eighteen . "
94352	94361	94362	94362	he	320	" And do you mean to tell me , "
94384	94424	94362	94362	he	320	" that you did n't know that you might have gone back there , since you were not the one who took the car , and after explaining it all , been paroled in the custody of your parents ? "
94425	94428	94430	94430	Mason	209	" Object ! "
94432	94458	94430	94430	Mason	209	" There 's no evidence here to show that he could have returned to Kansas City and been paroled in the custody of his parents . "
94459	94463	94465	94466	the judge	4625	" Objection sustained ! "
94472	94490	94465	94466	the judge	4625	" The defense will please confine itself a little more closely to the letter of the testimony . "
94491	94494	94499	94499	his	323	" Exception , "
94502	94513	94515	94515	Clyde	197	" No , sir . I did n't know that , "
94521	94543	94545	94545	Jephson	320	" Anyhow was that the reason after you got away that you changed your name to Tenet as you told me ? "
94547	94552	94465	94466	the judge	4625	" Yes , sir . "
94553	94570	94499	94499	his	323	" By the way , just where did you get that name of Tenet , Clyde ? "
94571	94587	94465	94466	the judge	4625	" It was the name of a boy I used to play with in Quincy . "
94588	94595	94499	94499	his	323	" Was he a good boy ? "
94596	94599	94601	94601	Mason	209	" Object ! "
94607	94614	94601	94601	Mason	209	" Incompetent , immaterial , irrelevant . "
94615	94648	94650	94650	Jephson	320	" Oh , he might have associated with a good boy in spite of what you would like to have the jury believe , and in that sense it is very relevant , "
94652	94656	94658	94659	Justice Oberwaltzer	326	" Objection sustained ! "
94661	94701	94601	94601	Mason	209	" But did n't it occur to you at the time that he might object or that you might be doing him an injustice in using his name to cover the identity of a fellow who was running away ? "
94702	94715	94601	94601	Mason	209	" No , sir — I thought there were lots of Tenets . "
94750	94756	94758	94758	Jephson	320	" Now listen , Clyde , "
94777	94790	94763	94763	he	320	" you cared for your mother , did you?—or did n't you ? "
94802	94813	94815	94815	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir , certainly I cared for her , "
94845	94848	94815	94815	Clyde	197	" Much ? "
94849	94856	94857	94857	He	197	" Yes , sir — much . "
94868	94886	94815	94815	Clyde	197	" Had n't she always done as much as she could for you , in her way ? "
94887	94892	94815	94815	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . "
94893	94965	94815	94815	Clyde	197	" Well , then , Clyde , how was it , after all that , and even though that dreadful accident had occurred , you could run away and stay away so long without so much as one word to tell her that you were by no means as guilty as you seemed and that she should n't worry because you were working and trying to be a good boy again ? "
94966	94981	94815	94815	Clyde	197	" But I did write her — only I did n't sign my name . "
94982	94989	94815	94815	Clyde	197	" I see . Anything else ? "
94990	95006	94815	94815	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . I sent her a little money . Ten dollars once . "
95007	95019	94815	94815	Clyde	197	" But you did n't think of going back at all ? "
95020	95038	94815	94815	Clyde	197	" No , sir . I was afraid that if I went back they might arrest me . "
95039	95044	95047	95047	Jephson	320	" In other words , "
95054	95072	95047	95047	Jephson	320	" you were a moral and mental coward , as Mr. Belknap , my colleague , said . "
95073	95091	95093	95093	Mason	209	" I object to this interpretation of this defendant 's testimony for the benefit of the jury ! "
95095	95118	95121	95121	Jephson	320	" This defendant 's testimony really needs no interpretation . It is very plain and honest , as any one can see , "
95123	95127	95129	95130	the judge	4625	" Objection sustained ! "
95132	95137	95129	95130	the judge	4625	" Proceed . Proceed . "
95138	95185	95193	95194	the judge	4625	" And it was because you were a moral and mental coward as I see it , Clyde — not that I am condemning you for anything that you can not help . ( After all , you did n't make yourself , did you ? ) "
95208	95269	95271	95271	Jephson	320	" Then you went about in Alton , Peoria , Bloomington , Milwaukee , and Chicago — hiding away in small rooms in back streets and working as a dishwasher or soda fountain man , or a driver , and changing your name to Tenet when you really might have gone back to Kansas City and resumed your old place ? "
95273	95280	95282	95282	Mason	209	" I object ! I object ! "
95284	95304	95282	95282	Mason	209	" There is no evidence here to show that he could have gone there and resumed his old place . "
95305	95309	95311	95311	Oberwaltzer	326	" Objection sustained , "
95715	95730	95677	95677	Jephson	320	" Clyde ! You really loved Roberta Alden at first , did n't you ? "
95731	95736	95677	95677	Jephson	320	" Yes , sir . "
95737	95776	95677	95677	Jephson	320	" Well , then , you must have known , or at least you gathered from her actions , from the first , did n't you , that she was a perfectly good and innocent and religious girl . "
95777	95790	95792	95792	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir , that 's how I felt about her , "
95803	95849	95853	95853	he	197	" Well , then , just roughly now , without going into detail , do you suppose you could explain to yourself and this jury how and why and where and when those changes came about which led to that relationship which we all of us "
95871	95927	95853	95853	he	197	" deplore . How was it , if you thought so highly of her at first that you could so soon afterwards descend to this evil relationship ? Did n't you know that all men , and all women also , view it as wrong , and outside of marriage unforgivable — a statutory crime ? "
96034	96070	96031	96031	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir , I suppose I did — certainly — but I did n't try to seduce her at first or at any time , really . I was in love with her . "
96071	96079	96759	96759	he	2750	" You were in love with her ? "
96080	96085	96031	96031	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . "
96086	96090	96759	96759	he	2750	" Very much ? "
96091	96095	96031	96031	Clyde	197	" Very much . "
96096	96110	96759	96759	he	2750	" And was she as much in love with you at that time ? "
96111	96119	96031	96031	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir , she was . "
96120	96126	96759	96759	he	2750	" From the very first ? "
96127	96133	96031	96031	Clyde	197	" From the very first . "
96134	96140	96759	96759	he	2750	" She told you so ? "
96141	96146	96031	96031	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . "
96147	96190	96759	96759	he	2750	" At the time she left the Newtons — you have heard all the testimony here in regard to that — did you induce or seek to induce her in any way , by any trick or agreement , to leave there ? "
96191	96220	96031	96031	Clyde	197	" No , sir , I did n't . She wanted to leave there of her own accord . She wanted me to help her find a place . "
96221	96232	96759	96759	he	2750	" She wanted you to help her find a place ? "
96233	96238	96031	96031	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . "
96239	96244	96759	96759	he	2750	" And just why ? "
96245	96279	96031	96031	Clyde	197	" Because she did n't know the city very well and she thought maybe I could tell her where there was a nice room she could get — one that she could afford . "
96280	96296	96759	96759	he	2750	" And did you tell her about the room she took at the Gilpins ' ? "
96297	96319	96031	96031	Clyde	197	" No , sir , I did n't . I never told her about any room . She found it herself . "
96331	96340	96759	96759	he	2750	" But why did n't you help her ? "
96341	96373	96759	96759	he	2750	" Because I was busy , days and most evenings . And besides I thought she knew better what she wanted than I did — the kind of people and all . "
96374	96388	96759	96759	he	2750	" Did you personally ever see the Gilpin place before she went there ? "
96389	96394	96759	96759	he	2750	" No , sir . "
96395	96435	96759	96759	he	2750	" Ever have any discussion with her before she moved there as to the kind of a room she was to take — its position as regards to entrance , exit , privacy , or anything of that sort ? "
96436	96445	96759	96759	he	2750	" No , sir , I never did . "
96446	96478	96759	96759	he	2750	" Never insisted , for instance , that she take a certain type of room which you could slip in and out of at night or by day without being seen ? "
96479	96502	96759	96759	he	2750	" I never did . Besides , no one could very well slip in or out of that house without being seen . "
96503	96508	96759	96759	he	2750	" And why not ? "
96509	96541	96759	96759	he	2750	" Because the door to her room was right next to the door to the general front entrance where everybody went in and out and anybody that was around could see . "
96550	96562	96759	96759	he	2750	" But you slipped in and out , did n't you ? "
96563	96591	96759	96759	he	2750	" Well , yes , sir — that is , we both decided from the first that the less we were seen together anywhere , the better . "
96592	96600	96759	96759	he	2750	" On account of that factory rule ? "
96601	96613	96759	96759	he	2750	" Yes , sir — on account of that factory rule . "
96634	96758	96759	96759	he	2750	" Now , Clyde , we will have to go into the matter of this Miss X a little . Because of an agreement between the defense and the prosecution which you gentlemen of the jury fully understand , we can only touch on this incidentally , since it all concerns an entirely innocent person whose real name can be of no service here anyhow . But some of the facts must be touched upon , although we will deal with them as light as possible , as much for the sake of the innocent living as the worthy dead . And I am sure Miss Alden would have it so if she were alive . But now in regard to Miss X , "
96766	96798	96759	96759	he	2750	" it is already agreed by both sides that you met her in Lycurgus some time in November or December of last year . That is correct , is it not ? "
96799	96808	96810	96810	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir , that is correct , "
96814	96828	96759	96759	he	2750	" And that at once you fell very much in love with her ? "
96829	96838	96759	96759	he	2750	" Yes , sir . That 's true . "
96839	96844	96759	96759	he	2750	" She was rich ? "
96845	96850	96759	96759	he	2750	" Yes , sir . "
96851	96853	96759	96759	he	2750	" Beautiful ?
96854	96866	96867	96867	he	2750	" I believe it is admitted by all that she is , "
96897	96902	96884	96885	the latter	760	" Yes , sir . "
96903	96933	96759	96759	he	2750	" Had you two — yourself and Miss Alden , I mean — at that time when you first met Miss X already established that illicit relationship referred to ? "
96934	96939	96884	96885	the latter	760	" Yes , sir . "
96940	97001	96759	96759	he	2750	" Well , now , in view of all that — but no , one moment , there is something else I want to ask you first — now , let me see — at the time that you first met this Miss X you were still in love with Roberta Alden , were you — or were you not ? "
97002	97015	96884	96885	the latter	760	" I was still in love with her — yes , sir . "
97016	97040	96759	96759	he	2750	" You had not , up to that time at least , in any way become weary of her ? Or had you ? "
97041	97050	96884	96885	the latter	760	" No , sir . I had not . "
97051	97068	96759	96759	he	2750	" Her love and her companionship were just as precious and delightful to you as ever ? "
97069	97077	96884	96885	the latter	760	" Yes , sir , they were . "
97124	97161	97080	97080	Clyde	197	" And what , if any , were your plans for your future with Miss Alden — before you met this Miss X ? You must have thought at times of that , did n't you ? "
97162	97168	97172	97172	he	197	" Well , not exactly , "
97184	97294	97175	97175	he	197	" You see , I never had any real plan to do anything — that is , to do anything that was n't quite right with her . And neither did she , of course . We just drifted kinda , from the first . It was being alone there so much , maybe . She had n't taken up with anybody yet and I had n't either . And then there was that rule that kept me from taking her about anywhere , and once we were together , of course we just went on without thinking very much about it , I suppose — either of us . "
97295	97318	97080	97080	Clyde	197	" You just drifted because nothing had happened as yet and you did n't suppose anything would . Is that the way ? "
97319	97338	97339	97339	Clyde	197	" No , sir . I mean , yes , sir . That 's the way it was . "
97357	97384	97339	97339	Clyde	197	" But you must have thought of something — one or both of you . You were twenty - one and she was twenty - three . "
97385	97406	97339	97339	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . I suppose we did — I suppose I did think of something now and then . "
97407	97420	97339	97339	Clyde	197	" And what was it that you thought ? Can you recollect ? "
97421	97499	97339	97339	Clyde	197	" Well , yes , sir . I suppose I can . That is , I know that I did think at times that if things went all right and I made a little more money and she got a place somewhere else , that I would begin taking her out openly , and then afterwards maybe , if she and I kept on caring for each other as we did then , marry her , maybe . "
97500	97512	97339	97339	Clyde	197	" You actually thought of marrying her then , did you ? "
97513	97533	97339	97339	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . I know I did in the way that I 've said , of course . "
97534	97545	97339	97339	Clyde	197	" But that was before you met this Miss X ? "
97546	97556	97339	97339	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir , that was before that . "
97558	97562	97564	97564	Mason	209	" Beautifully done ! "
97576	97581	97583	97583	Redmond	385	" Excellent stage play , "
97590	97602	97604	97604	Jephson	320	" But did you ever tell her in so many words ? "
97606	97628	97569	97569	his	209	" Well , no , sir . I do n't recall that I did — not just in so many words . "
97629	97647	97569	97569	his	209	" You either told her or you did n't tell her . Now , which was it ? "
97648	97681	97569	97569	his	209	" Well , neither , quite . I used to tell her that I loved her and that I never wanted her to leave me and that I hoped she never would . "
97682	97692	97569	97569	his	209	" But not that you wanted to marry her ? "
97693	97706	97569	97569	his	209	" No , sir . Not that I wanted to marry her . "
97707	97721	97569	97569	his	209	" Well , well , all right!—and she — what did she say ? "
97722	97730	97732	97732	Clyde	197	" That she never would leave me , "
97778	97782	97784	97784	Mason	209	" Well staged ! "
97790	97797	97799	97799	Redmond	385	" Pretty shrewd — pretty shrewd ! "
97804	97810	97813	97813	Jephson	320	" But , tell me , "
97819	97861	97813	97813	Jephson	320	" feeling as you did about Miss Alden , how was it that upon meeting this Miss X , you could change so quickly ? Are you so fickle that you do n't know your own mind from day to day ? "
97862	97879	97799	97799	Redmond	385	" Well , I did n't think so up to that time — no , sir ! "
97880	97903	97813	97813	Jephson	320	" Had you ever had a strong and binding love affair at any time in your life before you met Miss Alden ? "
97904	97909	97799	97799	Redmond	385	" No , sir . "
97910	97939	97813	97813	Jephson	320	" But did you consider this one with Miss Alden strong and binding — a true love affair — up to the time you met this Miss X ? "
97940	97948	97799	97799	Redmond	385	" Yes , sir , I did . "
97949	97956	97813	97813	Jephson	320	" And afterwards — then what ? "
97957	97971	97799	97799	Redmond	385	" Well — afterwards — it was n't quite like that any more . "
97972	98000	97813	97813	Jephson	320	" You mean to say that on sight of Miss X , after encountering her once or twice , you ceased to care for Miss Alden entirely ? "
98001	98015	98017	98017	Clyde	197	" Well , no , sir . It was n't quite like that , "
98023	98057	98017	98017	Clyde	197	" I did continue to care for her some — quite a lot , really . But before I knew it I had completely lost my head over — over Miss — Miss — "
98058	98084	97813	97813	Jephson	320	" Yes , this Miss X. We know . You fell madly and unreasonably in love with her . Was that the way of it ? "
98085	98090	98017	98017	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . "
98091	98095	97813	97813	Jephson	320	" And then ? "
98096	98115	98017	98017	Clyde	197	" Well — and then — I just could n't care for Miss Alden so much any more . "
98131	98138	98141	98141	Jephson	320	" I see ! I see ! "
98155	98170	98141	98141	Jephson	320	" A case of the Arabian Nights , of the enscorcelled and the enscorcellor . "
98171	98182	98184	98184	Clyde	197	" I do n't think I know what you mean , "
98186	98243	98141	98141	Jephson	320	" A case of being betwitched , my poor boy — by beauty , love , wealth , by things that we sometimes think we want very , very much , and can not ever have — that is what I mean , and that is what much of the love in the world amounts to . "
98244	98249	98251	98251	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir , "
98270	98386	98141	98141	Jephson	320	" But what I want to know is — how was it that loving Miss Alden as much as you say you did — and having reached that relationship which should have been sanctified by marriage — how was it that you could have felt so little bound or obligated to her as to entertain the idea of casting her over for this Miss X ? Now just how was that ? I would like to know , and so would this jury , I am sure . Where was your sense of gratitude ? Your sense of moral obligation ? Do you mean to say that you have none ? We want to know . "
98413	98416	98419	98419	Clyde	197	" Well ... "
98531	98639	98712	98712	He	197	" The fact is , I did n't think about those things at all very much . I could n't after I saw her . I tried to at times , but I could n't . I only wanted her and I did n't want Miss Alden any more . I knew I was n't doing right — exactly — and I felt sorry for Roberta — but just the same I did n't seem able to do anything much about it . I could only think of Miss X and I could n't think of Roberta as I had before no matter how hard I tried . "
98640	98660	98712	98712	He	197	" Do you mean to say that you did n't suffer in your own conscience on account of this ? "
98661	98669	98671	98671	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir , I suffered , "
98673	98710	98712	98712	He	197	" I knew I was n't doing right , and it made me worry a lot about her and myself , but just the same I did n't seem to be able to do any better . "
98746	98750	98712	98712	He	197	" And then ? "
98751	98773	98712	98712	He	197	" Well , then she began to complain because I did n't go round to see her as much as before . "
98774	98785	98712	98712	He	197	" In other words , you began to neglect her . "
98786	98801	98712	98712	He	197	" Yes , sir , some — but not entirely — no , sir . "
98802	98846	98712	98712	He	197	" Well , when you found you were so infatuated with this Miss X , what did you do ? Did you go and tell Miss Alden that you were no longer in love with her but in love with some one else ? "
98847	98857	98712	98712	He	197	" No , I did n't . Not then . "
98858	98883	98712	98712	He	197	" Why not then ? Did you think it fair and honorable to be telling two girls at once that you cared for them ? "
98884	98946	98712	98712	He	197	" No , sir , but it was n't quite like that either . You see at that time I was just getting acquainted with Miss X , and I was n't telling her anything . She would n't let me . But I knew then , just the same , that I could n't care for Miss Alden any more . "
98947	98980	98712	98712	He	197	" But what about the claim Miss Alden had on you ? Did n't you feel that that was enough or should be , to prevent you from running after another girl ? "
98981	98986	98712	98712	He	197	" Yes , sir . "
98987	98995	98712	98712	He	197	" Well , why did you then ? "
98996	99003	98712	98712	He	197	" I could n't resist her . "
99004	99011	98712	98712	He	197	" Miss X , you mean ? "
99012	99017	98712	98712	He	197	" Yes , sir . "
99018	99036	98712	98712	He	197	" And so you continued to run after her until you had made her care for you ? "
99037	99050	98712	98712	He	197	" No , sir , that was n't the way at all . "
99051	99060	98712	98712	He	197	" Well then , what was the way ? "
99061	99075	98712	98712	He	197	" I just met her here and there and got crazy about her . "
99076	99100	98712	98712	He	197	" I see . But still you did n't go and tell Miss Alden that you could n't care for her any longer ? "
99101	99109	98712	98712	He	197	" No , sir . Not then . "
99110	99115	98712	98712	He	197	" And why not ? "
99116	99134	98712	98712	He	197	" Because I thought it would hurt her , and I did n't want to do that . "
99135	99155	98712	98712	He	197	" Oh , I see . You did n't have the moral or mental courage to do it then ? "
99156	99168	99170	99170	Clyde	197	" I do n't know about the moral or mental courage , "
99183	99210	99170	99170	Clyde	197	" but I felt sorry for her just the same . She used to cry and I did n't have the heart to tell her anything . "
99211	99263	99280	99280	Clyde	197	" I see . Well , let it stand that way , if you want to . But now answer me one other thing . That relationship between you two — what about that — after you knew that you did n't care for her any more . Did that continue ? "
99264	99278	99280	99280	Clyde	197	" Well , no , sir , not so very long , anyhow , "
99352	99429	99348	99348	Jephson	320	" Educational effect . The quicker and harder we can shock 'em with some of the real facts of life around here , the easier it is going to be for you to get a little more sane consideration of what your problem was . But do n't worry your head over that now . When the time comes , just answer 'em and leave the rest to us . We know what we 're doing . "
99436	99492	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" You see , after meeting Miss X I could n't care for her so much that way any more , and so I tried not to go around her so much any more . But anyhow , it was n't so very long after that before she got in trouble and then — well — "
99493	99504	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" I see . And when was that — about ? "
99505	99516	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" Along in the latter part of January last year . "
99517	99545	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" And once that happened , then what ? Did you or did you not feel that it was your duty under the circumstances to marry her ? "
99546	99573	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" Well , no — not the way things were then — that is , if I could get her out of it , I mean . "
99574	99591	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" And why not ? What do you mean by ' as things were then ' ? "
99592	99660	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" Well , you see , it was just as I told you . I was n't caring for her any more , and since I had n't promised to marry her , and she knew it , I thought it would be fair enough if I helped her out of it and then told her that I did n't care for her as I once did . "
99661	99672	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" But could n't you help her out of it ? "
99673	99682	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" No , sir . But I tried . "
99683	99693	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" You went to that druggist who testified here ? "
99694	99699	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . "
99700	99705	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" To anybody else ? "
99706	99722	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir — to seven others before I could get anything at all . "
99723	99732	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" But what you got did n't help ? "
99733	99738	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" No , sir . "
99739	99754	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" Did you go to that young haberdasher who testified here as he said ? "
99755	99760	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . "
99761	99774	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" And did he give you the name of any particular doctor ? "
99775	99790	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" Well — yes — but I would n't care to say which one . "
99791	99809	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" All right , you need n't . But did you send Miss Alden to any doctor ? "
99810	99815	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . "
99816	99828	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" Did she go alone or did you go with her ? "
99829	99842	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" I went with her — that is , to the door . "
99843	99850	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" Why only to the door ? "
99851	99910	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" Well , we talked it over , and she thought just as I did , that it might be better that way . I did n't have any too much money at the time . I thought he might be willing to help her for less if she went by herself than if we both went together . "
99912	99927	99929	99929	Mason	209	" I 'll be damned if he is n't stealing most of my thunder , "
99936	99951	99931	99931	himself	209	" He 's forestalling most of the things I intended to riddle him with . "
99977	100003	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" I see . And it was n't by any chance because you were afraid that your uncle or Miss X might hear of it ? "
100004	100034	99970	99970	Jephson	320	" Oh , yes , I ... that is , we both thought of that and talked of it . She understood how things were with me down there . "
100035	100042	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" But not about Miss X ? "
100043	100050	99970	99970	Jephson	320	" No , not about Miss X. "
100051	100056	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" And why not ? "
100057	100094	99970	99970	Jephson	320	" Well , because I did n't think I could very well tell her just then . It would have made her feel too bad . I wanted to wait until she was all right again . "
100095	100110	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" And then tell her and leave her . Is that what you mean ? "
100111	100131	99970	99970	Jephson	320	" Well , yes , if I still could n't care for her any more — yes , sir . "
100132	100141	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" But not if she was in trouble ? "
100142	100176	99970	99970	Jephson	320	" Well , no , sir , not if she was in trouble . But you see , at that time I was expecting to be able to get her out of that . "
100177	100213	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" I see . But did n't her condition affect your attitude toward her — cause you to want to straighten the whole thing out by giving up this Miss X and marrying Miss Alden ? "
100214	100233	99970	99970	Jephson	320	" Well , no , sir — not then exactly — that is , not at that time . "
100234	100244	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" How do you mean—'not at that time ' ? "
100245	100280	99970	99970	Jephson	320	" Well , I did come to feel that way later , as I told you — but not then — that was afterwards — after we started on our trip to the Adirondacks — "
100281	100287	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" And why not then ? "
100288	100308	99970	99970	Jephson	320	" I 've said why . I was too crazy about Miss X to think of anything but her . "
100309	100317	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" You could n't change even then ? "
100318	100332	99970	99970	Jephson	320	" No , sir . I felt sorry , but I could n't . "
100333	100420	99433	99433	Clyde	197	" I see . But never mind that now . I will come to that later . Just now I want to have you explain to the jury , if you can , just what it was about this Miss X , as contrasted with Miss Alden , that made her seem so very much more desirable in your eyes . Just what characteristics of manner or face or mind or position — or whatever it was that so enticed you ? Or do you know ? "
100544	100737	100536	100536	he	197	" Well , you see , it 's hard to say . She was very beautiful to me . Much more so than Roberta — but not only that , she was different from any one I had ever known — more independent — and everybody paid so much attention to what she did and what she said . She seemed to know more than any one else I ever knew . Then she dressed awfully well , and was very rich and in society and her name and pictures were always in the paper . I used to read about her every day when I did n't see her , and that seemed to keep her before me a lot . She was daring , too — not so simple or trusting as Miss Alden was — and at first it was hard for me to believe that she was becoming so interested in me . It got so that I could n't think of any one or anything else , and I did n't want Roberta any more . I just could n't , with Miss X always before me . "
100738	100759	100772	100772	his	320	" Well , it looks to me as if you might have been in love , or hypnotized at that , "
100779	100804	100772	100772	his	320	" If that is n't a picture of pretty much all gone , I guess I do n't know one when I see it . "
100848	100910	100927	100927	Clyde	197	" Well , now , Clyde , from there on , just what happened ? Tell us now , as near as you can recall . Do n't shade it or try to make yourself look any better or any worse . She is dead , and you may be , eventually , if these twelve gentlemen here finally so decide . "
100930	100943	100927	100927	Clyde	197	" But the truth for the peace of your own soul is the best,"—and
100958	100963	100965	100965	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir , "
100969	101015	100927	100927	Clyde	197	" Well , then , after she got in trouble and you could n't help her , then what ? What was it you did ? How did you act? ... By the way , one moment — what was your salary at that time ? "
101016	101024	101026	101026	Clyde	197	" Twenty - five dollars a week , "
101028	101035	100927	100927	Clyde	197	" No other source of income ? "
101036	101043	100927	100927	Clyde	197	" I did n't quite hear . "
101044	101064	100927	100927	Clyde	197	" Was there any other source from which you were obtaining any money at that time in any way ? "
101065	101070	100927	100927	Clyde	197	" No , sir . "
101071	101079	100927	100927	Clyde	197	" And how much was your room ? "
101080	101086	100927	100927	Clyde	197	" Seven dollars a week . "
101087	101092	100927	100927	Clyde	197	" And your board ? "
101093	101101	100927	100927	Clyde	197	" Oh , from five to six . "
101102	101107	100927	100927	Clyde	197	" Any other expenses ? "
101108	101118	100927	100927	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir — my clothes and laundry . "
101119	101138	100927	100927	Clyde	197	" You had to stand your share of whatever social doings were on foot , did n't you ? "
101139	101145	101147	101147	Mason	209	" Objected to as leading ! "
101149	101153	101155	101156	Justice Oberwaltzer	326	" Objection sustained , "
101158	101168	100927	100927	Clyde	197	" Any other expenses that you can think of ? "
101169	101191	100927	100927	Clyde	197	" Well , there were carfares and trainfares . And then I had to share in whatever social expenses there were . "
101192	101195	101197	101197	Mason	209	" Exactly ! "
101203	101214	101197	101197	Mason	209	" I wish you would quit leading this parrot here . "
101215	101228	101230	101230	Jephson	320	" I wish the honorable district attorney would mind his own business ! "
101253	101290	101243	101243	He	320	" I 'm examining this defendant , and as for parrots we 've seen quite a number of them around here in the last few weeks , and coached to the throat like school - boys . "
101291	101298	101300	101300	Mason	209	" That 's a malicious lie ! "
101302	101310	101300	101300	Mason	209	" I object and demand an apology . "
101311	101345	101355	101355	he	320	" The apology is to me and to this defendant , if your Honor pleases , and will be exacted quickly if your Honor will only adjourn this court for a few minutes , "
101358	101372	101355	101355	he	320	" And I will be able to obtain it without any judicial aid . "
101426	101475	101423	101423	his	320	" Gentlemen ! Gentlemen ! You are both in contempt of court , both of you ! You will apologize to the court and to each other , or I 'll declare a mistrial and commit you both for ten days and fine you five hundred dollars each . "
101497	101543	101489	101489	Jephson	320	" Under the circumstances , your Honor , I apologize to you and to the attorney for the People and to this jury . The attack on this defendant , by the district attorney , seemed too unfair and uncalled for — that was all . "
101544	101549	101551	101551	Oberwaltzer	326	" Never mind that , "
101553	101587	101589	101589	Mason	209	" Under the circumstances , your Honor , I apologize to you and to the counsel for the defense . I was a little hasty , perhaps . And to this defendant also , "
101615	101618	101620	101620	Oberwaltzer	326	" Proceed , "
101624	101629	101631	101631	Jephson	320	" Now , Clyde , "
101648	101685	101638	101638	he	320	" You say your salary was twenty - five dollars and you had these various expenses . Had you , up to this time , been able to put aside any money for a rainy day ? "
101686	101699	101620	101620	Oberwaltzer	326	" No , sir — not much — not any , really . "
101700	101737	101638	101638	he	320	" Well , then , supposing some doctor to whom Miss Alden had applied had been willing to assist her and wanted — say a hundred dollars or so — were you ready to furnish that ? "
101738	101750	101620	101620	Oberwaltzer	326	" No , sir — not right off , that is . "
101751	101765	101638	101638	he	320	" Did she have any money of her own that you know of ? "
101766	101777	101620	101620	Oberwaltzer	326	" None that I know of — no , sir . "
101778	101790	101638	101638	he	320	" Well , how did you intend to help her then ? "
101791	101829	101620	101620	Oberwaltzer	326	" Well , I thought if either she or I found any one and he would wait and let me pay for it on time , that I could save and pay it that way , maybe . "
101830	101845	101638	101638	he	320	" I see . You were perfectly willing to do that , were you ? "
101846	101854	101620	101620	Oberwaltzer	326	" Yes , sir , I was . "
101855	101864	101638	101638	he	320	" You told her so , did you ? "
101865	101874	101620	101620	Oberwaltzer	326	" Yes , sir . She knew that . "
101875	101900	101638	101638	he	320	" Well , when neither you nor she could find any one to help her , then what ? What did you do next ? "
101901	101912	101620	101620	Oberwaltzer	326	" Well , then she wanted me to marry her . "
101913	101917	101638	101638	he	320	" Right away ? "
101918	101926	101620	101620	Oberwaltzer	326	" Yes , sir . Right away . "
101927	101936	101638	101638	he	320	" And what did you say to that ? "
101937	101997	101620	101620	Oberwaltzer	326	" I told her I just could n't then . I did n't have any money to get married on . And besides if I did and did n't go away somewhere , at least until the baby was born , everybody would find out and I could n't have stayed there anyhow . And she could n't either . "
101998	102003	101638	101638	he	320	" And why not ? "
102004	102030	101620	101620	Oberwaltzer	326	" Well , there were my relatives . They would n't have wanted to keep me any more , or her either , I guess . "
102031	102057	101638	101638	he	320	" I see . They would n't have considered you fit for the work you were doing , or her either . Is that it ? "
102058	102065	102067	102067	Clyde	197	" I thought so , anyhow , "
102069	102074	101638	101638	he	320	" And then what ? "
102075	102151	101638	101638	he	320	" Well , even if I had wanted to go away with her and marry her , I did n't have enough money to do that and she did n't either . I would have had to give up my place and gone and found another somewhere before I could let her come . Besides that , I did n't know any place where I could go and earn as much as I did there . "
102152	102167	101638	101638	he	320	" How about hotel work ? Could n't you have gone back to that ? "
102168	102193	101638	101638	he	320	" Well , maybe — if I had an introduction of some kind . But I did n't want to go back to that . "
102194	102199	101638	101638	he	320	" And why not ? "
102200	102219	101638	101638	he	320	" Well , I did n't like it so much any more — not that kind of life . "
102220	102249	101638	101638	he	320	" But you did n't mean that you did n't want to do anything at all , did you ? That was n't your attitude , was it ? "
102250	102313	101638	101638	he	320	" Oh , no , sir . That was n't it . I told her right away if she would go away for a while — while she had her baby — and let me stay on there in Lycurgus , that I would try to live on less and give her all I could save until she was all right again . "
102314	102320	101638	101638	he	320	" But not marry her ? "
102321	102337	101638	101638	he	320	" No , sir , I did n't feel that I could do that then . "
102338	102347	101638	101638	he	320	" And what did she say to that ? "
102348	102373	101638	101638	he	320	" She would n't do it . She said she could n't and would n't go through with it unless I would marry her . "
102374	102382	101638	101638	he	320	" I see . Then and there ? "
102383	102414	101638	101638	he	320	" Well , yes — pretty soon , anyhow . She was willing to wait a little while , but she would n't go away unless I would marry her . "
102415	102431	101638	101638	he	320	" And did you tell her that you did n't care for her any more ? "
102432	102440	101638	101638	he	320	" Well , nearly — yes , sir "
102441	102451	101638	101638	he	320	" What do you mean by ' nearly ' ? "
102452	102480	101638	101638	he	320	" Well , that I did n't want to . Besides , she knew I did n't care for her any more . She said so herself . "
102481	102489	101638	101638	he	320	" To you , at that time ? "
102490	102499	101638	101638	he	320	" Yes , sir . Lots of times . "
102500	102536	101638	101638	he	320	" Well , yes , that 's true — it was in all of those letters of hers that were read here . But when she refused so flatly , what did you do then ? "
102537	102597	102599	102599	Clyde	197	" Well , I did n't know what to do . But I thought maybe if I could get her to go up to her home for a while , while I tried and saved what I could — well ... maybe ... once she was up there and saw how much I did n't want to marry her — "
102613	102639	101638	101638	he	320	" Yes , go on . And remember , the truth , however ashamed of it you may be , is better than any lie . "
102640	102655	101638	101638	he	320	" And maybe when she was a little more frightened and not so determined — "
102656	102664	101638	101638	he	320	" Were n't you frightened , too ? "
102665	102673	101638	101638	he	320	" Yes , sir , I was . "
102674	102680	101638	101638	he	320	" Well , go on . "
102681	102745	101638	101638	he	320	" That then — well — maybe if I offered her all that I had been able to save up to then — you see I thought maybe I might be able to borrow some from some one too — that she might be willing to go away and not make me marry her — just live somewhere and let me help her . "
102746	102758	101638	101638	he	320	" I see . But she would n't agree to that ? "
102759	102798	101638	101638	he	320	" Well , no — not to my not marrying her , no — but to going up there for a month , yes . I could n't get her to say that she would let me off . "
102799	102825	101638	101638	he	320	" But did you at that or any other time before or subsequent to that say that you would come up there and marry her ? "
102826	102835	101638	101638	he	320	" No , sir . I never did . "
102836	102844	101638	101638	he	320	" Just what did you say then ? "
102845	102859	102861	102861	Clyde	197	" I said that ... as soon as I could get the money , "
102873	102902	102871	102871	he	197	" I would come for her in about a month and we could go away somewhere until — until — well , until she was out of that . "
102903	102916	101638	101638	he	320	" But you did not tell her that you would marry her ? "
102917	102926	102871	102871	he	197	" No , sir . I did not . "
102927	102937	101638	101638	he	320	" But she wanted you to , of course . "
102938	102943	102871	102871	he	197	" Yes , sir . "
102944	102970	101638	101638	he	320	" Had you any notion that she could force you so to do at that time — marry her against your will , I mean ? "
102971	103031	102871	102871	he	197	" No , sir , I did n't . Not if I could help it . My plan was to wait as long as I could and save all the money I could and then when the time came just refuse and give her all the money that I had and help her all I could from then on . "
103032	103037	103039	103039	Jephson	320	" But you know , "
103049	103062	103063	103063	he	320	" there are various references in these letters here which Miss Alden wrote you"—and
103086	103135	103063	103063	he	320	hand—"to a plan which you two had in connection with this trip — or at least that she seemed to think you had . Now , exactly what was that plan ? She distinctly refers to it , if I recall aright , as ' our plan . ' "
103136	103141	103143	103143	Clyde	197	" I know that , "
103164	103171	103173	103173	he	320	" But the only plan I know of"—and
103182	103191	103173	103173	he	320	convincing—"was the one I offered over and over . "
103192	103198	103154	103154	Belknap	323	" And what was that ? "
103199	103227	103173	103173	he	320	" Why , that she go away and take a room somewhere and let me help her and come over and see her once in a while . "
103228	103238	103240	103240	Jephson	320	" Well , no , you 're wrong there , "
103244	103302	103240	103240	Jephson	320	" That is n't and could n't be the plan she had in mind . She says in one of these letters that she knows it will be hard on you to have to go away and stay so long , or until she is out of this thing , but that it ca n't be helped . "
103303	103309	103311	103311	Clyde	197	" Yes , I know , "
103324	103405	103311	103311	Clyde	197	" but that was her plan , not mine . She kept saying to me most of the time that that was what she wanted me to do , and that I would have to do it . She told me that over the telephone several times , and I may have said all right , all right , not meaning that I agreed with her entirely but that I wanted to talk with her about it some more later . "
103406	103428	103240	103240	Jephson	320	" I see . And so that 's what you think — that she meant one thing and you meant another . "
103429	103491	103311	103311	Clyde	197	" Well , I know I never agreed to her plan — exactly . That is , I never did any more than just to ask her to wait and not do anything until I could get money enough together to come up there and talk to her some more and get her to go away — the way I suggested . "
103492	103506	103240	103240	Jephson	320	" But if she would n't accede to your plan , then what ? "
103507	103529	103311	103311	Clyde	197	" Well , then I was going to tell her about Miss X , and beg her to let me go . "
103530	103538	103240	103240	Jephson	320	" And if she still would n't ? "
103539	103562	103311	103311	Clyde	197	" Well , then I thought I might run away , but I did n't like to think about that very much . "
103563	103654	103240	103240	Jephson	320	" You know , Clyde , of course , that some here are of the opinion that there was a plot on your part which originated in your mind about this time to conceal your identity and hers and lure her up there to one of those lone lakes in the Adirondacks and slay her or drown her in cold blood , in order that you might be free to marry this Miss X. Any truth in that ? Tell this jury — yes or no — which is it ? "
103655	103672	103674	103674	Clyde	197	" No ! No ! I never did plot to kill her , or any one , "
103862	103864	103872	103872	his	320	" alleged "
104416	104446	104398	104398	he	197	" But now , Clyde , in regard to your plans and your being out on that lake in the first place — let 's hear about that now . "
104546	104569	104572	104572	Clyde	197	" But when I saw her at Fonda , and later in Utica , looking as tired and worried as she was , "
104587	104602	104572	104572	Clyde	197	" and sort of helpless , I began to feel sorry for her again . "
104603	104610	104572	104572	Clyde	197	" Yes , and then what ? "
104611	104637	104572	104572	Clyde	197	" Well , I was n't quite so sure whether in case she refused to let me off I could go through with leaving her . "
104638	104647	104572	104572	Clyde	197	" Well , what did you decide then ? "
104648	104697	104572	104572	Clyde	197	" Not anything just then . I listened to what she had to say and I tried to tell her how hard it was going to be for me to do anything much , even if I did go away with her . I only had fifty dollars . "
104698	104701	104572	104572	Clyde	197	" Yes ? "
104702	104762	104765	104765	Clyde	197	" And then she began to cry , and I decided I could n't talk to her any more about it there . She was too run - down and nervous . So I asked her if there was n't any place she would like to go to for a day or two to brace herself up a little , "
104815	104868	104794	104794	he	197	" And she said yes , maybe to one of those lakes up in the Adirondacks — it did n't make much difference which one — if we could afford it . And when I told her , mostly because of the way she was feeling , that I thought we could — "
104869	104881	104780	104780	he	197	" Then you really only went up there on her account ? "
104882	104893	104794	104794	he	197	" Yes , sir , only on account of her . "
104894	104901	104780	104780	he	197	" I see . Go on . "
104902	104937	104794	104794	he	197	" Well , then she said if I would go downstairs or somewhere and get some folders we might be able to find a place up there somewhere where it was n't so expensive . "
104938	104943	104780	104780	he	197	" And did you ? "
104944	104949	104794	104794	he	197	" Yes , sir . "
104950	104957	104780	104780	he	197	" Well , and then what ? "
104958	104973	104794	104794	he	197	" Well , we looked them over and we finally hit on Grass Lake . "
104974	104986	104780	104780	he	197	" Who did ? The two of you — or she ? "
104987	105048	104794	104794	he	197	" Well , she took one folder and I took another , and in hers she found an ad about an inn up there where two people could stay for twenty - one dollars a week , or five dollars a day for the two . And I thought we could n't do much better than that for one day . "
105049	105059	104780	104780	he	197	" Was one day all you intended to stay ? "
105060	105115	104794	104794	he	197	" No , sir . Not if she wanted to stay longer . My idea at first was that we might stay one or two days or three . I could n't tell — whatever time it took me to talk things out with her and make her understand and see where I stood . "
105116	105124	104780	104780	he	197	" I see . And then ... ? "
105125	105139	104794	104794	he	197	" Well , then we went up to Grass Lake the next morning . "
105140	105146	104780	104780	he	197	" In separate cars still ? "
105147	105156	104794	104794	he	197	" Yes , sir — in separate cars . "
105157	105164	104780	104780	he	197	" And when you got there ? "
105165	105171	104794	104794	he	197	" Why , we registered . "
105172	105175	104780	104780	he	197	" How ? "
105176	105182	104794	104794	he	197	" Clifford Graham and wife . "
105183	105194	104780	104780	he	197	" Still afraid some one would know who you were ? "
105195	105200	104794	104794	he	197	" Yes , sir . "
105201	105213	104780	104780	he	197	" Did you try to disguise your handwriting in any way ? "
105214	105222	104794	104794	he	197	" Yes , sir — a little . "
105223	105238	104780	104780	he	197	" But just why did you always use your own initials — C. G. ? "
105239	105269	104794	104794	he	197	" Well , I thought that the initials on my bag should be the same as the initials on the register , and still not be my name either . "
105270	105296	104780	104780	he	197	" I see . Clever in one sense , not so clever in another — just half clever , which is the worst of all . "
105338	105366	104794	104794	he	197	" Well , did you finally explain to her that you wanted to be done with it all as you had planned — or did you not ? "
105367	105473	104794	104794	he	197	" I wanted to talk to her about it just after we got there if I could — the next morning , anyhow — but just as soon as we got off up there and got settled she kept saying to me that if I would only marry her then — that she would not want to stay married long — that she was so sick and worried and felt so bad — that all she wanted to do was to get through and give the baby a name , and after that she would go away and let me go my way , too . "
105474	105478	104794	104794	he	197	" And then ? "
105479	105493	104794	104794	he	197	" Well , and then — then we went out on the lake — "
105494	105500	104794	104794	he	197	" Which lake , Clyde ? "
105501	105518	104794	104794	he	197	" Why , Grass Lake . We went out for a row after we got there . "
105519	105527	104794	104794	he	197	" Right away ? In the afternoon ? "
105528	105548	105550	105550	He	2797	" Yes , sir . She wanted to go . And then while we were out there rowing around — "
105554	105620	104794	104794	he	197	" She got to crying again , and she seemed so much up against it and looked so sick and so worried that I decided that after all she was right and I was wrong — that it would n't be right , on account of the baby and all , not to marry her , and so I thought I had better do it . "
105621	105640	104794	104794	he	197	" I see . A change of heart . And did you tell her that then and there ? "
105641	105646	104794	104794	he	197	" No , sir . "
105647	105666	104794	104794	he	197	" And why not ? Were n't you satisfied with the trouble you had caused her so far ? "
105667	105704	104794	104794	he	197	" Yes , sir . But you see just as I was going to talk to her at that time I got to thinking of all the things I had been thinking before I came up . "
105705	105711	104794	104794	he	197	" What , for instance ? "
105712	105739	104794	104794	he	197	" Why , Miss X and my life in Lycurgus , and what we 'd be up against in case we did go away this way . "
105740	105743	104794	104794	he	197	" Yes . "
105744	105765	104794	104794	he	197	" And ... well ... and then I could n't just tell her then — not that day , anyhow . "
105766	105776	104794	104794	he	197	" Well , when did you tell her then ? "
105777	105824	104794	104794	he	197	" Well , I told her not to cry any more — that I thought maybe it would be all right if she gave me twenty - four hours more to think things all out — that maybe we 'd be able to settle on something . "
105825	105829	104794	104794	he	197	" And then ? "
105830	105857	104794	104794	he	197	" Well , then she said after a while that she did n't care for Grass Lake . She wished we would go away from there . "
105858	105862	104794	104794	he	197	" She did ? "
105863	105937	104794	104794	he	197	" Yes . And then we got out the maps again and I asked a fellow at the hotel there if he knew about the lakes up there . And he said of all the lakes around there Big Bittern was the most beautiful . I had seen it once , and I told Roberta about it and what the man said , and then she asked why did n't we go there . "
105938	105947	104794	104794	he	197	" And is that why you went there ? "
105948	105952	104794	104794	he	197	" Yes , sir "
105953	105958	104794	104794	he	197	" No other reason ? "
105959	105983	104794	104794	he	197	" No , sir — none — except that it was back , or south , and we were going that way anyhow . "
105984	105996	104794	104794	he	197	" I see . And that was Thursday , July eighth ? "
105997	106002	104794	104794	he	197	" Yes , sir . "
106003	106094	104794	104794	he	197	" Well , now , Clyde , as you have seen , it has been charged here that you took Miss Alden to and out on that lake with the sole and premeditated intent of killing her — murdering her — finding some unobserved and quiet spot and then first striking her with your camera , or an oar , or club , or stone maybe , and then drowning her . Now , what have you to say to that ? Is that true , or is n't it ? "
106095	106105	106107	106107	Clyde	197	" No , sir ! It 's not true ! "
106113	106140	106107	106107	Clyde	197	" I never went there of my own accord in the first place , and I only went there because she did n't like Grass Lake . "
106193	106216	106190	106190	he	197	" And I wanted to please her in any way that I could so that she might be a little more cheerful . "
106217	106236	106190	106190	he	197	" Were you still as sorry for her on this Thursday as you had been the day before ? "
106237	106247	106190	106190	he	197	" Yes , sir — more , I think . "
106248	106267	106190	106190	he	197	" And had you definitely made up your mind by then as to what you wanted to do ? "
106268	106273	106190	106190	he	197	" Yes , sir . "
106274	106283	106190	106190	he	197	" Well , and just what was that ? "
106284	106373	106190	106190	he	197	" Well , I had decided to play as fair as I could . I had been thinking about it all night , and I realized how badly she would feel and I too if I did n't do the right thing by her — because she had said three or four times that if I did n't she would kill herself . And I had made up my mind that morning that whatever else happened that day , I was going to straighten the whole thing out . "
106374	106391	106190	106190	he	197	" This was at Grass Lake . You were still in the hotel on Thursday morning ? "
106392	106397	106190	106190	he	197	" Yes , sir . "
106398	106409	106190	106190	he	197	" And you were going to tell her just what ? "
106410	106512	106190	106190	he	197	" Well , that I knew that I had n't treated her quite right and that I was sorry — besides , that her offer was fair enough , and that if after what I was going to tell her she still wanted me , I would go away with her and marry her . But that I had to tell her first the real reason for my changing as I had — that I had been and still was in love with another girl and that I could n't help it — that probably whether I married her or not — "
106513	106519	106190	106190	he	197	" Miss Alden you mean ? "
106520	106586	106190	106190	he	197	" Yes , sir — that I would always go on loving this other girl , because I just could n't get her out of my mind . But just the same , if that did n't make any difference to her , that I would marry her even if I could n't love her any more as I once did . That was all . "
106587	106594	106190	106190	he	197	" But what about Miss X ? "
106595	106645	106190	106190	he	197	" Well , I had thought about her too , but I thought she was better off and could stand it easier . Besides , I thought perhaps Roberta would let me go and we could just go on being friends and I would help her all I could . "
106646	106657	106190	106190	he	197	" Had you decided just where you would marry her ? "
106658	106678	106190	106190	he	197	" No , sir . But I knew there were plenty of towns below Big Bittern and Grass Lake . "
106679	106696	106190	106190	he	197	" But were you going to do that without one single word to Miss X beforehand ? "
106697	106780	106190	106190	he	197	" Well , no , sir — not exactly . I figured that if Roberta would n't let me off but did n't mind my leaving her for a few days , I would go down to where Miss X lived and tell her , and then come back . But if she objected to that , why then I was going to write Miss X a letter and explain how it was and then go on and get married to Roberta . "
106781	106857	106190	106190	he	197	" I see . But , Clyde , among other bits of testimony here , there was that letter found in Miss Alden 's coat pocket — the one written on Grass Lake Inn stationery and addressed to her mother , in which she told her that she was about to be married . Had you already told her up there at Grass Lake that morning that you were going to marry her for sure ? "
106858	106905	106190	106190	he	197	" No , sir . Not exactly , but I did say on getting up that day that it was the deciding day for us and that she was going to be able to decide for herself whether she wanted me to marry her or not . "
106906	106917	106919	106919	Jephson	320	" Oh , I see . So that 's it , "
106954	106960	106190	106190	he	197	" Of all the bunk ! "
106962	107074	106190	106190	he	197	" Well , now we come to the trip itself . You have heard the testimony here and the dark motive and plotting that has been attributed to every move in connection with it . Now I want you to tell it in your own way . It has been testified here that you took both bags — yours and hers — up there with you but that you left hers at Gun Lodge when you got there and took your own out on the lake in that boat with you . Now just why did you do that ? Please speak so that all of the jurymen can hear you . "
107075	107084	106190	106190	he	197	" Well , the reason for that was , "
107100	107165	106190	106190	he	197	" we did n't know whether we could get any lunch at Big Bittern , so we decided to take some things along with us from Grass Lake . Her bag was packed full of things , but there was room in mine . Besides , it had my camera with the tripod outside . So I decided to leave hers and take mine . "
107166	107170	106190	106190	he	197	" You decided ? "
107171	107189	106190	106190	he	197	" Well , I asked her what she thought and she said she thought that was best . "
107190	107199	106190	106190	he	197	" Where was it you asked her that ? "
107200	107207	106190	106190	he	197	" On the train coming down . "
107208	107229	106190	106190	he	197	" And did you know then that you were coming back to Gun Lodge after going out on the lake ? "
107230	107256	106190	106190	he	197	" Yes , sir , I did . We had to . There was no other road . They told us that at Grass Lake . "
107257	107301	106190	106190	he	197	" And in riding over to Big Bittern — do you recall the testimony of the driver who drove you over — that you were ' very nervous ' and that you asked him whether there were many people over that that day ? "
107302	107348	106190	106190	he	197	" I recall it , yes , sir , but I was n't nervous at all . I may have asked about the people , but I ca n't see anything wrong with that . It seems to me that any one might ask that . "
107349	107357	107359	107359	Jephson	320	" And so it seems to me , "
107361	107426	107359	107359	Jephson	320	" Then what happened after you registered at Big Bittern Inn and got into that boat and went out on the lake with Miss Alden ? Were you or she especially preoccupied or nervous or in any state different from that of any ordinary person who goes out on a lake to row ? Were you particularly happy or particularly gloomy , or what ? "
107427	107502	106190	106190	he	197	" Well , I do n't think I was especially gloomy — no , sir . I was thinking of all I was going to tell her , of course , and of what was before me either way she decided . I was n't exactly gay , I guess , but I thought it would be all right whichever way things went . I had decided that I was willing to marry her . "
107503	107514	107359	107359	Jephson	320	" And how about her ? Was she quite cheerful ? "
107515	107532	106190	106190	he	197	" Well — yes , sir . She seemed to feel much happier for some reason . "
107533	107541	107359	107359	Jephson	320	" And what did you talk about ? "
107542	107612	106190	106190	he	197	" Oh , about the lake first — how beautiful it was and where we would have our lunch when we were ready for it . And then we rowed along the west shore looking for water lilies . She was so happy that I hated to bring up anything just then , and so we just kept on rowing until about two , when we stopped for lunch . "
107613	107645	107359	107359	Jephson	320	" Just where was that ? Just get up and trace on the map with that pointer there just where you did go and how long you stopped and for what . "
108092	108218	108086	108086	she	195	" I called to her to try to get to the boat — it was moving away — to take hold of it , but she did n't seem to hear me or understand what I meant . I was afraid to go too near her at first because she was striking out in every direction — and before I could swim ten strokes forward her head had gone down once and come up and then gone down again for a second time . By then the boat had floated all of thirty or forty feet away and I knew that I could n't get her into that . And then I decided that if I wanted to save myself I had better swim ashore . "
108662	108716	108645	108646	the former	2329	" Now , Clyde , you have taken a solemn oath before this jury , this judge , all these people here , and above all your God , to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth . You realize what that means , do n't you ? "
108717	108725	108645	108646	the former	2329	" Yes , sir , I do . "
108726	108742	108645	108646	the former	2329	" You swear before God that you did not strike Roberta Alden in that boat ? "
108743	108751	108645	108646	the former	2329	" I swear . I did not . "
108752	108760	108645	108646	the former	2329	" Or throw her into the lake ? "
108761	108770	108645	108646	the former	2329	" I swear it . I did not . "
108771	108797	108645	108646	the former	2329	" Or willfully or willingly in any way attempt to upset that boat or in any other fashion bring about the death that she suffered ? "
108798	108803	108805	108805	Clyde	197	" I swear it ! "
108811	108826	108805	108805	Clyde	197	" You swear that it was an accident — unpremeditated and undesigned by you ? "
108827	108831	108833	108833	Clyde	197	" I do , "
108917	108925	108903	108903	he	320	" The prosecution may take the witness . "
109035	109056	109005	109005	he	320	" Griffiths , you had that camera in your hand at the time she came toward you in the boat ? "
109057	109062	109005	109005	he	320	" Yes , sir . "
109063	109076	109005	109005	he	320	" She stumbled and fell and you accidentally struck her with it ? "
109077	109080	109005	109005	he	320	" Yes . "
109081	109113	109005	109005	he	320	" I do n't suppose in your truthful and honest way you remember telling me there in the woods on the shore of Big Bittern that you never had a camera ? "
109114	109123	109005	109005	he	320	" Yes , sir — I remember that . "
109124	109134	109005	109005	he	320	" And that was a lie , of course ? "
109135	109140	109005	109005	he	320	" Yes , sir . "
109141	109159	109005	109005	he	320	" And told with all the fervor and force that you are now telling this other lie ? "
109160	109174	109005	109005	he	320	" I 'm not lying . I 've explained why I said that . "
109175	109207	109005	109005	he	320	" You 've explained why you said that ! You 've explained why you said that ! And because you lied there you expect to be believed here , do you ? "
109219	109231	109214	109214	Jephson	320	" Well , this is the truth , just the same . "
109232	109261	109005	109005	he	320	" And no power under heaven could make you tell another lie here , of course — not a strong desire to save yourself from the electric chair ? "
109276	109294	109268	109268	he	197	" Well , I might , maybe , but not under oath , I do n't think . "
109295	109333	109214	109214	Jephson	320	" You do n't think ! Oh , I see . Lie all you want wherever you are — and at any time — and under any circumstances — except when you 're on trial for murder ! "
109334	109352	109268	109268	he	197	" No , sir . It is n't that . But what I just said is so . "
109353	109372	109214	109214	Jephson	320	" And you swear on the Bible , do you , that you experienced a change of heart ? "
109373	109378	109268	109268	he	197	" Yes , sir . "
109379	109399	109214	109214	Jephson	320	" That Miss Alden was very sad and that was what moved you to experience this change of heart ? "
109400	109411	109268	109268	he	197	" Yes , sir . That 's how it was . "
109412	109444	109214	109214	Jephson	320	" Well , now , Griffiths , when she was up there in the country and waiting for you — she wrote you all those letters there , did she not ? "
109445	109450	109268	109268	he	197	" Yes , sir . "
109451	109467	109214	109214	Jephson	320	" You received one on an average of every two days , did n't you ? "
109468	109473	109268	109268	he	197	" Yes , sir . "
109474	109489	109214	109214	Jephson	320	" And you knew she was lonely and miserable there , did n't you ? "
109490	109501	109268	109268	he	197	" Yes , sir — but then I 've explained — "
109502	109544	109214	109214	Jephson	320	" Oh , you 've explained ! You mean your lawyers have explained it for you ! Did n't they coach you day after day in that jail over there as to how you were to answer when the time came ? "
109545	109554	109556	109556	Clyde	197	" No , sir , they did n't ! "
109568	109645	109214	109214	Jephson	320	" Well , then when I asked you up there at Bear Lake how it was that his girl met her death — why did n't you tell me then and save all this trouble and suspicion and investigation ? Do n't you think the public would have listened more kindly and believingly there than it will now after you 've taken five long months to think it all out with the help of two lawyers ? "
109646	109658	109660	109660	Clyde	197	" But I did n't think it out with any lawyers , "
109677	109687	109665	109665	Jephson	320	" I 've just explained why I did that . "
109688	109697	109699	109699	Mason	209	" You 've explained ! You 've explained ! "
109749	109773	109739	109739	he	209	" And before you went up — while she was writing them to you — you considered them sad , did n't you ? "
109774	109782	109849	109849	Jephson	320	" Why , yes , sir . That is"—he
109784	109790	109739	109739	he	209	incautiously—"some parts of them anyhow . "
109791	109814	109849	109849	Jephson	320	" Oh , I see — only some parts of them now . I thought you just said you considered them sad . "
109815	109821	109739	109739	he	209	" Well , I do . "
109822	109826	109849	109849	Jephson	320	" And did . "
109827	109835	109739	109739	he	209	" Yes , sir — and did . "
109862	109869	109849	109849	Jephson	320	" Remember her writing you this ? "
109885	109963	109872	109872	Mason	209	" Clyde — I shall certainly die , dear , if you do n't come . I am so much alone . I am nearly crazy now . I wish I could go away and never return or trouble you any more . But if you would only telephone me , even so much as once every other day , since you wo n't write . And when I need you and a word of encouragement so . "
110009	110019	109979	109979	he	209	" Does that seem at all sad to you ? "
110020	110028	109964	109964	Mason	209	" Yes , sir , it does . "
110029	110034	109979	109979	he	209	" Did it then ? "
110035	110043	109964	109964	Mason	209	" Yes , sir , it did . "
110044	110055	110057	110057	Mason	209	" You knew it was sincere , did n't you ? "
110059	110067	109964	109964	Mason	209	" Yes , sir . I did . "
110068	110214	109964	109964	Mason	209	" Then why did n't a little of that pity that you claim moved you so deeply out there in the center of Big Bittern move you down there in Lycurgus to pick up the telephone there in Mrs. Peyton 's house where you were and reassure that lonely girl by so much as a word that you were coming ? Was it because your pity for her then was n't as great as it was after she wrote you that threatening letter ? Or was it because you had a plot and you were afraid that too much telephoning to her might attract attention ? How was it that you had so much pity all of a sudden up at Big Bittern , but none at all down there at Lycurgus ? Is it something you can turn on and off like a faucet ? "
110215	110225	110227	110227	Clyde	197	" I never said I had none at all , "
110241	110263	109964	109964	Mason	209	" Well , you left her to wait until she had to threaten you because of her own terror and misery . "
110264	110278	109964	109964	Mason	209	" Well , I 've admitted that I did n't treat her right . "
110279	110324	109964	109964	Mason	209	" Ha , ha ! Right ! Right ! And because of that admission and in face of all the other testimony we 've had here , your own included , you expect to walk out of here a free man , do you ? "
110347	110370	110342	110342	he	323	" This is infamous , your Honor . Is the district attorney to be allowed to make a speech with every question ? "
110371	110377	110379	110380	the court	1991	" I heard no objection , "
110382	110392	110379	110380	the court	1991	" The district attorney will frame his questions properly . "
110404	110432	110393	110393	Mason	209	" In that boat there in the center of Big Bittern you have testified that you had in your hand that camera that you once denied owning ? "
110433	110438	110393	110393	Mason	209	" Yes , sir . "
110439	110450	110393	110393	Mason	209	" And she was in the stern of the boat ? "
110451	110456	110393	110393	Mason	209	" Yes , sir . "
110457	110468	110469	110469	he	197	" Bring in that boat , will you , Burton ? "
110576	110643	110562	110562	Mason	209	" Well , here you are now , Griffiths ! The camera you never owned . Step down here into this boat and take this camera here and show the jury just where you sat , and where Miss Alden sat . And exactly , if you can , how and where it was that you struck Miss Alden and where and about how she fell . "
110644	110647	110649	110649	Belknap	323	" Object ! "
110687	110696	110684	110684	Clyde	197	" I did n't intentionally strike her with it though"—to
110701	110709	110698	110698	Mason	209	" Yes , we heard you testify that way"—then
110739	110774	110733	110734	three men	2841	" And now , Newcomb — I want you to come here and sit wherever Miss Alden was supposed to sit and take any position which he describes as having been taken by her . "
110775	110780	110782	110782	Newcomb	181	" Yes , sir , "
110811	110817	110820	110820	Mason	209	" And now , Griffiths , "
110822	110841	110820	110820	Mason	209	" just you show Mr. Newcomb here how Miss Alden arose and came toward you . Direct him . "
111037	111039	111089	111089	Belknap	323	" lightly "
111041	111043	111089	111089	Belknap	323	" loosely "
111046	111087	111089	111089	Belknap	323	" But how in Heaven 's name are these antics as here demonstrated on a man of Mr. Newcomb 's build to show what would follow in the case of a girl of the size and weight of Miss Alden ? "
111091	111111	111089	111089	Belknap	323	" Well , then we 'll put a girl of the size and weight of Miss Alden in here . "
111137	111177	111128	111128	Belknap	323	" And what of that ? The conditions are n't the same . This boat is n't on the water . No two people are going to be alike in their resistance or their physical responses to accidental blows . "
111178	111190	111195	111195	Mason	209	" Then you refuse to allow this demonstration to be made ? "
111203	111224	111226	111226	Belknap	323	" Oh , make it if you choose . It does n't mean anything though , as anybody can see , "
111244	111249	111255	111255	he	197	" about as hard , "
111508	111525	111501	111501	Mason	209	" You still insist that you experienced a change of heart , do you , Griffiths ? "
111526	111534	111910	111910	Mason	209	" Yes , sir , I do . "
111535	111548	111501	111501	Mason	209	" Ever hear of people being resuscitated after they have apparently drowned ? "
111549	111556	111910	111910	Mason	209	" I do n't quite understand . "
111557	111629	111501	111501	Mason	209	" You know , of course , that people who are supposed to be drowned , who go down for the last time and do n't come up , are occasionally gotten out of the water and revived , brought back to life by first - aid methods — working their arms and rolling them over a log or a barrel . You 've heard of that , have n't you ? "
111630	111669	111910	111910	Mason	209	" Yes , sir , I think I have . I 've heard of people being brought back to life after they 're supposed to be drowned , but I do n't think I ever heard just how . "
111670	111675	111501	111501	Mason	209	" You never did ? "
111676	111681	111910	111910	Mason	209	" No , sir . "
111682	111696	111501	111501	Mason	209	" Or how long they could stay under water and still be revived ? "
111697	111706	111910	111910	Mason	209	" No , sir . I never did . "
111707	111734	111501	111501	Mason	209	" Never heard , for instance , that a person who had been in the water as long as fifteen minutes might still be brought to ? "
111735	111740	111910	111910	Mason	209	" No , sir . "
111741	111769	111501	111501	Mason	209	" So it never occurred to you after you swam to shore yourself that you might still call for aid and so save her life even then ? "
111770	111790	111910	111910	Mason	209	" No , sir , it did n't occur to me . I thought she was dead by then . "
111791	111822	111501	111501	Mason	209	" I see . But when she was still alive out there in the water — how about that ? You 're a pretty good swimmer , are n't you ? "
111823	111833	111910	111910	Mason	209	" Yes , sir , I swim fairly well . "
111834	111862	111501	111501	Mason	209	" Well enough , for instance , to save yourself by swimming over five hundred feet with your shoes and clothes on . Is n't that so ? "
111863	111877	111910	111910	Mason	209	" Well , I did swim that distance then — yes , sir . "
111878	111908	111910	111910	Mason	209	" Yes , you did indeed — and pretty good for a fellow who could n't swim thirty - five feet to an overturned boat , I 'll say , "
111966	111986	111916	111916	Belknap	323	" The first time you took Roberta out on Crum Lake was in a canoe , was n't it ? "
111987	111992	111916	111916	Belknap	323	" Yes , sir . "
111993	112001	111916	111916	Belknap	323	" But you had no accident then ? "
112002	112007	111916	111916	Belknap	323	" No , sir . "
112008	112021	111916	111916	Belknap	323	" You cared for her then very much , did n't you ? "
112022	112027	111916	111916	Belknap	323	" Yes , sir . "
112028	112059	111916	111916	Belknap	323	" But the day she was drowned in Big Bittern , in this solid , round - bottomed row - boat , you did n't care for her any more . "
112060	112071	111916	111916	Belknap	323	" Well , I 've said how I felt then . "
112072	112098	111916	111916	Belknap	323	" And of course there could n't be any relation between the fact that on Crum Lake you cared for her but on Big Bittern — "
112099	112107	111916	111916	Belknap	323	" I said how I felt then . "
112108	112147	111916	111916	Belknap	323	" But you wanted to get rid of her just the same , did n't you ? The moment she was dead to run away to that other girl . You do n't deny that , do you ? "
112148	112157	112159	112159	Clyde	197	" I 've explained why I did that , "
112161	112186	112187	112187	Mason	209	" Explained ! Explained ! And you expect any fair - minded , decent , intelligent person to believe that explanation , do you ? "
112216	112220	112205	112206	The judge	4625	" Objection sustained . "
112227	112256	112257	112257	He	209	" You could n't have been just a little careless , could you , Griffiths , in the handling of the boat and upset it yourself , say ? "
112263	112283	112284	112284	Clyde	197	" No , sir , I was n't careless . It was an accident that I could n't avoid . "
112294	112327	112329	112329	Mason	209	" An accident . Like that other accident out there in Kansas City , for instance . You 're rather familiar with accidents of that kind , are n't you , Griffiths ? "
112334	112342	112344	112344	Clyde	197	" I 've explained how that happened , "
112347	112376	112344	112344	Clyde	197	" You 're rather familiar with accidents that result in death to girls , are n't you ? Do you always run away when one of them dies ? "
112377	112380	112382	112382	Belknap	323	" Object , "
112389	112393	112395	112395	Oberwaltzer	326	" Objection sustained , "
112398	112423	112395	112395	Oberwaltzer	326	" There is nothing before this court concerning any other accident . The prosecution will confine itself more closely to the case in hand . "
112424	112427	112430	112430	Mason	209	" Griffiths , "
112452	112479	112436	112436	he	209	" when that boat upset after that accidental blow of yours and you and Miss Alden fell into the water — how far apart were you ? "
112480	112490	112395	112395	Oberwaltzer	326	" Well , I did n't notice just then . "
112491	112519	112436	112436	he	209	" Pretty close , were n't you ? Not much more than a foot or two , surely — the way you stood there in the boat ? "
112520	112535	112395	112395	Oberwaltzer	326	" Well , I did n't notice . Maybe that , yes , sir . "
112536	112577	112436	112436	he	209	" Close enough to have grabbed her and hung on to her if you had wanted to , were n't you ? That 's what you jumped up for , was n't it , when she started to fall out ? "
112578	112589	112591	112591	Clyde	197	" Yes , that 's what I jumped up for , "
112594	112624	112591	112591	Clyde	197	" but I was n't close enough to grab her . I know I went right under , and when I came up she was some little distance away . "
112625	112655	112436	112436	he	209	" Well , how far exactly ? As far as from here to this end of the jury box or that end , or half way , or what ? "
112656	112680	112681	112681	he	197	" Well , I say I did n't notice , quite . About as far from here to that end , I guess , "
112693	112697	112699	112699	Mason	209	" Not really ! "
112706	112752	112699	112699	Mason	209	" This boat here turns over , you both fall in the water close together , and when you come up you and she are nearly twenty feet apart . Do n't you think your memory is getting a little the best of you there ? "
112753	112769	112436	112436	he	209	" Well , that 's the way it looked to me when I came up . "
112770	112816	112699	112699	Mason	209	" Well , now , after that boat turned over and you both came up , where were you in relation to it ? Here is the boat now and where were you out there in the audience , as to distance , I mean ? "
112817	112835	112837	112837	Clyde	197	" Well , as I say , I did n't exactly notice when I first came up , "
112859	112876	112699	112699	Mason	209	" About as far as from here to that railing beyond your table , I guess . "
112877	112887	112889	112889	Mason	209	" About thirty to thirty - five feet then , "
112895	112911	112699	112699	Mason	209	" Yes , sir . About that maybe . I could n't be quite sure . "
112912	112932	112699	112699	Mason	209	" And now with you over there and the boat here , where was Miss Alden at that time ? "
113055	113074	113051	113051	Mason	209	" Well , then she was not more than fifteen feet or so from you or the boat . "
113075	113087	113051	113051	Mason	209	" No , sir , maybe not . I guess not . "
113088	113122	113051	113051	Mason	209	" Well then , do you mean to say that you could n't have swum that little distance and buoyed her up until you could reach the boat just fifteen feet beyond her ? "
113123	113148	113051	113051	Mason	209	" Well , as I say , I was a little dazed when I came up and she was striking about and screaming so . "
113149	113240	113051	113051	Mason	209	" But there was that boat — not more than thirty - five feet away , according to your own story — and a mighty long way for a boat to move in that time , I 'll say . And do you mean to say that when you could swim five hundred feet to shore afterwards that you could n't have swum to that boat and pushed it to her in time for her to save herself ? She was struggling to keep herself up , was n't she ? "
113241	113253	113255	113255	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . But I was rattled at first , "
113276	113281	113255	113255	Clyde	197	" and ... and ... "
113317	113341	113311	113311	he	197	"I did n't think quite quick enough I guess , what to do . Besides I was afraid if I went near her ... "
113342	113352	113354	113354	Mason	209	" I know . A mental and moral coward , "
113356	113387	113354	113354	Mason	209	" Besides very slow to think when it 's to your advantage to be slow and swift when it 's to your advantage to be swift . Is that it ? "
113388	113393	113311	113311	he	197	" No , sir . "
113394	113489	113354	113354	Mason	209	" Well , then , if it is n't , just tell me this , Griffiths , why was it , after you got out of the water a few moments later you had sufficient presence of mind to stop and bury that tripod before starting through the woods , whereas , when it came to rescuing her you got rattled and could n't do a thing ? How was it that you could get so calm and calculating the moment you set your foot on land ? What can you say to that ? "
113490	113510	113311	113311	he	197	" Well ... a ... I told you that afterwards I realized that there was nothing else to do . "
113511	113583	113354	113354	Mason	209	" Yes , we know all about that . But does n't it occur to you that it takes a pretty cool head after so much panic in the water to stop at a moment like that and take such a precaution as that — burying that tripod ? How was it that you could think so well of that and not think anything about the boat a few moments before ? "
113584	113589	113311	113311	he	197	" Well ... but ... "
113590	113613	113615	113615	Mason	209	" You did n't want her to live , in spite of your alleged change of heart ! Is n't that it ? "
113617	113650	113615	113615	Mason	209	" Is n't that the black , sad truth ? She was drowning , as you wanted her to drown , and you just let her drown ! Is n't that so ? "
113783	113792	113793	113793	he	209	" I ... I wanted to save her , "
113801	113818	113793	113793	he	209	" but ... but ... as I said , I was dazed ... and ... and ... "
113819	113829	113831	113831	Mason	209	" Do n't you know that you 're lying ! "
113858	113905	113842	113842	his	209	" that you deliberately and with cold - hearted cunning allowed that poor , tortured girl to die there when you might have rescued her as easily as you could have swum fifty of those five hundred feet you did swim in order to save yourself ? "
114005	114023	113993	113993	Clyde	197	" No ! No ! I did n't . I wanted to save her if I could . "
114126	114138	114141	114141	Mason	209	" She only weighed a hundred pounds , did n't she ? "
114144	114151	114141	114141	Mason	209	" Yes , I think so . "
114152	114164	114191	114192	the jury	1953	" And you — what did you weigh at the time ? "
114165	114172	114174	114174	Clyde	197	" About a hundred and forty , "
114176	114185	114187	114187	Mason	209	" And a hundred and forty pound man , "
114194	114251	114187	114187	Mason	209	" is afraid to go near a weak , sick , hundred - pound little girl who is drowning , for fear she will cling to him and drag him under ! And a perfectly good boat , strong enough to hold three or four up , within fifteen or twenty feet ! How 's that ? "
114305	114333	114300	114301	Burton Burleigh	211	" You might as well have this boat taken out of here , Burton . We 're not going to need it for a little while anyhow . "
114361	114393	114351	114351	he	209	" Griffiths , you knew the color and feel of Roberta Alden 's hair pretty well , did n't you ? You were intimate enough with her , were n't you ? "
114394	114407	114409	114409	Clyde	197	" I know the color of it or I think I do , "
114425	114438	114440	114440	Mason	209	" And the feel of it , too , did n't you ? "
114442	114464	114440	114440	Mason	209	" In those very loving days of yours before Miss X came along — you must have touched it often enough . "
114465	114476	114478	114478	Clyde	197	" I do n't know whether I did or not , "
114486	114513	114533	114533	he	209	" Well , roughly . You must know whether it was coarse or fine — silky or coarse . You know that , do n't you ? "
114514	114521	114533	114533	he	209	" It was silky , yes . "
114522	114532	114533	114533	he	209	" Well , here 's a lock of it , "
114571	114580	114583	114583	he	209	" Do n't that look like her hair ? "
114623	114631	114633	114633	Mason	209	" Oh , do n't be afraid , "
114637	114647	114633	114633	Mason	209	" It 's only your dead love 's hair . "
114670	114683	114686	114686	Mason	209	" That looks and feels like her hair , does n't it ? "
114688	114697	114699	114699	Clyde	197	" Well , it looks like it anyhow , "
114702	114707	114709	114709	Mason	209	" And now here , "
114752	114781	114783	114783	he	209	" Just take this camera . It 's yours even though you did swear that it wasn't — and look at those two hairs there . See them ? "
114798	114839	114783	114783	he	209	" They were caught in there — presumably — at the time you struck her so lightly that it made all those wounds on her face . Ca n't you tell the jury whether those hairs are hers or not ? "
114840	114846	114848	114848	Clyde	197	" I ca n't say , "
114852	114879	114783	114783	he	209	" What 's that ? Speak up . Do n't be so much of a moral and mental coward . Are they or are they not ? "
114880	114886	114888	114888	Clyde	197	" I ca n't say , "
114897	115002	114783	114783	he	209	" Look at them . Look at them . Compare them with these others . We know these are hers . And you know that these in this camera are , do n't you ? Do n't be so squeamish . You 've often touched her hair in real life . She 's dead . They wo n't bite you . Are these two hairs — or are they not — the same as these other hairs here — which we know are hers — the same color — same feel — all ? Look ! Answer ! Are they or are they not ? "
115029	115052	115013	115013	Belknap	323	" I would n't be able to say . They look and feel a little alike , but I ca n't tell . "
115053	115086	115013	115013	Belknap	323	" Oh , ca n't you ? And even when you know that when you struck her that brutal vicious blow with that camera — these two hairs caught there and held . "
115087	115098	115100	115100	Clyde	197	" But I did n't strike her any vicious blow , "
115104	115110	115111	115111	He	197	Jephson—"and I ca n't say . "
115170	115210	115211	115211	He	209	" Well , it 's been amply testified to that those two hairs were in that camera when found in the water . And you yourself swear that it was last in your hands before it reached the water . "
115233	115258	115211	115211	He	209	" Griffiths , in regard to that trip south through the woods , what time was it when you got to Three Mile Bay ? "
115259	115273	115146	115146	Mason	209	" About four in the morning , I think — just before dawn . "
115274	115291	115211	115211	He	209	" And what did you do between then and the time that boat down there left ? "
115292	115299	115146	115146	Mason	209	" Oh , I walked around . "
115300	115306	115211	115211	He	209	" In Three Mile Bay ? "
115307	115317	115146	115146	Mason	209	" No , sir — just outside of it . "
115318	115348	115211	115211	He	209	" In the woods , I suppose , waiting for the town to wake up so you would n't look so much out of place . Was that it ? "
115349	115375	115146	115146	Mason	209	" Well , I waited until after the sun came up . Besides I was tired and I sat down and rested for a while . "
115376	115388	115211	115211	He	209	" Did you sleep well and did you have pleasant dreams ? "
115389	115401	115146	115146	Mason	209	" I was tired and I slept a little — yes . "
115402	115434	115211	115211	He	209	" And how was it you knew so much about the boat and the time and all about Three Mile Bay ? Had n't you familiarized yourself with this data beforehand ? "
115435	115452	115146	115146	Mason	209	" Well , everybody knows about the boat from Sharon to Three Mile Bay around there . "
115453	115463	115211	115211	He	209	" Oh , do they ? Any other reason ? "
115464	115482	115484	115484	Clyde	197	" Well , in looking for a place to get married , both of us saw it , "
115488	115505	115484	115484	Clyde	197	" but we did n't see that any train went to it . Only to Sharon . "
115506	115519	115211	115211	He	209	" But you did notice that it was south of Big Bittern ? "
115520	115530	115532	115532	Clyde	197	" Why , yes — I guess I did , "
115534	115555	115211	115211	He	209	" And that that road west of Gun Lodge led south toward it around the lower edge of Big Bittern ? "
115556	115591	115211	115211	He	209	" Well , I noticed after I got up there that there was a road of some kind or a trail anyhow — but I did n't think of it as a regular road . "
115592	115625	115211	115211	He	209	" I see . How was it then that when you met those three men in the woods you were able to ask them how far it was to Three Mile Bay ? "
115626	115634	115636	115636	Clyde	197	" I did n't ask 'em that , "
115648	115680	115639	115639	he	197	" I asked 'em if they knew any road to Three Mile Bay , and how far it was . I did n't know whether that was the road or not . "
115681	115692	115211	115211	He	209	" Well , that was n't how they testified here . "
115693	115715	115639	115639	he	197	" Well , I do n't care what they testified to , that 's what I asked 'em just the same . "
115716	115770	115211	115211	He	209	" It seems to me that according to you all the witnesses are liars and you are the only truthful one in the bunch ... Isn't that it ? But , when you reached Three Mile Bay , did you stop to eat ? You must have been hungry , were n't you ? "
115771	115779	115781	115781	Clyde	197	" No , I was n't hungry , "
115785	115834	115211	115211	He	209	" You wanted to get away from that place as quickly as possible , was n't that it ? You were afraid that those three men might go up to Big Bittern and having heard about Miss Alden , tell about having seen you — wasn't that it ? "
115835	115858	115211	115211	He	209	" No , that was n't it . But I did n't want to stay around there . I 've said why . "
115859	115908	115211	115211	He	209	" I see . But after you got down to Sharon where you felt a little more safe — a little further away , you did n't lose any time in eating , did you ? It tasted pretty good all right down there , did n't it ? "
115909	115929	115211	115211	He	209	" Oh , I do n't know about that . I had a cup of coffee and a sandwich . "
115930	115946	115948	115948	Mason	209	" And a piece of pie , too , as we 've already proved here , "
115950	115984	115948	115948	Mason	209	" And after that you joined the crowd coming up from the depot as though you had just come up from Albany , as you afterwards told everybody . Was n't that it ? "
115985	115992	115211	115211	He	209	" Yes , that was it . "
115993	116046	115948	115948	Mason	209	" Well , now for a really innocent man who only so recently experienced a kindly change of heart , do n't you think you were taking an awful lot of precaution ? Hiding away like that and waiting in the dark and pretending that you had just come up from Albany . "
116047	116054	116056	116056	Clyde	197	" I 've explained all that , "
116107	116116	116058	116058	Mason	209	" Why did n't you take separate rooms ? "
116117	116145	116058	116058	Mason	209	" Well , she did n't want it that way . She wanted to be with me . Besides I did n't have any too much money . "
116146	116205	116058	116058	Mason	209	" Even so , how could you have so little respect for her there , and then be so deeply concerned about her reputation after she was dead that you had to run away and keep the secret of her death all to yourself , in order , as you say , to protect her name and reputation ? "
116206	116210	116212	116212	Belknap	323	" Your Honor , "
116214	116226	116212	116212	Belknap	323	" this is n't a question . It 's an oration . "
116227	116233	116235	116235	Mason	209	" I withdraw the question , "
116242	116265	116235	116235	Mason	209	" Do you admit , by the way , that you are a mental and moral coward , Griffiths — do you ? "
116266	116275	116058	116058	Mason	209	" No , sir . I do n't . "
116276	116281	116235	116235	Mason	209	" You do not ? "
116282	116287	116058	116058	Mason	209	" No , sir . "
116288	116341	116235	116235	Mason	209	" Then when you lie , and swear to it , you are just the same as any other person who is not a mental and moral coward , and deserving of all the contempt and punishment due a person who is a perjurer and a false witness . Is that correct ? "
116342	116351	116058	116058	Mason	209	" Yes , sir . I suppose so . "
116352	116522	116235	116235	Mason	209	" Well , if you are not a mental and moral coward , how can you justify your leaving that girl in that lake — after as you say you accidentally struck her and when you knew how her parents would soon be suffering because of her loss — and not say one word to anybody — just walk off — and hide the tripod and your suit and sneak away like an ordinary murderer ? Would n't you think that that was the conduct of a man who had plotted and executed murder and was trying to get away with it — if you had heard of it about some one else ? Or would you think it was just the sly , crooked trick of a man who was only a mental and moral coward and who was trying to get away from the blame for the accidental death of a girl whom he had seduced and news of which might interfere with his prosperity ? Which ? "
116523	116536	116538	116538	Clyde	197	" Well , I did n't kill her , just the same , "
116540	116545	116547	116547	Mason	209	" Answer the question ! "
116549	116567	116570	116570	Jephson	320	" I ask the court to instruct the witness that he need not answer such a question , "
116584	116603	116579	116579	Oberwaltzer	326	" It is purely an argumentative one and has no real bearing on the facts in this case . "
116604	116609	116611	116611	Oberwaltzer	326	" I so instruct , "
116613	116620	116611	116611	Oberwaltzer	326	" The witness need not answer . "
116633	116640	116642	116642	Mason	209	" Well , to go on , "
116683	116704	116824	116824	Belknap	323	outdone—"you say you did n't intend to marry her if you could help it , before you went up there ? "
116705	116710	116824	116824	Belknap	323	" Yes , sir . "
116711	116726	116824	116824	Belknap	323	" That she wanted you to but you had n't made up your mind ? "
116727	116730	116824	116824	Belknap	323	" Yes . "
116731	116762	116824	116824	Belknap	323	" Well , do you recall the cook - book and the salt and pepper shakers and the spoons and knives and so on that she put in her bag ? "
116763	116771	116824	116824	Belknap	323	" Yes , sir . I do . "
116772	116822	116824	116824	Belknap	323	" What do you suppose she had in mind when she left Biltz — with those things in her trunk — that she was going out to live in some hall bedroom somewhere , unmarried , while you came to see her once a week or once a month ? "
116835	116849	116828	116828	Clyde	392	" I ca n't say what she had in her mind about that . "
116850	116892	116824	116824	Belknap	323	" You could n't possibly have told her over the telephone there at Biltz , for instance — after she wrote you that if you did n't come for her she was coming to Lycurgus — that you would marry her ? "
116893	116902	116828	116828	Clyde	392	" No , sir — I did n't . "
116903	116923	116824	116824	Belknap	323	" You were n't mental and moral coward enough to be bullied into anything like that , were you ? "
116924	116936	116828	116828	Clyde	392	" I never said I was a mental and moral coward . "
116937	116952	116824	116824	Belknap	323	" But you were n't to be bullied by a girl you had seduced ? "
116953	116968	116828	116828	Clyde	392	" Well , I could n't feel then that I ought to marry her . "
116969	116985	116824	116824	Belknap	323	" You did n't think she 'd make as good a match as Miss X ? "
116986	117005	116828	116828	Clyde	392	" I did n't think I ought to marry her if I did n't love her any more . "
117006	117019	116824	116824	Belknap	323	" Not even to save her honor — and your own decency ? "
117020	117034	116828	116828	Clyde	392	" Well , I did n't think we could be happy together then . "
117035	117048	116824	116824	Belknap	323	" That was before your great change of heart , I suppose . "
117049	117060	116828	116828	Clyde	392	" It was before we went to Utica , yes . "
117061	117073	116824	116824	Belknap	323	" And while you were still so enraptured with Miss X ? "
117074	117085	116828	116828	Clyde	392	" I was in love with Miss X — yes . "
117086	117102	116824	116824	Belknap	323	" Do you recall , in one of those letters to you that you never answered "
117122	117185	116824	116824	Belknap	323	" her writing this to you ; ' I feel upset and uncertain about everything although I try not to feel so — now that we have our plan and you are going to come for me as you said . ' Now just what was she referring to there when she wrote — ' now that we have our plan ' ? "
117186	117208	116828	116828	Clyde	392	" I do n't know unless it was that I was coming to get her and take her away somewhere temporarily . "
117209	117218	116824	116824	Belknap	323	" Not to marry her , of course . "
117219	117228	116828	116828	Clyde	392	" No , I had n't said so . "
117229	117399	116824	116824	Belknap	323	" But right after that in this same letter she says : ' On the way up , instead of coming straight home , I decided to stop at Homer to see my sister and brother - in - law , since I am not sure now when I 'll see them again , and I want so much that they shall see me respectable or never at all any more . ' Now just what do you suppose , she meant by that word ' respectable ' ? Living somewhere in secret and unmarried and having a child while you sent her a little money , and then coming back maybe and posing as single and innocent or married and her husband dead — or what ? Do n't you suppose she saw herself married to you , for a time at least , and the child given a name ? That ' plan ' she mentions could n't have contemplated anything less than that , could it ? "
117400	117412	117414	117414	Clyde	392	" Well , maybe as she saw it it could n't , "
117416	117426	117414	117414	Clyde	392	" But I never said I would marry her . "
117427	117439	117442	117442	Mason	209	" Well , well — we'll let that rest a minute , "
117445	117451	117442	117442	Mason	209	" But now take this , "
117462	117630	117454	117454	he	209	" ' It wo n't make any difference to you about your coming a few days sooner than you intended , will it , dear ? Even if we have got to get along on a little less , I know we can , for the time I will be with you anyhow , probably no more than six or eight months at the most . I agreed to let you go by then , you know , if you want to . I can be very saving and economical . It ca n't be any other way now , Clyde , although for your own sake I wish it could . ' What do you suppose all that means—'saving and economical'—and not letting you go until after eight months ? Living in a hall bedroom and you coming to see her once a week ? Or had n't you really agreed to go away with her and marry her , as she seems to think here ? "
117631	117646	117648	117648	Clyde	392	" I do n't know unless she thought she could make me , maybe , "
117670	117673	117666	117666	they	2874	" make me "
117680	117686	117666	117666	they	2874	" I never agreed to . "
117687	117709	117666	117666	they	2874	" Unless she could make you . So that was the way you felt about it , was it , Griffiths ? "
117710	117715	117666	117666	they	2874	" Yes , sir . "
117716	117731	117666	117666	they	2874	" You 'd swear to that as quick as you would to anything else ? "
117732	117741	117666	117666	they	2874	" Well , I have sworn to it . "
117853	117874	117846	117846	he	197	" Griffiths , in your testimony here yesterday , through which you were being led by your counsel , Mr. Jephson "
117883	117920	117846	117846	he	197	" you talked about that change of heart that you experienced after you encountered Roberta Alden once more at Fonda and Utica back there in July — just as you were starting on this death trip . "
117923	117928	117921	117921	Clyde	197	" yes , sir , "
117941	117944	117936	117937	the latter	760	" death trip "
117947	117950	117936	117937	the latter	760	" trip . "
117951	117979	117846	117846	he	197	" Before going up there with her you had n't been liking her as much as you might have . Was n't that the way of it ? "
117980	117995	117936	117937	the latter	760	" Not as much as I had at one time — no , sir . "
117996	118028	117846	117846	he	197	" And just how long — from when to when — was the time in which you really did like her , before you began to dislike her , I mean ? "
118029	118044	117936	117937	the latter	760	" Well , from the time I first met her until I met Miss X. "
118045	118050	117846	117846	he	197	" But not afterwards ? "
118051	118097	117936	117937	the latter	760	" Oh , I ca n't say not entirely afterwards . I cared for her some — a good deal , I guess — but still not as much as I had . I felt more sorry for her than anything else , I suppose . "
118098	118125	117846	117846	he	197	" And now , let 's see — that was between December first last say , and last April or May — or was n't it ? "
118126	118138	117936	117937	the latter	760	" About that time , I think — yes , sir . "
118139	118163	117846	117846	he	197	" Well , during that time — December first to April or May first you were intimate with her , were n't you ? "
118164	118169	117936	117937	the latter	760	" Yes , sir . "
118170	118182	117846	117846	he	197	" Even though you were n't caring for her so much . "
118183	118190	118192	118192	Clyde	197	" Why — yes , sir , "
118211	118270	117846	117846	he	197	" And yet at nights , and in spite of the fact that she was alone over there in her little room — as faithful to you , as you yourself have testified , as any one could be — you went off to dances , parties , dinners , and automobile rides , while she sat there . "
118271	118283	117846	117846	he	197	" Oh , but I was n't off all the time . "
118284	118323	117846	117846	he	197	" Oh , were n't you ? But you heard the testimony of Tracy and Jill Trumbull , and Frederick Sells , and Frank Harriet , and Burchard Taylor , on this particular point , did n't you ? "
118324	118329	117846	117846	he	197	" Yes , sir . "
118330	118345	117846	117846	he	197	" Well , were they all liars , or were they telling the truth ? "
118346	118364	117846	117846	he	197	" Well , they were telling the truth as near as they could remember , I suppose . "
118365	118378	117846	117846	he	197	" But they could n't remember very well — is that it ? "
118379	118408	117846	117846	he	197	" Well , I was n't off all the time . Maybe I was gone two or three times a week — maybe four sometimes — not more . "
118409	118419	117846	117846	he	197	" And the rest you gave to Miss Alden ? "
118420	118425	117846	117846	he	197	" Yes , sir . "
118426	118437	117846	117846	he	197	" Is that what she meant in this letter here ? "
118464	118499	118501	118501	Mason	209	" ' Night after night , almost every night after that dreadful Christmas day when you left me , I was alone nearly always . ' Is she lying , or is n't she ? "
118522	118542	118505	118505	Clyde	197	" No , she is n't lying . But I did spend some evenings with her just the same . "
118543	118609	118440	118440	he	2880	" And yet you heard Mrs. Gilpin and her husband testify here that night after night from December first on Miss Alden was mostly always alone in her room and that they felt sorry for her and thought it so unnatural and tried to get her to join them , but she would n't . You heard them testify to that , did n't you ? "
118610	118615	118505	118505	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . "
118616	118628	118440	118440	he	2880	" And yet you insist that you were with her some ? "
118629	118634	118505	118505	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . "
118635	118650	118440	118440	he	2880	" Yet at the same time loving and seeking the company of Miss X ? "
118651	118656	118505	118505	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . "
118657	118667	118440	118440	he	2880	" And trying to get her to marry you ? "
118668	118678	118505	118505	Clyde	197	" I wanted her to — yes , sir . "
118679	118695	118440	118440	he	2880	" Yet continuing relations with Miss Alden when your other interests left you any time . "
118696	118703	118505	118505	Clyde	197	" Well ... yes , sir , "
118779	118807	118809	118809	Mason	209	" Well , do n't you think your learned counsel found a very mild term for you when they described you as a mental and moral coward ? "
118857	118874	118853	118855	an irate woodsman	2885	" Why do n't they kill the God - damned bastard and be done with him ? "
118935	118962	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Griffiths , you say when you left Lycurgus you had no intention of marrying Roberta Alden unless you could not arrange in any other way . "
118963	118976	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Yes , sir . That was my intention at that time . "
118977	118988	118930	118930	Mason	209	" And accordingly you were fairly certain of coming back ? "
118989	118999	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Yes , sir — I thought I was . "
119000	119017	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Then why did you pack everything in your room in your trunk and lock it ? "
119018	119026	119028	119028	Clyde	197	" Well ... well ... that is , "
119055	119084	118930	118930	Mason	209	wits—"well , you see — I was n't absolutely sure . I did n't know but what I might have to go whether I wanted to or not . "
119085	119102	118930	118930	Mason	209	" I see . And so if you had decided up there unexpectedly as you did — "
119124	119142	118930	118930	Mason	209	" you would n't have had time to come back and decently pack your things and depart ? "
119143	119157	119106	119106	Mason	209	" Well , no , sir — that was n't the reason either . "
119158	119167	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Well then , what was the reason ? "
119168	119174	119106	119106	Mason	209	" Well , you see , "
119224	119261	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Well , you see — if I had to go away , even for a short time as I thought I might , I decided that I might need whatever I had in a hurry . "
119262	119295	118930	118930	Mason	209	" I see . You 're quite sure it was n't that in case the police discovered who Clifford Golden or Carl Graham were , that you might wish to leave quickly ? "
119296	119305	118930	118930	Mason	209	" No , sir . It was n't . "
119306	119326	118930	118930	Mason	209	" And so you did n't tell Mrs. Peyton you were giving up the room either , did you ? "
119327	119332	118930	118930	Mason	209	" No , sir . "
119333	119374	118930	118930	Mason	209	" In your testimony the other day you said something about not having money enough to go up there and take Miss Alden away on any temporary marriage scheme — even one that would last so long as six months . "
119375	119380	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Yes , sir . "
119381	119398	118930	118930	Mason	209	" When you left Lycurgus to start on the trip , how much did you have ? "
119399	119404	118930	118930	Mason	209	" About fifty dollars . "
119405	119421	118930	118930	Mason	209	" ' About ' fifty ? Do n't you know exactly how much you had ? "
119422	119432	118930	118930	Mason	209	" I had fifty dollars — yes , sir . "
119433	119456	118930	118930	Mason	209	" And while you were in Utica and Grass Lake and getting down to Sharon afterwards , how much did you spend ? "
119457	119470	118930	118930	Mason	209	" I spent about twenty dollars on the trip , I think . "
119471	119477	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Do n't you know ? "
119478	119493	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Not exactly — no , sir — somewhere around twenty dollars , though . "
119494	119508	119511	119511	Mason	209	" Well , now let 's see about that exactly if we can , "
119549	119562	119543	119543	he	197	" How much was your fare from Fonda to Utica for yourself ? "
119563	119570	118930	118930	Mason	209	" A dollar and a quarter . "
119571	119592	119543	119543	he	197	" And what did you have to pay for your room at the hotel at Utica for you and Roberta ? "
119593	119599	118930	118930	Mason	209	" That was four dollars . "
119600	119621	119543	119543	he	197	" And of course you had dinner that night and breakfast the next morning , which cost you how much ? "
119622	119632	118930	118930	Mason	209	" It was about three dollars for both meals . "
119633	119642	119543	119543	he	197	" Was that all you spent in Utica ? "
119670	119675	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Yes , sir . "
119676	119692	118930	118930	Mason	209	" How about the straw hat that it has been proved you purchased while there ? "
119693	119705	119707	119707	Clyde	197	" Oh , yes , sir , I forgot about that , "
119711	119721	119707	119707	Clyde	197	" That was two dollars — yes , sir . "
119731	119750	118930	118930	Mason	209	" And your fares to Grass Lake were , of course , five dollars . Is that right ? "
119751	119756	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Yes , sir . "
119757	119772	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Then you hired a boat at Grass Lake . How much was that ? "
119773	119783	118930	118930	Mason	209	" That was thirty - five cents an hour . "
119784	119792	118930	118930	Mason	209	" And you had it how long ? "
119793	119797	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Three hours . "
119798	119806	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Making one dollar and five cents . "
119807	119812	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Yes , sir . "
119813	119835	118930	118930	Mason	209	" And then that night at the hotel , they charged you how much ? Five dollars , was n't it ? "
119836	119841	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Yes , sir . "
119842	119863	118930	118930	Mason	209	" And then did n't you buy that lunch that you carried out in that lake with you up there ? "
119864	119877	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Yes , sir . I think that was about sixty cents . "
119878	119892	118930	118930	Mason	209	" And how much did it cost you to get to Big Bittern ? "
119893	119919	118930	118930	Mason	209	" It was a dollar on the train to Gun Lodge and a dollar on the bus for the two of us to Big Bittern . "
119920	119961	118930	118930	Mason	209	" You know these figures pretty well , I see . Naturally , you would . You did n't have much money and it was important . And how much was your fare from Three Mile Bay to Sharon afterwards ? "
119962	119971	118930	118930	Mason	209	" My fare was seventy - five cents . "
119972	119984	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Did you ever stop to figure this all up exactly ? "
119985	119990	118930	118930	Mason	209	" No , sir . "
119991	119997	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Well , will you ? "
119998	120012	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Well , you know how much it is , do n't you ? "
120013	120061	118930	118930	Mason	209	" Yes , sir , I do . It was twenty - four dollars and sixty - five cents . You said you spent twenty dollars . But here is a discrepancy of four dollars and sixty - five cents . How do you account for it ? "
120062	120075	120077	120077	Clyde	197	" Well , I suppose I did n't figure just exactly right , "
120097	120118	120091	120091	Mason	209	" Oh , yes , Griffiths , I forgot , how much was the boat you hired at Big Bittern ? "
120146	120156	120158	120158	Clyde	197	" Oh — ah — ah — that is , "
120231	120234	120218	120218	Mason	209	" Yes ? "
120246	120269	120237	120237	Clyde	197	" Why , thirty - five cents an hour — just the same as at Grass Lake — so the boatman said . "
120310	120328	120307	120307	Mason	209	" Oh , it was , was it ? The boatman told you that , did he ? "
120329	120334	120307	120307	Mason	209	" Yes , sir . "
120335	120422	120425	120425	Mason	209	" Well now , do n't you recall that you never asked the boatman at all ? It was not thirty - five cents an hour , but fifty cents . But of course you do not know that because you were in such a hurry to get out on the water and you did not expect to have to come back and pay for it anyway . So you never even asked , you see . Do you see ? Do you recall that now ? "
120444	120452	120453	120453	he	209	" It was fifty cents an hour , "
120456	120527	120453	120453	he	209	" They charge more than at Grass Lake . But what I want to know is , if you are so familiar with these other figures , as you have just shown that you are , how comes it that you are not familiar with this figure ? Did n't you think of the expense of taking her out in a boat and keeping the boat from noon until night ? "
120571	120574	120576	120576	Mason	209	" Well , "
120578	120612	120576	120576	Mason	209	" any explanation to make as to that ? Does n't it strike even you as strange that you can remember every other item of all your expenditures — but not that item ? "
120641	120656	120626	120626	Clyde	197	" Well , I do n't know just how I came to forget that . "
120657	120668	120670	120670	Mason	209	" Oh , no , of course you do n't , "
120672	120734	120670	120670	Mason	209	" A man who is planning to kill a girl on a lone lake has a lot of things to think of , and it is n't any wonder if you forget a few of them . But you did n't forget to ask the purser the fare to Sharon , once you got to Three Mile Bay , did you ? "
120735	120746	120626	120626	Clyde	197	" I do n't remember if I did or not . "
120747	120825	120828	120828	Mason	209	" Well , he remembers . He testified to it here . You bothered to ask the price of the room at Grass Lake . You asked the price of the boat there . You even asked the price of the bus fare to Big Bittern . What a pity you could n't think to ask the price of the boat at Big Bittern ? You would n't be so nervous about it now , would you ? "
120842	120854	120856	120856	Clyde	197	" I just did n't think of it , I guess , "
120858	120868	120871	120871	Mason	209	" A very satisfactory explanation , I 'm sure , "
120882	120925	120926	120926	Mason	209	" I do n't suppose you happen to recall an item of thirteen dollars and twenty cents paid for a lunch at the Casino on July ninth — the day after Roberta Alden 's death — do you or do you not ? "
120978	120986	120989	120989	Mason	209	" And do you remember , too , "
120991	121005	120989	120989	Mason	209	" that over eighty dollars was found on you when you were arrested ? "
121006	121014	121015	121015	he	209	" Yes , I remember it now , "
121042	121047	121050	121050	Mason	209	" How about that ? "
121056	121103	121050	121050	Mason	209	" If you only had fifty dollars when you left Lycurgus and over eighty dollars when you were arrested , and you spent twenty - four dollars and sixty - five cents plus thirteen for a lunch , where did you get that extra money from ? "
121104	121115	121117	121117	Clyde	197	" Well , I ca n't answer that just now , "
121146	121154	121156	121156	Mason	209	" Why ca n't you answer it ? "
121158	121246	121156	121156	Mason	209	" Where do you think you are , anyhow ? And what do you think we are here for ? To say what you will or will not answer ? You are on trial for your life — don't forget that ! You ca n't play fast and loose with law , however much you may have lied to me . You are here before these twelve men and they are waiting to know . Now , what about it ? Where did you get that money ? "
121247	121255	121383	121383	Mason	209	" I borrowed it from a friend . "
121256	121266	121156	121156	Mason	209	" Well , give his name . What friend ? "
121267	121272	121383	121383	Mason	209	" I do n't care to
121273	121326	121156	121156	Mason	209	" Oh , you do n't ! Well , you 're lying about the amount of money you had when you left Lycurgus — that 's plain . And under oath , too . Do n't forget that ! That sacred oath that you respect so much . Is n't that true ? "
121327	121334	121337	121337	Clyde	197	" No , it is n't , "
121346	121358	121337	121337	Clyde	197	" I borrowed that money after I got to Twelfth Lake . "
121359	121364	121156	121156	Mason	209	" And from whom ? "
121365	121373	121337	121337	Clyde	197	" Well , I ca n't say . "
121374	121381	121383	121383	Mason	209	" Which makes the statement worthless , "
121491	121495	121496	121496	he	209	" Remember these ? "
121571	121578	121580	121580	Mason	209	" Recall where these were made ? "
121590	121596	121580	121580	Mason	209	" Yes , I do . "
121597	121602	121580	121580	Mason	209	" Where was it ? "
121603	121617	121618	121618	He	197	" On the south shore of Big Bittern the day we were there . "
121654	121657	121660	121660	Mason	209	" Griffiths , "
121662	121696	121660	121660	Mason	209	" your lawyers did n't tell you that they fished and fished for that camera you swore you did n't have with you before they found that I had it , did they ? "
121697	121707	121709	121709	Clyde	197	" They never said anything to me about it , "
121711	121757	121660	121660	Mason	209	" Well , that 's too bad . I could have saved them a lot of trouble . Well , these were the photos that were found in that camera and that were made just after that change of heart you experienced , you remember ? "
121758	121766	121768	121768	Clyde	197	" I remember when they were made , "
121772	121827	121660	121660	Mason	209	" Well , they were made before you two went out in that boat for the last time — before you finally told her whatever it was you wanted to tell her — before she was murdered out there — at a time when , as you have testified , she was very sad . "
121828	121837	121839	121839	Clyde	197	" No , that was the day before , "
121841	121869	121660	121660	Mason	209	" Oh , I see . Well , anyhow , these pictures look a little cheerful for one who was as depressed as you say she was . "
121870	121889	121891	121891	Clyde	197	" Well — but — she was n't nearly as depressed then as she was the day before , "
121903	121930	121660	121660	Mason	209	" I see . But just the same , look at these other pictures . These three here , for instance . Where were they made ? "
121931	121943	121660	121660	Mason	209	" At the Cranston Lodge on Twelfth Lake , I think . "
121944	121959	121660	121660	Mason	209	" Right . And that was June eighteenth or nineteenth , was n't it ? "
121960	121968	121660	121660	Mason	209	" On the nineteenth , I think . "
121969	121986	121660	121660	Mason	209	" Well , now , do you recall a letter Roberta wrote you on the nineteenth ? "
121987	121992	121660	121660	Mason	209	" No , sir . "
121993	122002	121660	121660	Mason	209	" You do n't recall any particular one ? "
122003	122008	121660	121660	Mason	209	" No , sir . "
122009	122021	121660	121660	Mason	209	" But they were all very sad , you have said . "
122022	122030	121660	121660	Mason	209	" Yes , sir — they were . "
122031	122047	122048	122048	He	197	" Well , this is that letter written at the time these pictures were made . "
122054	122107	122108	122108	he	197	" I would like the jury to look at these pictures and then listen to just one passage from this letter written by Miss Alden to this defendant on the same day . He has admitted that he was refusing to write or telephone her , although he was sorry for her , "
122131	122142	122144	122144	he	197	" And now here are four more pictures , Griffiths . "
122154	122235	122144	122144	he	197	" Very cheerful , do n't you think ? Not much like pictures of a man who has just experienced a great change of heart after a most terrific period of doubt and worry and evil conduct — and has just seen the woman whom he had most cruelly wronged , but whom he now proposed to do right by , suddenly drowned . They look as though you had n't a care in the world , do n't they ? "
122236	122255	122144	122144	he	197	" Well , they were just group pictures . I could n't very well keep out of them . "
122256	122312	122144	122144	he	197	" But this one in the water here . Did n't it trouble you the least bit to go in the water the second or third day after Roberta Alden had sunk to the bottom of Big Bittern , and especially when you had experienced such an inspiring change of heart in regard to her ? "
122313	122330	122144	122144	he	197	" I did n't want any one to know I had been up there with her . "
122331	122350	122352	122352	he	2905	" We know all about that . But how about this banjo picture here . Look at this ! "
122357	122365	122366	122366	he	2905	" Very gay , is n't it ? "
122379	122390	122371	122371	Clyde	197	" But I was n't enjoying myself just the same ! "
122391	122452	122453	122453	Mason	209	" Not when you were playing the banjo here ? Not when you were playing golf and tennis with your friends the very next day after her death ? Not when you were buying and eating thirteen - dollar lunches ? Not when you were with Miss X again , and where you yourself testified that you preferred to be ? "
122466	122479	122453	122453	Mason	209	" Well , not just then , anyhow — no , sir . "
122480	122498	122453	122453	Mason	209	" What do you mean—'not just then ' ? Were n't you where you wanted to be ? "
122499	122510	122512	122512	Clyde	197	" Well , in one way I was — certainly , "
122634	122711	122615	122615	he	197	" But I was sorry about Miss Alden just the same . I could n't be happy then — I could n't be . I was just trying to make people think that I had n't had anything to do with her going up there — that 's all . I could n't see that there was any better way to do . I did n't want to be arrested for what I had n't done . "
122712	122729	122731	122731	Mason	209	" Do n't you know that is false ! Do n't you know you are lying ! "
122773	122791	122765	122765	Clyde	197	" You heard the testimony of Rufus Martin , the second cook up there at Bear Lake ? "
122792	122797	122615	122615	he	197	" Yes , sir . "
122798	122835	122765	122765	Clyde	197	" You heard him swear that he saw you and Miss X at a certain point overlooking Bear Lake and that she was in your arms and that you were kissing her . Was that true ? "
122836	122841	122615	122615	he	197	" Yes , sir . "
122842	122869	122765	122765	Clyde	197	" And that exactly four days after you had left Roberta Alden under the waters of Big Bittern . Were you afraid of being arrested then ? "
122870	122875	122615	122615	he	197	" Yes , sir . "
122876	122890	122765	122765	Clyde	197	" Even when you were kissing her and holding her in your arms ? "
122891	122896	122898	122898	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir , "
122903	122910	122912	122912	Mason	209	" Well , of all things ! "
122914	122983	122912	122912	Mason	209	" Could you imagine such stuff being whimpered before a jury , if you had n't heard it with your own ears ? Do you really sit there and swear to this jury that you could bill and coo with one deceived girl in your arms and a second one in a lake a hundred miles away , and yet be miserable because of what you were doing ? "
122984	122996	122998	122998	Clyde	197	" Just the same , that 's the way it was , "
123000	123005	123007	123007	Mason	209	" Excellent ! Incomparable , "
123056	123083	123011	123011	he	209	" Griffiths , only yesterday on the witness stand you swore that you personally had no plan to go to Big Bittern when you left Lycurgus . "
123084	123093	123011	123011	he	209	" No , sir , I had n't . "
123094	123159	123011	123011	he	209	" But when you two got in that room at the Renfrew House in Utica and you saw how tired she looked , it was you that suggested that a vacation of some kind — a little one — something within the range of your joint purses at the time — would be good for her . Was n't that the way of it ? "
123160	123172	123174	123174	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . That was the way of it , "
123176	123192	123011	123011	he	209	" But up to that time you had n't even thought of the Adirondacks specifically . "
123193	123235	123011	123011	he	209	" Well , no sir — no particular lake , that is . I did think we might go to some summer place maybe — they're mostly lakes around there — but not to any particular one that I knew of . "
123236	123265	123011	123011	he	209	" I see . And after you suggested it , it was she that said that you had better get some folders or maps , was n't it ? "
123266	123271	123011	123011	he	209	" Yes , sir . "
123272	123285	123011	123011	he	209	" And then it was that you went downstairs and got them ? "
123286	123291	123011	123011	he	209	" Yes , sir . "
123292	123300	123011	123011	he	209	" At the Renfrew House in Utica ? "
123301	123306	123011	123011	he	209	" Yes , sir . "
123307	123315	123011	123011	he	209	" Not anywhere else by any chance ? "
123316	123321	123011	123011	he	209	" No , sir . "
123322	123354	123011	123011	he	209	" And afterwards , in looking over those maps , you saw Grass Lake and Big Bittern and decided to go up that way . Was that the way of it ? "
123355	123361	123363	123363	Clyde	197	" Yes , we did , "
123397	123403	123011	123011	he	209	" You and Miss Alden ? "
123404	123409	123011	123011	he	209	" Yes , sir . "
123410	123435	123011	123011	he	209	" And you picked on Grass Lake as being the best because it was the cheapest . Was n't that the way of it ? "
123436	123446	123011	123011	he	209	" Yes , sir . That was the way . "
123447	123458	123459	123459	he	197	" I see . And now do you remember these ? "
123506	123524	123498	123498	he	197	" Look them over . Are those the folders I found in your bag at Bear Lake ? "
123525	123537	123459	123459	he	197	" Well , they look like the ones I had there . "
123538	123560	123498	123498	he	197	" Are these the ones you found in the rack at the Renfrew House and took upstairs to show Miss Alden ? "
123601	123611	123459	123459	he	197	" Compliments of Lycurgus House , Lycurgus , N. Y. "
123659	123669	123639	123639	He	197	" Yes , I think these are the ones . "
123670	123675	123678	123678	Mason	209	" Well , now , "
123682	123714	123678	123678	Mason	209	" in which one of these was it that you found that notice of Grass Lake Inn and the rate they charged up there ? Was n't it in this one ? "
123853	123874	123850	123850	he	197	" Yes , it may be the one . It looks like it . I guess it is , maybe . "
123875	123884	123886	123886	Mason	209	" Do n't you know that it is ? "
123892	123908	123886	123886	Mason	209	" Ca n't you tell from reading that item there whether it is or not ? "
123909	123917	123919	123919	Clyde	197	" Well , it looks like it , "
123938	123945	123919	123919	Clyde	197	" I suppose maybe it is . "
123946	124001	124023	124023	he	197	" You suppose ! You suppose ! Getting a little more cautious now that we 're getting down to something practical . Well , just look at that map there again and tell me what you see . Tell me if you do n't see a road marked as leading south from Grass Lake . "
124002	124005	124007	124007	Clyde	197	" Yes , "
124085	124109	124219	124219	Mason	209	" And where does it run , please ? Do you mind telling the jury where it runs — from where to where ? "
124125	124138	124111	124111	Clyde	197	" Well , it runs from Grass Lake to Three Mile Bay . "
124139	124151	124153	124153	Mason	209	" And to what or near what other places in between ? "
124160	124168	124111	124111	Clyde	197	" Gun Lodge . That 's all . "
124169	124190	124111	124111	Clyde	197	" What about Big Bittern ? Does n't it run near that when it gets to the south of it ? "
124191	124200	124111	124111	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir , it does here . "
124201	124217	124219	124219	Mason	209	" Ever notice or study that map before you went to Grass Lake from Utica ? "
124226	124235	124111	124111	Clyde	197	" No , sir — I did not . "
124236	124245	124111	124111	Clyde	197	" Never knew the road was on there ? "
124246	124255	124257	124257	Clyde	197	" Well , I may have seen it , "
124259	124272	124257	124257	Clyde	197	" but if so I did n't pay any attention to it . "
124273	124299	124111	124111	Clyde	197	" And , of course , by no possible chance could you have seen or studied this folder and that road before you left Utica ? "
124300	124311	124257	124257	Clyde	197	" No , sir . I never saw it before . "
124312	124324	124111	124111	Clyde	197	" I see . You 're absolutely positive as to that ? "
124325	124333	124257	124257	Clyde	197	" Yes , sir . I am . "
124334	124386	124389	124389	he	2917	" Well then , explain to me , or to this jury , if you can , and under your solemn oath which you respect so much , how it comes that this particular folder chances to be marked , ' Compliments of the Lycurgus House , Lycurgus , N. Y. ' "
124466	124472	124473	124473	he	2917	" I do n't know , "
124484	124495	124473	124473	he	2917	" It must have been in the Renfrew House rack . "
124496	124567	124569	124569	he	2917	" Oh , must it ? And if I bring two witnesses here to swear that on July third — three days before you left Lycurgus for Fonda — you were seen by them to enter the Lycurgus House and take four or five folders from the rack there , will you still say that it ' musta been in the rack at the Renfrew House ' on July sixth ? "
124629	124644	124614	124614	he	197	" Well , it musta been . I did n't get it in Lycurgus . "
124645	124664	124666	124666	he	209	" Very good . But in the meantime we 'll just let these gentlemen here look at this , "
124742	124747	124737	124737	Mason	209	" That 's all . "

126402	126432	126306	126306	Oberwaltzer	326	" And it must be remembered that evidence is not to be discredited or decried because it is circumstantial . It may often be more reliable evidence than direct evidence .

126494	126583	126306	126306	Oberwaltzer	326	" If the jury finds that Roberta Alden accidentally or involuntarily fell out of the boat and that the defendant made no attempt to rescue her , that does not make the defendant guilty and the jury must find the defendant ' not guilty . ' On the other hand , if the jury finds that the defendant in any way , intentionally , there and then brought about or contributed to that fatal accident , either by a blow or otherwise , it must find the defendant guilty .

There can be no compromising with sin in any one . And though my heart goes out in sympathy and love to the bleeding heart of her dear mother and father who have suffered so , still we must not fail to see that this sin was mutual and that the world should know and judge accordingly .

143752	143760	143743	143743	he	197	" Yes , I guess I am . "
143794	143804	143783	143784	the man	504	" Your name 's Griffiths , is n't it ? "
143805	143808	143743	143743	he	197	" Yes . "
143809	143829	143830	143830	He	197	" Well , my name 's Nicholson . Do n't be frightened . You 'll get used to it . "
143854	143865	143867	143867	Clyde	197	" I do n't suppose I 'm so scared either , "
143880	143920	143921	143921	He	197	" Well , that 's good . Be game . We all have to be here — or the whole place would go crazy . Better breathe a little . Or walk fast . It 'll do you good . "

146018	146029	146097	146097	Clyde	197	" Yes , he 's topped off , poor devil . "
146054	146065	146097	146097	Clyde	197	" There — sure — that 's the end now . "
146066	146079	146097	146097	Clyde	197	" Yes . He knows what 's on the other side now . "

147285	147305	147250	147250	Clyde	197	" And he can walk here . And be so calm . What sort of a man is this ? "
147355	147366	147342	147342	Clyde	197	" I 'm sending you something to remember me by . "
147445	147461	147440	147440	he	418	" God bless you all . I hope you have good luck and get out . "
148162	148183	148149	148150	St. John	436	" He that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me , scattereth . "
148804	148880	148800	148800	he	431	" I bring you , Clyde , the mercy and the salvation of your God . He has called on me and I have come . He has sent me that I may say unto you though your sins be as scarlet , they shall be white — like snow . Though they be red , like crimson , they shall be as wool . Come now , let us reason together with the Lord . "
148952	148959	148960	148960	he	749	" Duncan McMillan is my name , "
148963	149031	148960	148960	he	749	" and I come from the work of the Lord in Syracuse . He has sent me — just as he sent your mother to me . She has told me all that she believes . I have read all that you have said . And I know why you are here . But it is to bring you spiritual joy and gladness that I am here . "
149040	149188	149033	149033	he	749	" Clyde , those are all words addressed to you . They come to me here to say to you just as though they were being whispered to me . I am but the mouthpiece for these words spoken direct to you . Take counsel with your own heart . Turn from the shadow to the light . Let us break these bonds of misery and gloom ; chase these shadows and this darkness . You have sinned . The Lord can and will forgive . Repent . Join with Him who has shaped the world and keeps it . He will not spurn your faith ; He will not neglect your prayers . Turn — in yourself — in the confines of this cell — and say : ' Lord , help me . Lord , hear Thou my prayer . Lord , lighten mine eyes ! '
149189	149382	149383	149383	He	3753	" Do you think there is no God — and that He will not answer you ? Pray . In your trouble turn to Him — not me — or any other . But to Him . Pray . Speak to Him . Call to Him . Tell Him the truth and ask for help . As surely as you are here before me — and if in your heart you truly repent of any evil you have done — truly , truly , you will hear and feel Him . He will take your hand . He will enter this cell and your soul . You will know Him by the peace and the light that will fill your mind and heart . Pray . And if you need me again to help you in any way — to pray with you — or to do you any service of any kind — to cheer you in your loneliness — you have only to send for me ; drop me a card . I have promised your mother and I will do what I can . The warden has my address . "
149439	149479	149482	149482	he	197	" I 'll always be in easy reach . I have a lot of religious work over in Syracuse but I 'll be glad to drop it at any time that I can really do anything more for you . "
149522	149613	149614	149614	His	197	" Oh , do n't go just yet . Please do n't . It 's very nice of you to come and see me and I 'm obliged to you . My mother wrote me you might . You see , it 's very lonely here . I have n't thought much of what you were saying , perhaps , because I have n't felt as guilty as some think I am . But I 've been sorry enough . And certainly any one in here pays a good deal . "
149637	149746	149626	149626	McMillan	431	" Clyde , you need n't worry . I 'll come to see you again within a week , because now I see you need me . I 'm not asking you to pray because I think you are guilty of the death of Roberta Alden . I do n't know . You have n't told me . Only you and God know what your sins and your sorrows are . But I do know you need spiritual help and He will give you that — oh , fully . ' The Lord will be a refuge for the oppressed ; a refuge in time of trouble . ' "
149937	150189	149923	149925	the Reverend Duncan	438	" Well , do n't worry , Clyde . Enlightenment and peace are surely going to come to you . I can see that . You have a Bible there , I see . Open it anywhere in Psalms and read . The 51st , 91st , 23rd . Open to St. John . Read it all — over and over . Think and pray — and think on all the things about you — the moon , the stars , the sun , the trees , the sea — your own beating heart , your body and strength — and ask yourself who made them . How did they come to be ? Then , if you ca n't explain them , ask yourself if the one who made them and you — whoever he is , whatever he is , wherever he is , is n't strong and wise enough and kind enough to help you when you need help — provide you with light and peace and guidance , when you need them . Just ask yourself what of the Maker of all this certain reality . And then ask Him — the Creator of it all — to tell you how and what to do . Do n't doubt . Just ask and see . Ask in the night — in the day . Bow your head and pray and see . Verily , He will not fail you . I know because I have that peace . "
150918	150931	150932	150932	he	431	" It was given unto you to know the Peace of God , "
150975	150982	150961	150961	he	431	" peace that passeth all understanding . "
151011	151095	151097	151097	he	197	" Ask , and ye shall receive ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you . For every one that asketh , receiveth ; and he that seeketh , findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened . For what man is there of you whom , if his son ask bread , will give him a stone ; or , if he ask fish , will give him a serpent ? "
151659	151685	151653	151655	The Rev. McMillan	431	" He hath said God hath forgotten ; He hideth His face . But He has not forgotten . He has not hidden His face . "
151804	151820	151821	151821	He	197	" The Heavens declare the Glory of God , and the Firmament sheweth His handiwork . "
151841	151853	151821	151821	He	197	" For He is Thy life and Thy length of Days . "
151990	152051	151951	151951	Clyde	197	" Brethren now are we the children of God . And it doth not yet appear what we shall be ; but we know that when He shall appear we shall be like Him , for we shall see Him as He is . And every man that has this hope in him purifieth himself even as He is pure . "
152052	152074	151951	151951	Clyde	197	" Hereby know that we dwell in Him and He in us , because He hath given us of His spirit . "
152075	152084	151951	151951	Clyde	197	" For ye are bought with a price . "
152085	152142	151951	151951	Clyde	197	" Of His own will begot He us with the word of truth , and we should be a kind of first fruits of His creatures . And every good and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning . "
152143	152156	151951	151951	Clyde	197	" Draw nigh unto God and He will draw nigh unto you . "
153917	153990	153897	153897	his	197	" Clyde — This is so that you will not think that some one once dear to you has utterly forgotten you . She has suffered much , too . And though she can never understand how you could have done as you did , still , even now , although she is never to see you again , she is not without sorrow and sympathy and wishes you freedom and happiness . "
154441	154484	154424	154425	the Negro	3858	" Oh , big wheel ro - a - lin' ... hmp ! Oh , big wheel ro - a - lin' ... hmp ! Oh , big wheel ro - a - lin' ... hmp ! Foh me ! Foh me ! "
154523	154533	154521	154521	Farewell	452	" Although she is never to see you again . "
154638	154707	154712	154714	Big Tom Rooney	453	" I have been evil . I have been unkind . I have lied . Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! I have been unfaithful . My heart has been wicked . I have joined with those who have done evil things . Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! I have stolen . I have been false . I have been cruel ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! "
154731	154759	154712	154714	Big Tom Rooney	453	" For Christ 's sake ! I know you feel bad . But so do I. Oh , for God 's sake , do n't do that ! "
154781	154874	154780	154780	him	197	silently—"I have been evil . I have been unkind . I have lied . Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! I have been unfaithful . My heart has been wicked . I have joined with those who have done evil things . Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! I have been false . I have been cruel . I have sought to murder . Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! And for what ? A vain — impossible dream ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh! ... Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! ... "
155062	155132	155049	155049	he	438	" What ! Was not the peace of God within his grasp and for the asking . To one who sought God and found Him , as he surely would , if he sought , there could be no sorrow , but only joy . ' Hereby know we that we dwell in Him , and He in us , because He hath given us of His spirit . ' "
156097	156101	156089	156089	he	197	" Do nothing . "
156387	156418	156419	156421	The Reverend McMillan	438	" Up to the time you went in that boat with her , Clyde , you had not changed in your mood toward her — your intention to — to — "
156525	156532	156602	156604	The Reverend McMillan	438	" No , I had not . "
156533	156562	156602	156604	The Reverend McMillan	438	" You were , as you say , angry with yourself for being so weak as not to be able to do what you had planned to do . "
156563	156601	156602	156604	The Reverend McMillan	438	" In a way it was like that , yes . But then I was sorry , too , you see . And maybe afraid . I 'm not exactly sure now . Maybe not , either . "
156621	156645	156602	156604	The Reverend McMillan	438	" But at the same time , as you say , you were angry with her for having driven you to that point . "
156646	156649	156602	156604	The Reverend McMillan	438	" Yes . "
156650	156663	156602	156604	The Reverend McMillan	438	" Where you were compelled to wrestle with so terrible a problem ? "
156664	156667	156602	156604	The Reverend McMillan	438	" Yes . "
156668	156683	156602	156604	The Reverend McMillan	438	" Tst ! Tst ! Tst ! And so you thought of striking her . "
156684	156690	156602	156604	The Reverend McMillan	438	" Yes , I did . "
156691	156697	156602	156604	The Reverend McMillan	438	" But you could not . "
156698	156701	156602	156604	The Reverend McMillan	438	" No . "
156702	156754	156602	156604	The Reverend McMillan	438	" Praised be the mercy of God . Yet in the blow that you did strike — unintentionally — as you say — there was still some anger against her . That was why the blow was so — so severe . You did not want her to come near you . "
156755	156802	156602	156604	The Reverend McMillan	438	" No , I did n't . I think I did n't , anyhow . I 'm not quite sure . It may be that I was n't quite right . Anyhow — all worked up , I guess — sick almost . I — I — "
156869	156883	156863	156863	himself	438	" Wide is the gate and broad the way that leadeth to destruction . "
156889	156898	156863	156863	himself	438	" But you did rise to save her . "
156899	156925	156859	156861	the Reverend McMillan	438	" Yes , afterwards , I got up . I meant to catch her after she fell back . That was what upset the boat . "
156926	156936	156863	156863	himself	438	" And you did really want to catch her ? "
156937	156959	156859	156861	the Reverend McMillan	438	" I do n't know . At the moment I guess I did . Anyhow I felt sorry , I think . "
156960	156990	156863	156863	himself	438	" But can you say now truly and positively , as your Creator sees you , that you were sorry — or that you wanted to save her then ? "
156991	157001	157003	157003	Clyde	197	" It all happened so quick , you see , "
157010	157102	157003	157003	Clyde	197	" that I 'm not just sure . No , I do n't know that I was so very sorry . No . I really do n't know , you see , now . Sometimes I think maybe I was , a little , sometimes not , maybe . But after she was gone and I was on shore , I felt sorry — a little . But I was sort of glad , too , you know , to be free , and yet frightened , too — You see — "
157103	157128	156863	156863	himself	438	" Yes , I know . You were going to that Miss X. But out there , when she was in the water — ? "
157129	157132	157003	157003	Clyde	197	" No . "
157133	157144	156863	156863	himself	438	" You did not want to go to her rescue ? "
157145	157148	157003	157003	Clyde	197	" No . "
157149	157166	156863	156863	himself	438	" Tst ! Tst ! Tst ! You felt no sorrow ? No shame ? Then ? "
157167	157203	157003	157003	Clyde	197	" Yes , shame , maybe . Maybe sorrow , too , a little . I knew it was terrible . I felt that it was , of course . But still — you see — "
157204	157219	156863	156863	himself	438	" Yes , I know . That Miss X. You wanted to get away . "
157220	157238	157003	157003	Clyde	197	" Yes — but mostly I was frightened , and I did n't want to help her . "
157239	157265	156863	156863	himself	438	" Yes ! Yes ! Tst ! Tst ! Tst ! If she drowned you could go to that Miss X. You thought of that ? "
157277	157280	157003	157003	Clyde	197	" Yes . "
157281	157295	157003	157003	Clyde	197	" My son ! My son ! In your heart was murder then . "
157296	157301	157302	157302	Clyde	197	" Yes , yes , "
157306	157318	157302	157302	Clyde	197	" I have thought since it must have been that way . "
157341	157371	157339	157339	himself	438	" Our Father who art in Heaven — hallowed be Thy name . Thy Kingdom come , Thy will be done — on earth as it is in Heaven . "
157379	157497	157498	157498	He	438	" Ah , Clyde . The mercy of God is equal to every sin . I know it . He sent His own son to die for the evil of the world . It must be so — if you will but repent . But that thought ! That deed ! You have much to pray for , my son — much . Oh , yes . For in the sight of God , I fear,—yes — And yet — I must pray for enlightenment . This is a strange and terrible story . There are so many phases . It may be but pray . Pray with me now that you and I may have light . "
157533	157616	157530	157530	he	438	" Oh , Lord , rebuke me not in thine anger ; neither chasten me in Thy hot displeasure . Have mercy on me , O Lord , for I am weak . Heal me in my shame and sorrow for my soul is wounded and dark in Thy sight . Oh , let the wickedness of my heart pass . Lead me , O God , into Thy righteousness . Let the wickedness of my heart pass and remember it not . "
157677	157809	157674	157674	McMillan	438	" But I must go now . I must think — pray . This has troubled and touched me deeply . Oh , very , Lord . And you — my son — you return and pray — alone . Repent . Ask of God on your knees His forgiveness and He will hear you . Yes , He will . And to - morrow — or as soon as I honestly can — I will come again . But do not despair . Pray always — for in prayer alone , prayer and contrition , is salvation . Rest in the strength of Him who holds the world in the hollow of His hand . In His abounding strength and mercy , is peace and forgiveness . Oh , yes . "
159096	159174	159046	159046	Belknap	323	" We are mindful that this is a case of circumstantial evidence and that the only eyewitness denies that death was the result of crime . But in obedience to the most exacting requirements of that manner of proof , the counsel for the people , with very unusual thoroughness and ability has investigated and presented evidence of a great number of circumstances for the purpose of truly solving the question of the defendant 's guilt or innocence .
159175	159231	159319	159319	McMillan	438	" We might think that the proof of some of these facts standing by themselves was subject to doubt by reason of unsatisfactory or contradictory evidence , and that other occurrences might be so explained or interpreted as to be reconcilable with innocence . The defense — and very ably — sought to enforce this view .
159232	159314	159046	159046	Belknap	323	" But taken all together and considered as a connected whole , they make such convincing proof of guilt that we are not able to escape from its force by any justifiable process of reasoning and we are compelled to say that not only is the verdict not opposed to the weight of evidence , and to the proper inference to be drawn from it , but that it is abundantly justified thereby . Decision of the lower court unanimously confirmed . "
159593	159656	159657	159657	He	197	" So they decided against me . Now I will have to go through that door after all,—like all those others . They 'll draw the curtains for me , too . Into that other room — then back across the passage — saying good - bye as I go , like those others . I will not be here any more . "
159805	159885	159799	159801	the Reverend Duncan	438	" But you see we have n't reached the end of this yet . There is a new Governor coming into office in January . He is a very sensible and kindly man , I hear . In fact I know several people who know him — and it is my plan to see him personally — as well as to have some other people whom I know write him on the strength of what I will tell them . "
159912	159933	159907	159907	he	197	" My mother . I suppose some one ought to telegraph her . She is going to feel very bad . "
159937	159966	159967	159967	He	197	" I do n't suppose they believed that those letters should n't have been introduced just as they were , did they ? I thought maybe they would . "
159973	159980	159986	159986	McMillan	438	" Do n't worry , Clyde , "
160009	160053	159986	159986	McMillan	438	" I have already telegraphed your mother . As for that decision — I will see your lawyers right away . Besides — as I say — I propose to see the Governor myself . He is a new man , you see . "
160711	160807	160808	160808	Her	3955	" Oh , my dear Governor , how can the sacrifice of my son 's life now , and when spiritually he has purged his soul of sin and is ready to devote himself to the work of God , repay the state for the loss of that poor , dear girl 's life , whether it was accidentally or otherwise taken — how can it ? Can not the millions of people of the state of New York be merciful ? Can not you as their representative exercise the mercy that they may feel ? "
161003	161012	161013	161014	the Governor	4626	" But you , personally , Mr. McMillan , "
161022	161099	161013	161014	the Governor	4626	" because of your long contact with him in the prison there — do you know of any material fact not introduced at the trial which would in any way tend to invalidate or weaken any phase of the testimony offered at the trial ? As you must know this is a legal proceeding . I can not act upon sentiment alone — and especially in the face of the unanimous decision of two separate courts . "
161239	161263	161266	161266	he	445	" Ye are the salt of the earth ; but if the salt have lost his savor , wherewith shall it be salted ? "
161269	161290	161266	161266	he	445	" As his spiritual advisor I have entered only upon the spiritual , not the legal aspect of his life . "
161333	161438	161330	161331	Mrs. Griffiths	335	" Unless some definite evidence such as I have not yet seen and which will affect the legality of these two findings can be brought me , I have no alternative , Mrs. Griffiths , but to allow the verdict as written to stand . I am very sorry — oh , more than I can tell you . But if the law is to be respected its decisions can never be altered except for reasons that in themselves are full of legal merit . I wish I could decide differently . I do indeed . My heart and my prayers go with you . "
161579	161598	161599	161599	He	4626	" Never in my life have I faced a sadder duty . It will always be with me . "
162238	162258	162218	162218	Clyde	197	" Clyde , if there is anything you have not confessed , you must confess it before you go . "
162259	162278	162218	162218	Clyde	197	" I have confessed everything to God and to Mr. McMillan , Mother . Is n't that enough ? "
162279	162304	162218	162218	Clyde	197	" No , Clyde . You have told the world that you are innocent . But if you are not you must say so . "
162305	162322	162218	162218	Clyde	197	" But if my conscience tells me that I am right , is not that enough ? "
162323	162336	162338	162339	Mrs. Griffiths	335	" No , not if God 's word says differently , Clyde , "
163391	163588	163379	163379	his	3986	" Lord , give me peace . Lord , give me light . Lord , give me strength to resist any evil thoughts that I should not have . I know I am not wholly white . Oh , no . I know I plotted evil . Yes , yes , I know that . I confess . But must I really die now ? Is there no help ? Will you not help me , Lord ? Will you not manifest yourself , as my mother says you will — for me ? Will you get the Governor to change my sentence before the final moment to life imprisonment ? Will you get the Reverend McMillan to change his views and go to him , and my mother , too ? I will drive out all sinful thoughts . I will be different . Oh , yes , I will , if you will only spare me . Do not let me die now — so soon . Do not . I will pray . Yes , I will . Give me the strength to understand and believe — and pray . Oh , do ! "
163885	163913	163879	163879	I	0	" I know in whom I have believed , and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day "
164076	164119	164065	164065	McMillan	438	" And the victory is won , Clyde . ' This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise . ' You have His word . Your soul and your body belong to Him . Praised , everlastingly , be His name . "
164149	164199	164126	164126	he	438	" My son , my son , in whom I am well pleased . In you God has truly manifested His truth . His power to save . I see it . I feel it . Your address to the world is really His own voice to the world . "
164333	164370	164327	164331	the Hon . David Waltham	463	" Can you say before your God that you have no doubt of Clyde 's guilt ? Please wire . If you can not , then his blood will be upon your head . His mother . "
164384	164403	164372	164373	Robert Fessler	465	" Governor Waltham does not think himself justified in interfering with the decision of the Court of Appeals . "
164593	164626	164587	164587	he	197	" Mama , you must believe that I die resigned and content . It wo n't be hard . God has heard my prayers . He has given me strength and peace . "
164632	164636	164629	164629	himself	197	" Had he ? "
164642	164681	164638	164639	Mrs. Griffiths	335	" My son ! My son , I know , I know . I have faith too . I know that my Redeemer liveth and that He is yours . Though we die — yet shall we live ! "
164714	164721	164723	164723	her	335	" My son — my baby — "
164819	164832	164793	164794	the guards	3618	" It is time , I fear . Courage , my son . "
164892	164910	164884	164884	John	436	" Let not your heart be troubled . Ye believe in God — believe also in me . "
164952	165034	164947	164949	the Reverend McMillan	438	" Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you in due time . Cast all your care upon Him for He careth for you . Be at peace . Wise and righteous are His ways , who hath called us into His eternal glory by Christ Jesus , after that we have suffered a little . I am the way , the truth and the life — no man cometh unto the Father but by me . "
165054	165061	165040	165040	Clyde	197	" Good - by , Clyde . "
165074	165081	165063	165063	Clyde	197	" Good - by , all . "
165557	165573	165576	165576	he	197	" I know my Redeemer liveth and that He will keep him against that day . "
165640	165649	165654	165654	her	3123	" I know in whom I have believed , "
166017	166024	166027	166028	the wife	500	" Russell , stay close now . "
166031	166039	166027	166028	the wife	500	" Better take hold of my hand . "
166040	166046	166048	166049	the husband	501	" It seems to me , "
166057	166068	166048	166049	the husband	501	" that the traffic here grows worse all the time . "
166102	166106	166108	166116	a passing bank clerk to his cashier girl friend	4093	" Street preachers , "
166118	166130	166108	166116	a passing bank clerk to his cashier girl friend	4093	" Sure — I see them up here nearly every Wednesday . "
166131	166166	166108	166116	a passing bank clerk to his cashier girl friend	4093	" Gee , it 's pretty tough on the little kid , I should think . He 's pretty small to be dragged around on the streets , do n't you think , Ella ? "
166167	166202	166204	166204	Ella	178	" Well , I 'll say so . I 'd hate to see a brother of mine in on any such game . What kind of a life is that for a kid anyhow ? "
166339	166360	166312	166313	The husband	501	" We will begin with 276 tonight . ' How firm a foundation . ' All right , Miss Schoof . "
166665	166688	166659	166659	each	2326	" Well , here is one , who , whatever her defects , probably does what she believes as nearly as possible . "
166795	166813	166790	166791	the husband	501	" A fine night . It seemed to me they were a little more attentive than usual . "
166814	166819	166821	166828	the younger woman that had played the organ	4129	" Oh , yes , "
166830	166853	166821	166828	the younger woman that had played the organ	4129	" At least eleven took tracts . And one old gentleman asked me where the mission was and when we held services . "
166854	166859	166861	166862	the man	504	" Praise the Lord , "

166964	166985	166960	166961	the boy	4131	" Yes , I guess so , Russell . But listen to me . You are to come right back . "
166986	167000	167001	167001	He	4131	" Yes , I will , grandma , sure . You know me . "
