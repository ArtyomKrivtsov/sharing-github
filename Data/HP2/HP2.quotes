3938	3949	3927	3928	the elf	397	“ Dobby almost spoke ill of his family , sir ... ”
3950	3954	3881	3881	Harry	84	“ Your family ? ”
3955	3981	3927	3928	the elf	397	“ The wizard family Dobby serves , sir ... Dobby is a house - elf — bound to serve one house and one family forever ... ”
3982	3990	3992	3992	Harry	84	“ Do they know you ’re here ? ”
3998	4044	3927	3928	the elf	397	“ Oh , no , sir , no ... Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you , sir . Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this . If they ever knew , sir — ”
4045	4061	3927	3928	the elf	397	“ But wo n’t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door ? ”
4062	4100	3927	3928	the elf	397	“ Dobby doubts it , sir . Dobby is always having to punish himself for something , sir . They lets Dobby get on with it , sir . Sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments ... ”

4112	4144	3927	3928	the elf	397	“ A house - elf must be set free , sir . And the family will never set Dobby free ... Dobby will serve the family until he dies , sir ... ”

4167	4186	4164	4164	he	84	“ This makes the Dursleys sound almost human . Ca n’t anyone help you ? Ca n’t I ? ”
4206	4209	4210	4210	Harry	84	“ Please , ”
4214	4232	4210	4210	Harry	84	“ please be quiet . If the Dursleys hear anything , if they know you ’re here — ”
4233	4261	4164	4164	he	84	“ Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby ... Dobby has heard of your greatness , sir , but of your goodness , Dobby never knew ... ”
4275	4306	4262	4262	Harry	84	“ Whatever you ’ve heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish . I ’m not even top of my year at Hogwarts ; that ’s Hermione , she — ”
4319	4327	4329	4329	Dobby	104	“ Harry Potter is humble and modest , ”
4339	4360	4329	4329	Dobby	104	“ Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named — ”
4361	4364	4366	4366	Harry	84	“ Voldemort ? ”
4379	4394	4370	4370	his	104	“ Ah , speak not the name , sir ! Speak not the name ! ”
4395	4398	4400	4400	Harry	84	“ Sorry , ”

4488	4493	4494	4494	he	104	“ Ah , sir , ”
4511	4564	4494	4494	he	104	“ Harry Potter is valiant and bold ! He has braved so many dangers already ! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter , to warn him , even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later ... Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts . ”
4590	4595	4596	4596	Harry	84	“ W - what ? ”
4599	4648	4596	4596	Harry	84	“ But I ’ve got to go back — term starts on September first . It ’s all that ’s keeping me going . You do n’t know what it ’s like here . I do n’t belong here . I belong in your world — at Hogwarts . ”
4649	4656	4658	4658	Dobby	104	“ No , no , no , ”
4669	4705	4658	4658	Dobby	104	“ Harry Potter must stay where he is safe . He is too great , too good , to lose . If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts , he will be in mortal danger . ”
4706	4709	4711	4711	Harry	84	“ Why ? ”
4715	4742	4744	4744	Dobby	104	“ There is a plot , Harry Potter . A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year , ”
4751	4777	4744	4744	Dobby	104	“ Dobby has known it for months , sir . Harry Potter must not put himself in peril . He is too important , sir ! ”
4778	4783	4785	4785	Harry	84	“ What terrible things ? ”
4789	4795	4785	4785	Harry	84	“ Who ’s plotting them ? ”
4812	4816	4818	4818	Harry	84	“ All right ! ”
4829	4846	4818	4818	Harry	84	“ You ca n’t tell me . I understand . But why are you warning me ? ”
4855	4888	4889	4889	he	84	“ Hang on — this has n’t got anything to do with Vol- — sorry — with You - Know - Who , has it ? You could just shake or nod , ”
4911	4929	4937	4937	he	104	“ Not — not He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named , sir — ”
4956	4967	4937	4937	he	104	“ He has n’t got a brother , has he ? ”
4979	5001	5003	5003	Harry	84	“ Well then , I ca n’t think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts , ”
5005	5027	5003	5003	Harry	84	“ I mean , there ’s Dumbledore , for one thing — you know who Dumbledore is , do n’t you ? ”
5033	5081	5083	5083	Dobby	104	“ Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had . Dobby knows it , sir . Dobby has heard Dumbledore ’s powers rival those of He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named at the height of his strength . But , sir ”
5092	5105	5083	5083	Dobby	104	“ there are powers Dumbledore does n’t ... powers no decent wizard ... ”
5161	5175	5152	5153	Uncle Vernon	85	“ Dudley must have left his television on again , the little tyke ! ”
5176	5183	5185	5185	Harry	84	“ Quick ! In the closet ! ”
5208	5221	5223	5224	Uncle Vernon	85	“ What — the — devil — are — you — doing ? ”
5237	5266	5229	5229	his	85	“ You ’ve just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke ... One more sound and you ’ll wish you ’d never been born , boy ! ”
5286	5294	5295	5295	he	84	“ See what it ’s like here ? ”
5298	5328	5295	5295	he	84	“ See why I ’ve got to go back to Hogwarts ? It ’s the only place I ’ve got — well , I think I ’ve got friends . ”
5329	5340	5342	5342	Dobby	104	“ Friends who do n’t even write to Harry Potter ? ”
5345	5357	5359	5359	Harry	84	“ I expect they ’ve just been — wait a minute , ”
5363	5377	5359	5359	Harry	84	“ How do you know my friends have n’t been writing to me ? ”
5383	5400	5431	5431	he	104	“ Harry Potter must n’t be angry with Dobby . Dobby did it for the best — ”
5401	5409	5431	5431	he	104	“ Have you been stopping my letters ? ”
5410	5418	5420	5421	the elf	397	“ Dobby has them here , sir , ”
5486	5520	5479	5479	Dobby	104	“ Harry Potter must n’t be angry ... Dobby hoped ... if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him ... Harry Potter might not want to go back to school , sir ... ”
5541	5586	5535	5535	Dobby	104	“ Harry Potter will have them , sir , if he gives Dobby his word that he will not return to Hogwarts . Ah , sir , this is a danger you must not face ! Say you wo n’t go back , sir ! ”
5587	5590	5592	5592	Harry	84	“ No , ”
5595	5603	5592	5592	Harry	84	“ Give me my friends ’ letters ! ”
5604	5613	5615	5616	the elf	397	“ Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice , ”
5689	5714	5685	5686	Uncle Vernon	85	“ . . . tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers , Mr. Mason . She ’s been dying to hear ... ”
5763	5766	5768	5768	Harry	84	“ No , ”
5770	5778	5768	5768	Harry	84	“ Please ... they ’ll kill me ... ”
5779	5792	5867	5867	Dobby	104	“ Harry Potter must say he ’s not going back to school — ”
5793	5798	5768	5768	Harry	84	“ Dobby ... please ... ”
5799	5805	5867	5867	Dobby	104	“ Say it , sir — ”
5806	5811	5768	5768	Harry	84	“ I ca n’t — ”
5819	5835	5812	5812	Dobby	104	“ Then Dobby must do it , sir , for Harry Potter ’s own good . ”
5922	5941	5943	5943	He	85	“ Just our nephew — very disturbed — meeting strangers upsets him , so we kept him upstairs ... ”
6139	6143	6144	6144	he	85	“ Read it ! ”
6156	6163	6144	6144	he	85	“ Go on — read it ! ”
6316	6332	6334	6335	Uncle Vernon	85	“ You did n’t tell us you were n’t allowed to use magic outside school , ”
6345	6358	6342	6342	his	85	“ Forgot to mention it ... Slipped your mind , I daresay ... ”
6375	6418	6359	6359	He	85	“ Well , I ’ve got news for you , boy ... I ’m locking you up ... You ’re never going back to that school ... never ... and if you try and magic yourself out — they ’ll expel you ! ”
6735	6754	6756	6756	Harry	84	“ It ’s no good turning your beak up at it — that ’s all we ’ve got , ”
6929	6938	6926	6926	Dobby	104	“ Harry Potter is safe there , sir ! ”
6959	6963	6964	6964	Harry	84	“ Stop it , ”
6975	6990	6964	6964	Harry	84	“ Leave me alone ... cut it out ... I ’m trying to sleep ... ”

7137	7144	7146	7146	Ron	99	“ What ’s been going on ? ”
7148	7189	7146	7146	Ron	99	“ Why have n’t you been answering my letters ? I ’ve asked you to stay about twelve times , and then Dad came home and said you ’d got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles — ”
7190	7202	7135	7135	George	111	“ It was n’t me — and how did he know ? ”
7203	7210	7212	7212	Ron	99	“ He works for the Ministry , ”
7214	7227	7212	7212	Ron	99	“ You know we ’re not supposed to do spells outside school — ”
7228	7233	7235	7235	Harry	84	“ You should talk , ”
7243	7251	7253	7253	Ron	99	“ Oh , this does n’t count , ”
7255	7285	7253	7253	Ron	99	“ We ’re only borrowing this . It ’s Dad ’s , we did n’t enchant it . But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with — ”
7286	7355	7212	7212	Ron	99	“ I told you , I did n’t — but it ’ll take too long to explain now — look , can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and wo n’t let me come back , and obviously I ca n’t magic myself out , because the Ministry’ll think that ’s the second spell I ’ve done in three days , so — ”
7356	7360	7362	7362	Ron	99	“ Stop gibbering , ”
7364	7375	7362	7362	Ron	99	“ We ’ve come to take you home with us . ”
7376	7386	7212	7212	Ron	99	“ But you ca n’t magic me out either — ”
7387	7394	7396	7396	Ron	99	“ We do n’t need to , ”
7408	7418	7399	7399	his	99	“ You forget who I ’ve got with me . ”
7419	7426	7428	7428	Fred	110	“ Tie that around the bars , ”
7439	7450	7452	7452	Harry	84	“ If the Dursleys wake up , I ’m dead , ”
7469	7474	7476	7476	Fred	110	“ Do n’t worry , ”
7478	7483	7476	7476	Fred	110	“ and stand back . ”
7607	7611	7612	7612	Ron	99	“ Get in , ”
7615	7628	7612	7612	Ron	99	“ But all my Hogwarts stuff — my wand — my broomstick — ”
7629	7634	7596	7596	Fred	110	“ Where is it ? ”
7635	7654	7612	7612	Ron	99	“ Locked in the cupboard under the stairs , and I ca n’t get out of this room — ”
7655	7659	7661	7661	George	111	“ No problem , ”
7668	7676	7661	7661	George	111	“ Out of the way , Harry . ”
7717	7737	7739	7739	Fred	110	“ A lot of wizards think it ’s a waste of time , knowing this sort of Muggle trick , ”
7741	7759	7739	7739	Fred	110	“ but we feel they ’re skills worth learning , even if they are a bit slow . ”
7771	7795	7797	7797	George	111	“ So — we ’ll get your trunk — you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to Ron , ”
7799	7810	7811	7811	Harry	84	“ Watch out for the bottom stair — it creaks , ”
7923	7928	7930	7930	Fred	110	“ A bit more , ”
7940	7945	7930	7930	Fred	110	“ One good push — ”
7970	7977	7978	7978	George	111	“ Okay , let ’s go , ”
8009	8014	8004	8005	Uncle Vernon	85	“ THAT RUDDY OWL ! ”
8015	8021	8004	8005	Uncle Vernon	85	“ I ’ve forgotten Hedwig ! ”
8129	8132	8134	8135	Uncle Vernon	85	“ Petunia ! ”
8137	8148	8134	8135	Uncle Vernon	85	“ He ’s getting away ! HE ’S GETTING AWAY ! ”
8181	8189	8191	8191	Ron	99	“ Put your foot down , Fred ! ”
8256	8262	8263	8263	Harry	84	“ See you next summer ! ”
8285	8290	8291	8291	he	99	“ Let Hedwig out , ”
8295	8315	8291	8291	he	99	“ She can fly behind us . She has n’t had a chance to stretch her wings for ages . ”
8343	8353	8355	8355	Ron	99	“ So — what ’s the story , Harry ? ”
8358	8364	8355	8355	Ron	99	“ What ’s been happening ? ”
8398	8402	8404	8404	Fred	110	“ Very fishy , ”
8407	8411	8413	8413	George	111	“ Definitely dodgy , ”
8415	8433	8413	8413	George	111	“ So he would n’t even tell you who ’s supposed to be plotting all this stuff ? ”
8434	8442	8444	8444	Harry	84	“ I do n’t think he could , ”
8446	8470	8444	8444	Harry	84	“ I told you , every time he got close to letting something slip , he started banging his head against the wall . ”
8481	8492	8494	8494	Harry	84	“ What , you think he was lying to me ? ”
8496	8499	8501	8501	Fred	110	“ Well , ”
8503	8567	8501	8501	Fred	110	“ put it this way — house - elves have got powerful magic of their own , but they ca n’t usually use it without their master ’s permission . I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back to Hogwarts . Someone ’s idea of a joke . Can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you ? ”
8568	8571	8573	8573	Harry	84	“ Yes , ”
8580	8584	8585	8585	Harry	84	“ Draco Malfoy , ”
8588	8593	8585	8585	Harry	84	“ He hates me . ”
8594	8598	8600	8600	George	111	“ Draco Malfoy ? ”
8605	8612	8600	8600	George	111	“ Not Lucius Malfoy ’s son ? ”
8613	8628	8630	8630	Harry	84	“ Must be , it ’s not a very common name , is it ? ”
8632	8635	8630	8630	Harry	84	“ Why ? ”
8636	8645	8647	8647	George	111	“ I ’ve heard Dad talking about him , ”
8649	8662	8647	8647	George	111	“ He was a big supporter of You - Know - Who . ”
8663	8673	8675	8675	Fred	110	“ And when You - Know - Who disappeared , ”
8684	8717	8675	8675	Fred	110	“ Lucius Malfoy came back saying he ’d never meant any of it . Load of dung — Dad reckons he was right in You - Know - Who ’s inner circle . ”
8753	8767	8769	8769	Harry	84	“ I do n’t know whether the Malfoys own a house - elf ... ”
8771	8790	8792	8792	Fred	110	“ Well , whoever owns him will be an old Wizarding family , and they ’ll be rich , ”
8794	8812	8814	8814	George	111	“ Yeah , Mum ’s always wishing we had a house - elf to do the ironing , ”
8816	8861	8814	8814	George	111	“ But all we ’ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden . House - elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that ; you would n’t catch one in our house ... ”
8933	8945	8947	8947	Ron	99	“ I ’m glad we came to get you , anyway , ”
8949	8975	8947	8947	Ron	99	“ I was getting really worried when you did n’t answer any of my letters . I thought it was Errol ’s fault at first — ”
8976	8981	8947	8947	Ron	99	“ Who ’s Errol ? ”
8982	9012	8947	8947	Ron	99	“ Our owl . He ’s ancient . It would n’t be the first time he ’d collapsed on a delivery . So then I tried to borrow Hermes — ”
9013	9016	8947	8947	Ron	99	“ Who ? ”
9017	9031	9033	9033	Fred	110	“ The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect , ”
9038	9048	9050	9050	Ron	99	“ But Percy would n’t lend him to me , ”
9052	9058	9050	9050	Ron	99	“ Said he needed him . ”
9059	9069	9071	9071	George	111	“ Percy ’s been acting very oddly this summer , ”
9075	9122	9123	9123	he	99	“ And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room ... I mean , there ’s only so many times you can polish a prefect badge ... You ’re driving too far west , Fred , ”
9140	9153	9155	9155	Harry	84	“ So , does your dad know you ’ve got the car ? ”
9161	9166	9168	9168	Ron	99	“ Er , no , ”
9170	9196	9168	9168	Ron	99	“ he had to work tonight . Hopefully we ’ll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it . ”
9197	9211	9134	9134	Fred	110	“ What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic , anyway ? ”
9212	9221	9223	9223	Ron	99	“ He works in the most boring department , ”
9225	9233	9223	9223	Ron	99	“ The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office . ”
9234	9238	9134	9134	Fred	110	“ The what ? ”
9239	9322	9223	9223	Ron	99	“ It ’s all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle - made , you know , in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house . Like , last year , some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop . This Muggle woman bought it , took it home , and tried to serve her friends tea in it . It was a nightmare — Dad was working overtime for weeks . ”
9323	9327	9134	9134	Fred	110	“ What happened ? ”
9328	9394	9223	9223	Ron	99	“ The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose . Dad was going frantic — it ’s only him and an old warlock called Perkins in the office — and they had to do Memory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up — ”
9395	9403	9134	9134	Fred	110	“ But your dad — this car — ”
9407	9464	9404	9404	Fred	110	“ Yeah , Dad ’s crazy about everything to do with Muggles ; our shed ’s full of Muggle stuff . He takes it apart , puts spells on it , and puts it back together again . If he raided our house he ’d have to put himself under arrest . It drives Mum mad . ”
9465	9472	9474	9474	George	111	“ That ’s the main road , ”
9482	9500	9474	9474	George	111	“ We ’ll be there in ten minutes ... Just as well , it ’s getting light ... ”
9533	9543	9545	9545	George	111	“ We ’re a little way outside the village , ”
9547	9552	9545	9545	George	111	“ Ottery St. Catchpole . ”
9575	9578	9580	9580	Fred	110	“ Touchdown ! ”
9728	9734	9736	9736	Ron	99	“ It ’s not much , ”
9738	9743	9745	9745	Harry	84	“ It ’s wonderful , ”
9760	9770	9772	9772	Fred	110	“ Now , we ’ll go upstairs really quietly , ”
9774	9827	9772	9772	Fred	110	“ and wait for Mum to call us for breakfast . Then , Ron , you come bounding downstairs going , ‘ Mum , look who turned up in the night ! ’ and she ’ll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car . ”
9828	9831	9833	9833	Ron	99	“ Right , ”
9835	9850	9833	9833	Ron	99	“ Come on , Harry , I sleep at the — at the top — ”
9909	9912	9914	9914	Fred	110	“ Ah , ”
9916	9921	9923	9923	George	111	“ Oh , dear , ”
9966	9969	9970	9970	she	122	“ So , ”
9973	9978	9980	9980	George	111	“ Morning , Mum , ”
9994	10005	10007	10008	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Have you any idea how worried I ’ve been ? ”
10014	10026	10007	10008	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Sorry , Mum , but see , we had to — ”
10050	10106	10131	10132	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Beds empty ! No note ! Car gone — could have crashed — out of my mind with worry — did you care ? — never , as long as I ’ve lived — you wait until your father gets home , we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy — ”
10107	10111	10113	10113	Fred	110	“ Perfect Percy , ”
10115	10129	10131	10132	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY ’S BOOK ! ”
10142	10163	10131	10132	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ You could have died , you could have been seen , you could have lost your father his job — ”
10188	10201	10202	10202	she	122	“ I ’m very pleased to see you , Harry , dear , ”
10205	10213	10202	10202	she	122	“ Come in and have some breakfast . ”
10377	10390	10422	10422	she	122	“ Witching Hour , with the popular singing sorceress , Celestina Warbeck . ”
10426	10436	10422	10422	she	122	“ do n’t know what you were thinking of , ”
10438	10445	10422	10422	she	122	“ never would have believed it . ”
10446	10455	10456	10456	she	122	“ I do n’t blame you , dear , ”
10469	10507	10509	10509	she	122	“ Arthur and I have been worried about you , too . Just last night we were saying we ’d come and get you ourselves if you had n’t written back to Ron by Friday . But really ”
10521	10537	10509	10509	she	122	“ flying an illegal car halfway across the country — anyone could have seen you — ”
10562	10569	10571	10571	Fred	110	“ It was cloudy , Mum ! ”
10573	10584	10585	10586	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ You keep your mouth closed while you ’re eating ! ”
10589	10597	10599	10599	George	111	“ They were starving him , Mum ! ”
10601	10605	10607	10608	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ And you ! ”
10667	10670	10672	10672	Ron	99	“ Ginny , ”
10679	10692	10672	10672	Ron	99	“ My sister . She ’s been talking about you all summer . ”
10693	10705	10706	10706	Fred	110	“ Yeah , she ’ll be wanting your autograph , Harry , ”
10748	10755	10757	10757	Fred	110	“ Blimey , I ’m tired , ”
10768	10778	10757	10757	Fred	110	“ I think I ’ll go to bed and — ”
10779	10784	10786	10787	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ You will not , ”
10789	10823	10786	10787	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ It ’s your own fault you ’ve been up all night . You ’re going to de - gnome the garden for me ; they ’re getting completely out of hand again — ”
10824	10829	10757	10757	Fred	110	“ Oh , Mum — ”
10830	10835	10836	10836	she	122	“ And you two , ”
10845	10855	10856	10856	she	122	“ You can go up to bed , dear , ”
10861	10873	10856	10856	she	122	“ You did n’t ask them to fly that wretched car — ”
10885	10900	10875	10875	Harry	84	“ I ’ll help Ron . I ’ve never seen a de - gnoming — ”
10901	10917	10919	10920	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ That ’s very sweet of you , dear , but it ’s dull work , ”
10922	10938	10919	10920	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Now , let ’s see what Lockhart ’s got to say on the subject — ”
10955	10968	10952	10952	George	111	“ Mum , we know how to de - gnome a garden — ”
11059	11066	11067	11067	she	122	“ Oh , he is marvelous , ”
11070	11086	11067	11067	she	122	“ He knows his household pests , all right , it ’s a wonderful book ... ”
11087	11092	11094	11094	Fred	110	“ Mum fancies him , ”
11102	11111	11113	11114	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Do n’t be so ridiculous , Fred , ”
11121	11164	11116	11116	her	122	“ All right , if you think you know better than Lockhart , you can go and get on with it , and woe betide you if there ’s a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it . ”
11246	11257	11258	11258	Harry	84	“ Muggles have garden gnomes , too , you know , ”
11267	11280	11282	11282	Ron	99	“ Yeah , I ’ve seen those things they think are gnomes , ”
11294	11304	11282	11282	Ron	99	“ like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods ... ”
11322	11328	11329	11329	he	99	“ This is a gnome , ”
11333	11340	11342	11343	the gnome	518	“ Gerroff me ! Gerroff me ! ”
11404	11413	11414	11414	he	99	“ This is what you have to do , ”
11425	11429	11417	11417	He	99	“ Gerroff me ! ”
11455	11483	11452	11452	Ron	99	“ It does n’t hurt them — you ’ve just got to make them really dizzy so they ca n’t find their way back to the gnomeholes . ”
11512	11515	11517	11517	Fred	110	“ Pitiful , ”
11519	11530	11517	11517	Fred	110	“ I bet I can get mine beyond that stump . ”
11586	11598	11575	11575	he	84	“ Wow , Harry — that must ’ve been fifty feet ... ”
11608	11617	11619	11619	George	111	“ See , they ’re not too bright , ”
11629	11663	11619	11619	George	111	“ The moment they know the de - gnoming ’s going on they storm up to have a look . You ’d think they ’d have learned by now just to stay put . ”
11686	11692	11694	11694	Ron	99	“ They ’ll be back , ”
11712	11731	11694	11694	Ron	99	“ They love it here ... Dad ’s too soft with them ; he thinks they ’re funny ... ”
11740	11745	11747	11747	George	111	“ He ’s back ! ”
11749	11754	11747	11747	George	111	“ Dad ’s home ! ”
11823	11828	11829	11829	he	133	“ What a night , ”
11844	11868	11829	11829	he	133	“ Nine raids . Nine ! And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned ... ”
11880	11886	11888	11888	Fred	110	“ Find anything , Dad ? ”
11891	11906	11908	11909	Mr. Weasley	133	“ All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle , ”
11911	11950	11908	11909	Mr. Weasley	133	“ There was some pretty nasty stuff that was n’t my department , though . Mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets , but that ’s the Committee on Experimental Charms , thank goodness ... ”
11951	11961	11963	11963	George	111	“ Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink ? ”
11965	11971	11973	11974	Mr. Weasley	133	“ Just Muggle - baiting , ”
11976	12064	11973	11974	Mr. Weasley	133	“ Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it ... Of course , it ’s very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking — they ’ll insist they just keep losing it . Bless them , they ’ll go to any lengths to ignore magic , even if it ’s staring them in the face ... But the things our lot have taken to enchanting , you would n’t believe — ”
12065	12072	12073	12074	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ LIKE CARS , FOR INSTANCE ? ”
12100	12109	12073	12074	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ C - cars , Molly , dear ? ”
12110	12117	12119	12120	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Yes , Arthur , cars , ”
12126	12167	12122	12122	her	122	“ Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked , while really he was enchanting it to make it fly . ”
12172	12249	12073	12074	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Well , dear , I think you ’ll find that he would be quite within the law to do that , even if — er — he maybe would have done better to , um , tell his wife the truth ... There ’s a loophole in the law , you ’ll find ... As long as he was n’t intending to fly the car , the fact that the car could fly would n’t — ”
12250	12267	12269	12270	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Arthur Weasley , you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law ! ”
12272	12308	12269	12270	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed ! And for your information , Harry arrived this morning in the car you were n’t intending to fly ! ”
12309	12312	12314	12315	Mr. Weasley	133	“ Harry ? ”
12318	12322	12314	12315	Mr. Weasley	133	“ Harry who ? ”
12333	12356	12269	12270	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Good lord , is it Harry Potter ? Very pleased to meet you , Ron ’s told us so much about — ”
12357	12372	12374	12375	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Your sons flew that car to Harry ’s house and back last night ! ”
12377	12389	12374	12375	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ What have you got to say about that , eh ? ”
12390	12395	12397	12398	Mr. Weasley	133	“ Did you really ? ”
12401	12413	12414	12414	he	133	“ Did it go all right ? I — I mean , ”
12425	12439	12420	12421	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ that — that was very wrong , boys — very wrong indeed ... ”
12440	12448	12449	12449	Ron	99	“ Let ’s leave them to it , ”
12461	12472	12454	12455	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Come on , I ’ll show you my bedroom . ”
12531	12534	12536	12536	Ron	99	“ Ginny , ”
12538	12560	12536	12536	Ron	99	“ You do n’t know how weird it is for her to be this shy . She never shuts up normally — ”
12671	12676	12678	12678	Harry	84	“ Your Quidditch team ? ”
12680	12685	12687	12687	Ron	99	“ The Chudley Cannons , ”
12709	12715	12687	12687	Ron	99	“ Ninth in the league . ”
12853	12860	12862	12862	Ron	99	“ It ’s a bit small , ”
12865	12897	12862	12862	Ron	99	“ Not like that room you had with the Muggles . And I ’m right underneath the ghoul in the attic ; he ’s always banging on the pipes and groaning ... ”
12906	12918	12899	12899	Harry	84	“ This is the best house I ’ve ever been in . ”
12977	12984	12995	12995	he	84	shouted,“Tuck your shirt in , scruffy ! ”
13114	13117	13118	13118	he	133	“ Fascinating ! ”
13130	13147	13118	13118	he	133	“ Ingenious , really , how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic . ”
13261	13266	13268	13269	Mr. Weasley	133	“ Letters from school , ”
13286	13312	13313	13313	he	133	“ Dumbledore already knows you ’re here , Harry — does n’t miss a trick , that man . You two’ve got them , too , ”
13464	13478	13479	13479	he	552	“ You ’ve been told to get all Lockhart ’s books , too ! ”
13482	13502	13479	13479	he	552	“ The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan — bet it ’s a witch . ”
13521	13529	13531	13531	George	111	“ That lot wo n’t come cheap , ”
13541	13549	13531	13531	George	111	“ Lockhart ’s books are really expensive ... ”
13550	13557	13563	13563	she	122	“ Well , we ’ll manage , ”
13567	13585	13563	13563	she	122	“ I expect we ’ll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny ’s things secondhand . ”
13586	13597	13598	13598	Harry	84	“ Oh , are you starting at Hogwarts this year ? ”
13657	13662	13664	13664	Percy	120	“ Morning , all , ”
13667	13671	13664	13664	Percy	120	“ Lovely day . ”
13717	13720	13722	13722	Ron	99	“ Errol ! ”
13739	13766	13722	13722	Ron	99	“ Finally — he ’s got Hermione ’s answer . I wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys . ”
13804	13807	13793	13793	Ron	99	“ Pathetic . ”
13821	13832	13809	13809	he	99	“ ‘ Dear Ron , and Harry if you ’re there ,
13833	13915	13809	13809	he	99	“ ‘ I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you did n’t do anything illegal to get him out , Ron , because that would get Harry into trouble , too . I ’ve been really worried and if Harry is all right , will you please let me know at once , but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl , because I think another delivery might finish your one off .
13916	13934	13936	13936	Ron	99	“ ‘ I ’m very busy with schoolwork , of course ’ — How can she be ? ”
13940	13970	13936	13936	Ron	99	“ We ’re on vacation ! — ‘ and we ’re going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books . Why do n’t we meet in Diagon Alley ?
13971	13990	13809	13809	he	99	“ ‘ Let me know what ’s happening as soon as you can . Love from Hermione . ’ ”
13991	14011	14013	14014	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Well , that fits in nicely , we can go and get all your things then , too , ”
14022	14031	14013	14014	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ What ’re you all up to today ? ”
14209	14219	14221	14221	Fred	110	“ Wish I knew what he was up to , ”
14225	14250	14221	14221	Fred	110	“ He ’s not himself . His exam results came the day before you did ; twelve O.W.L.s and he hardly gloated at all . ”
14251	14256	14257	14257	George	111	“ Ordinary Wizarding Levels , ”
14266	14299	14257	14257	George	111	“ Bill got twelve , too . If we ’re not careful , we ’ll have another Head Boy in the family . I do n’t think I could stand the shame . ”
14350	14367	14369	14369	George	111	“ Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year , ”
14374	14391	14369	14369	George	111	“ Five sets of Lockhart books ! And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything ... ”
14522	14530	14531	14531	she	122	“ We ’re running low , Arthur , ”
14534	14556	14531	14531	she	122	“ We ’ll have to buy some more today ... Ah well , guests first ! After you , Harry dear ! ”
14572	14582	14583	14583	he	84	“ W - what am I supposed to do ? ”
14586	14595	14597	14597	Ron	99	“ He ’s never traveled by Floo powder , ”
14600	14608	14597	14597	Ron	99	“ Sorry , Harry , I forgot . ”
14609	14612	14614	14615	Mr. Weasley	133	“ Never ? ”
14617	14634	14614	14615	Mr. Weasley	133	“ But how did you get to Diagon Alley to buy your school things last year ? ”
14635	14642	14597	14597	Ron	99	“ I went on the Underground — ”
14643	14646	14648	14649	Mr. Weasley	133	“ Really ? ”
14652	14660	14648	14649	Mr. Weasley	133	“ Were there escapators ? How exactly — ”
14661	14667	14669	14670	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Not now , Arthur , ”
14672	14694	14669	14670	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Floo powder ’s a lot quicker , dear , but goodness me , if you ’ve never used it before — ”
14695	14704	14706	14706	Fred	110	“ He ’ll be all right , Mum , ”
14708	14715	14706	14706	Fred	110	“ Harry , watch us first . ”
14765	14769	14755	14755	Fred	110	“ Diagon Alley ! ”
14773	14781	14782	14783	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ You must speak clearly , dear , ”
14795	14807	14787	14787	George	111	“ And be sure to get out at the right grate ... ”
14808	14813	14815	14815	Harry	84	“ The right what ? ”
14830	14857	14787	14787	George	111	“ Well , there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from , you know , but as long as you ’ve spoken clearly — ”
14858	14870	14872	14873	Mr. Weasley	133	“ He ’ll be fine , Molly , do n’t fuss , ”
14883	14904	14787	14787	George	111	“ But , dear , if he got lost , how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle ? ”
14905	14911	14912	14912	Harry	84	“ They would n’t mind , ”
14916	14939	14912	14912	Harry	84	“ Dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney , do n’t worry about that — ”
14940	14951	14953	14954	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Well ... all right ... you go after Arthur , ”
14956	14972	14953	14954	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Now , when you get into the fire , say where you ’re going — ”
14973	14981	14982	14982	Ron	99	“ And keep your elbows tucked in , ”
14985	14991	14993	14994	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ And your eyes shut , ”
14996	15000	14993	14994	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ The soot — ”
15001	15006	15008	15008	Ron	99	“ Do n’t fidget , ”
15010	15022	15008	15008	Ron	99	“ Or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace — ”
15023	15042	14993	14994	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ But do n’t panic and get out too early ; wait until you see Fred and George . ”
15106	15114	15115	15115	he	84	“ D - Dia - gon Alley , ”
15591	15597	15586	15586	his	114	“ Touch nothing , Draco . ”
15610	15622	15598	15598	Malfoy	101	“ I thought you were going to buy me a present . ”
15623	15634	15640	15640	his	592	“ I said I would buy you a racing broom , ”
15646	15662	15664	15664	Malfoy	101	“ What ’s the good of that if I ’m not on the House team ? ”
15673	15720	15664	15664	Malfoy	101	“ Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year . Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play for Gryffindor . He ’s not even that good , it ’s just because he ’s famous ... famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead ... ”
15732	15752	15664	15664	Malfoy	101	“ . . . everyone thinks he ’s so smart , wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick — ”
15753	15766	15768	15769	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ You have told me this at least a dozen times already , ”
15779	15824	15768	15769	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ And I would remind you that it is not — prudent — to appear less than fond of Harry Potter , not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear — ah , Mr. Borgin . ”
15843	15855	15857	15858	Mr. Borgin	149	“ Mr. Malfoy , what a pleasure to see you again , ”
15868	15901	15857	15858	Mr. Borgin	149	“ Delighted — and young Master Malfoy , too — charmed . How may I be of assistance ? I must show you , just in today , and very reasonably priced — ”
15902	15915	15917	15918	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ I ’m not buying today , Mr. Borgin , but selling , ”
15920	15923	15857	15858	Mr. Borgin	149	“ Selling ? ”
15934	15950	15952	15953	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ You have heard , of course , that the Ministry is conducting more raids , ”
15973	15996	15968	15969	Mr. Borgin	149	“ I have a few — ah — items at home that might embarrass me , if the Ministry were to call ... ”
16015	16029	15997	15998	Mr. Borgin	149	“ The Ministry would n’t presume to trouble you , sir , surely ? ”
16036	16088	15997	15998	Mr. Borgin	149	“ I have not been visited yet . The name Malfoy still commands a certain respect , yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome . There are rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act — no doubt that flea - bitten , Muggle - loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it — ”
16097	16113	15997	15998	Mr. Borgin	149	“ — and as you see , certain of these poisons might make it appear — ”
16114	16123	16125	16126	Mr. Borgin	149	“ I understand , sir , of course , ”
16128	16133	16125	16126	Mr. Borgin	149	“ Let me see ... ”
16134	16140	16142	16142	Draco	101	“ Can I have that ? ”
16153	16161	16163	16164	Mr. Borgin	149	“ Ah , the Hand of Glory ! ”
16177	16205	16175	16175	Draco	101	“ Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder ! Best friend of thieves and plunderers ! Your son has fine taste , sir . ”
16206	16224	16226	16227	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer , Borgin , ”
16236	16246	16231	16232	Mr. Borgin	149	“ No offense , sir , no offense meant — ”
16247	16257	16259	16260	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ Though if his grades do n’t pick up , ”
16266	16277	16259	16260	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ that may indeed be all he is fit for — ”
16278	16285	16287	16287	Draco	101	“ It ’s not my fault , ”
16289	16300	16287	16287	Draco	101	“ The teachers all have favorites , that Hermione Granger — ”
16301	16323	16325	16326	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ I would have thought you ’d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam , ”
16328	16331	16333	16333	Harry	84	“ Ha ! ”
16348	16356	16358	16359	Mr. Borgin	149	“ It ’s the same all over , ”
16366	16375	16362	16362	his	149	“ Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere — ”
16376	16381	16383	16384	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ Not with me , ”
16391	16402	16404	16405	Mr. Borgin	149	“ No , sir , nor with me , sir , ”
16412	16425	16427	16428	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ In that case , perhaps we can return to my list , ”
16431	16449	16427	16428	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ I am in something of a hurry , Borgin , I have important business elsewhere today — ”
16547	16550	16552	16553	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ Done , ”
16558	16563	16552	16553	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ Come , Draco — ”
16576	16599	16572	16572	Draco	101	“ Good day to you , Mr. Borgin . I ’ll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods . ”
16614	16643	16610	16610	his	149	“ Good day yourself , Mister Malfoy , and if the stories are true , you have n’t sold me half of what ’s hidden in your manor ... ”
16883	16892	16904	16906	An aged witch	608	“ Not lost are you , my dear ? ”
16938	16945	16946	16946	he	84	“ I ’m fine , thanks , ”
16949	16954	16946	16946	he	84	“ I ’m just — ”
16955	16966	16974	16975	the witch	609	“ HARRY ! What d’yeh think yer doin’ down there ? ”
17016	17019	17020	17020	Harry	84	“ Hagrid ! ”
17025	17033	17020	17020	Harry	84	“ I was lost — Floo powder — ”
17102	17107	17109	17109	Hagrid	91	“ Yer a mess ! ”
17132	17158	17118	17118	he	91	“ Skulkin ’ around Knockturn Alley , I dunno — dodgy place , Harry — don ’ want no one ter see yeh down there — ”
17159	17164	17166	17166	Harry	84	“ I realized that , ”
17178	17196	17170	17170	Hagrid	91	“ I told you , I was lost — what were you doing down there , anyway ? ”
17197	17211	17213	17213	Hagrid	91	“ I was lookin ’ fer a Flesh - Eatin ’ Slug Repellent , ”
17215	17230	17213	17213	Hagrid	91	“ They ’re ruinin ’ the school cabbages . Yer not on yer own ? ”
17231	17243	17244	17244	Harry	84	“ I ’m staying with the Weasleys but we got separated , ”
17247	17257	17244	17244	Harry	84	“ I ’ve got to go and find them ... ”
17266	17276	17278	17278	Hagrid	91	“ How come yeh never wrote back ter me ? ”
17310	17314	17316	17316	Hagrid	91	“ Lousy Muggles , ”
17318	17325	17316	17316	Hagrid	91	“ If I ’d ’ve known — ”
17326	17334	17301	17301	Harry	84	“ Harry ! Harry ! Over here ! ”
17370	17400	17355	17355	She	100	“ What happened to your glasses ? Hello , Hagrid — Oh , it ’s wonderful to see you two again — Are you coming into Gringotts , Harry ? ”
17401	17411	17413	17413	Harry	84	“ As soon as I ’ve found the Weasleys , ”
17415	17424	17425	17425	Hagrid	91	“ Yeh wo n’t have long ter wait , ”
17455	17458	17459	17460	Mr. Weasley	133	“ Harry , ”
17463	17475	17476	17476	He	133	“ We hoped you ’d only gone one grate too far ... ”
17483	17493	17476	17476	He	133	“ Molly ’s frantic — she ’s coming now — ”
17494	17501	17502	17502	Ron	99	“ Where did you come out ? ”
17505	17509	17511	17511	Hagrid	91	“ Knockturn Alley , ”
17514	17517	17519	17519	Fred	110	“ Excellent ! ”
17524	17532	17534	17534	Ron	99	“ We ’ve never been allowed in , ”
17537	17545	17547	17547	Hagrid	91	“ I should ruddy well think not , ”
17572	17588	17593	17593	she	122	“ Oh , Harry — oh , my dear — you could have been anywhere — ”
17640	17648	17650	17650	Hagrid	91	“ Well , got ta be off , ”
17662	17675	17659	17660	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Knockturn Alley ! If you had n’t found him , Hagrid ! ”

17732	17739	17741	17742	Mr. Weasley	133	“ Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything ? ”
17747	17754	17713	17713	Harry	84	“ No , he was selling — ”
17755	17761	17763	17764	Mr. Weasley	133	“ So he ’s worried , ”
17769	17782	17763	17764	Mr. Weasley	133	“ Oh , I ’d love to get Lucius Malfoy for something ... ”
17783	17790	17792	17793	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ You be careful , Arthur , ”
17809	17826	17803	17807	a goblin at the door	625	“ That family ’s trouble . Do n’t go biting off more than you can chew — ”
17827	17841	17843	17844	Mr. Weasley	133	“ So you do n’t think I ’m a match for Lucius Malfoy ? ”
17885	17891	17893	17894	Mr. Weasley	133	“ But you ’re Muggles ! ”
17897	17924	17925	17925	He	133	“ We must have a drink ! What ’s that you ’ve got there ? Oh , you ’re changing Muggle money . Molly , look ! ”

18958	18970	18953	18953	his	206	“ Together , you and I are worth the front page . ”

19122	19196	19102	19102	Lockhart	206	“ that he would shortly be getting much , much more than my book , Magical Me . He and his schoolmates will , in fact , be getting the real magical me . Yes , ladies and gentlemen , I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September , I will be taking up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry ! ”
19249	19254	19255	19255	Harry	84	“ You have these , ”
19267	19274	19255	19255	Harry	84	“ I ’ll buy my own — ”
19275	19287	19291	19291	Harry	84	“ Bet you loved that , did n’t you , Potter ? ”
19319	19324	19326	19326	Malfoy	101	“ Famous Harry Potter , ”
19328	19342	19326	19326	Malfoy	101	“ Ca n’t even go into a bookshop without making the front page . ”
19343	19355	19357	19357	Ginny	128	“ Leave him alone , he did n’t want all that ! ”
19378	19388	19390	19390	Malfoy	101	“ Potter , you ’ve got yourself a girlfriend ! ”

19452	19468	19470	19470	Malfoy	101	“ Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop , Weasley , ”
19472	19489	19470	19470	Malfoy	101	“ I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those . ”
19523	19526	19528	19529	Mr. Weasley	133	“ Ron ! ”
19538	19556	19536	19536	George	111	“ What are you doing ? It ’s too crowded in here , let ’s go outside . ”

19601	19611	19613	19614	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ Busy time at the Ministry , I hear , ”
19616	19629	19613	19614	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ All those raids ... I hope they ’re paying you overtime ? ”
19661	19665	19666	19667	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ Obviously not , ”
19670	19698	19666	19667	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ Dear me , what ’s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they do n’t even pay you well for it ? ”
19709	19726	19727	19727	he	114	“ We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard , Malfoy , ”
19730	19733	19735	19736	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ Clearly , ”
19753	19771	19745	19746	Mrs. Granger	155	“ The company you keep , Weasley ... and I thought your family could sink no lower — ”
19819	19825	19864	19865	the assistant	670	“ Get him , Dad ! ”

19992	20001	20003	20003	Hagrid	91	“ Yeh should ’ve ignored him , Arthur , ”
20018	20059	20013	20013	he	91	“ Rotten ter the core , the whole family , everyone knows that — no Malfoy ’s worth listenin ’ ter — bad blood , that ’s what it is — come on now — let ’s get outta here . ”
20108	20129	20104	20104	herself	122	“ A fine example to set for your children ... brawling in public ... what Gilderoy Lockhart must ’ve thought — ”

20139	20178	20137	20137	Fred	110	“ Did n’t you hear him as we were leaving ? He was asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he ’d be able to work the fight into his report — said it was all publicity — ”
20574	20581	20582	20582	he	133	“ Not a word to Molly , ”
20647	20663	20664	20664	She	122	“ Muggles do know more than we give them credit for , do n’t they ? ”
20685	20704	20666	20666	Ginny	128	“ I mean , you ’d never know it was this roomy from the outside , would you ? ”
20830	20835	20822	20822	his	133	“ Molly , dear — ”
20836	20841	20822	20822	his	133	“ No , Arthur — ”
20842	20891	20822	20822	his	133	“ No one would see — this little button here is an Invisibility Booster I installed — that ’d get us up in the air — then we fly above the clouds . We ’d be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser — ”
20892	20904	20822	20822	his	133	“ I said no , Arthur , not in broad daylight — ”
21007	21011	21013	21014	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ Percy first , ”
21054	21067	21068	21069	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ I ’ll take Ginny and you two come right after us , ”
21093	21106	21107	21107	Ron	99	“ Let ’s go together , we ’ve only got a minute , ”
21245	21255	21240	21242	a guard nearby	705	“ What in blazes d’you think you ’re doing ? ”
21256	21263	21264	21264	Harry	84	“ Lost control of the trolley , ”
21304	21312	21313	21313	Harry	84	“ Why ca n’t we get through ? ”
21318	21322	21313	21313	Harry	84	“ I dunno — ”
21337	21346	21347	21347	Ron	99	“ We ’re going to miss the train , ”
21350	21362	21347	21347	Ron	99	“ I do n’t understand why the gateway ’s sealed itself — ”
21421	21426	21428	21428	Ron	99	“ It ’s gone , ”
21433	21459	21428	21428	Ron	99	“ The train ’s left . What if Mum and Dad ca n’t get back through to us ? Have you got any Muggle money ? ”
21466	21480	21460	21460	Harry	84	“ The Dursleys have n’t given me pocket money for about six years . ”
21490	21497	21498	21498	he	99	“ Ca n’t hear a thing , ”
21502	21528	21498	21498	he	99	“ What ’re we going to do ? I do n’t know how long it ’ll take Mum and Dad to get back to us . ”
21547	21560	21562	21562	Harry	84	“ I think we ’d better go and wait by the car , ”
21564	21572	21562	21562	Harry	84	“ We ’re attracting too much atten — ”
21573	21576	21578	21578	Ron	99	“ Harry ! ”
21584	21588	21578	21578	Ron	99	“ The car ! ”
21589	21594	21562	21562	Harry	84	“ What about it ? ”
21595	21604	21578	21578	Ron	99	“ We can fly the car to Hogwarts ! ”
21605	21610	21562	21562	Harry	84	“ But I thought — ”
21611	21657	21578	21578	Ron	99	“ We ’re stuck , right ? And we ’ve got to get to school , have n’t we ? And even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it ’s a real emergency , section nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy — ”
21658	21665	21667	21667	Harry	84	“ But your mum and dad ... ”
21684	21691	21667	21667	Harry	84	“ How will they get home ? ”
21692	21700	21702	21702	Ron	99	“ They do n’t need the car ! ”
21705	21745	21702	21702	Ron	99	“ They know how to Apparate ! You know , just vanish and reappear at home ! They only bother with Floo powder and the car because we ’re all underage and we ’re not allowed to Apparate yet ... ”
21756	21762	21667	21667	Harry	84	“ Can you fly it ? ”
21763	21767	21769	21769	Ron	99	“ No problem , ”
21780	21801	21769	21769	Ron	99	“ C’m on , let ’s go . If we hurry we ’ll be able to follow the Hogwarts Express — ”
21865	21873	21875	21875	Ron	99	“ Check that no one ’s watching , ”
21911	21914	21915	21915	he	84	“ Okay , ”
21996	22001	22003	22003	Ron	99	“ Let ’s go , ”
22064	22069	22071	22071	Ron	99	“ Uh - oh , ”
22079	22084	22071	22071	Ron	99	“ It ’s faulty — ”
22101	22105	22106	22106	Ron	99	“ Hold on ! ”
22134	22138	22140	22140	Harry	84	“ Now what ? ”
22157	22172	22174	22174	Ron	99	“ We need to see the train to know what direction to go in , ”
22176	22184	22174	22174	Ron	99	“ Dip back down again — quickly — ”
22203	22209	22210	22210	Harry	84	“ I can see it ! ”
22213	22219	22210	22210	Harry	84	“ Right ahead — there ! ”
22233	22237	22239	22239	Ron	99	“ Due north , ”
22248	22268	22239	22239	Ron	99	“ Okay , we ’ll just have to check on it every half hour or so — hold on — ”
22321	22333	22335	22335	Ron	99	“ All we ’ve got to worry about now are airplanes , ”
22629	22639	22641	22641	Ron	99	“ Ca n’t be much further , can it ? ”
22665	22674	22641	22641	Ron	99	“ Ready for another check on the train ? ”
22732	22739	22741	22741	Ron	99	“ It ’s probably just tired , ”
22743	22752	22741	22741	Ron	99	“ It ’s never been this far before ... ”
22805	22809	22811	22811	Ron	99	“ Not far , ”
22821	22826	22828	22828	he	99	“ not far now , ”
22859	22862	22863	22863	Harry	84	“ There ! ”
22872	22876	22863	22863	Harry	84	“ Straight ahead ! ”
22913	22917	22918	22918	Ron	99	“ Come on , ”
22930	22937	22918	22918	Ron	99	“ nearly there , come on — ”
23016	23020	23021	23021	Ron	99	“ Come on , ”
23057	23062	23064	23064	Ron	99	“ Uh - oh , ”
23092	23095	23096	23096	Ron	99	“ Noooooo ! ”
23165	23170	23171	23171	he	99	“ STOP ! STOP ! ”
23194	23201	23202	23202	Harry	84	“ WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE ! ”
23291	23296	23297	23297	Harry	84	“ Are you okay ? ”
23301	23305	23307	23307	Ron	99	“ My wand , ”
23314	23320	23307	23307	Ron	99	“ Look at my wand — ”
23407	23413	23414	23414	Ron	99	“ What ’s happen — ? ”
23473	23476	23478	23478	Ron	99	“ Aaargh ! ”
23528	23533	23534	23534	Ron	99	“ Run for it ! ”
23565	23571	23572	23572	he	99	“ We ’re done for ! ”
23594	23597	23598	23598	Harry	84	“ Reverse ! ”
23640	23643	23645	23645	Ron	99	“ That , ”
23647	23656	23645	23645	Ron	99	“ was close . Well done , car — ”
23768	23772	23773	23773	Ron	99	“ Come back ! ”
23783	23788	23773	23773	Ron	99	“ Dad’ll kill me ! ”
23803	23810	23812	23812	Ron	99	“ Can you believe our luck ? ”
23822	23841	23812	23812	Ron	99	“ Of all the trees we could ’ve hit , we had to get one that hits back . ”
23860	23864	23866	23866	Harry	84	“ Come on , ”
23869	23879	23866	23866	Harry	84	“ we ’d better get up to the school ... ”
23922	23931	23933	23933	Ron	99	“ I think the feast ’s already started , ”
23956	23970	23933	23933	Ron	99	“ Hey — Harry — come and look — it ’s the Sorting ! ”
24327	24331	24332	24332	Harry	84	“ Hang on ... ”
24337	24352	24335	24335	Ron	99	“ There ’s an empty chair at the staff table ... Where ’s Snape ? ”
24397	24403	24405	24405	Ron	99	“ Maybe he ’s ill ! ”
24408	24414	24416	24416	Harry	84	“ Maybe he ’s left , ”
24418	24433	24416	24416	Harry	84	“ because he missed out on the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again ! ”
24434	24442	24444	24444	Ron	99	“ Or he might have been sacked ! ”
24447	24455	24444	24444	Ron	99	“ I mean , everyone hates him — ”
24456	24460	24416	24416	Harry	84	“ Or maybe , ”
24470	24487	24416	24416	Harry	84	“ he ’s waiting to hear why you two did n’t arrive on the school train . ”
24552	24556	24558	24558	Snape	90	“ Follow me , ”
24626	24629	24630	24630	he	90	“ In ! ”
24704	24707	24708	24708	he	90	“ So , ”
24712	24742	24708	24708	he	90	“ the train is n’t good enough for the famous Harry Potter and his faithful sidekick Weasley . Wanted to arrive with a bang , did we , boys ? ”
24743	24759	24693	24693	Snape	90	“ No , sir , it was the barrier at King ’s Cross , it — ”
24760	24763	24765	24765	Snape	90	“ Silence ! ”
24768	24777	24765	24765	Snape	90	“ What have you done with the car ? ”
24819	24824	24825	24825	he	90	“ You were seen , ”
24845	24910	24911	24911	he	90	“ Two Muggles in London , convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower ... at noon in Norfolk , Mrs. Hetty Bayliss , while hanging out her washing ... Mr. Angus Fleet , of Peebles , reported to police ... Six or seven Muggles in all . I believe your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office ? ”
24924	24933	24911	24911	he	90	“ Dear , dear ... his own son ... ”
24974	25000	25001	25001	Snape	90	“ I noticed , in my search of the park , that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow , ”
25005	25016	25017	25017	Ron	99	“ That tree did more damage to us than we — ”
25021	25024	25026	25026	Snape	90	“ Silence ! ”
25029	25070	25026	25026	Snape	90	“ Most unfortunately , you are not in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with me . I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power . You will wait here . ”
25235	25238	25239	25239	she	158	“ Sit , ”
25252	25255	25256	25256	she	158	“ Explain , ”
25283	25301	25264	25264	Ron	99	“ — so we had no choice , Professor , we could n’t get on the train . ”
25302	25321	25322	25323	Professor McGonagall	158	“ Why did n’t you send us a letter by owl ? I believe you have an owl ? ”
25348	25356	25335	25335	she	158	“ I — I did n’t think — ”
25357	25360	25362	25363	Professor McGonagall	158	“ That , ”
25365	25369	25362	25363	Professor McGonagall	158	“ is obvious . ”
25450	25458	25447	25447	Dumbledore	106	“ Please explain why you did this . ”
25566	25575	25577	25577	Ron	99	“ We ’ll go and get our stuff , ”
25585	25594	25596	25597	Professor McGonagall	158	“ What are you talking about , Weasley ? ”
25599	25611	25613	25613	Ron	99	“ Well , you ’re expelling us , are n’t you ? ”
25621	25628	25630	25630	Dumbledore	106	“ Not today , Mr. Weasley , ”
25632	25683	25630	25630	Dumbledore	106	“ But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done . I will be writing to both your families tonight . I must also warn you that if you do anything like this again , I will have no choice but to expel you . ”
25700	25733	25693	25693	He	90	“ Professor Dumbledore , these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry , caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree — surely acts of this nature — ”
25734	25751	25753	25753	Dumbledore	106	“ It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys ’ punishments , Severus , ”
25756	25768	25769	25769	He	90	“ They are in her House and are therefore her responsibility . ”
25775	25813	25772	25773	Professor McGonagall	158	“ I must go back to the feast , Minerva , I ’ve got to give out a few notices . Come , Severus , there ’s a delicious - looking custard tart I want to sample — ”
25854	25871	25841	25842	Professor McGonagall	158	“ You ’d better get along to the hospital wing , Weasley , you ’re bleeding . ”
25872	25876	25878	25878	Ron	99	“ Not much , ”
25891	25903	25878	25878	Ron	99	“ Professor , I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted — ”
25904	25911	25913	25914	Professor McGonagall	158	“ The Sorting Ceremony is over , ”
25916	25924	25913	25914	Professor McGonagall	158	“ Your sister is also in Gryffindor . ”
25925	25930	25932	25932	Ron	99	“ Oh , good , ”
25934	25940	25941	25942	Professor McGonagall	158	“ And speaking of Gryffindor — ”
25951	25981	25982	25982	he	84	“ Professor , when we took the car , term had n’t started , so — so Gryffindor should n’t really have points taken from it — should it ? ”
26014	26024	26025	26025	she	158	“ I will not take any points from Gryffindor , ”
26035	26044	26025	26025	she	158	“ But you will both get a detention . ”
26121	26136	26137	26137	she	158	“ You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory , ”
26140	26149	26137	26137	she	158	“ I must also return to the feast . ”
26167	26175	26176	26176	he	99	“ I thought we ’d had it , ”
26183	26188	26190	26190	Harry	84	“ So did I , ”
26197	26206	26208	26208	Ron	99	“ Can you believe our luck , though ? ”
26218	26238	26208	26208	Ron	99	“ Fred and George must ’ve flown that car five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them . ”
26247	26257	26239	26239	He	99	“ Why could n’t we get through the barrier ? ”
26261	26275	26276	26276	he	99	“ We ’ll have to watch our step from now on , though , ”
26287	26298	26276	26276	he	99	“ Wish we could ’ve gone up to the feast ... ”
26299	26308	26310	26310	Ron	99	“ She did n’t want us showing off , ”
26313	26329	26310	26310	Ron	99	“ Does n’t want people to think it ’s clever , arriving by flying car . ”
26427	26430	26431	26431	she	821	“ Password ? ”
26437	26440	26442	26442	Harry	84	“ Er — ”
26483	26510	26478	26478	Hermione	100	“ There you are ! Where have you been ? The most ridiculous rumors — someone said you ’d been expelled for crashing a flying car — ”
26511	26520	26521	26521	Harry	84	“ Well , we have n’t been expelled , ”
26525	26536	26538	26538	Hermione	100	“ You ’re not telling me you did fly here ? ”
26548	26553	26555	26555	Ron	99	“ Skip the lecture , ”
26558	26566	26555	26555	Ron	99	“ and tell us the new password . ”
26567	26574	26576	26576	Hermione	100	“ It ’s ‘ wattlebird , ’ ”
26579	26587	26576	26576	Hermione	100	“ but that ’s not the point — ”
26670	26673	26675	26676	Lee Jordan	153	“ Brilliant ! ”
26678	26703	26675	26676	Lee Jordan	153	“ Inspired ! What an entrance ! Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow , people’ll be talking about that one for years — ”
26704	26709	26720	26720	someone	388	“ Good for you , ”
26752	26765	26738	26738	George	111	“ Why could n’t we ’ve come in the car , eh ? ”
26838	26847	26848	26848	he	99	“ Got to get upstairs — bit tired , ”
26881	26885	26886	26886	Harry	84	“ ’ Night , ”
27009	27023	27003	27003	Ron	99	“ I know I should n’t ’ve enjoyed that or anything , but — ”
27049	27052	27054	27054	Seamus	167	“ Unbelievable ! ”
27056	27059	27061	27061	Dean	168	“ Cool , ”
27063	27066	27068	27068	Neville	169	“ Amazing , ”
27185	27188	27183	27183	she	100	“ Morning , ”
27238	27256	27216	27216	Neville	169	“ Mail ’s due any minute — I think Gran ’s sending a few things I forgot . ”
27331	27334	27336	27336	Ron	99	“ Errol ! ”
27370	27375	27376	27376	Ron	99	“ Oh , no — ”
27379	27390	27392	27392	Hermione	100	“ It ’s all right , he ’s still alive , ”
27404	27414	27401	27401	her	100	“ It ’s not that — it ’s that . ”
27447	27453	27455	27455	Harry	84	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
27457	27468	27470	27470	Ron	99	“ She ’s — she ’s sent me a Howler , ”
27473	27482	27484	27484	Neville	169	“ You ’d better open it , Ron , ”
27490	27512	27514	27514	he	84	“ It ’ll be worse if you do n’t . My gran sent me one once , and I ignored it and ”
27517	27522	27514	27514	he	84	“ it was horrible . ”
27534	27540	27541	27541	he	84	“ What ’s a Howler ? ”
27564	27568	27569	27569	Neville	169	“ Open it , ”
27572	27583	27569	27569	Neville	169	“ It ’ll all be over in a few minutes — ”
27645	27691	27692	27693	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ — STEALING THE CAR , I WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY’D EXPELLED YOU , YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU , I DON’T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHER AND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE — ”
27754	27789	27747	27747	his	99	“ — LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT , I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME , WE DIDN’T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS , YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED — ”
27824	27859	27803	27803	He	84	“ — ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED — YOUR FATHER ’S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK , IT ’S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE’LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME . ”
27934	27950	27918	27918	Hermione	100	“ Well , I do n’t know what you expected , Ron , but you — ”
27951	27960	27962	27962	Ron	99	“ Do n’t tell me I deserved it , ”
28239	28245	28246	28246	he	206	“ Oh , hello there ! ”
28256	28307	28246	28246	he	206	“ Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow ! But I do n’t want you running away with the idea that I ’m better at Herbology than she is ! I just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels ... ”
28308	28315	28317	28318	Professor Sprout	176	“ Greenhouse three today , chaps ! ”
28418	28447	28412	28412	Lockhart	206	“ Harry ! I ’ve been wanting a word — you do n’t mind if he ’s a couple of minutes late , do you , Professor Sprout ? ”
28463	28469	28460	28460	Lockhart	206	“ That ’s the ticket , ”
28479	28482	28484	28484	Lockhart	206	“ Harry , ”
28500	28507	28495	28495	he	206	“ Harry , Harry , Harry . ”
28515	28536	28542	28542	he	206	“ When I heard — well , of course , it was all my fault . Could have kicked myself . ”
28558	28601	28554	28554	Lockhart	206	“ Do n’t know when I ’ve been more shocked . Flying a car to Hogwarts ! Well , of course , I knew at once why you ’d done it . Stood out a mile . Harry , Harry , Harry . ”
28622	28634	28636	28636	Lockhart	206	“ Gave you a taste for publicity , did n’t I ? ”
28638	28665	28636	28636	Lockhart	206	“ Gave you the bug . You got onto the front page of the paper with me and you could n’t wait to do it again . ”
28666	28675	28554	28554	Lockhart	206	“ Oh , no , Professor , see — ”
28676	28683	28685	28685	Lockhart	206	“ Harry , Harry , Harry , ”
28694	28861	28685	28685	Lockhart	206	“ I understand . Natural to want a bit more once you ’ve had that first taste — and I blame myself for giving you that , because it was bound to go to your head — but see here , young man , you ca n’t start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed . Just calm down , all right ? Plenty of time for all that when you ’re older . Yes , yes , I know what you ’re thinking ! ‘ It ’s all right for him , he ’s an internationally famous wizard already ! ’ But when I was twelve , I was just as much of a nobody as you are now . In fact , I ’d say I was even more of a nobody ! I mean , a few people have heard of you , have n’t they ? All that business with He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named ! ”
28873	28920	28862	28862	He	867	“ I know , I know — it ’s not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly ’s Most - Charming - Smile Award five times in a row , as I have — but it ’s a start , Harry , it ’s a start . ”
29002	29022	28999	28999	she	100	“ We ’ll be repotting Mandrakes today . Now , who can tell me the properties of the Mandrake ? ”
29037	29048	29050	29050	Hermione	100	“ Mandrake , or Mandragora , is a powerful restorative , ”
29063	29081	29057	29057	she	100	“ It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state . ”
29082	29090	29092	29093	Professor Sprout	176	“ Excellent . Ten points to Gryffindor , ”
29095	29120	29092	29093	Professor Sprout	176	“ The Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes . It is also , however , dangerous . Who can tell me why ? ”
29135	29149	29150	29150	she	100	“ The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it , ”
29154	29162	29164	29165	Professor Sprout	176	“ Precisely . Take another ten points , ”
29167	29180	29164	29165	Professor Sprout	176	“ Now , the Mandrakes we have here are still very young . ”
29240	29242	29190	29190	she	100	“ cry ”
29247	29255	29257	29258	Professor Sprout	176	“ Everyone take a pair of earmuffs , ”
29278	29296	29298	29299	Professor Sprout	176	“ When I tell you to put them on , make sure your ears are completely covered , ”
29301	29324	29298	29299	Professor Sprout	176	“ When it is safe to remove them , I will give you the thumbs - up . Right — earmuffs on . ”
29487	29502	29503	29503	she	176	“ As our Mandrakes are only seedlings , their cries wo n’t kill yet , ”
29520	29572	29503	29503	she	176	“ However , they will knock you out for several hours , and as I ’m sure none of you want to miss your first day back , make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work . I will attract your attention when it is time to pack up .
29573	29607	29608	29608	She	176	“ Four to a tray — there is a large supply of pots here — compost in the sacks over there — and be careful of the Venomous Tentacula , it ’s teething . ”
29668	29674	29675	29675	he	84	“ Justin Finch - Fletchley , ”
29685	29709	29675	29675	he	84	“ Know who you are , of course , the famous Harry Potter ... And you ’re Hermione Granger — always top in everything ”
29721	29734	29675	29675	he	84	“ — and Ron Weasley . Was n’t that your flying car ? ”
29749	29759	29761	29761	Justin	180	“ That Lockhart ’s something , is n’t he ? ”
29775	29815	29761	29761	Justin	180	“ Awfully brave chap . Have you read his books ? I ’d have died of fear if I ’d been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf , but he stayed cool and — zap — just fantastic .
29816	29880	29920	29921	The Mandrakes	177	“ My name was down for Eton , you know . I ca n’t tell you how glad I am I came here instead . Of course , Mother was slightly disappointed , but since I made her read Lockhart ’s books I think she ’s begun to see how useful it ’ll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family ... ”
30214	30221	30202	30202	Ron	99	“ Stupid — useless — thing — ”
30222	30229	30230	30230	Harry	84	“ Write home for another one , ”
30245	30256	30258	30258	Ron	99	“ Oh , yeah , and get another Howler back , ”
30269	30282	30258	30258	Ron	99	“ ‘ It ’s your own fault your wand got snapped — ’ ”
30313	30321	30323	30323	Harry	84	“ What ’ve we got this afternoon ? ”
30330	30337	30339	30339	Hermione	100	“ Defense Against the Dark Arts , ”
30343	30346	30348	30348	Ron	99	“ Why , ”
30354	30366	30348	30348	Ron	99	“ have you outlined all Lockhart ’s lessons in little hearts ? ”
30479	30493	30494	30494	he	99	“ All right , Harry ? I ’m — I ’m Colin Creevey , ”
30504	30528	30529	30529	he	99	“ I ’m in Gryffindor , too . D’you think — would it be all right if — can I have a picture ? ”
30537	30541	30542	30542	Harry	84	“ A picture ? ”
30546	30556	30558	30559	Colin Creevey	184	“ So I can prove I ’ve met you , ”
30566	30610	30612	30612	his	184	“ I know all about you . Everyone ’s told me . About how you survived when You - Know - Who tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how you ’ve still got a lightning scar on your forehead ”
30619	30641	30642	30642	Colin	184	“ and a boy in my dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion , the pictures’ll move . ”
30653	30721	30723	30723	he	184	“ It ’s amazing here , is n’t it ? I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts . My dad ’s a milkman , he could n’t believe it either . So I ’m taking loads of pictures to send home to him . And it ’d be really good if I had one of you ”
30729	30752	30723	30723	he	184	“ maybe your friend could take it and I could stand next to you ? And then , could you sign it ? ”
30753	30766	30780	30780	He	101	“ Signed photos ? You ’re giving out signed photos , Potter ? ”
30807	30812	30813	30813	Malfoy	101	“ Everyone line up ! ”
30819	30828	30813	30813	Malfoy	101	“ Harry Potter ’s giving out signed photos ! ”
30829	30836	30838	30838	Harry	84	“ No , I ’m not , ”
30845	30851	30838	30838	Harry	84	“ Shut up , Malfoy . ”
30852	30858	30861	30861	Colin	184	“ You ’re just jealous , ”
30875	30878	30880	30880	Malfoy	101	“ Jealous ? ”
30897	30931	30880	30880	Malfoy	101	“ Of what ? I do n’t want a foul scar right across my head , thanks . I do n’t think getting your head cut open makes you that special , myself . ”
30939	30945	30947	30947	Ron	99	“ Eat slugs , Malfoy , ”
30963	30969	30971	30971	Malfoy	101	“ Be careful , Weasley , ”
30973	30995	30996	30996	He	101	“ You do n’t want to start any trouble or your mummy’ll have to come and take you away from school . ”
31005	31017	30996	30996	He	101	“ ‘ If you put another toe out of line ’ — ”
31030	31040	31042	31042	Malfoy	101	“ Weasley would like a signed photo , Potter , ”
31044	31057	31042	31042	Malfoy	101	“ It ’d be worth more than his family ’s whole house — ”
31077	31081	31070	31070	Vampires	142	“ Look out ! ”
31082	31093	31094	31095	Gilderoy Lockhart	206	“ What ’s all this , what ’s all this ? ”
31108	31116	31106	31106	him	206	“ Who ’s giving out signed photos ? ”
31138	31150	31127	31127	Lockhart	206	“ Should n’t have asked ! We meet again , Harry ! ”
31171	31179	31181	31181	Lockhart	206	“ Come on then , Mr. Creevey , ”
31187	31208	31181	31181	Lockhart	206	“ A double portrait , ca n’t do better than that , and we ’ll both sign it for you . ”
31232	31241	31242	31242	Lockhart	206	“ Off you go , move along there , ”
31275	31284	31286	31286	Lockhart	206	“ A word to the wise , Harry , ”
31298	31331	31286	31286	Lockhart	206	“ I covered up for you back there with young Creevey — if he was photographing me , too , your schoolmates wo n’t think you ’re setting yourself up so much ... ”
31353	31408	31410	31410	he	206	“ Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career is n’t sensible — looks a tad bigheaded , Harry , to be frank . There may well come a time when , like me , you ’ll need to keep a stack handy wherever you go , but ”
31416	31427	31410	31410	he	206	“ I do n’t think you ’re quite there yet . ”
31509	31520	31522	31522	Ron	99	“ You could ’ve fried an egg on your face , ”
31524	31546	31522	31522	Ron	99	“ You ’d better hope Creevey does n’t meet Ginny , or they ’ll be starting a Harry Potter fan club . ”
31547	31551	31553	31553	Harry	84	“ Shut up , ”
31567	31573	31562	31562	Lockhart	206	“ Harry Potter fan club . ”
31620	31623	31624	31624	he	206	“ Me , ”
31635	31693	31624	31624	he	206	“ Gilderoy Lockhart , Order of Merlin , Third Class , Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League , and five - time winner of Witch Weekly ’s Most - Charming - Smile Award — but I do n’t talk about that . I did n’t get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her ! ”
31707	31757	31694	31694	He	206	“ I see you ’ve all bought a complete set of my books — well done . I thought we ’d start today with a little quiz . Nothing to worry about — just to check how well you ’ve read them , how much you ’ve taken in — ”
31777	31787	31766	31766	he	206	“ You have thirty minutes — start — now ! ”
31886	31965	31966	31966	He	206	“ Tut , tut — hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac . I say so in Year with the Yeti . And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully — I clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non - magic peoples — though I would n’t say no to a large bottle of Ogden ’s Old Firewhisky ! ”
32030	32065	32067	32067	he	206	“ . . . but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair - care potions — good girl ! In fact ”
32073	32083	32067	32067	he	206	“ full marks ! Where is Miss Hermione Granger ? ”
32090	32093	32095	32095	Lockhart	206	“ Excellent ! ”
32097	32113	32095	32095	Lockhart	206	“ Quite excellent ! Take ten points for Gryffindor ! And so — to business — ”
32130	32185	32114	32114	He	206	“ Now — be warned ! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind ! You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room . Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here . All I ask is that you remain calm . ”
32231	32240	32242	32242	Lockhart	206	“ I must ask you not to scream , ”
32248	32254	32242	32242	Lockhart	206	“ It might provoke them . ”
32269	32272	32273	32273	he	206	“ Yes , ”
32277	32283	32273	32273	he	206	“ Freshly caught Cornish pixies . ”
32310	32313	32314	32314	He	206	“ Yes ? ”
32319	32336	32337	32337	Seamus	167	“ Well , they ’re not — they ’re not very — dangerous , are they ? ”
32340	32347	32349	32349	Lockhart	206	“ Do n’t be so sure ! ”
32358	32367	32349	32349	Lockhart	206	“ Devilish tricky little blighters they can be ! ”
32426	32431	32432	32432	Lockhart	206	“ Right , then , ”
32436	32446	32448	32448	he	206	“ Let ’s see what you make of them ! ”
32571	32589	32590	32590	Lockhart	206	“ Come on now — round them up , round them up , they ’re only pixies , ”
32606	32610	32600	32600	his	206	“ Peskipiksi Pesternomi ! ”
32705	32725	32726	32726	He	206	“ Well , I ’ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage . ”
32738	32744	32746	32746	Ron	99	“ Can you believe him ? ”
32760	32773	32775	32775	Hermione	100	“ He just wants to give us some hands - on experience , ”
32795	32799	32801	32801	Harry	84	“ Hands on ? ”
32819	32833	32801	32801	Harry	84	“ Hermione , he did n’t have a clue what he was doing — ”
32834	32837	32839	32839	Hermione	100	“ Rubbish , ”
32841	32858	32839	32839	Hermione	100	“ You ’ve read his books — look at all those amazing things he ’s done — ”
32859	32866	32867	32867	Ron	99	“ He says he ’s done , ”
32923	32929	32915	32915	Colin	184	“ All right , Harry ? ”
32939	32944	32915	32915	Colin	184	“ Hello , Colin , ”
33069	33072	33074	33074	Harry	84	“ Whassamatter ? ”
33077	33081	33083	33083	Wood	193	“ Quidditch practice ! ”
33085	33089	33083	33083	Wood	193	“ Come on ! ”
33134	33137	33138	33138	Harry	84	“ Oliver , ”
33141	33149	33138	33138	Harry	84	“ It ’s the crack of dawn . ”
33150	33153	33155	33155	Wood	193	“ Exactly , ”
33180	33202	33204	33204	Wood	193	“ It ’s part of our new training program . Come on , grab your broom , and let ’s go , ”
33207	33230	33204	33204	Wood	193	“ None of the other teams have started training yet ; we ’re going to be first off the mark this year — ”
33249	33253	33255	33255	Wood	193	“ Good man , ”
33257	33267	33255	33255	Wood	193	“ Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes . ”
33352	33384	33329	33330	Colin Creevey	184	“ I heard someone saying your name on the stairs , Harry ! Look what I ’ve got here ! I ’ve had it developed , I wanted to show you — ”
33462	33468	33470	33470	Colin	184	“ Will you sign it ? ”
33473	33476	33478	33478	Harry	84	“ No , ”
33492	33506	33507	33507	He	184	“ Sorry , Colin , I ’m in a hurry — Quidditch practice — ”
33514	33532	33539	33539	him	184	“ Oh , wow ! Wait for me ! I ’ve never watched a Quidditch game before ! ”
33541	33548	33549	33549	Harry	84	“ It ’ll be really boring , ”
33564	33586	33588	33588	Colin	184	“ You were the youngest House player in a hundred years , were n’t you , Harry ? Were n’t you ? ”
33594	33623	33588	33588	Colin	184	“ You must be brilliant . I ’ve never flown . Is it easy ? Is that your own broom ? Is that the best one there is ? ”
33644	33652	33654	33654	Colin	184	“ I do n’t really understand Quidditch , ”
33657	33680	33654	33654	Colin	184	“ Is it true there are four balls ? And two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms ? ”
33681	33684	33686	33686	Harry	84	“ Yes , ”
33698	33732	33686	33686	Harry	84	“ They ’re called Bludgers . There are two Beaters on each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side . Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters . ”
33733	33742	33743	33743	Colin	184	“ And what are the other balls for ? ”
33762	33819	33753	33753	he	184	“ Well , the Quaffle — that ’s the biggish red one — is the one that scores goals . Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goalposts at the end of the pitch — they ’re three long poles with hoops on the end . ”
33820	33826	33753	33753	he	184	“ And the fourth ball — ”
33827	33834	33836	33836	Harry	84	“ — is the Golden Snitch , ”
33838	33897	33836	33836	Harry	84	“ and it ’s very small , very fast , and difficult to catch . But that ’s what the Seeker ’s got to do , because a game of Quidditch does n’t end until the Snitch has been caught . And whichever team ’s Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points . ”
33898	33910	33912	33912	Colin	184	“ And you ’re the Gryffindor Seeker , are n’t you ? ”
33916	33919	33921	33921	Harry	84	“ Yes , ”
33936	33956	33921	33921	Harry	84	“ And there ’s the Keeper , too . He guards the goalposts . That ’s it , really . ”
33998	34010	33989	33989	Colin	184	“ I ’ll go and get a good seat , Harry ! ”
34093	34104	34106	34106	Wood	193	“ There you are , Harry , what kept you ? ”
34109	34150	34106	34106	Wood	193	“ Now , I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field , because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program , which I really think will make all the difference ... ”
34267	34270	34272	34272	Wood	193	“ So , ”
34301	34309	34272	34272	Wood	193	“ Is that clear ? Any questions ? ”
34310	34319	34321	34321	George	111	“ I ’ve got a question , Oliver , ”
34330	34346	34321	34321	George	111	“ Why could n’t you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake ? ”
34352	34361	34362	34362	he	193	“ Now , listen here , you lot , ”
34370	34398	34362	34362	he	193	“ We should have won the Quidditch Cup last year . We ’re easily the best team . But unfortunately — owing to circumstances beyond our control — ”
34461	34486	34487	34487	Wood	193	“ So this year , we train harder than ever before ... Okay , let ’s go and put our new theories into practice ! ”
34560	34567	34569	34569	Ron	99	“ Are n’t you finished yet ? ”
34572	34578	34580	34580	Harry	84	“ Have n’t even started , ”
34600	34609	34591	34591	Hermione	100	“ Wood ’s been teaching us new moves . ”
34671	34679	34681	34681	Fred	110	“ What ’s that funny clicking noise ? ”
34723	34733	34734	34734	he	184	“ Look this way , Harry ! This way ! ”
34738	34743	34745	34745	Fred	110	“ Who ’s that ? ”
34747	34751	34752	34752	Harry	84	“ No idea , ”
34772	34778	34780	34780	Wood	193	“ What ’s going on ? ”
34793	34825	34780	34780	Wood	193	“ Why ’s that first year taking pictures ? I do n’t like it . He could be a Slytherin spy , trying to find out about our new training program . ”
34826	34832	34834	34834	Harry	84	“ He ’s in Gryffindor , ”
34837	34849	34851	34851	George	111	“ And the Slytherins do n’t need a spy , Oliver , ”
34853	34860	34862	34862	Wood	193	“ What makes you say that ? ”
34865	34873	34875	34875	George	111	“ Because they ’re here in person , ”
34895	34902	34903	34903	Wood	193	“ I do n’t believe it ! ”
34908	34922	34903	34903	Wood	193	“ I booked the field for today ! We ’ll see about this ! ”
34954	34957	34958	34958	Wood	193	“ Flint ! ”
34965	34983	34958	34958	Wood	193	“ This is our practice time ! We got up specially ! You can clear off now ! ”
35006	35017	34992	34992	He	202	“ Plenty of room for all of us , Wood . ”
35054	35061	35063	35063	Wood	193	“ But I booked the field ! ”
35070	35075	35063	35063	Wood	193	“ I booked it ! ”
35076	35079	35081	35081	Flint	202	“ Ah , ”
35083	35127	35081	35081	Flint	202	“ But I ’ve got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape . ‘ I , Professor S. Snape , give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker . ’ ”
35128	35136	35138	35138	Wood	193	“ You ’ve got a new Seeker ? ”
35142	35145	35138	35138	Wood	193	“ Where ? ”
35176	35185	35187	35187	Fred	110	“ Are n’t you Lucius Malfoy ’s son ? ”
35195	35204	35206	35206	Flint	202	“ Funny you should mention Draco ’s father , ”
35217	35233	35206	35206	Flint	202	“ Let me show you the generous gift he ’s made to the Slytherin team . ”
35278	35289	35291	35291	Flint	202	“ Very latest model . Only came out last month , ”
35306	35326	35328	35328	he	202	“ I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount . As for the old Cleansweeps ”
35343	35350	35328	35328	he	202	“ sweeps the board with them . ”
35379	35384	35386	35386	Flint	202	“ Oh , look , ”
35388	35393	35386	35386	Flint	202	“ A field invasion . ”
35408	35413	35414	35414	Ron	99	“ What ’s happening ? ”
35418	35432	35416	35416	Harry	84	“ Why are n’t you playing ? And what ’s he doing here ? ”
35446	35456	35458	35458	Malfoy	101	“ I ’m the new Slytherin Seeker , Weasley , ”
35462	35477	35458	35458	Malfoy	101	“ Everyone ’s just been admiring the brooms my father ’s bought our team . ”
35493	35500	35502	35502	Malfoy	101	“ Good , are n’t they ? ”
35505	35542	35502	35502	Malfoy	101	“ But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms , too . You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives ; I expect a museum would bid for them . ”
35550	35566	35568	35568	Hermione	100	“ At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in , ”
35571	35579	35568	35568	Hermione	100	“ They got in on pure talent . ”
35589	35601	35602	35602	he	101	“ No one asked your opinion , you filthy little Mudblood , ”
35646	35651	35643	35643	Alicia	198	“ How dare you ! ”
35669	35679	35656	35656	his	99	“ You ’ll pay for that one , Malfoy ! ”
35731	35741	35743	35743	Hermione	100	“ Ron ! Ron ! Are you all right ? ”
35833	35847	35849	35849	Harry	84	“ We ’d better get him to Hagrid ’s , it ’s nearest , ”
35869	35892	35893	35893	Colin	184	“ What happened , Harry ? What happened ? Is he ill ? But you can cure him , ca n’t you ? ”
35925	35928	35930	35930	Colin	184	“ Oooh , ”
35938	35947	35930	35930	Colin	184	“ Can you hold him still , Harry ? ”
35948	35957	35959	35959	Harry	84	“ Get out of the way , Colin ! ”
35982	35988	35990	35990	Hermione	100	“ Nearly there , Ron , ”
36000	36013	35990	35990	Hermione	100	“ You ’ll be all right in a minute — almost there — ”
36051	36057	36058	36058	Harry	84	“ Quick , behind here , ”
36074	36088	36089	36089	Lockhart	206	“ It ’s a simple matter if you know what you ’re doing ! ”
36096	36145	36147	36147	he	206	“ If you need help , you know where I am ! I ’ll let you have a copy of my book . I ’m surprised you have n’t already got one — I ’ll sign one tonight and send it over . Well , good - bye ! ”
36202	36229	36196	36196	he	91	“ Bin wonderin ’ when you ’d come ter see me — come in , come in — thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again — ”
36285	36291	36292	36292	he	84	“ Better out than in , ”
36306	36314	36292	36292	he	84	“ Get ’em all up , Ron . ”
36315	36332	36334	36334	Hermione	100	“ I do n’t think there ’s anything to do except wait for it to stop , ”
36344	36364	36338	36338	Ron	99	“ That ’s a difficult curse to work at the best of times , but with a broken wand — ”
36383	36393	36394	36394	Harry	84	“ What did Lockhart want with you , Hagrid ? ”
36402	36416	36418	36418	Hagrid	91	“ Givin ’ me advice on gettin ’ kelpies out of a well , ”
36436	36468	36418	36418	Hagrid	91	“ Like I don ’ know . An ’ bangin ’ on about some banshee he banished . If one word of it was true , I ’ll eat my kettle . ”
36501	36524	36488	36488	Hermione	100	“ I think you ’re being a bit unfair . Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job — ”
36525	36535	36537	36537	Hagrid	91	“ He was the on’y man for the job , ”
36555	36613	36615	36615	Hagrid	91	“ An ’ I mean the on’y one . Gettin ’ very difficult ter find anyone fer the Dark Arts job . People are n’t too keen ter take it on , see . They ’re startin ’ ter think it ’s jinxed . No one ’s lasted long fer a while now . So tell me , ”
36623	36632	36618	36618	his	91	“ Who was he tryin ’ ter curse ? ”
36633	36651	36618	36618	his	91	“ Malfoy called Hermione something — it must ’ve been really bad , because everyone went wild . ”
36652	36657	36659	36659	Ron	99	“ It was bad , ”
36671	36681	36659	36659	Ron	99	“ Malfoy called her ‘ Mudblood , ’ Hagrid — ”
36702	36707	36708	36708	he	91	“ He didn ’ ! ”
36713	36717	36718	36718	she	100	“ He did , ”
36721	36742	36718	36718	she	100	“ But I do n’t know what it means . I could tell it was really rude , of course — ”
36743	36756	36758	36758	Ron	99	“ It ’s about the most insulting thing he could think of , ”
36764	36815	36816	36816	He	99	“ Mudblood ’s a really foul name for someone who is Muggle - born — you know , non - magic parents . There are some wizards — like Malfoy ’s family — who think they ’re better than everyone else because they ’re what people call pure - blood . ”
36841	36881	36832	36832	He	99	“ I mean , the rest of us know it does n’t make any difference at all . Look at Neville Longbottom — he ’s pure - blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up . ”
36882	36897	36899	36899	Hagrid	91	“ An ’ they have n’t invented a spell our Hermione can ’ do , ”
36911	36921	36923	36923	Ron	99	“ It ’s a disgusting thing to call someone , ”
36934	36969	36923	36923	Ron	99	“ Dirty blood , see . Common blood . It ’s ridiculous . Most wizards these days are half - blood anyway . If we had n’t married Muggles we ’d ’ve died out . ”
36979	36996	36998	36998	Hagrid	91	“ Well , I don ’ blame yeh fer tryin ’ ter curse him , Ron , ”
37010	37047	36998	36998	Hagrid	91	“ Bu ’ maybe it was a good thing yer wand backfired . ’ Spect Lucius Malfoy would ’ve come marchin ’ up ter school if yeh’d cursed his son . Least yer not in trouble . ”
37084	37087	37089	37089	Hagrid	91	“ Harry , ”
37099	37128	37089	37089	Hagrid	91	“ Got ta bone ter pick with yeh . I ’ve heard you ’ve bin givin ’ out signed photos . How come I have n’t got one ? ”
37137	37147	37148	37148	he	84	“ I have not been giving out signed photos , ”
37152	37161	37148	37148	he	84	“ If Lockhart ’s still spreading that around — ”
37171	37178	37179	37179	he	91	“ I ’m on’y jokin ’ , ”
37197	37223	37179	37179	he	91	“ I knew yeh had n’t really . I told Lockhart yeh didn ’ need teh . Yer more famous than him without tryin ’ . ”
37224	37232	37234	37234	Harry	84	“ Bet he did n’t like that , ”
37243	37250	37252	37252	Hagrid	91	“ Don ’ think he did , ”
37258	37286	37287	37287	he	91	“ An ’ then I told him I ’d never read one o ’ his books an ’ he decided ter go . Treacle toffee , Ron ? ”
37293	37297	37299	37299	Ron	99	“ No thanks , ”
37302	37308	37299	37299	Ron	99	“ Better not risk it . ”
37309	37321	37323	37323	Hagrid	91	“ Come an ’ see what I ’ve bin growin ’ , ”
37365	37375	37377	37377	Hagrid	91	“ Gettin ’ on well , are n’t they ? ”
37380	37393	37377	37377	Hagrid	91	“ Fer the Halloween feast ... should be big enough by then . ”
37394	37402	37404	37404	Harry	84	“ What ’ve you been feeding them ? ”
37418	37437	37406	37406	Hagrid	91	“ Well , I ’ve bin givin ’ them — you know — a bit o ’ help — ”
37539	37547	37549	37549	Hermione	100	“ An Engorgement Charm , I suppose ? ”
37557	37569	37549	37549	Hermione	100	“ Well , you ’ve done a good job on them . ”
37570	37579	37581	37581	Hagrid	91	“ That ’s what yer little sister said , ”
37587	37594	37585	37585	Ron	99	“ Met her jus ’ yesterday . ”
37605	37634	37635	37635	He	91	“ Said she was jus ’ lookin ’ round the grounds , but I reckon she was hopin ’ she might run inter someone else at my house . ”
37640	37655	37635	37635	He	91	“ If yeh ask me , she wouldn ’ say no ter a signed — ”
37656	37662	37664	37664	Harry	84	“ Oh , shut up , ”

44022	44030	44031	44031	he	84	“ It ’s going to kill someone ! ”
44097	44106	44108	44108	Ron	99	“ Harry , what was that all about ? ”
44116	44123	44108	44108	Ron	99	“ I could n’t hear anything ... ”
44136	44139	44125	44125	Hermione	100	“ Look ! ”
44196	44205	44207	44207	Ron	99	“ What ’s that thing — hanging underneath ? ”
44321	44329	44318	44318	Ron	99	“ Let ’s get out of here . ”
44330	44338	44339	44339	Harry	84	“ Should n’t we try and help — ”
44343	44347	44349	44349	Ron	99	“ Trust me , ”
44351	44361	44349	44349	Ron	99	“ We do n’t want to be found here . ”
44490	44505	44484	44484	someone	388	“ Enemies of the Heir , beware ! You ’ll be next , Mudbloods ! ”
44556	44556	44533	44533	he	101	”
44590	44604	44605	44605	he	212	“ My cat ! My cat ! What ’s happened to Mrs. Norris ? ”
44616	44619	44620	44620	he	212	“ You ! ”
44623	44645	44620	44620	he	212	“ You ! You ’ve murdered my cat ! You ’ve killed her ! I ’ll kill you ! I ’ll — ”
44646	44649	44650	44650	Dumbledore	106	“ Argus ! ”
44687	44694	44695	44695	he	106	“ Come with me , Argus , ”
44700	44714	44695	44695	he	106	“ You , too , Mr. Potter , Mr. Weasley , Miss Granger . ”
44720	44735	44715	44715	Lockhart	206	“ My office is nearest , Headmaster — just upstairs — please feel free — ”
44736	44742	44744	44744	Dumbledore	106	“ Thank you , Gilderoy , ”
44948	44989	44937	44937	Lockhart	206	“ It was definitely a curse that killed her — probably the Transmogrifian Torture — I ’ve seen it used many times , so unlucky I was n’t there , I know the very countercurse that would have saved her ... ”
45099	45112	45114	45114	Lockhart	206	“ . . . I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou , ”
45116	45149	45114	45114	Lockhart	206	“ a series of attacks , the full story ’s in my autobiography , I was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets , which cleared the matter up at once ... ”
45183	45191	45192	45192	he	106	“ She ’s not dead , Argus , ”
45212	45216	45218	45218	Filch	212	“ Not dead ? ”
45228	45240	45225	45226	Mrs. Norris	224	“ But why ’s she all — all stiff and frozen ? ”
45241	45247	45249	45249	Dumbledore	106	“ She has been Petrified , ”
45251	45258	45260	45260	Lockhart	206	“ Ah ! I thought so ! ”
45263	45272	45249	45249	Dumbledore	106	“ But how , I can not say ... ”
45273	45277	45279	45279	Filch	212	“ Ask him ! ”
45290	45299	45301	45301	Dumbledore	106	“ No second year could have done this , ”
45304	45315	45301	45301	Dumbledore	106	“ It would take Dark Magic of the most advanced — ”
45316	45325	45326	45326	Filch	212	“ He did it , he did it ! ”
45334	45361	45329	45329	his	212	“ You saw what he wrote on the wall ! He found — in my office — he knows I ’m a — I ’m a — ”
45368	45376	45377	45377	he	212	“ He knows I ’m a Squib ! ”
45380	45387	45388	45388	Harry	84	“ I never touched Mrs. Norris ! ”
45408	45420	45388	45388	Harry	84	“ And I do n’t even know what a Squib is . ”
45421	45424	45426	45426	Filch	212	“ Rubbish ! ”
45428	45435	45426	45426	Filch	212	“ He saw my Kwikspell letter ! ”
45436	45444	45446	45446	Snape	203	“ If I might speak , Headmaster , ”
45475	45493	45494	45494	he	84	“ Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time , ”
45509	45540	45494	45494	he	84	“ But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here . Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all ? Why was n’t he at the Halloween feast ? ”
45556	45574	45543	45543	Ron	99	“ . . . there were hundreds of ghosts , they ’ll tell you we were there — ”
45575	45584	45586	45586	Snape	203	“ But why not join the feast afterward ? ”
45596	45604	45586	45586	Snape	203	“ Why go up to that corridor ? ”
45612	45617	45618	45618	Harry	84	“ Because — because — ”
45657	45669	45670	45670	he	84	“ because we were tired and wanted to go to bed , ”
45673	45678	45680	45680	Snape	203	“ Without any supper ? ”
45691	45707	45680	45680	Snape	203	“ I did n’t think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties . ”
45708	45714	45716	45716	Ron	99	“ We were n’t hungry , ”
45732	45746	45747	45747	he	203	“ I suggest , Headmaster , that Potter is not being entirely truthful , ”
45750	45795	45747	45747	he	203	“ It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story . I personally feel he should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be honest . ”
45796	45801	45803	45804	Professor McGonagall	158	“ Really , Severus , ”
45807	45844	45803	45804	Professor McGonagall	158	“ I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch . This cat was n’t hit over the head with a broomstick . There is no evidence at all that Potter has done anything wrong . ”
45871	45879	45880	45880	he	106	“ Innocent until proven guilty , Severus , ”
45892	45899	45900	45900	he	212	“ My cat has been Petrified ! ”
45907	45915	45900	45900	he	212	“ I want to see some punishment ! ”
45916	45927	45929	45929	Dumbledore	106	“ We will be able to cure her , Argus , ”
45932	45964	45929	45929	Dumbledore	106	“ Professor Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes . As soon as they have reached their full size , I will have a potion made that will revive Mrs. Norris . ”
45965	45971	45972	45972	Lockhart	206	“ I ’ll make it , ”
45976	45998	45972	45972	Lockhart	206	“ I must have done it a hundred times . I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep — ”
45999	46003	46005	46005	Snape	90	“ Excuse me , ”
46008	46021	46005	46005	Snape	90	“ But I believe I am the Potions master at this school . ”
46029	46034	46035	46035	Dumbledore	106	“ You may go , ”
46091	46105	46082	46082	Harry	84	“ D’you think I should have told them about that voice I heard ? ”
46106	46109	46111	46111	Ron	99	“ No , ”
46116	46136	46111	46111	Ron	99	“ Hearing voices no one else can hear is n’t a good sign , even in the Wizarding world . ”
46146	46156	46143	46143	Harry	84	“ You do believe me , do n’t you ? ”
46157	46163	46165	46165	Ron	99	“ ’ Course I do , ”
46168	46178	46165	46165	Ron	99	“ But — you must admit it ’s weird ... ”
46179	46186	46188	46188	Harry	84	“ I know it ’s weird , ”
46190	46219	46188	46188	Harry	84	“ The whole thing ’s weird . What was that writing on the wall about ? The Chamber Has Been Opened ... What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
46220	46231	46233	46233	Ron	99	“ You know , it rings a sort of bell , ”
46236	46257	46233	46233	Ron	99	“ I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once ... might ’ve been Bill ... ”
46258	46267	46269	46269	Harry	84	“ And what on earth ’s a Squib ? ”
46280	46295	46296	46296	he	99	“ Well — it ’s not funny really — but as it ’s Filch , ”
46299	46369	46370	46370	Ron	99	“ A Squib is someone who was born into a Wizarding family but has n’t got any magic powers . Kind of the opposite of Muggle - born wizards , but Squibs are quite unusual . If Filch ’s trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course , I reckon he must be a Squib . It would explain a lot . Like why he hates students so much . ”
46376	46381	46370	46370	Ron	99	“ He ’s bitter . ”
46387	46390	46392	46392	Harry	84	“ Midnight , ”
46394	46414	46392	46392	Harry	84	“ We ’d better get to bed before Snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else . ”
46536	46539	46511	46511	he	212	“ breathing loudly ”
46541	46545	46511	46511	he	212	“ looking happy . ”
46568	46580	46581	46581	Ron	99	“ But you have n’t really got to know Mrs. Norris , ”
46586	46597	46581	46581	Ron	99	“ Honestly , we ’re much better off without her . ”
46603	46614	46615	46615	Ron	99	“ Stuff like this does n’t often happen at Hogwarts , ”
46619	46658	46659	46659	Ron	99	“ They ’ll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time . I just hope he ’s got time to Petrify Filch before he ’s expelled . I ’m only joking — ”
46840	46848	46812	46812	Ron	99	“ The Medieval Assembly of European Wizards . ”
46849	46863	46865	46865	Ron	99	“ I do n’t believe it , I ’m still eight inches short ... ”
46881	46896	46865	46865	Ron	99	“ And Hermione ’s done four feet seven inches and her writing ’s tiny . ”
46897	46902	46904	46904	Harry	84	“ Where is she ? ”
46916	46921	46923	46923	Ron	99	“ Somewhere over there , ”
46930	46949	46923	46923	Ron	99	“ Looking for another book . I think she ’s trying to read the whole library before Christmas . ”
46963	46979	46981	46981	Ron	99	“ Dunno why you care . I thought he was a bit of an idiot , ”
46994	47004	46981	46981	Ron	99	“ All that junk about Lockhart being so great — ”
47025	47039	47040	47040	she	100	“ All the copies of Hogwarts : A History have been taken out , ”
47051	47088	47040	47040	she	100	“ And there ’s a two - week waiting list . I wish I had n’t left my copy at home , but I could n’t fit it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books . ”
47089	47096	47098	47098	Harry	84	“ Why do you want it ? ”
47100	47109	47111	47111	Hermione	100	“ The same reason everyone else wants it , ”
47113	47126	47111	47111	Hermione	100	“ to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets . ”
47127	47132	47134	47134	Harry	84	“ What ’s that ? ”
47137	47148	47150	47150	Hermione	100	“ That ’s just it . I ca n’t remember , ”
47156	47167	47150	47150	Hermione	100	“ And I ca n’t find the story anywhere else — ”
47168	47177	47179	47179	Ron	99	“ Hermione , let me read your composition , ”
47186	47193	47195	47195	Hermione	100	“ No , I wo n’t , ”
47200	47210	47195	47195	Hermione	100	“ You ’ve had ten days to finish it — ”
47211	47222	47229	47229	Hermione	100	“ I only need another two inches , come on — ”
47436	47442	47406	47406	Hermione	100	“ Miss — er — ? ”
47443	47463	47465	47465	Hermione	100	“ Granger , Professor . I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets , ”
47519	47527	47528	47528	he	241	“ My subject is History of Magic , ”
47537	47551	47528	47528	he	241	“ I deal with facts , Miss Granger , not myths and legends . ”
47566	47579	47554	47554	his	241	“ In September of that year , a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers — ”
47596	47600	47586	47586	Hermione	100	“ Miss Grant ? ”
47601	47616	47617	47618	Professor Binns	241	“ Please , sir , do n’t legends always have a basis in fact ? ”
47642	47645	47647	47648	Professor Binns	241	“ Well , ”
47651	47662	47663	47663	He	241	“ yes , one could argue that , I suppose . ”
47678	47697	47669	47669	he	241	“ However , the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational , even ludicrous tale — ”
47740	47746	47747	47747	he	241	“ Oh , very well , ”
47751	47760	47747	47747	he	241	“ Let me see ... the Chamber of Secrets ...
47761	47851	47852	47852	He	241	“ You all know , of course , that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago — the precise date is uncertain — by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age . The four school Houses are named after them : Godric Gryffindor , Helga Hufflepuff , Rowena Ravenclaw , and Salazar Slytherin . They built this castle together , far from prying Muggle eyes , for it was an age when magic was feared by common people , and witches and wizards suffered much persecution . ”
47864	47978	47852	47852	He	241	“ For a few years , the founders worked in harmony together , seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated . But then disagreements sprang up between them . A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others . Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts . He believed that magical learning should be kept within all - magic families . He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage , believing them to be untrustworthy . After a while , there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor , and Slytherin left the school . ”
47995	48004	48005	48005	he	241	“ Reliable historical sources tell us this much , ”
48008	48047	48005	48005	he	241	“ But these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets . The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle , of which the other founders knew nothing .
48048	48114	47979	47980	Professor Binns	241	“ Slytherin , according to the legend , sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school . The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets , unleash the horror within , and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic . ”
48164	48175	48176	48176	he	241	“ The whole thing is arrant nonsense , of course , ”
48179	48218	48176	48176	he	241	“ Naturally , the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber , many times , by the most learned witches and wizards . It does not exist . A tale told to frighten the gullible . ”
48228	48245	48176	48176	he	241	“ Sir — what exactly do you mean by the ‘ horror within ’ the Chamber ? ”
48246	48266	48271	48271	his	241	“ That is believed to be some sort of monster , which the Heir of Slytherin alone can control , ”
48283	48294	48296	48297	Professor Binns	241	“ I tell you , the thing does not exist , ”
48303	48312	48296	48297	Professor Binns	241	“ There is no Chamber and no monster . ”
48313	48318	48320	48321	Seamus Finnigan	167	“ But , sir , ”
48323	48350	48320	48321	Seamus Finnigan	167	“ if the Chamber can only be opened by Slytherin ’s true heir , no one else would be able to find it , would they ? ”
48351	48356	48358	48359	Professor Binns	241	“ Nonsense , O’Flaherty , ”
48365	48381	48358	48359	Professor Binns	241	“ If a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters and headmistresses have n’t found the thing — ”
48382	48387	48390	48391	Parvati Patil	246	“ But , Professor , ”
48393	48406	48390	48391	Parvati Patil	246	“ you ’d probably have to use Dark Magic to open it — ”
48407	48427	48429	48430	Professor Binns	241	“ Just because a wizard does n’t use Dark Magic does n’t mean he ca n’t , Miss Pennyfeather , ”
48432	48442	48429	48430	Professor Binns	241	“ I repeat , if the likes of Dumbledore — ”
48443	48460	48462	48463	Dean Thomas	168	“ But maybe you ’ve got to be related to Slytherin , so Dumbledore could n’t — ”
48472	48477	48478	48478	he	241	“ That will do , ”
48482	48540	48478	48478	he	241	“ It is a myth ! It does not exist ! There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard ! I regret telling you such a foolish story ! We will return , if you please , to history , to solid , believable , verifiable fact ! ”
48556	48568	48569	48569	Ron	99	“ I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony , ”
48597	48647	48577	48577	their	1179	“ But I never knew he started all this pure - blood stuff . I would n’t be in his House if you paid me . Honestly , if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin , I ’d ’ve got the train straight back home ... ”
48807	48812	48802	48803	Colin Creevey	184	“ Hiya , Harry ! ”
48813	48818	48820	48820	Harry	84	“ Hullo , Colin , ”
48823	48839	48820	48820	Harry	84	“ Harry — Harry — a boy in my class has been saying you ’re — ”
48866	48872	48874	48874	he	184	“ See you , Harry ! ”
48878	48890	48891	48891	Hermione	100	“ What ’s a boy in his class saying about you ? ”
48894	48905	48907	48907	Harry	84	“ That I ’m Slytherin ’s heir , I expect , ”
48934	48940	48942	48942	Ron	99	“ People here’ll believe anything , ”
48961	48972	48973	48973	Ron	99	“ D’you really think there ’s a Chamber of Secrets ? ”
48977	48983	48984	48984	she	100	“ I do n’t know , ”
48989	49014	48984	48984	she	100	“ Dumbledore could n’t cure Mrs. Norris , and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be — well — human . ”
49079	49088	49100	49100	Ron	99	“ The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened . ”
49089	49099	49100	49100	Ron	99	“ That ’s where Filch has been keeping guard , ”
49114	49124	49126	49126	Harry	84	“ Ca n’t hurt to have a poke around , ”
49149	49153	49154	49154	he	84	“ Scorch marks ! ”
49157	49163	49154	49154	he	84	“ Here — and here — ”
49164	49171	49173	49173	Hermione	100	“ Come and look at this ! ”
49175	49180	49173	49173	Hermione	100	“ This is funny ... ”
49246	49256	49258	49258	Hermione	100	“ Have you ever seen spiders act like that ? ”
49261	49264	49266	49266	Harry	84	“ No , ”
49268	49276	49266	49266	Harry	84	“ have you , Ron ? Ron ? ”
49298	49303	49305	49305	Harry	84	“ What ’s up ? ”
49307	49317	49319	49319	Ron	99	“ I — do n’t — like — spiders , ”
49322	49328	49330	49330	Hermione	100	“ I never knew that , ”
49338	49349	49330	49330	Hermione	100	“ You ’ve used spiders in Potions loads of times ... ”
49350	49358	49360	49360	Ron	99	“ I do n’t mind them dead , ”
49372	49383	49360	49360	Ron	99	“ I just do n’t like the way they move ... ”
49387	49393	49395	49395	Ron	99	“ It ’s not funny , ”
49399	49452	49395	49395	Ron	99	“ If you must know , when I was three , Fred turned my — my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick ... You would n’t like them either if you ’d been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and ... ”
49480	49501	49477	49477	Harry	84	“ Remember all that water on the floor ? Where did that come from ? Someone ’s mopped it up . ”
49502	49508	49510	49510	Ron	99	“ It was about here , ”
49526	49532	49510	49510	Ron	99	“ Level with this door . ”
49551	49557	49559	49559	Harry	84	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
49561	49568	49570	49570	Ron	99	“ Ca n’t go in there , ”
49573	49581	49570	49570	Ron	99	“ That ’s a girls ’ toilet . ”
49582	49595	49597	49597	Hermione	100	“ Oh , Ron , there wo n’t be anyone in there , ”
49605	49622	49597	49597	Hermione	100	“ That ’s Moaning Myrtle ’s place . Come on , let ’s have a look . ”
49735	49744	49732	49732	she	100	“ Hello , Myrtle , how are you ? ”
49770	49778	49779	49779	she	100	“ This is a girls ’ bathroom , ”
49788	49794	49779	49779	she	100	“ They ’re not girls . ”
49795	49798	49799	49799	Hermione	100	“ No , ”
49802	49819	49799	49799	Hermione	100	“ I just wanted to show them how — er — nice it is in here . ”
49833	49841	49842	49842	Harry	84	“ Ask her if she saw anything , ”
49847	49853	49855	49855	Myrtle	230	“ What are you whispering ? ”
49861	49864	49866	49866	Harry	84	“ Nothing , ”
49869	49875	49866	49866	Harry	84	“ We wanted to ask — ”
49876	49887	49889	49889	Myrtle	230	“ I wish people would stop talking behind my back ! ”
49898	49913	49889	49889	Myrtle	230	“ I do have feelings , you know , even if I am dead — ”
49914	49924	49926	49926	Hermione	100	“ Myrtle , no one wants to upset you , ”
49928	49932	49926	49926	Hermione	100	“ Harry only — ”
49933	49947	49949	49949	Myrtle	230	“ No one wants to upset me ! That ’s a good one ! ”
49951	49970	49949	49949	Myrtle	230	“ My life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death ! ”
49971	49985	49987	49987	Hermione	100	“ We wanted to ask you if you ’ve seen anything funny lately , ”
49990	50004	49987	49987	Hermione	100	“ Because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween . ”
50005	50015	50017	50017	Harry	84	“ Did you see anyone near here that night ? ”
50019	50026	50028	50028	Myrtle	230	“ I was n’t paying attention , ”
50031	50062	50028	50028	Myrtle	230	“ Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself . Then , of course , I remembered that I ’m — that I ’m — ”
50063	50067	50069	50069	Ron	99	“ Already dead , ”
50141	50158	50135	50135	Hermione	100	“ Honestly , that was almost cheerful for Myrtle ... Come on , let ’s go . ”
50181	50184	50159	50159	Harry	84	“ RON ! ”
50210	50218	50219	50219	he	120	“ That ’s a girls ’ bathroom ! ”
50222	50228	50219	50219	he	120	“ What were you — ? ”
50229	50236	50237	50237	Ron	99	“ Just having a look around , ”
50240	50246	50237	50237	Ron	99	“ Clues , you know — ”
50260	50269	50270	50270	Percy	120	“ Get — away — from — there — ”
50287	50306	50270	50270	Percy	120	“ Do n’t you care what this looks like ? Coming back here while everyone ’s at dinner — ”
50307	50315	50317	50317	Ron	99	“ Why should n’t we be here ? ”
50327	50339	50317	50317	Ron	99	“ Listen , we never laid a finger on that cat ! ”
50340	50348	50350	50350	Percy	120	“ That ’s what I told Ginny , ”
50353	50397	50350	50350	Percy	120	“ but she still seems to think you ’re going to be expelled , I ’ve never seen her so upset , crying her eyes out , you might think of her , all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business — ”
50398	50406	50408	50408	Ron	99	“ You do n’t care about Ginny , ”
50416	50434	50408	50408	Ron	99	“ You ’re just worried I ’m going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy — ”
50435	50441	50442	50442	Percy	120	“ Five points from Gryffindor ! ”
50451	50473	50442	50442	Percy	120	“ And I hope it teaches you a lesson ! No more detective work , or I ’ll write to Mum ! ”
50573	50581	50582	50582	she	100	“ Who can it be , though ? ”
50600	50617	50582	50582	she	100	“ Who ’d want to frighten all the Squibs and Muggle - borns out of Hogwarts ? ”
50618	50623	50625	50625	Ron	99	“ Let ’s think , ”
50630	50643	50625	50625	Ron	99	“ Who do we know who thinks Muggle - borns are scum ? ”
50655	50663	50644	50644	He	99	“ If you ’re talking about Malfoy — ”
50664	50670	50672	50672	Ron	99	“ Of course I am ! ”
50674	50709	50672	50672	Ron	99	“ You heard him — ‘ You ’ll be next , Mudbloods ! ’ — come on , you ’ve only got to look at his foul rat face to know it ’s him — ”
50710	50718	50720	50720	Hermione	100	“ Malfoy , the Heir of Slytherin ? ”
50723	50729	50731	50731	Harry	84	“ Look at his family , ”
50739	50772	50731	50731	Harry	84	“ The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin ; he ’s always boasting about it . They could easily be Slytherin ’s descendants . His father ’s definitely evil enough . ”
50773	50788	50790	50790	Ron	99	“ They could ’ve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries ! ”
50792	50801	50790	50790	Ron	99	“ Handing it down , father to son ... ”
50802	50805	50807	50807	Hermione	100	“ Well , ”
50810	50817	50807	50807	Hermione	100	“ I suppose it ’s possible ... ”
50818	50826	50828	50828	Harry	84	“ But how do we prove it ? ”
50831	50838	50840	50840	Hermione	100	“ There might be a way , ”
50858	50885	50856	50856	Percy	120	“ Of course , it would be difficult . And dangerous , very dangerous . We ’d be breaking about fifty school rules , I expect — ”
50886	50910	50912	50912	Ron	99	“ If , in a month or so , you feel like explaining , you will let us know , wo n’t you ? ”
50915	50919	50921	50921	Hermione	100	“ All right , ”
50924	50952	50921	50921	Hermione	100	“ What we ’d need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it ’s us . ”
50953	50959	50960	50960	Harry	84	“ But that ’s impossible , ”
50966	50973	50975	50975	Hermione	100	“ No , it ’s not , ”
50977	50988	50975	50975	Hermione	100	“ All we ’d need would be some Polyjuice Potion . ”
50989	50994	50996	50996	Ron	99	“ What ’s that ? ”
51001	51012	50998	50998	Harry	84	“ Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago — ”
51013	51030	51032	51032	Ron	99	“ D’you think we ’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape ? ”
51034	51091	51032	51032	Ron	99	“ It transforms you into somebody else . Think about it ! We could change into three of the Slytherins . No one would know it was us . Malfoy would probably tell us anything . He ’s probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now , if only we could hear him . ”
51092	51103	51105	51105	Ron	99	“ This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me , ”
51109	51123	51105	51105	Ron	99	“ What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever ? ”
51124	51132	51137	51137	her	100	“ It wears off after a while , ”
51141	51178	51137	51137	her	100	“ But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult . Snape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it ’s bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library . ”
51205	51218	51220	51220	Ron	99	“ Hard to see why we ’d want the book , really , ”
51222	51237	51220	51220	Ron	99	“ if we were n’t going to try and make one of the potions . ”
51238	51242	51244	51244	Hermione	100	“ I think , ”
51246	51269	51244	51244	Hermione	100	“ that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory , we might stand a chance ... ”
51270	51285	51287	51287	Ron	99	“ Oh , come on , no teacher ’s going to fall for that , ”
51289	51298	51287	51287	Ron	99	“ They ’d have to be really thick ... ”
51448	51578	51424	51424	he	84	“ Nice loud howl , Harry — exactly — and then , if you ’ll believe it , I pounced — like this — slammed him to the floor — thus — with one hand , I managed to hold him down — with my other , I put my wand to his throat — I then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm — he let out a piteous moan — go on , Harry — higher than that — good — the fur vanished — the fangs shrank — and he turned back into a man . Simple , yet effective — and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks . ”
51589	51617	51656	51656	Hermione	100	“ Homework — compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf ! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best one ! ”
51640	51643	51644	51644	Harry	84	“ Ready ? ”
51647	51654	51656	51656	Hermione	100	“ Wait till everyone ’s gone , ”
51659	51663	51656	51656	Hermione	100	“ All right ... ”
51687	51693	51694	51694	Hermione	100	“ Er — Professor Lockhart ? ”
51697	51716	51717	51717	She	100	“ I wanted to — to get this book out of the library . Just for background reading . ”
51730	51777	51717	51717	She	100	“ But the thing is , it ’s in the Restricted Section of the library , so I need a teacher to sign for it — I ’m sure it would help me understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls about slow - acting venoms — ”
51778	51785	51787	51787	Lockhart	206	“ Ah , Gadding with Ghouls ! ”
51800	51811	51787	51787	Lockhart	206	“ Possibly my very favorite book . You enjoyed it ? ”
51812	51817	51819	51819	Hermione	100	“ Oh , yes , ”
51822	51839	51819	51819	Hermione	100	“ So clever , the way you trapped that last one with the tea - strainer — ”
51840	51863	51865	51865	Lockhart	206	“ Well , I ’m sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help , ”
51877	51886	51887	51887	he	206	“ Yes , nice , is n’t it ? ”
51899	51908	51887	51887	he	206	“ I usually save it for book signings . ”
51925	51930	51932	51932	Lockhart	206	“ So , Harry , ”
51949	52042	51935	51935	Hermione	100	“ Tomorrow ’s the first Quidditch match of the season , I believe ? Gryffindor against Slytherin , is it not ? I hear you ’re a useful player . I was a Seeker , too . I was asked to try for the National Squad , but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces . Still , if ever you feel the need for a little private training , do n’t hesitate to ask . Always happy to pass on my expertise to less able players ... ”
52060	52067	52068	52068	he	84	“ I do n’t believe it , ”
52082	52094	52068	52068	he	84	“ He did n’t even look at the book we wanted . ”
52095	52105	52107	52107	Ron	99	“ That ’s because he ’s a brainless git , ”
52109	52121	52107	52107	Ron	99	“ But who cares , we ’ve got what we needed — ”
52122	52130	52132	52132	Hermione	100	“ He is not a brainless git , ”
52142	52156	52107	52107	Ron	99	“ Just because he said you were the best student of the year — ”
52190	52195	52196	52196	she	251	“ Moste Potente Potions ? ”
52215	52225	52226	52226	she	251	“ I was wondering if I could keep it , ”
52230	52236	52238	52238	Ron	99	“ Oh , come on , ”
52252	52270	52238	52238	Ron	99	“ We ’ll get you another autograph . Lockhart’ll sign anything if it stands still long enough . ”
52488	52493	52498	52498	she	100	“ Here it is , ”
52537	52549	52551	52551	Hermione	100	“ This is the most complicated potion I ’ve ever seen , ”
52558	52569	52570	52570	she	100	“ Lacewing flies , leeches , fluxweed , and knotgrass , ”
52582	52651	52570	52570	she	100	“ Well , they ’re easy enough , they ’re in the student store - cupboard , we can help ourselves ... Oooh , look , powdered horn of a bicorn — do n’t know where we ’re going to get that — shredded skin of a boomslang — that ’ll be tricky , too — and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into . ”
52652	52656	52658	52658	Ron	99	“ Excuse me ? ”
52661	52686	52658	52658	Ron	99	“ What d’you mean , a bit of whoever we ’re changing into ? I ’m drinking nothing with Crabbe ’s toenails in it — ”
52697	52717	52691	52691	she	100	“ We do n’t have to worry about that yet , though , because we add those bits last ... ”
52731	52787	52724	52724	Harry	84	“ D’you realize how much we ’re going to have to steal , Hermione ? Shredded skin of a boomslang , that ’s definitely not in the students ’ cupboard . What ’re we going to do , break into Snape ’s private stores ? I do n’t know if this is a good idea ... ”
52796	52810	52811	52811	she	100	“ Well , if you two are going to chicken out , fine , ”
52830	52887	52811	52811	she	100	“ I do n’t want to break rules , you know . I think threatening Muggle - borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion . But if you do n’t want to find out if it ’s Malfoy , I ’ll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in — ”
52888	52907	52909	52909	Ron	99	“ I never thought I ’d see the day when you ’d be persuading us to break rules , ”
52911	52926	52909	52909	Ron	99	“ All right , we ’ll do it . But not toenails , okay ? ”
52927	52938	52940	52940	Harry	84	“ How long will it take to make , anyway ? ”
52952	53001	53036	53036	he	99	“ Well , since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty - one days ... I ’d say it ’d be ready in about a month , if we can get all the ingredients . ”
53002	53006	53008	53008	Ron	99	“ A month ? ”
53010	53026	53008	53008	Ron	99	“ Malfoy could have attacked half the Muggle - borns in the school by then ! ”
53040	53059	53036	53036	he	99	“ But it ’s the best plan we ’ve got , so full steam ahead , I say . ”
53083	53102	53078	53078	Ron	99	“ It ’ll be a lot less hassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow . ”
53294	53302	53303	53303	he	193	“ Slytherin has better brooms than us , ”
53306	53338	53303	53303	he	193	“ No point denying it . But we ’ve got better people on our brooms . We ’ve trained harder than they have , we ’ve been flying in all weathers — ”
53340	53344	53346	53347	George Weasley	111	“ Too true , ”
53349	53358	53346	53347	George Weasley	111	“ I have n’t been properly dry since August ”
53360	53389	53303	53303	he	193	“ — and we ’re going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime , Malfoy , buy his way onto their team . ”
53400	53451	53395	53395	Wood	193	“ It ’ll be down to you , Harry , to show them that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father . Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying , Harry , because we ’ve got to win today , we ’ve got to . ”
53452	53459	53461	53461	Fred	110	“ So no pressure , Harry , ”
53543	53548	53550	53551	Madam Hooch	253	“ On my whistle , ”
53553	53560	53550	53551	Madam Hooch	253	“ Three ... two ... one ... ”
53595	53602	53604	53604	Malfoy	101	“ All right there , Scarhead ? ”
53657	53663	53665	53665	George	111	“ Close one , Harry ! ”
53837	53840	53841	53841	Fred	110	“ Gotcha ! ”
53925	53934	53916	53917	Lee Jordan	153	“ Slytherin lead , sixty points to zero — ”
54003	54015	54016	54016	Fred	110	“ Someone ’s — tampered — with — this — Bludger — ”
54037	54043	54045	54045	George	111	“ We need time out , ”
54098	54104	54106	54106	Wood	193	“ What ’s going on ? ”
54121	54141	54115	54118	Slytherins in the crowd	1253	“ We ’re being flattened . Fred , George , where were you when that Bludger stopped Angelina scoring ? ”
54142	54160	54162	54162	George	111	“ We were twenty feet above her , stopping the other Bludger from murdering Harry , Oliver , ”
54165	54197	54162	54162	George	111	“ Someone ’s fixed it — it wo n’t leave Harry alone . It has n’t gone for anyone else all game . The Slytherins must have done something to it . ”
54198	54224	54226	54226	Wood	193	“ But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch ’s office since our last practice , and there was nothing wrong with them then ... ”
54254	54257	54259	54259	Harry	84	“ Listen , ”
54267	54312	54259	54259	Harry	84	“ with you two flying around me all the time the only way I ’m going to catch the Snitch is if it flies up my sleeve . Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one . ”
54313	54319	54321	54321	Fred	110	“ Do n’t be thick , ”
54323	54331	54321	54321	Fred	110	“ It ’ll take your head off . ”
54341	54348	54350	54351	Alicia Spinnet	198	“ Oliver , this is insane , ”
54354	54375	54350	54351	Alicia Spinnet	198	“ You ca n’t let Harry deal with that thing on his own . Let ’s ask for an inquiry — ”
54376	54390	54392	54392	Harry	84	“ If we stop now , we ’ll have to forfeit the match ! ”
54394	54421	54392	54392	Harry	84	“ And we ’re not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger ! Come on , Oliver , tell them to leave me alone ! ”
54422	54429	54430	54430	George	111	“ This is all your fault , ”
54436	54454	54430	54430	George	111	“ ‘ Get the Snitch or die trying , ’ what a stupid thing to tell him — ”
54461	54467	54468	54468	she	198	“ Ready to resume play ? ”
54483	54487	54488	54488	he	193	“ All right , ”
54491	54514	54488	54488	he	193	“ Fred , George , you heard Harry — leave him alone and let him deal with the Bludger on his own . ”
54697	54705	54707	54707	Malfoy	101	“ Training for the ballet , Potter ? ”
54943	54947	54948	54948	he	84	“ What the — ”
55072	55075	55076	55076	he	84	“ Aha , ”
55080	55085	55076	55076	he	84	“ We ’ve won . ”
55119	55127	55128	55128	he	84	“ Oh , no , not you , ”
55131	55140	55142	55142	Lockhart	206	“ Does n’t know what he ’s saying , ”
55154	55169	55142	55142	Lockhart	206	“ Not to worry , Harry . I ’m about to fix your arm . ”
55170	55173	55175	55175	Harry	84	“ No ! ”
55177	55187	55175	55175	Harry	84	“ I ’ll keep it like this , thanks ... ”
55208	55220	55221	55221	he	84	“ I do n’t want a photo of this , Colin , ”
55225	55231	55233	55233	Lockhart	206	“ Lie back , Harry , ”
55236	55248	55233	55233	Lockhart	206	“ It ’s a simple charm I ’ve used countless times — ”
55249	55261	55263	55263	Harry	84	“ Why ca n’t I just go to the hospital wing ? ”
55268	55275	55277	55279	a muddy Wood	193	“ He should really , Professor , ”
55293	55310	55277	55279	a muddy Wood	193	“ Great capture , Harry , really spectacular , your best yet , I ’d say — ”
55343	55347	55349	55349	Lockhart	206	“ Stand back , ”
55361	55367	55369	55369	Harry	84	“ No — do n’t — ”
55481	55484	55486	55486	Lockhart	206	“ Ah , ”
55488	55561	55486	55486	Lockhart	206	“ Yes . Well , that can sometimes happen . But the point is , the bones are no longer broken . That ’s the thing to bear in mind . So , Harry , just toddle up to the hospital wing — ah , Mr. Weasley , Miss Granger , would you escort him ? — and Madam Pomfrey will be able to — er — tidy you up a bit . ”
55648	55657	55658	55658	she	219	“ You should have come straight to me ! ”
55682	55696	55658	55658	she	219	“ I can mend bones in a second — but growing them back — ”
55697	55708	55710	55710	Harry	84	“ You will be able to , wo n’t you ? ”
55713	55728	55730	55731	Madam Pomfrey	219	“ I ’ll be able to , certainly , but it will be painful , ”
55741	55750	55730	55731	Madam Pomfrey	219	“ You ’ll have to stay the night ... ”
55784	55798	55799	55799	Ron	99	“ How can you stick up for Lockhart now , Hermione , eh ? ”
55815	55826	55799	55799	Ron	99	“ If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked . ”
55827	55834	55836	55836	Hermione	100	“ Anyone can make a mistake , ”
55838	55851	55836	55836	Hermione	100	“ And it does n’t hurt anymore , does it , Harry ? ”
55852	55855	55857	55857	Harry	84	“ No , ”
55863	55873	55857	55857	Harry	84	“ But it does n’t do anything else either . ”
55910	55919	55920	55920	she	219	“ You ’re in for a rough night , ”
55934	55942	55920	55920	she	219	“ Regrowing bones is a nasty business . ”
55996	56002	56004	56004	Ron	99	“ We won , though , ”
56013	56031	56004	56004	Ron	99	“ That was some catch you made . Malfoy ’s face ... he looked ready to kill ... ”
56032	56043	56045	56045	Hermione	100	“ I want to know how he fixed that Bludger , ”
56048	56070	56072	56072	Harry	84	“ We can add that to the list of questions we ’ll ask him when we ’ve taken the Polyjuice Potion , ”
56080	56090	56072	56072	Harry	84	“ I hope it tastes better than this stuff ... ”
56091	56109	56111	56111	Ron	99	“ If it ’s got bits of Slytherins in it ? You ’ve got to be joking , ”
56142	56148	56150	56150	George	111	“ Unbelievable flying , Harry , ”
56152	56184	56150	56150	George	111	“ I ’ve just seen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy . Something about having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing . Malfoy did n’t seem too happy . ”
56226	56246	56218	56219	Madam Pomfrey	219	“ This boy needs rest , he ’s got thirty - three bones to regrow ! Out ! OUT ! ”
56330	56334	56335	56335	he	84	“ Get off ! ”
56342	56345	56335	56335	he	84	“ Dobby ! ”
56375	56383	56384	56384	he	84	“ Harry Potter came back to school , ”
56388	56420	56384	56384	he	84	“ Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter . Ah sir , why did n’t you heed Dobby ? Why did n’t Harry Potter go back home when he missed the train ? ”
56435	56442	56443	56443	he	84	“ What ’re you doing here ? ”
56446	56457	56443	56443	he	84	“ And how did you know I missed the train ? ”
56471	56476	56477	56477	he	84	“ It was you ! ”
56481	56491	56477	56477	he	84	“ You stopped the barrier from letting us through ! ”
56492	56498	56500	56500	Dobby	104	“ Indeed yes , sir , ”
56510	56530	56532	56532	he	104	“ Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward ”
56541	56573	56532	56532	he	104	“ but Dobby did n’t care , sir , for he thought Harry Potter was safe , and never did Dobby dream that Harry Potter would get to school another way ! ”
56586	56618	56532	56532	he	104	“ Dobby was so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back at Hogwarts , he let his master ’s dinner burn ! Such a flogging Dobby never had , sir ... ”
56626	56635	56636	56636	he	104	“ You nearly got Ron and me expelled , ”
56640	56660	56636	56636	he	104	“ You ’d better get lost before my bones come back , Dobby , or I might strangle you . ”
56665	56685	56686	56686	He	104	“ Dobby is used to death threats , sir . Dobby gets them five times a day at home . ”
56715	56724	56725	56725	he	104	“ Why d’you wear that thing , Dobby ? ”
56729	56734	56736	56736	Dobby	104	“ This , sir ? ”
56743	56799	56736	56736	Dobby	104	“ ’ Tis a mark of the house - elf ’s enslavement , sir . Dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes , sir . The family is careful not to pass Dobby even a sock , sir , for then he would be free to leave their house forever . ”
56809	56826	56800	56800	Dobby	104	“ Harry Potter must go home ! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make — ”
56827	56831	56833	56833	Harry	84	“ Your Bludger ? ”
56840	56857	56833	56833	Harry	84	“ What d’you mean , your Bludger ? You made that Bludger try and kill me ? ”
56858	56869	56871	56871	Dobby	104	“ Not kill you , sir , never kill you ! ”
56875	56910	56871	56871	Dobby	104	“ Dobby wants to save Harry Potter ’s life ! Better sent home , grievously injured , than remain here , sir ! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt enough to be sent home ! ”
56911	56918	56920	56920	Harry	84	“ Oh , is that all ? ”
56923	56943	56920	56920	Harry	84	“ I do n’t suppose you ’re going to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces ? ”
56944	56953	56954	56954	Dobby	104	“ Ah , if Harry Potter only knew ! ”
56965	57039	57040	57040	he	104	“ If he knew what he means to us , to the lowly , the enslaved , we dregs of the magical world ! Dobby remembers how it was when He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named was at the height of his powers , sir ! We house - elves were treated like vermin , sir ! Of course , Dobby is still treated like that , sir , ”
57050	57169	57040	57040	he	104	“ But mostly , sir , life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named . Harry Potter survived , and the Dark Lord ’s power was broken , and it was a new dawn , sir , and Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the dark days would never end , sir ... And now , at Hogwarts , terrible things are to happen , are perhaps happening already , and Dobby can not let Harry Potter stay here now that history is to repeat itself , now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once more — ”
57215	57223	57202	57202	he	104	“ Bad Dobby , very bad Dobby ... ”
57224	57233	57234	57234	Harry	84	“ So there is a Chamber of Secrets ? ”
57237	57254	57234	57234	Harry	84	“ And — did you say it ’s been opened before ? Tell me , Dobby ! ”
57272	57291	57255	57255	He	84	“ But I ’m not Muggle - born — how can I be in danger from the Chamber ? ”
57292	57308	57310	57311	the elf	397	“ Ah , sir , ask no more , ask no more of poor Dobby , ”
57320	57364	57310	57311	the elf	397	“ Dark deeds are planned in this place , but Harry Potter must not be here when they happen — go home , Harry Potter , go home . Harry Potter must not meddle in this , sir , ’ tis too dangerous — ”
57365	57372	57373	57373	Harry	84	“ Who is it , Dobby ? ”
57396	57408	57373	57373	Harry	84	“ Who ’s opened it ? Who opened it last time ? ”
57409	57425	57427	57428	the elf	397	“ Dobby ca n’t , sir , Dobby ca n’t , Dobby must n’t tell ! ”
57430	57440	57427	57428	the elf	397	“ Go home , Harry Potter , go home ! ”
57441	57448	57450	57450	Harry	84	“ I ’m not going anywhere ! ”
57453	57478	57450	57450	Harry	84	“ One of my best friends is Muggle - born ; she ’ll be first in line if the Chamber really has been opened — ”
57479	57490	57492	57492	Dobby	104	“ Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends ! ”
57500	57521	57492	57492	Dobby	104	“ So noble ! So valiant ! But he must save himself , he must , Harry Potter must not — ”
57546	57551	57553	57554	the elf	397	“ Dobby must go ! ”
57649	57654	57656	57656	Dumbledore	106	“ Get Madam Pomfrey , ”
57721	57725	57726	57727	Madam Pomfrey	219	“ What happened ? ”
57740	57744	57746	57746	Dumbledore	106	“ Another attack , ”
57748	57756	57746	57746	Dumbledore	106	“ Minerva found him on the stairs . ”
57757	57768	57770	57771	Professor McGonagall	158	“ There was a bunch of grapes next to him , ”
57773	57787	57770	57771	Professor McGonagall	158	“ We think he was trying to sneak up here to visit Potter . ”
57851	57854	57856	57857	Madam Pomfrey	219	“ Petrified ? ”
57859	57862	57864	57865	Professor McGonagall	158	“ Yes , ”
57867	57893	57864	57865	Professor McGonagall	158	“ But I shudder to think ... If Albus had n’t been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate — who knows what might have — ”
57918	57933	57935	57936	Professor McGonagall	158	“ You do n’t think he managed to get a picture of his attacker ? ”
57952	57956	57958	57959	Madam Pomfrey	219	“ Good gracious ! ”
57986	57989	57991	57992	Madam Pomfrey	219	“ Melted , ”
57995	57999	57991	57992	Madam Pomfrey	219	“ All melted ... ”
58000	58008	58009	58010	Professor McGonagall	158	“ What does this mean , Albus ? ”
58014	58018	58020	58020	Dumbledore	107	“ It means , ”
58022	58033	58020	58020	Dumbledore	107	“ that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again . ”
58049	58058	58047	58047	Dumbledore	107	“ But , Albus ... surely ... who ? ”
58059	58066	58068	58068	Dumbledore	107	“ The question is not who , ”
58075	58082	58070	58070	his	107	“ The question is , how ... ”
58184	58189	58190	58190	she	219	“ All in order , ”
58202	58213	58190	58190	she	219	“ When you ’ve finished eating , you may leave . ”
58303	58310	58311	58311	he	120	“ Oh , hello , Harry , ”
58314	58338	58311	58311	he	120	“ Excellent flying yesterday , really excellent . Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup — you earned fifty points ! ”
58339	58351	58353	58353	Harry	84	“ You have n’t seen Ron or Hermione , have you ? ”
58355	58362	58364	58364	Percy	120	“ No , I have n’t , ”
58370	58382	58366	58366	his	120	“ I hope Ron ’s not in another girls ’ toilet ... ”
58446	58451	58452	58452	he	84	“ It ’s me , ”
58487	58490	58491	58491	she	100	“ Harry ! ”
58494	58510	58491	58491	she	100	“ You gave us such a fright — come in — how ’s your arm ? ”
58511	58514	58516	58516	Harry	84	“ Fine , ”
58562	58582	58583	58583	Ron	99	“ We ’d ’ve come to meet you , but we decided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion , ”
58596	58609	58586	58586	Harry	84	“ We ’ve decided this is the safest place to hide it . ”
58622	58648	58619	58619	Hermione	100	“ We already know — we heard Professor McGonagall telling Professor Flitwick this morning . That ’s why we decided we ’d better get going — ”
58649	58663	58665	58665	Ron	99	“ The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy , the better , ”
58667	58693	58665	58665	Ron	99	“ D’you know what I think ? He was in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match , he took it out on Colin . ”
58694	58700	58702	58702	Harry	84	“ There ’s something else , ”
58717	58730	58702	58702	Harry	84	“ Dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night . ”
58763	58773	58774	58774	Hermione	100	“ The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before ? ”
58777	58782	58784	58784	Ron	99	“ This settles it , ”
58790	58850	58784	58784	Ron	99	“ Lucius Malfoy must ’ve opened the Chamber when he was at school here and now he ’s told dear old Draco how to do it . It ’s obvious . Wish Dobby’d told you what kind of monster ’s in there , though . I want to know how come nobody ’s noticed it sneaking around the school . ”
58851	58859	58861	58861	Hermione	100	“ Maybe it can make itself invisible , ”
58872	58897	58861	58861	Hermione	100	“ Or maybe it can disguise itself — pretend to be a suit of armor or something — I ’ve read about Chameleon Ghouls — ”
58898	58906	58908	58908	Ron	99	“ You read too much , Hermione , ”
58931	58946	58947	58947	He	99	“ So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm ... ”
58952	58976	58949	58949	his	99	“ You know what , Harry ? If he does n’t stop trying to save your life he ’s going to kill you . ”
59195	59202	59203	59203	Neville	169	“ They went for Filch first , ”
59211	59221	59203	59203	Neville	169	“ And everyone knows I ’m almost a Squib . ”
59352	59357	59359	59359	Hermione	100	“ What we need , ”
59371	59392	59359	59359	Hermione	100	“ is a diversion . Then one of us can sneak into Snape ’s office and take what we need . ”
59401	59412	59413	59413	Hermione	100	“ I think I ’d better do the actual stealing , ”
59424	59466	59413	59413	Hermione	100	“ You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble , and I ’ve got a clean record . So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so . ”
59588	59591	59571	59571	Harry	84	“ Unfair . ”
59802	59807	59808	59808	Snape	90	“ Silence ! SILENCE ! ”
59811	59833	59808	59808	Snape	90	“ Anyone who has been splashed , come here for a Deflating Draught — when I find out who did this — ”
59945	59955	59956	59956	Snape	90	“ If I ever find out who threw this , ”
59959	59969	59956	59956	Snape	90	“ I shall make sure that person is expelled . ”
60005	60012	60013	60013	Harry	84	“ He knew it was me , ”
60028	60033	60013	60013	Harry	84	“ I could tell . ”
60048	60057	60058	60058	she	100	“ It ’ll be ready in two weeks , ”
60062	60071	60073	60073	Ron	99	“ Snape ca n’t prove it was you , ”
60078	60084	60073	60073	Ron	99	“ What can he do ? ”
60085	60092	60094	60094	Harry	84	“ Knowing Snape , something foul , ”
60156	60164	60166	60166	Seamus	167	“ They ’re starting a Dueling Club ! ”
60168	60190	60166	60166	Seamus	167	“ First meeting tonight ! I would n’t mind dueling lessons ; they might come in handy one of these days ... ”
60191	60202	60204	60204	Ron	99	“ What , you reckon Slytherin ’s monster can duel ? ”
60217	60222	60223	60223	he	99	“ Could be useful , ”
60235	60240	60223	60223	he	99	“ Shall we go ? ”
60314	60323	60325	60325	Hermione	100	“ I wonder who ’ll be teaching us ? ”
60334	60354	60325	60325	Hermione	100	“ Someone told me Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young — maybe it ’ll be him . ”
60355	60363	60364	60364	Harry	84	“ As long as it ’s not — ”
60410	60429	60401	60401	Lockhart	206	“ Gather round , gather round ! Can everyone see me ? Can you all hear me ? Excellent !
60430	60475	60401	60401	Lockhart	206	“ Now , Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club , to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions — for full details , see my published works .
60476	60486	60488	60488	Lockhart	206	“ Let me introduce my assistant , Professor Snape , ”
60495	60553	60488	60488	Lockhart	206	“ He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin . Now , I do n’t want any of you youngsters to worry — you ’ll still have your Potions master when I ’m through with him , never fear ! ”
60554	60567	60568	60568	Ron	99	“ Would n’t it be good if they finished each other off ? ”
60657	60673	60674	60674	Lockhart	206	“ As you see , we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position , ”
60680	60706	60674	60674	Lockhart	206	“ On the count of three , we will cast our first spells . Neither of us will be aiming to kill , of course . ”
60707	60715	60716	60716	Harry	84	“ I would n’t bet on that , ”
60725	60732	60722	60722	his	90	“ One — two — three — ”
60752	60755	60749	60749	Snape	90	“ Expelliarmus ! ”
60809	60818	60819	60819	she	100	“ Do you think he ’s all right ? ”
60825	60829	60831	60831	Harry	84	“ Who cares ? ”
60858	60866	60867	60867	he	206	“ Well , there you have it ! ”
60876	60963	60867	60867	he	206	“ That was a Disarming Charm — as you see , I ’ve lost my wand — ah , thank you , Miss Brown — yes , an excellent idea to show them that , Professor Snape , but if you do n’t mind my saying so , it was very obvious what you were about to do . If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy — however , I felt it would be instructive to let them see ... ”
60978	61008	60975	60975	he	206	“ Enough demonstrating ! I ’m going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs . Professor Snape , if you ’d like to help me — ”
61036	61048	61049	61049	he	90	“ Time to split up the dream team , I think , ”
61052	61062	61049	61049	he	90	“ Weasley , you can partner Finnigan . Potter — ”
61069	61076	61078	61078	Snape	90	“ I do n’t think so , ”
61083	61114	61078	61078	Snape	90	“ Mr. Malfoy , come over here . Let ’s see what you make of the famous Potter . And you , Miss Granger — you can partner Miss Bulstrode . ”
61165	61170	61172	61172	Lockhart	206	“ Face your partners ! ”
61179	61183	61172	61172	Lockhart	206	“ And bow ! ”
61200	61206	61208	61208	Lockhart	206	“ Wands at the ready ! ”
61210	61243	61208	61208	Lockhart	206	“ When I count to three , cast your charms to Disarm your opponents — only to disarm them — we do n’t want any accidents — one ... two ... three — ”
61256	61258	61251	61251	Malfoy	114	“ two ”
61308	61311	61298	61298	Harry	84	“ Rictusempra ! ”
61329	61335	61336	61336	Lockhart	206	“ I said Disarm only ! ”
61415	61418	61406	61406	his	114	“ Tarantallegra ! ”
61440	61445	61447	61447	Lockhart	206	“ Stop ! Stop ! ”
61454	61458	61459	61459	he	90	“ Finite Incantatem ! ”
61574	61579	61581	61581	Lockhart	206	“ Dear , dear , ”
61596	61622	61581	61581	Lockhart	206	“ Up you go , Macmillan ... Careful there , Miss Fawcett ... Pinch it hard , it ’ll stop bleeding in a second , Boot —
61623	61637	61639	61639	Lockhart	206	“ I think I ’d better teach you how to block unfriendly spells , ”
61665	61683	61653	61653	Snape	90	“ Let ’s have a volunteer pair — Longbottom and Finch - Fletchley , how about you — ”
61684	61692	61694	61694	Snape	90	“ A bad idea , Professor Lockhart , ”
61705	61734	61694	61694	Snape	90	“ Longbottom causes devastation with the simplest spells . We ’ll be sending what ’s left of Finch - Fletchley up to the hospital wing in a matchbox . ”
61744	61751	61753	61753	Snape	90	“ How about Malfoy and Potter ? ”
61759	61763	61765	61765	Lockhart	206	“ Excellent idea ! ”
61787	61792	61794	61794	Lockhart	206	“ Now , Harry , ”
61796	61809	61794	61794	Lockhart	206	“ When Draco points his wand at you , you do this . ”
61839	61849	61831	61831	Lockhart	206	“ Whoops — my wand is a little overexcited — ”
61880	61892	61871	61871	Harry	84	“ Professor , could you show me that blocking thing again ? ”
61893	61896	61898	61898	Malfoy	101	“ Scared ? ”
61908	61912	61914	61914	Harry	84	“ You wish , ”
61931	61940	61923	61923	Lockhart	206	“ Just do what I did , Harry ! ”
61941	61948	61923	61923	Lockhart	206	“ What , drop my wand ? ”
61955	61964	61965	61965	he	206	“ Three — two — one — go ! ”
61976	61979	61970	61970	his	101	“ Serpensortia ! ”
62032	62039	62041	62041	Snape	90	“ Do n’t move , Potter , ”
62061	62069	62041	62041	Snape	90	“ I ’ll get rid of it ... ”
62070	62074	62076	62076	Lockhart	206	“ Allow me ! ”
62189	62194	62181	62181	he	84	“ Leave him alone ! ”
62282	62292	62293	62293	he	84	“ What do you think you ’re playing at ? ”
62387	62391	62393	62393	Ron	99	“ Come on , ”
62400	62406	62393	62393	Ron	99	“ Move — come on — ”
62487	62500	62478	62478	Ron	99	“ You ’re a Parselmouth . Why did n’t you tell us ? ”
62501	62507	62509	62509	Harry	84	“ I ’m a what ? ”
62511	62515	62517	62517	Ron	99	“ A Parselmouth ! ”
62519	62526	62517	62517	Ron	99	“ You can talk to snakes ! ”
62527	62531	62533	62533	Harry	84	“ I know , ”
62535	62600	62533	62533	Harry	84	“ I mean , that ’s only the second time I ’ve ever done it . I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once — long story — but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to — that was before I knew I was a wizard — ”
62601	62613	62614	62614	Ron	99	“ A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil ? ”
62618	62621	62623	62623	Harry	84	“ So ? ”
62625	62636	62623	62623	Harry	84	“ I bet loads of people here can do it . ”
62637	62645	62647	62647	Ron	99	“ Oh , no they ca n’t , ”
62649	62664	62647	62647	Ron	99	“ It ’s not a very common gift . Harry , this is bad . ”
62665	62670	62672	62672	Harry	84	“ What ’s bad ? ”
62680	62701	62672	62672	Harry	84	“ What ’s wrong with everyone ? Listen , if I had n’t told that snake not to attack Justin — ”
62702	62713	62647	62647	Ron	99	“ Oh , that ’s what you said to it ? ”
62714	62727	62672	62672	Harry	84	“ What d’you mean ? You were there — you heard me — ”
62728	62735	62737	62737	Ron	99	“ I heard you speaking Parseltongue , ”
62739	62774	62737	62737	Ron	99	“ Snake language . You could have been saying anything — no wonder Justin panicked , you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something — it was creepy , you know — ”
62780	62807	62775	62775	Harry	84	“ I spoke a different language ? But — I did n’t realize — how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it ? ”
62834	62854	62855	62855	he	99	“ D’you want to tell me what ’s wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off Justin ’s head ? ”
62858	62880	62855	62855	he	99	“ What does it matter how I did it as long as Justin does n’t have to join the Headless Hunt ? ”
62881	62885	62887	62887	Hermione	100	“ It matters , ”
62897	62925	62887	62887	Hermione	100	“ because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for . That ’s why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent . ”
62932	62935	62937	62937	Ron	99	“ Exactly , ”
62939	62964	62937	62937	Ron	99	“ And now the whole school ’s going to think you ’re his great - great - great - great - grandson or something — ”
62965	62971	62973	62973	Harry	84	“ But I ’m not , ”
62984	62993	62995	62995	Hermione	100	“ You ’ll find that hard to prove , ”
62997	63015	62995	62995	Hermione	100	“ He lived about a thousand years ago ; for all we know , you could be . ”
63320	63328	63330	63330	Hermione	100	“ For heaven ’s sake , Harry , ”
63353	63366	63335	63339	one of Ron ’s bishops	1382	“ Go and find Justin if it ’s so important to you . ”
63581	63585	63586	63588	a stout boy	1392	“ So anyway , ”
63592	63690	63586	63588	a stout boy	1392	“ I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory . I mean to say , if Potter ’s marked him down as his next victim , it ’s best if he keeps a low profile for a while . Of course , Justin ’s been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle - born . Justin actually told him he ’d been down for Eton . That ’s not the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin ’s heir on the loose , is it ? ”
63691	63703	63705	63709	a girl with blonde pigtails	1393	“ You definitely think it is Potter , then , Ernie ? ”
63712	63715	63717	63719	the stout boy	1394	“ Hannah , ”
63722	63761	63717	63719	the stout boy	1394	“ he ’s a Parselmouth . Everyone knows that ’s the mark of a Dark wizard . Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes ? They called Slytherin himself Serpent - tongue . ”
63775	63849	63771	63771	Ernie	262	“ Remember what was written on the wall ? Enemies of the Heir , Beware . Potter had some sort of run - in with Filch . Next thing we know , Filch ’s cat ’s attacked . That first year , Creevey , was annoying Potter at the Quidditch match , taking pictures of him while he was lying in the mud . Next thing we know — Creevey ’s been attacked . ”
63850	63859	63861	63861	Hannah	265	“ He always seems so nice , though , ”
63864	63892	63861	63861	Hannah	265	“ and , well , he ’s the one who made You - Know - Who disappear . He ca n’t be all bad , can he ? ”
63917	63969	63970	63970	He	262	“ No one knows how he survived that attack by You - Know - Who . I mean to say , he was only a baby when it happened . He should have been blasted into smithereens . Only a really powerful Dark wizard could have survived a curse like that . ”
63986	64025	63972	63972	his	262	“ That ’s probably why You - Know - Who wanted to kill him in the first place . Did n’t want another Dark Lord competing with him . I wonder what other powers Potter ’s been hiding ? ”
64094	64097	64099	64099	Harry	84	“ Hello , ”
64101	64111	64099	64099	Harry	84	“ I ’m looking for Justin Finch - Fletchley . ”
64129	64137	64139	64139	Ernie	262	“ What do you want with him ? ”
64145	64162	64164	64164	Harry	84	“ I wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the Dueling Club , ”
64181	64192	64166	64166	Ernie	262	“ We were all there . We saw what happened . ”
64193	64209	64211	64211	Harry	84	“ Then you noticed that after I spoke to it , the snake backed off ? ”
64213	64218	64220	64220	Ernie	262	“ All I saw , ”
64231	64243	64224	64224	he	262	“ was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake toward Justin . ”
64244	64253	64254	64254	Harry	84	“ I did n’t chase it at him ! ”
64263	64271	64254	64254	Harry	84	“ It did n’t even touch him ! ”
64272	64280	64282	64282	Ernie	262	“ It was a very near miss , ”
64284	64293	64294	64294	he	84	“ And in case you ’re getting ideas , ”
64298	64329	64294	64294	he	84	“ I might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my blood ’s as pure as anyone ’s , so — ”
64330	64343	64345	64345	Harry	84	“ I do n’t care what sort of blood you ’ve got ! ”
64348	64359	64345	64345	Harry	84	“ Why would I want to attack Muggle - borns ? ”
64360	64372	64374	64374	Ernie	262	“ I ’ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with , ”
64377	64392	64394	64394	Harry	84	“ It ’s not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them , ”
64396	64406	64394	64394	Harry	84	“ I ’d like to see you try it . ”
64481	64488	64489	64489	Harry	84	“ Oh , hello , Hagrid , ”
64545	64552	64553	64553	he	91	“ All righ ’ , Harry ? ”
64565	64573	64553	64553	he	91	“ Why are n’t yeh in class ? ”
64574	64577	64579	64579	Harry	84	“ Canceled , ”
64584	64592	64579	64579	Harry	84	“ What ’re you doing in here ? ”
64600	64607	64608	64608	he	91	“ Second one killed this term , ”
64611	64641	64608	64608	he	91	“ It ’s either foxes or a Blood - Suckin ’ Bugbear , an ’ I need the headmaster ’s permission ter put a charm around the hen coop . ”
64658	64674	64642	64642	He	91	“ Yeh sure yeh’re all righ ’ ? Yeh look all hot an ’ bothered — ”
64696	64701	64702	64702	he	84	“ It ’s nothing , ”
64705	64728	64702	64702	he	84	“ I ’d better get going , Hagrid , it ’s Transfiguration next and I ’ve got to pick up my books . ”
64745	64769	64739	64739	Ernie	262	“ Justin ’s been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle - born ... ”
65075	65084	65086	65086	Peeves	225	“ Why , it ’s potty wee Potter ! ”
65099	65111	65086	65086	Peeves	225	“ What ’s Potter up to ? Why ’s Potter lurking — ”
65152	65174	65148	65148	him	84	“ ATTACK ! ATTACK ! ANOTHER ATTACK ! NO MORTAL OR GHOST IS SAFE ! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES ! ATTAAAACK ! ”
65304	65310	65311	65311	Ernie	262	“ Caught in the act ! ”
65326	65333	65335	65336	Professor McGonagall	158	“ That will do , Macmillan ! ”
65376	65390	65371	65371	Peeves	225	“ Oh , Potter , you rotter , oh , what have you done ,
65404	65405	65371	65371	Peeves	225	” .
65406	65413	65415	65416	Professor McGonagall	158	“ That ’s enough , Peeves ! ”
65516	65522	65523	65523	she	158	“ This way , Potter , ”
65526	65529	65531	65531	Harry	84	“ Professor , ”
65535	65542	65531	65531	Harry	84	“ I swear I did n’t — ”
65543	65553	65555	65556	Professor McGonagall	158	“ This is out of my hands , Potter , ”
65578	65582	65583	65583	she	158	“ Lemon drop ! ”
66032	66041	66120	66120	Harry	84	“ Bee in your bonnet , Harry Potter ? ”
66042	66047	66048	66048	Harry	84	“ Er , yes , ”
66051	66064	66048	66048	Harry	84	“ Er — sorry to bother you — I wanted to ask — ”
66065	66079	66120	66120	Harry	84	“ You ’ve been wondering whether I put you in the right House , ”
66085	66103	66120	66120	Harry	84	“ Yes ... you were particularly difficult to place . But I stand by what I said before ”
66110	66119	66120	66120	Harry	84	“ you would have done well in Slytherin — ”
66159	66164	66165	66165	he	84	“ You ’re wrong , ”
66381	66384	66385	66385	Harry	84	“ Professor , ”
66388	66403	66385	66385	Harry	84	“ Your bird — I could n’t do anything — he just caught fire — ”
66412	66418	66419	66419	he	106	“ About time , too , ”
66422	66442	66419	66419	he	106	“ He ’s been looking dreadful for days ; I ’ve been telling him to get a move on . ”
66454	66484	66443	66443	He	106	“ Fawkes is a phoenix , Harry . Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes . Watch him ... ”
66517	66532	66534	66534	Dumbledore	106	“ It ’s a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day , ”
66542	66584	66534	66534	Dumbledore	106	“ He ’s really very handsome most of the time , wonderful red and gold plumage . Fascinating creatures , phoenixes . They can carry immensely heavy loads , their tears have healing powers , and they make highly faithful pets . ”
66684	66693	66695	66695	Hagrid	91	“ It wasn ’ Harry , Professor Dumbledore ! ”
66698	66719	66695	66695	Hagrid	91	“ I was talkin ’ ter him seconds before that kid was found , he never had time , sir — ”
66744	66771	66727	66727	Hagrid	91	“ — it ca n’t ’ve bin him , I ’ll swear it in front o ’ the Ministry o ’ Magic if I have to — ”
66772	66777	66727	66727	Hagrid	91	“ Hagrid , I — ”
66778	66793	66727	66727	Hagrid	91	“ — yeh’ve got the wrong boy , sir , I know Harry never — ”
66794	66797	66799	66799	Dumbledore	106	“ Hagrid ! ”
66802	66813	66799	66799	Dumbledore	106	“ I do not think that Harry attacked those people . ”
66814	66817	66819	66819	Hagrid	91	“ Oh , ”
66829	66840	66819	66819	Hagrid	91	“ Right . I ’ll wait outside then , Headmaster . ”
66848	66859	66860	66860	Harry	84	“ You do n’t think it was me , Professor ? ”
66872	66881	66883	66883	Dumbledore	106	“ No , Harry , I do n’t , ”
66892	66902	66886	66886	his	106	“ But I still want to talk to you . ”
66919	66938	66939	66939	he	106	“ I must ask you , Harry , whether there is anything you ’d like to tell me , ”
66943	66948	66939	66939	he	106	“ Anything at all . ”
66963	66971	66960	66960	Malfoy	101	“ You ’ll be next , Mudbloods ! ”
67003	67023	66999	66999	Ron	99	“ Hearing voices no one else can hear is n’t a good sign , even in the Wizarding world . ”
67050	67053	67055	67055	Harry	84	“ No , ”
67057	67065	67055	67055	Harry	84	“ There is n’t anything , Professor ... ”
67147	67160	67161	67161	Ron	99	“ At this rate , we ’ll be the only ones left , ”
67167	67187	67161	67161	Ron	99	“ Us , Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle . What a jolly holiday it ’s going to be . ”
67287	67302	67270	67270	They	1453	“ Make way for the Heir of Slytherin , seriously evil wizard coming through ... ”
67311	67319	67320	67320	he	120	“ It is not a laughing matter , ”
67324	67335	67337	67337	Fred	110	“ Oh , get out of the way , Percy , ”
67339	67346	67337	67337	Fred	110	“ Harry ’s in a hurry . ”
67347	67368	67370	67370	George	111	“ Yeah , he ’s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant , ”
67382	67388	67389	67389	she	128	“ Oh , do n’t , ”
67476	67490	67492	67492	Ron	99	“ It ’s because he ’s bursting to say it ’s really him , ”
67495	67519	67492	67492	Ron	99	“ You know how he hates anyone beating him at anything , and you ’re getting all the credit for his dirty work . ”
67520	67525	67527	67527	Hermione	100	“ Not for long , ”
67533	67554	67527	67527	Hermione	100	“ The Polyjuice Potion ’s nearly ready . We ’ll be getting the truth out of him any day now . ”
67739	67743	67744	67744	she	100	“ Wake up , ”
67756	67768	67770	67770	Ron	99	“ Hermione — you ’re not supposed to be in here — ”
67779	67787	67789	67789	Hermione	100	“ Merry Christmas to you , too , ”
67796	67817	67789	67789	Hermione	100	“ I ’ve been up for nearly an hour , adding more lacewings to the potion . It ’s ready . ”
67826	67831	67818	67818	Harry	84	“ Are you sure ? ”
67832	67835	67837	67837	Hermione	100	“ Positive , ”
67859	67875	67845	67845	she	100	“ If we ’re going to do it , I say it should be tonight . ”
67895	67898	67900	67900	Harry	84	“ Hello , ”
67909	67917	67900	67900	Harry	84	“ Are you speaking to me again ? ”
68227	68230	68209	68209	Percy	120	“ Pinhead , ”
68311	68325	68327	68327	Hermione	100	“ We still need a bit of the people you ’re changing into , ”
68347	68403	68336	68336	she	100	“ And obviously , it ’ll be best if you can get something of Crabbe ’s and Goyle ’s ; they ’re Malfoy ’s best friends , he ’ll tell them anything . And we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle ca n’t burst in on us while we ’re interrogating him .
68404	68413	68414	68414	she	100	“ I ’ve got it all worked out , ”
68436	68495	68428	68428	She	100	“ I ’ve filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught . All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them . You know how greedy they are , they ’re bound to eat them . Once they ’re asleep , pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet . ”
68505	68513	68498	68498	Ron	99	“ Hermione , I do n’t think — ”
68514	68521	68523	68523	Hermione	100	“ That could go seriously wrong — ”
68540	68554	68555	68555	she	100	“ The potion will be useless without Crabbe ’s and Goyle ’s hair , ”
68559	68571	68555	68555	she	100	“ You do want to investigate Malfoy , do n’t you ? ”
68572	68581	68583	68583	Harry	84	“ Oh , all right , all right , ”
68585	68598	68583	68583	Harry	84	“ But what about you ? Whose hair are you ripping out ? ”
68599	68606	68608	68608	Hermione	100	“ I ’ve already got mine ! ”
68628	68678	68608	68608	Hermione	100	“ Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club ? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me ! And she ’s gone home for Christmas — so I ’ll just have to tell the Slytherins I ’ve decided to come back . ”
68703	68719	68692	68692	Ron	99	“ Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong ? ”
68818	68825	68826	68826	Ron	99	“ How thick can you get ? ”
69018	69021	69011	69011	Ron	99	“ Hermione ? ”
69064	69070	69071	69071	Hermione	100	“ Did you get them ? ”
69082	69096	69097	69097	Hermione	100	“ Good . And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry , ”
69106	69119	69097	69097	Hermione	100	“ You ’ll need bigger sizes once you ’re Crabbe and Goyle . ”
69144	69154	69156	69156	Hermione	100	“ I ’m sure I ’ve done everything right , ”
69168	69197	69156	69156	Hermione	100	“ It looks like the book says it should ... once we ’ve drunk it , we ’ll have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves . ”
69198	69202	69203	69203	Ron	99	“ Now what ? ”
69206	69218	69203	69203	Ron	99	“ We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs . ”
69278	69286	69288	69288	Ron	99	“ Urgh — essence of Millicent Bulstrode , ”
69295	69301	69288	69288	Ron	99	“ Bet it tastes disgusting . ”
69302	69308	69310	69310	Hermione	100	“ Add yours , then , ”
69355	69359	69361	69361	Harry	84	“ Hang on , ”
69371	69401	69363	69363	Ron	99	“ We ’d better not all drink them in here ... Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we wo n’t fit . And Millicent Bulstrode ’s no pixie . ”
69402	69406	69408	69408	Ron	99	“ Good thinking , ”
69414	69421	69408	69408	Ron	99	“ We ’ll take separate stalls . ”
69440	69443	69444	69444	he	84	“ Ready ? ”
69447	69450	69452	69452	Ron	99	“ Ready , ”
69459	69466	69455	69455	Hermione	100	“ One — two — three — ”
69772	69778	69765	69765	he	84	“ Are you two okay ? ”
69791	69794	69800	69800	Crabbe	186	“ Yeah , ”
69877	69882	69884	69884	Ron	99	“ This is unbelievable , ”
69896	69899	69884	69884	Ron	99	“ Unbelievable . ”
69900	69907	69909	69909	Harry	84	“ We ’d better get going , ”
69923	69948	69909	69909	Harry	84	“ We ’ve still got to find out where the Slytherin common room is . I only hope we can find someone to follow ... ”
69960	69974	69949	69949	Ron	99	“ You do n’t know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking . ”
69982	69991	69975	69975	He	99	“ C’m on , we need to go — ”
70000	70021	70070	70070	Ron	99	“ I — I do n’t think I ’m going to come after all . You go on without me . ”
70022	70042	70070	70070	Ron	99	“ Hermione , we know Millicent Bulstrode ’s ugly , no one ’s going to know it ’s you — ”
70043	70066	70070	70070	Ron	99	“ No — really — I do n’t think I ’ll come . You two hurry up , you ’re wasting time — ”
70074	70081	70083	70083	Ron	99	“ That looks more like Goyle , ”
70085	70100	70083	70083	Ron	99	“ That ’s how he looks every time a teacher asks him a question . ”
70101	70108	70110	70110	Harry	84	“ Hermione , are you okay ? ”
70115	70125	70083	70083	Ron	99	“ Fine — I ’m fine — go on — ”
70142	70153	70154	70154	he	84	“ We ’ll meet you back here , all right ? ”
70179	70188	70189	70189	Harry	84	“ Do n’t swing your arms like that , ”
70194	70197	70154	70154	he	84	“ Eh ? ”
70198	70206	70192	70192	Ron	99	“ Crabbe holds them sort of stiff ... ”
70207	70212	70154	70154	he	84	“ How ’s this ? ”
70213	70220	70192	70192	Ron	99	“ Yeah , that ’s better ... ”
70251	70255	70257	70257	Harry	84	“ Any ideas ? ”
70259	70271	70273	70273	Ron	99	“ The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there , ”
70303	70307	70309	70309	Ron	99	“ Excuse me , ”
70316	70327	70309	70309	Ron	99	“ We ’ve forgotten the way to our common room . ”
70328	70334	70336	70337	the girl	1501	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
70340	70350	70336	70337	the girl	1501	“ Our common room ? I ’m a Ravenclaw . ”
70454	70457	70459	70459	Ron	99	“ Ha ! ”
70462	70470	70459	70459	Ron	99	“ There ’s one of them now ! ”
70501	70509	70511	70511	Ron	99	“ What ’re you doing down here ? ”
70519	70522	70523	70523	he	120	“ That , ”
70527	70542	70523	70523	he	120	“ is none of your business . It ’s Crabbe , is n’t it ? ”
70543	70550	70552	70552	Ron	99	“ Wh — oh , yeah , ”
70554	70563	70565	70565	Percy	120	“ Well , get off to your dormitories , ”
70568	70582	70565	70565	Percy	120	“ It ’s not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days . ”
70583	70587	70588	70588	Ron	99	“ You are , ”
70592	70595	70597	70597	Percy	120	“ I , ”
70603	70615	70600	70600	himself	120	“ am a prefect . Nothing ’s about to attack me . ”
70648	70653	70654	70654	he	101	“ There you are , ”
70661	70692	70654	70654	he	101	“ Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this time ? I ’ve been looking for you ; I want to show you something really funny . ”
70699	70710	70711	70711	he	101	“ And what ’re you doing down here , Weasley ? ”
70718	70732	70733	70733	he	120	“ You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect ! ”
70736	70744	70733	70733	he	120	“ I do n’t like your attitude ! ”
70788	70793	70776	70776	Malfoy	101	“ That Peter Weasley — ”
70794	70797	70798	70798	Ron	99	“ Percy , ”
70803	70806	70808	70808	Malfoy	101	“ Whatever , ”
70810	70846	70808	70808	Malfoy	101	“ I ’ve noticed him sneaking around a lot lately . And I bet I know what he ’s up to . He thinks he ’s going to catch Slytherin ’s heir single - handed . ”
70874	70882	70883	70883	he	101	“ What ’s the new password again ? ”
70888	70891	70893	70893	Harry	84	“ Er — ”
70895	70904	70906	70906	Malfoy	101	“ Oh , yeah — pure - blood ! ”
70988	70992	70994	70994	Malfoy	101	“ Wait here , ”
71014	71031	70994	70994	Malfoy	101	“ I ’ll go and get it — my father ’s just sent it to me — ”
71078	71086	71087	71087	he	101	“ That ’ll give you a laugh , ”
71191	71200	71201	71202	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute , ”
71207	71228	71201	71202	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately . ”
71254	71257	71259	71259	Malfoy	114	“ Well ? ”
71270	71279	71262	71262	Harry	84	“ Do n’t you think it ’s funny ? ”
71280	71285	71287	71287	Harry	84	“ Ha , ha , ”
71290	71310	71312	71312	Malfoy	114	“ Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them , ”
71315	71330	71312	71312	Malfoy	114	“ You ’d never know the Weasleys were purebloods , the way they behave . ”
71346	71355	71357	71357	Malfoy	114	“ What ’s up with you , Crabbe ? ”
71359	71362	71363	71363	Ron	99	“ Stomachache , ”
71366	71385	71387	71387	Malfoy	114	“ Well , go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick from me , ”
71391	71409	71410	71410	he	114	“ You know , I ’m surprised the Daily Prophet has n’t reported all these attacks yet , ”
71415	71474	71410	71410	he	114	“ I suppose Dumbledore ’s trying to hush it all up . He ’ll be sacked if it does n’t stop soon . Father ’s always said old Dumbledore ’s the worst thing that ’s ever happened to this place . He loves Muggle - borns . A decent headmaster would never’ve let slime like that Creevey in . ”
71493	71522	71491	71491	Colin	184	“ ‘ Potter , can I have your picture , Potter ? Can I have your autograph ? Can I lick your shoes , please , Potter ? ’ ”
71534	71543	71523	71523	He	114	“ What ’s the matter with you two ? ”
71572	71581	71583	71583	Malfoy	114	“ Saint Potter , the Mudbloods ’ friend , ”
71586	71620	71583	71583	Malfoy	114	“ He ’s another one with no proper wizard feeling , or he would n’t go around with that jumped - up Granger Mudblood . And people think he ’s Slytherin ’s heir ! ”
71644	71653	71655	71655	Malfoy	114	“ I wish I knew who it is , ”
71658	71664	71655	71655	Malfoy	114	“ I could help them . ”
71694	71706	71687	71687	Harry	84	“ You must have some idea who ’s behind it all ... ”
71707	71726	71728	71728	Malfoy	114	“ You know I have n’t , Goyle , how many times do I have to tell you ? ”
71730	71836	71837	71837	he	114	“ And Father wo n’t tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either . Of course , it was fifty years ago , so it was before his time , but he knows all about it , and he says that it was all kept quiet and it ’ll look suspicious if I know too much about it . But I know one thing — last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened , a Mudblood died . So I bet it ’s a matter of time before one of them ’s killed this time ... I hope it ’s Granger , ”
71874	71889	71865	71865	Harry	84	“ D’you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught ? ”
71890	71901	71903	71903	Malfoy	114	“ Oh , yeah ... whoever it was was expelled , ”
71905	71913	71903	71903	Malfoy	114	“ They ’re probably still in Azkaban . ”
71914	71917	71919	71919	Harry	84	“ Azkaban ? ”
71923	71932	71934	71934	Malfoy	114	“ Azkaban — the wizard prison , Goyle , ”
71942	71957	71934	71934	Malfoy	114	“ Honestly , if you were any slower , you ’d be going backward . ”
71967	72034	71958	71958	He	99	“ Father says to keep my head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it . He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth , but not to get mixed up in it . Of course , he ’s got a lot on his plate at the moment . You know the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week ? ”
72049	72052	72054	72054	Malfoy	114	“ Yeah ... ”
72056	72092	72054	72054	Malfoy	114	“ Luckily , they did n’t find much . Father ’s got some very valuable Dark Arts stuff . But luckily , we ’ve got our own secret chamber under the drawing - room floor — ”
72093	72096	72098	72098	Ron	99	“ Ho ! ”
72163	72169	72170	72170	Ron	99	“ Medicine for my stomach , ”
72286	72298	72299	72299	Ron	99	“ Well , it was n’t a complete waste of time , ”
72309	72345	72299	72299	Ron	99	“ I know we still have n’t found out who ’s doing the attacks , but I ’m going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the Malfoys ’ drawing room . ”
72377	72391	72367	72367	Ron	99	“ Hermione , come out , we ’ve got loads to tell you — ”
72392	72396	72397	72397	Hermione	100	“ Go away ! ”
72408	72414	72416	72416	Ron	99	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
72418	72431	72416	72416	Ron	99	“ You must be back to normal by now , we are — ”
72451	72459	72460	72460	she	100	“ Ooooooh , wait till you see , ”
72463	72468	72460	72460	she	100	“ It ’s awful — ”
72489	72494	72496	72496	Ron	99	“ What ’s up ? ”
72499	72510	72496	72496	Ron	99	“ Have you still got Millicent ’s nose or something ? ”
72548	72557	72558	72558	she	100	“ It was a c - cat hair ! ”
72561	72588	72558	72558	she	100	“ M - Millicent Bulstrode m - must have a cat ! And the p - potion is n’t supposed to be used for animal transformations ! ”
72589	72594	72596	72596	Ron	99	“ Uh - oh , ”
72598	72606	72608	72608	Myrtle	230	“ You ’ll be teased something dreadful , ”
72611	72618	72620	72620	Harry	84	“ It ’s okay , Hermione , ”
72623	72642	72620	72620	Harry	84	“ We ’ll take you up to the hospital wing . Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions ... ”
72668	72680	72656	72657	Moaning Myrtle	230	“ Wait till everyone finds out you ’ve got a tail ! ”
72792	72807	72809	72809	Ron	99	“ If I ’d sprouted whiskers , I ’d take a break from work , ”
72824	72839	72841	72841	Hermione	100	“ Do n’t be silly , Ron , I ’ve got to keep up , ”
72871	72883	72884	72884	she	100	“ I do n’t suppose you ’ve got any new leads ? ”
72899	72902	72904	72904	Harry	84	“ Nothing , ”
72907	72916	72918	72918	Ron	99	“ I was so sure it was Malfoy , ”
72926	72931	72933	72933	Harry	84	“ What ’s that ? ”
72947	72954	72956	72956	Hermione	100	“ Just a get well card , ”
72988	73040	72975	72975	He	99	“ To Miss Granger , wishing you a speedy recovery , from your concerned teacher , Professor Gilderoy Lockhart , Order of Merlin , Third Class , Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League , and five - time winner of Witch Weekly ’s Most - Charming - Smile Award . ”
73049	73058	73041	73041	Ron	99	“ You sleep with this under your pillow ? ”
73076	73090	73091	73091	Ron	99	“ Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you ’ve ever met , or what ? ”
73170	73175	73176	73176	Harry	84	“ That ’s Filch , ”
73194	73205	73207	73207	Ron	99	“ You do n’t think someone else ’s been attacked ? ”
73227	73262	73218	73218	Filch	212	“ — even more work for me ! Mopping all night , like I have n’t got enough to do ! No , this is the final straw , I ’m going to Dumbledore — ”
73375	73383	73385	73385	Ron	99	“ Now what ’s up with her ? ”
73387	73394	73396	73396	Harry	84	“ Let ’s go and see , ”
73484	73491	73493	73493	Harry	84	“ What ’s up , Myrtle ? ”
73495	73500	73502	73502	Myrtle	230	“ Who ’s that ? ”
73505	73514	73502	73502	Myrtle	230	“ Come to throw something else at me ? ”
73524	73533	73515	73515	Harry	84	“ Why would I throw something at you ? ”
73534	73540	73541	73541	Myrtle	230	“ Do n’t ask me , ”
73561	73584	73541	73541	Myrtle	230	“ Here I am , minding my own business , and someone thinks it ’s funny to throw a book at me ... ”
73585	73599	73601	73601	Harry	84	“ But it ca n’t hurt you if someone throws something at you , ”
73605	73621	73601	73601	Harry	84	“ I mean , it ’d just go right through you , would n’t it ? ”
73636	73690	73629	73629	Myrtle	230	“ Let ’s all throw books at Myrtle , because she ca n’t feel it ! Ten points if you can get it through her stomach ! Fifty points if it goes through her head ! Well , ha , ha , ha ! What a lovely game , I do n’t think ! ”
73691	73700	73702	73702	Harry	84	“ Who threw it at you , anyway ? ”
73704	73735	73737	73737	Myrtle	230	“ I do n’t know ... I was just sitting in the U - bend , thinking about death , and it fell right through the top of my head , ”
73743	73754	73737	73737	Myrtle	230	“ It ’s over there , it got washed out ... ”
73812	73815	73817	73817	Harry	84	“ What ? ”
73819	73824	73826	73826	Ron	99	“ Are you crazy ? ”
73828	73834	73826	73826	Ron	99	“ It could be dangerous . ”
73835	73838	73840	73840	Harry	84	“ Dangerous ? ”
73844	73855	73840	73840	Harry	84	“ Come off it , how could it be dangerous ? ”
73856	73862	73864	73864	Ron	99	“ You ’d be surprised , ”
73874	73954	73864	73864	Ron	99	“ Some of the books the Ministry ’s confiscated — Dad ’s told me — there was one that burned your eyes out . And everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives . And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading ! You just had to wander around with your nose in it , trying to do everything one - handed . And — ”
73955	73965	73967	73967	Harry	84	“ All right , I ’ve got the point , ”
73981	73995	73996	73996	he	84	“ Well , we wo n’t find out unless we look at it , ”
74053	74057	74003	74003	Ron	99	“ T. M. Riddle ”
74062	74066	74068	74068	Ron	99	“ Hang on , ”
74082	74104	74068	74068	Ron	99	“ I know that name ... T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago . ”
74105	74113	74115	74115	Harry	84	“ How on earth d’you know that ? ”
74119	74133	74135	74135	Ron	99	“ Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention , ”
74138	74168	74135	74135	Ron	99	“ That was the one I burped slugs all over . If you ’d wiped slime off a name for an hour , you ’d remember it , too . ”
74209	74216	74218	74218	Harry	84	“ He never wrote in it , ”
74222	74233	74235	74235	Ron	99	“ I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away ? ”
74262	74271	74273	74273	Harry	84	“ He must ’ve been Muggle - born , ”
74276	74286	74273	74273	Harry	84	“ To have bought a diary from Vauxhall Road ... ”
74287	74298	74300	74300	Ron	99	“ Well , it ’s not much use to you , ”
74307	74320	74302	74302	He	99	“ Fifty points if you can get it through Myrtle ’s nose . ”
74382	74391	74393	74393	Hermione	100	“ Oooh , it might have hidden powers , ”
74405	74417	74419	74419	Ron	99	“ If it has , it ’s hiding them very well , ”
74421	74440	74419	74419	Ron	99	“ Maybe it ’s shy . I do n’t know why you do n’t chuck it , Harry . ”
74441	74454	74456	74456	Harry	84	“ I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it , ”
74458	74476	74456	74456	Harry	84	“ I would n’t mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services to Hogwarts either . ”
74477	74483	74485	74485	Ron	99	“ Could ’ve been anything , ”
74487	74515	74485	74485	Ron	99	“ Maybe he got thirty O.W.L.s or saved a teacher from the giant squid . Maybe he murdered Myrtle ; that would ’ve done everyone a favor ... ”
74537	74540	74542	74542	Ron	99	“ What ? ”
74551	74568	74569	74569	he	84	“ Well , the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago , was n’t it ? ”
74572	74579	74569	74569	he	84	“ That ’s what Malfoy said . ”
74580	74583	74585	74585	Ron	99	“ Yeah ... ”
74588	74597	74599	74599	Hermione	100	“ And this diary is fifty years old , ”
74605	74608	74569	74569	he	84	“ So ? ”
74609	74617	74619	74619	Hermione	100	“ Oh , Ron , wake up , ”
74621	74719	74619	74619	Hermione	100	“ We know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago . We know T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago . Well , what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of Slytherin ? His diary would probably tell us everything — where the Chamber is , and how to open it , and what sort of creature lives in it — the person who ’s behind the attacks this time would n’t want that lying around , would they ? ”
74720	74729	74731	74731	Ron	99	“ That ’s a brilliant theory , Hermione , ”
74733	74749	74731	74731	Ron	99	“ with just one tiny little flaw . There ’s nothing written in his diary . ”
74761	74768	74769	74769	she	100	“ It might be invisible ink ! ”
74781	74784	74772	74772	She	100	“ Aparecium ! ”
74810	74823	74824	74824	she	100	“ It ’s a Revealer , I got it in Diagon Alley , ”
74837	74851	74853	74853	Ron	99	“ I ’m telling you , there ’s nothing to find in there , ”
74855	74872	74853	74853	Ron	99	“ Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and could n’t be bothered filling it in . ”
75081	75101	75103	75103	Ron	99	“ Good thing , too , or it ’d be even bigger and I ’d still be polishing it , ”
75131	75137	75139	75139	Ron	99	“ He sounds like Percy , ”
75147	75159	75139	75139	Ron	99	“ Prefect , Head Boy ... probably top of every class — ”
75160	75171	75173	75173	Hermione	100	“ You say that like it ’s a bad thing , ”
75242	75258	75261	75261	her	219	“ The moment their acne clears up , they ’ll be ready for repotting again , ”
75268	75298	75261	75261	her	219	“ And after that , it wo n’t be long until we ’re cutting them up and stewing them . You ’ll have Mrs. Norris back in no time . ”
75382	75386	75368	75368	He	262	“ given himself away ”
75407	75415	75398	75398	he	225	“ Oh , Potter , you rotter ... ”
75453	75467	75468	75468	he	206	“ I do n’t think there ’ll be any more trouble , Minerva , ”
75478	75521	75468	75468	he	206	“ I think the Chamber has been locked for good this time . The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before I caught him . Rather sensible to stop now , before I came down hard on him .
75522	75563	75564	75564	He	206	“ You know , what the school needs now is a morale - booster . Wash away the memories of last term ! I wo n’t say any more just now , but I think I know just the thing ... ”
75688	75694	75695	75695	Harry	84	“ What ’s going on ? ”
75785	75791	75792	75792	Lockhart	206	“ Happy Valentine ’s Day ! ”
75795	75836	75792	75792	Lockhart	206	“ And may I thank the forty - six people who have so far sent me cards ! Yes , I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all — and it does n’t end here ! ”
75875	75884	75886	75886	Lockhart	206	“ My friendly , card - carrying cupids ! ”
75888	75968	75886	75886	Lockhart	206	“ They will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines ! And the fun does n’t stop here ! I ’m sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion ! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion ! And while you ’re at it , Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I ’ve ever met , the sly old dog ! ”
76000	76017	76019	76019	Ron	99	“ Please , Hermione , tell me you were n’t one of the forty - six , ”
76092	76101	76103	76108	a particularly grim - looking dwarf	1593	“ Oi , you ! ’ Arry Potter ! ”
76180	76196	76197	76197	he	1596	“ I ’ve got a musical message to deliver to ’ Arry Potter in person , ”
76210	76214	76215	76215	Harry	84	“ Not here , ”
76222	76226	76228	76229	the dwarf	1596	“ Stay still ! ”
76242	76247	76248	76248	Harry	84	“ Let me go ! ”
76311	76318	76326	76327	Draco Malfoy	101	“ What ’s going on here ? ”
76351	76358	76364	76365	Percy Weasley	120	“ What ’s all this commotion ? ”
76397	76400	76401	76401	he	1596	“ Right , ”
76410	76416	76401	76401	he	1596	“ Here is your singing valentine :
76456	76456	76443	76443	he	1596	”
76514	76536	76537	76537	he	120	“ Off you go , off you go , the bell rang five minutes ago , off to class , now , ”
76548	76554	76537	76537	he	120	“ And you , Malfoy — ”
76589	76594	76596	76596	Harry	84	“ Give that back , ”
76599	76608	76610	76610	Malfoy	101	“ Wonder what Potter ’s written in this ? ”
76650	76657	76659	76659	Percy	120	“ Hand it over , Malfoy , ”
76662	76670	76672	76672	Malfoy	101	“ When I ’ve had a look , ”
76684	76690	76681	76681	Percy	120	“ As a school prefect — ”
76706	76709	76698	76698	He	84	“ Expelliarmus ! ”
76740	76743	76745	76745	Percy	120	“ Harry ! ”
76748	76765	76745	76745	Percy	120	“ No magic in the corridors . I ’ll have to report this , you know ! ”
76812	76823	76806	76806	he	101	“ I do n’t think Potter liked your valentine much ! ”
76987	76998	76984	76984	George	111	“ His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad ”
77121	77128	77110	77110	Harry	84	“ My name is Harry Potter . ”
77173	77193	77348	77348	His	84	“ Hello , Harry Potter . My name is Tom Riddle . How did you come by my diary ? ”
77212	77222	77348	77348	His	84	“ Someone tried to flush it down a toilet . ”
77231	77263	77223	77223	He	84	“ Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink . But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read . ”
77264	77270	77271	77271	Harry	84	“ What do you mean ? ”
77281	77310	77223	77223	He	84	“ I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things . Things that were covered up . Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . ”
77311	77319	77320	77320	Harry	84	“ That ’s where I am now , ”
77324	77347	77320	77320	Harry	84	“ I ’m at Hogwarts , and horrible stuff ’s been happening . Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets ? ”
77375	77532	77366	77366	he	282	“ Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets . In my day , they told us it was a legend , that it did not exist . But this was a lie . In my fifth year , the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students , finally killing one . I caught the person who ’d opened the Chamber and he was expelled . But the headmaster , Professor Dippet , ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts , forbade me to tell the truth . A story was given out that the girl had died in a freak accident . They gave me a nice , shiny , engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut . But I knew it could happen again . The monster lived on , and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned . ”
77546	77575	77533	77533	Harry	84	“ It ’s happening again now . There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who ’s behind them . Who was it last time ? ”
77576	77586	77588	77588	Riddle	282	“ I can show you , if you like , ”
77592	77619	77588	77588	Riddle	282	“ You do n’t have to take my word for it . I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him . ”
77675	77681	77682	77682	Harry	84	“ Let me show you . ”
77696	77699	77682	77682	Harry	84	“ OK . ”
77899	77904	77905	77905	he	84	“ I ’m sorry , ”
77909	77918	77905	77905	he	84	“ I did n’t mean to butt in — ”
77944	77955	77935	77935	Harry	84	“ Er — I ’ll just go , shall I ? ”
77985	77996	77997	77997	he	84	“ Sorry I disturbed you . I ’ll go now , ”
78136	78139	78141	78143	the old wizard	1631	“ Enter , ”
78191	78196	78198	78199	the headmaster	783	“ Ah , Riddle , ”
78201	78211	78213	78213	Riddle	282	“ You wanted to see me , Professor Dippet ? ”
78219	78223	78225	78225	Dippet	283	“ Sit down , ”
78227	78239	78225	78225	Dippet	283	“ I ’ve just been reading the letter you sent me . ”
78240	78243	78245	78245	Riddle	282	“ Oh , ”
78258	78263	78265	78265	Dippet	283	“ My dear boy , ”
78268	78292	78265	78265	Dippet	283	“ I can not possibly let you stay at school over the summer . Surely you want to go home for the holidays ? ”
78293	78296	78298	78298	Riddle	282	“ No , ”
78302	78319	78298	78298	Riddle	282	“ I ’d much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that — to that — ”
78320	78334	78336	78336	Dippet	283	“ You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays , I believe ? ”
78339	78344	78346	78346	Riddle	282	“ Yes , sir , ”
78351	78358	78298	78298	Riddle	282	“ You are Muggle - born ? ”
78359	78366	78368	78368	Riddle	282	“ Half - blood , sir , ”
78370	78377	78368	78368	Riddle	282	“ Muggle father , witch mother . ”
78378	78386	78298	78298	Riddle	282	“ And are both your parents — ? ”
78387	78424	78368	78368	Riddle	282	“ My mother died just after I was born , sir . They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me — Tom after my father , Marvolo after my grandfather . ”
78431	78438	78439	78439	he	283	“ The thing is , Tom , ”
78442	78458	78439	78439	he	283	“ special arrangements might have been made for you , but in the current circumstances ... ”
78459	78468	78470	78470	Riddle	282	“ You mean all these attacks , sir ? ”
78488	78491	78493	78494	the headmaster	783	“ Precisely , ”
78496	78583	78493	78494	the headmaster	783	“ My dear boy , you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends . Particularly in light of the recent tragedy ... the death of that poor little girl ... You will be safer by far at your orphanage . As a matter of fact , the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school . We are no nearer locating the — er — source of all this unpleasantness ... ”
78590	78604	78584	78584	Riddle	282	“ Sir — if the person was caught — if it all stopped — ”
78605	78611	78613	78613	Dippet	283	“ What do you mean ? ”
78627	78640	78613	78613	Dippet	283	“ Riddle , do you mean you know something about these attacks ? ”
78641	78646	78648	78648	Riddle	282	“ No , sir , ”
78661	78663	78665	78665	he	282	“ no ”
78679	78686	78671	78671	Dippet	283	“ You may go , Tom ... ”
78808	78821	78788	78799	a tall wizard with long , sweeping auburn hair and a beard	1642	“ What are you doing , wandering around this late , Tom ? ”
78841	78851	78853	78853	Riddle	282	“ I had to see the headmaster , sir , ”
78855	78863	78865	78865	Dumbledore	106	“ Well , hurry off to bed , ”
78880	78893	78865	78865	Dumbledore	106	“ Best not to roam the corridors these days . Not since ... ”
79157	79176	79150	79150	someone	388	“ C’m on ... got ta get yeh outta here ... C’m on now ... in the box ... ”
79226	79231	79233	79233	Riddle	282	“ Evening , Rubeus , ”
79246	79255	79236	79237	The boy	2692	“ What yer doin’ down here , Tom ? ”
79260	79266	79267	79267	he	282	“ It ’s all over , ”
79270	79296	79267	79267	he	282	“ I ’m going to have to turn you in , Rubeus . They ’re talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks do n’t stop . ”
79297	79301	79354	79354	him	1657	“ What d’yeh — ”
79302	79332	79267	79267	he	282	“ I do n’t think you meant to kill anyone . But monsters do n’t make good pets . I suppose you just let it out for exercise and — ”
79333	79340	79342	79344	the large boy	1657	“ It never killed no one ! ”
79365	79371	79373	79373	Riddle	282	“ Come on , Rubeus , ”
79379	79408	79373	79373	Riddle	282	“ The dead girl ’s parents will be here tomorrow . The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered ... ”
79409	79415	79417	79418	the boy	2692	“ It was n’t him ! ”
79428	79436	79420	79420	his	2692	“ He wouldn ’ ! He never ! ”
79437	79441	79443	79443	Riddle	282	“ Stand aside , ”
79596	79599	79577	79579	the huge boy	1665	“ NOOOOOOO ! ”
79662	79667	79668	79668	he	99	“ There you are , ”
79681	79686	79688	79688	Ron	99	“ What ’s up ? ”
79696	79713	79688	79688	Ron	99	“ It was Hagrid , Ron . Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago . ”
79774	79777	79771	79771	he	91	“ Fluffy . ”
79928	79937	79939	79939	Hermione	100	“ Riddle might have got the wrong person , ”
79941	79953	79939	79939	Hermione	100	“ Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people ... ”
79954	79965	79966	79966	Ron	99	“ How many monsters d’you think this place can hold ? ”
79970	79979	79981	79981	Harry	84	“ We always knew Hagrid had been expelled , ”
79984	80007	79981	79981	Harry	84	“ And the attacks must ’ve stopped after Hagrid was kicked out . Otherwise , Riddle would n’t have got his award . ”
80014	80031	80008	80008	Ron	99	“ Riddle does sound like Percy — who asked him to squeal on Hagrid , anyway ? ”
80032	80042	80044	80044	Hermione	100	“ But the monster had killed someone , Ron , ”
80046	80063	80065	80065	Harry	84	“ And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts , ”
80067	80079	80065	80065	Harry	84	“ I do n’t blame him for wanting to stay here ... ”
80080	80094	80123	80123	Hermione	100	“ You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley , did n’t you , Harry ? ”
80095	80106	80108	80108	Harry	84	“ He was buying a Flesh - Eating Slug Repellent , ”
80135	80149	80123	80123	Hermione	100	“ Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all ? ”
80150	80158	80160	80160	Ron	99	“ That ’d be a cheerful visit , ”
80162	80186	80160	80160	Ron	99	“ ‘ Hello , Hagrid . Tell us , have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately ? ’ ”
80284	80291	80283	80283	his	225	“ Oh , Potter , you rotter ”
80336	80358	80359	80359	she	1680	“ The moment they start trying to move into each other ’s pots , we ’ll know they ’re fully mature , ”
80363	80379	80359	80359	she	1680	“ Then we ’ll be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing . ”
80420	80428	80429	80429	she	1680	“ It could affect our whole future , ”
80448	80457	80459	80459	Harry	84	“ I just want to give up Potions , ”
80461	80466	80468	80468	Ron	99	“ We ca n’t , ”
80471	80490	80468	80468	Ron	99	“ We keep all our old subjects , or I ’d ’ve ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts . ”
80491	80498	80500	80500	Hermione	100	“ But that ’s very important ! ”
80504	80512	80514	80514	Ron	99	“ Not the way Lockhart teaches it , ”
80516	80531	80514	80514	Ron	99	“ I have n’t learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose . ”
80682	80692	80693	80693	he	120	“ Depends where you want to go , Harry , ”
80696	80796	80693	80693	he	120	“ It ’s never too early to think about the future , so I ’d recommend Divination . People say Muggle Studies is a soft option , but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non - magical community , particularly if they ’re thinking of working in close contact with them — look at my father , he has to deal with Muggle business all the time . My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type , so he went for Care of Magical Creatures . Play to your strengths , Harry . ”
80952	80967	80944	80945	Neville Longbottom	169	“ Harry — I do n’t know who did it — I just found — ”
81071	81077	81067	81067	Dean	168	“ What happened , Harry ? ”
81078	81082	81084	81084	Harry	84	“ No idea , ”
81101	81109	81111	81111	Ron	99	“ Someone ’s been looking for something , ”
81113	81119	81111	81111	Ron	99	“ Is there anything missing ? ”
81158	81165	81166	81166	he	84	“ Riddle ’s diary ’s gone , ”
81174	81177	81166	81166	he	84	“ What ? ”
81232	81248	81225	81225	Hermione	100	“ But — only a Gryffindor could have stolen — nobody else knows our password — ”
81249	81252	81254	81254	Harry	84	“ Exactly , ”
81271	81276	81278	81278	Wood	193	“ Perfect Quidditch conditions ! ”
81294	81307	81278	81278	Wood	193	“ Harry , buck up there , you need a decent breakfast . ”
81440	81451	81452	81452	He	84	“ Kill this time ... let me rip ... tear ... ”
81467	81471	81473	81473	Harry	84	“ The voice ! ”
81480	81491	81473	81473	Harry	84	“ I just heard it again — did n’t you ? ”
81512	81532	81501	81501	Hermione	100	“ Harry — I think I ’ve just understood something ! I ’ve got to go to the library ! ”
81542	81548	81550	81550	Harry	84	“ What does she understand ? ”
81567	81574	81576	81576	Ron	99	“ Loads more than I do , ”
81582	81594	81579	81579	his	99	“ But why ’s she got to go to the library ? ”
81595	81603	81605	81605	Ron	99	“ Because that ’s what Hermione does , ”
81609	81619	81605	81605	Ron	99	“ When in doubt , go to the library . ”
81660	81667	81669	81669	Ron	99	“ You ’d better get moving , ”
81671	81680	81669	81669	Ron	99	“ It ’s nearly eleven — the match — ”
81832	81839	81840	81841	Professor McGonagall	158	“ This match has been canceled , ”
81876	81881	81882	81882	he	193	“ But , Professor ! ”
81885	81897	81882	81882	he	193	“ We ’ve got to play — the Cup — Gryffindor — ”
81910	81944	81907	81907	her	158	“ All students are to make their way back to the House common rooms , where their Heads of Houses will give them further information . As quickly as you can , please ! ”
81957	81969	81946	81946	she	158	“ Potter , I think you ’d better come with me ... ”
82015	82028	82009	82010	Professor McGonagall	158	“ Yes , perhaps you ’d better come , too , Weasley ... ”
82076	82086	82088	82089	Professor McGonagall	158	“ This will be a bit of a shock , ”
82101	82112	82088	82089	Professor McGonagall	158	“ There has been another attack ... another double attack . ”
82176	82179	82180	82180	Ron	99	“ Hermione ! ”
82194	82202	82204	82205	Professor McGonagall	158	“ They were found near the library , ”
82207	82228	82204	82205	Professor McGonagall	158	“ I do n’t suppose either of you can explain this ? It was on the floor next to them ... ”
82251	82261	82263	82264	Professor McGonagall	158	“ I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower , ”
82267	82278	82263	82264	Professor McGonagall	158	“ I need to address the students in any case . ”
82279	82349	82243	82243	their	1716	“ All students will return to their House common rooms by six o’clock in the evening . No student is to leave the dormitories after that time . You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher . No student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher . All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed . There will be no more evening activities . ”
82383	82430	82371	82371	she	158	“ I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed . It is likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught . I would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about them to come forward . ”
82448	82468	82475	82476	Lee Jordan	153	“ That ’s two Gryffindors down , not counting a Gryffindor ghost , one Ravenclaw , and one Hufflepuff , ”
82483	82531	82532	82532	he	153	“ Have n’t any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe ? Is n’t it obvious all this stuff ’s coming from Slytherin ? The Heir of Slytherin , the monster of Slytherin — why do n’t they just chuck all the Slytherins out ? ”
82572	82578	82579	82579	George	111	“ Percy ’s in shock , ”
82584	82611	82579	82579	George	111	“ That Ravenclaw girl — Penelope Clearwater — she ’s a prefect . I do n’t think he thought the monster would dare attack a prefect . ”
82699	82707	82709	82709	Ron	99	“ What ’re we going to do ? ”
82716	82723	82709	82709	Ron	99	“ D’you think they suspect Hagrid ? ”
82724	82735	82737	82737	Harry	84	“ We ’ve got to go and talk to him , ”
82744	82782	82737	82737	Harry	84	“ I ca n’t believe it ’s him this time , but if he set the monster loose last time he ’ll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets , and that ’s a start . ”
82783	82801	82859	82859	Hagrid	91	“ But McGonagall said we ’ve got to stay in our tower unless we ’re in class — ”
82802	82806	82808	82808	Harry	84	“ I think , ”
82814	82828	82808	82808	Harry	84	“ it ’s time to get my dad ’s old Cloak out again . ”
83094	83097	83098	83098	he	91	“ Oh , ”
83109	83117	83098	83098	he	91	“ What ’re you two doin’ here ? ”
83118	83124	83126	83126	Harry	84	“ What ’s that for ? ”
83137	83142	83143	83143	Hagrid	91	“ Nothin’ — nothin’ — ”
83146	83165	83143	83143	Hagrid	91	“ I ’ve bin expectin ’ — doesn ’ matter — Sit down — I ’ll make tea — ”
83204	83211	83213	83213	Harry	84	“ Are you okay , Hagrid ? ”
83215	83222	83213	83213	Harry	84	“ Did you hear about Hermione ? ”
83223	83233	83235	83235	Hagrid	91	“ Oh , I heard , all righ ’ , ”
83338	83344	83319	83319	Hagrid	91	“ Good evening , Hagrid . ”
83418	83425	83426	83426	Ron	99	“ That ’s Dad ’s boss ! ”
83429	83438	83426	83426	Ron	99	“ Cornelius Fudge , the Minister of Magic ! ”
83471	83477	83479	83479	Fudge	289	“ Bad business , Hagrid , ”
83485	83512	83479	83479	Fudge	289	“ Very bad business . Had to come . Four attacks on Muggle - borns . Things’ve gone far enough . Ministry ’s got to act . ”
83513	83517	83519	83519	Hagrid	91	“ I never , ”
83526	83537	83519	83519	Hagrid	91	“ You know I never , Professor Dumbledore , sir — ”
83538	83553	83555	83555	Dumbledore	106	“ I want it understood , Cornelius , that Hagrid has my full confidence , ”
83561	83566	83568	83568	Fudge	289	“ Look , Albus , ”
83572	83595	83568	83568	Fudge	289	“ Hagrid ’s record ’s against him . Ministry ’s got to do something — the school governors have been in touch — ”
83596	83616	83618	83618	Dumbledore	106	“ Yet again , Cornelius , I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help in the slightest , ”
83634	83644	83646	83646	Fudge	289	“ Look at it from my point of view , ”
83653	83707	83646	83646	Fudge	289	“ I ’m under a lot of pressure . Got to be seen to be doing something . If it turns out it was n’t Hagrid , he ’ll be back and no more said . But I ’ve got to take him . Got to . Would n’t be doing my duty — ”
83708	83712	83714	83714	Hagrid	91	“ Take me ? ”
83720	83725	83714	83714	Hagrid	91	“ Take me where ? ”
83726	83733	83735	83735	Fudge	289	“ For a short stretch only , ”
83743	83770	83735	83735	Fudge	289	“ Not a punishment , Hagrid , more a precaution . If someone else is caught , you ’ll be let out with a full apology — ”
83771	83775	83777	83777	Hagrid	91	“ Not Azkaban ? ”
83846	83852	83853	83853	he	207	“ Already here , Fudge , ”
83857	83862	83853	83853	he	207	“ Good , good ... ”
83863	83870	83872	83872	Hagrid	91	“ What ’re you doin’ here ? ”
83875	83881	83872	83872	Hagrid	91	“ Get outta my house ! ”
83882	83910	83912	83913	Lucius Malfoy	114	“ My dear man , please believe me , I have no pleasure at all in being inside your — er — d’you call this a house ? ”
83924	83940	83917	83917	he	114	“ I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here . ”
83941	83953	83955	83955	Dumbledore	106	“ And what exactly did you want with me , Lucius ? ”
83972	83978	83980	83980	Malfoy	114	“ Dreadful thing , Dumbledore , ”
83991	84079	83980	83980	Malfoy	114	“ but the governors feel it ’s time for you to step aside . This is an Order of Suspension — you ’ll find all twelve signatures on it . I ’m afraid we feel you ’re losing your touch . How many attacks have there been now ? Two more this afternoon , was n’t it ? At this rate , there ’ll be no Muggle - borns left at Hogwarts , and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school . ”
84080	84090	84092	84092	Fudge	289	“ Oh , now , see here , Lucius , ”
84097	84112	84092	84092	Fudge	289	“ Dumbledore suspended — no , no — last thing we want just now — ”
84113	84132	84134	84135	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ The appointment — or suspension — of the headmaster is a matter for the governors , Fudge , ”
84138	84149	84134	84135	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ And as Dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks — ”
84150	84163	84165	84165	Fudge	289	“ See here , Malfoy , if Dumbledore ca n’t stop them , ”
84174	84183	84165	84165	Fudge	289	“ I mean to say , who can ? ”
84184	84191	84193	84194	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ That remains to be seen , ”
84200	84210	84193	84194	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ But as all twelve of us have voted — ”
84225	84246	84247	84247	he	91	“ An ’ how many did yeh have ter threaten an ’ blackmail before they agreed , Malfoy , eh ? ”
84250	84274	84276	84277	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ Dear , dear , you know , that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days , Hagrid , ”
84279	84302	84276	84277	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that . They wo n’t like it at all . ”
84303	84310	84312	84312	Hagrid	91	“ Yeh can ’ take Dumbledore ! ”
84325	84349	84312	84312	Hagrid	91	“ Take him away , an ’ the Muggle - borns won ’ stand a chance ! There ’ll be killin ’ next ! ”
84350	84356	84358	84358	Dumbledore	106	“ Calm yourself , Hagrid , ”
84367	84384	84361	84361	He	106	“ If the governors want my removal , Lucius , I shall of course step aside — ”
84385	84388	84390	84390	Fudge	289	“ But — ”
84392	84395	84397	84397	Hagrid	91	“ No ! ”
84415	84418	84420	84420	Dumbledore	106	“ However , ”
84437	84477	84420	84420	Dumbledore	106	“ you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me . You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it . ”
84500	84504	84506	84506	Malfoy	114	“ Admirable sentiments , ”
84510	84544	84506	84506	Malfoy	114	“ We shall all miss your — er — highly individual way of running things , Albus , and only hope that your successor will manage to prevent any — ah — killins . ”
84591	84628	84577	84577	Hagrid	91	“ If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff , all they ’d have ter do would be ter follow the spiders . That ’d lead ’em right ! That ’s all I ’m sayin ’ . ”
84636	84645	84647	84647	Hagrid	91	“ All right , I ’m comin ’ , ”
84674	84687	84667	84667	he	91	“ An ’ someone’ll need ter feed Fang while I ’m away . ”
84700	84707	84708	84708	he	99	“ We ’re in trouble now , ”
84712	84736	84708	84708	he	99	“ No Dumbledore . They might as well close the school tonight . There ’ll be an attack a day with him gone . ”
84843	84851	84852	84853	Madam Pomfrey	219	“ We ’re taking no more chances , ”
84865	84887	84852	84853	Madam Pomfrey	219	“ No , I ’m sorry , there ’s every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off ... ”
84962	84993	84952	84952	Harry	84	“ I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me ... Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it . ”
85205	85220	85221	85221	he	101	“ I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore , ”
85232	85281	85221	85221	he	101	“ I told you he thinks Dumbledore ’s the worst headmaster the school ’s ever had . Maybe we ’ll get a decent headmaster now . Someone who wo n’t want the Chamber of Secrets closed . McGonagall wo n’t last long , she ’s only filling in ... ”
85298	85301	85303	85303	Malfoy	101	“ Sir , ”
85306	85320	85303	85303	Malfoy	101	“ Sir , why do n’t you apply for the headmaster ’s job ? ”
85321	85328	85330	85330	Snape	90	“ Now , now , Malfoy , ”
85343	85365	85330	85330	Snape	90	“ Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors . I daresay he ’ll be back with us soon enough . ”
85366	85371	85373	85373	Malfoy	101	“ Yeah , right , ”
85377	85411	85373	85373	Malfoy	101	“ I expect you ’d have Father ’s vote , sir , if you wanted to apply for the job — I ’ll tell Father you ’re the best teacher here , sir — ”
85437	85453	85454	85454	Malfoy	101	“ I ’m quite surprised the Mudbloods have n’t all packed their bags by now , ”
85458	85474	85454	85454	Malfoy	101	“ Bet you five Galleons the next one dies . Pity it was n’t Granger — ”
85517	85523	85524	85524	Ron	99	“ Let me at him , ”
85535	85559	85524	85524	Ron	99	“ I do n’t care , I do n’t need my wand , I ’m going to kill him with my bare hands — ”
85560	85574	85576	85576	Snape	90	“ Hurry up , I ’ve got to take you all to Herbology , ”
85707	85757	85696	85696	Ernie	262	“ I just want to say , Harry , that I ’m sorry I ever suspected you . I know you ’d never attack Hermione Granger , and I apologize for all the stuff I said . We ’re all in the same boat now , and , well — ”
85787	85793	85795	85795	Ernie	262	“ That Draco Malfoy character , ”
85802	85827	85795	85795	Ernie	262	“ he seems very pleased about all this , does n’t he ? D’you know , I think he might be Slytherin ’s heir . ”
85828	85835	85837	85837	Ron	99	“ That ’s clever of you , ”
85852	85862	85863	85863	Ernie	262	“ Do you think it ’s Malfoy , Harry ? ”
85866	85869	85871	85871	Harry	84	“ No , ”
85933	85940	85922	85922	Harry	84	“ Ouch ! What ’re you — ”
85959	85964	85966	85966	Ron	99	“ Oh , yeah , ”
85977	85986	85966	85966	Ron	99	“ But we ca n’t follow them now — ”
86024	86035	85999	85999	he	84	“ Looks like they ’re heading for the Forbidden Forest ... ”
86079	86090	86091	86091	Harry	84	“ We ’ll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again , ”
86095	86120	86091	86091	Harry	84	“ We can take Fang with us . He ’s used to going into the forest with Hagrid , he might be some help . ”
86121	86124	86126	86126	Ron	99	“ Right , ”
86138	86156	86157	86157	he	99	“ Er — are n’t there — are n’t there supposed to be werewolves in the forest ? ”
86183	86203	86180	86180	Harry	84	“ There are good things in there , too . The centaurs are all right , and the unicorns ... ”
86261	86265	86266	86266	he	206	“ Come now , ”
86273	86280	86266	86266	he	206	“ Why all these long faces ? ”
86290	86297	86299	86299	Lockhart	206	“ Do n’t you people realize , ”
86313	86326	86299	86299	Lockhart	206	“ the danger has passed ! The culprit has been taken away — ”
86327	86331	86333	86334	Dean Thomas	168	“ Says who ? ”
86337	86366	86368	86368	Lockhart	206	“ My dear young man , the Minister of Magic would n’t have taken Hagrid if he had n’t been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty , ”
86383	86390	86392	86392	Ron	99	“ Oh , yes he would , ”
86400	86420	86422	86422	Lockhart	206	“ I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid ’s arrest than you do , Mr. Weasley , ”
86456	86464	86465	86465	Harry	84	“ We were n’t there , remember ? ”
86788	86792	86794	86794	Ron	99	“ ’ Course , ”
86804	86847	86794	86794	Ron	99	“ we might get to the forest and find there ’s nothing to follow . Those spiders might not ’ve been going there at all . I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction , but ... ”
86946	86959	86961	86961	Harry	84	“ C’m on , Fang , we ’re going for a walk , ”
87004	87007	86996	86996	Harry	84	“ Lumos ! ”
87032	87036	87038	87038	Ron	99	“ Good thinking , ”
87040	87060	87038	87038	Ron	99	“ I ’d light mine , too , but you know — it ’d probably blow up or something ... ”
87089	87092	87093	87093	Ron	99	“ Okay , ”
87102	87111	87093	87093	Ron	99	“ I ’m ready . Let ’s go . ”
87323	87328	87329	87329	Harry	84	“ What d’you reckon ? ”
87349	87356	87358	87358	Ron	99	“ We ’ve come this far , ”
87501	87504	87506	87506	Ron	99	“ What ? ”
87525	87533	87534	87534	Harry	84	“ There ’s something moving over there , ”
87537	87545	87534	87534	Harry	84	“ Listen ... sounds like something big ... ”
87570	87575	87577	87577	Ron	99	“ Oh , no , ”
87579	87590	87577	87577	Ron	99	“ Oh , no , oh , no , oh — ”
87591	87595	87597	87597	Harry	84	“ Shut up , ”
87600	87606	87597	87597	Harry	84	“ It ’ll hear you . ”
87607	87611	87613	87613	Ron	99	“ Hear me ? ”
87620	87627	87613	87613	Ron	99	“ It ’s already heard Fang ! ”
87655	87663	87665	87665	Harry	84	“ What d’you think it ’s doing ? ”
87667	87674	87676	87676	Ron	99	“ Probably getting ready to pounce , ”
87688	87695	87696	87696	Harry	84	“ D’you think it ’s gone ? ”
87699	87702	87696	87696	Harry	84	“ Dunno — ”
87754	87757	87758	87758	Ron	99	“ Harry ! ”
87767	87775	87761	87761	his	99	“ Harry , it ’s our car ! ”
87776	87779	87761	87761	his	99	“ What ? ”
87780	87784	87761	87761	his	99	“ Come on ! ”
87863	87872	87874	87874	Ron	99	“ It ’s been here all the time ! ”
87882	87894	87874	87874	Ron	99	“ Look at it . The forest ’s turned it wild ... ”
87957	87968	87970	87970	Ron	99	“ And we thought it was going to attack us ! ”
87980	87988	87970	87970	Ron	99	“ I wondered where it had gone ! ”
88015	88022	88023	88023	he	84	“ We ’ve lost the trail , ”
88026	88037	88023	88023	he	84	“ C’m on , let ’s go and find them . ”
88517	88520	88507	88507	he	84	“ Aragog ! ”
88524	88527	88507	88507	he	84	“ Aragog ! ”
88583	88588	88589	88589	he	84	“ What is it ? ”
88597	88600	88607	88607	Harry	84	“ Men , ”
88609	88614	88616	88616	Aragog	292	“ Is it Hagrid ? ”
88628	88631	88638	88638	Ron	99	“ Strangers , ”
88640	88644	88646	88646	Aragog	292	“ Kill them , ”
88649	88654	88646	88646	Aragog	292	“ I was sleeping ... ”
88655	88663	88664	88664	Harry	84	“ We ’re friends of Hagrid ’s , ”
88700	88711	88712	88712	he	292	“ Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before , ”
88716	88722	88724	88724	Harry	84	“ Hagrid ’s in trouble , ”
88730	88738	88724	88724	Harry	84	“ That ’s why we ’ve come . ”
88739	88743	88745	88747	the aged spider	1836	“ In trouble ? ”
88760	88768	88745	88747	the aged spider	1836	“ But why has he sent you ? ”
88804	88833	88792	88792	he	84	“ They think , up at the school , that Hagrid ’s been setting a — a — something on students . They ’ve taken him to Azkaban . ”
88872	88879	88881	88881	Aragog	292	“ But that was years ago , ”
88884	88936	88881	88881	Aragog	292	“ Years and years ago . I remember it well . That ’s why they made him leave the school . They believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets . They thought that Hagrid had opened the Chamber and set me free . ”
88937	88951	88953	88953	Harry	84	“ And you ... you did n’t come from the Chamber of Secrets ? ”
88964	88967	88969	88969	Aragog	292	“ I ! ”
88974	89099	88969	88969	Aragog	292	“ I was not born in the castle . I come from a distant land . A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg . Hagrid was only a boy , but he cared for me , hidden in a cupboard in the castle , feeding me on scraps from the table . Hagrid is my good friend , and a good man . When I was discovered , and blamed for the death of a girl , he protected me . I have lived here in the forest ever since , where Hagrid still visits me . He even found me a wife , Mosag , and you see how our family has grown , all through Hagrid ’s goodness ... ”
89108	89117	89260	89260	Aragog	292	“ So you never — never attacked anyone ? ”
89118	89121	89123	89125	the old spider	1839	“ Never , ”
89127	89188	89123	89125	the old spider	1839	“ It would have been my instinct , but out of respect for Hagrid , I never harmed a human . The body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom . I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up . Our kind like the dark and the quiet ... ”
89189	89202	89204	89204	Harry	84	“ But then ... Do you know what did kill that girl ? ”
89206	89220	89204	89204	Harry	84	“ Because whatever it is , it ’s back and attacking people again — ”
89249	89258	89260	89260	Aragog	292	“ The thing that lives in the castle , ”
89262	89298	89260	89260	Aragog	292	“ is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others . Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go , when I sensed the beast moving about the school . ”
89299	89304	89306	89306	Harry	84	“ What is it ? ”
89324	89332	89334	89334	Aragog	292	“ We do not speak of it ! ”
89337	89364	89334	89334	Aragog	292	“ We do not name it ! I never even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature , though he asked me , many times . ”
89414	89422	89423	89423	Harry	84	“ We ’ll just go , then , ”
89435	89438	89440	89440	Aragog	292	“ Go ? ”
89443	89448	89440	89440	Aragog	292	“ I think not ... ”
89449	89454	89427	89427	Aragog	292	“ But — but — ”
89455	89495	89440	89440	Aragog	292	“ My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid , on my command . But I can not deny them fresh meat , when it wanders so willingly into our midst . Good - bye , friend of Hagrid . ”
89631	89635	89636	89636	Harry	84	“ Get Fang ! ”
89763	89768	89745	89745	His	99	“ Are you okay ? ”
89979	89984	89986	89986	Ron	99	“ Follow the spiders , ”
89996	90010	89986	89986	Ron	99	“ I ’ll never forgive Hagrid . We ’re lucky to be alive . ”
90011	90024	90026	90026	Harry	84	“ I bet he thought Aragog would n’t hurt friends of his , ”
90028	90036	90038	90038	Ron	99	“ That ’s exactly Hagrid ’s problem ! ”
90047	90075	90038	90038	Ron	99	“ He always thinks monsters are n’t as bad as they ’re made out , and look where it ’s got him ! A cell in Azkaban ! ”
90082	90105	90076	90076	He	99	“ What was the point of sending us in there ? What have we found out , I ’d like to know ? ”
90106	90116	90118	90118	Harry	84	“ That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets , ”
90136	90141	90118	90118	Harry	84	“ He was innocent . ”
90481	90484	90485	90485	he	84	“ Ron , ”
90491	90494	90485	90485	he	84	“ Ron — ”
90512	90529	90531	90531	Harry	84	“ Ron — that girl who died . Aragog said she was found in a bathroom , ”
90542	90558	90531	90531	Harry	84	“ What if she never left the bathroom ? What if she ’s still there ? ”
90576	90586	90597	90597	she	1881	“ You do n’t think — not Moaning Myrtle ? ”
90604	90613	90597	90597	she	1881	” said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day , “
90624	90624	90619	90619	her	1881	”
90726	90729	90731	90732	Seamus Finnigan	167	“ Exams ? ”
90734	90741	90731	90732	Seamus Finnigan	167	“ We ’re still getting exams ? ”
90785	90805	90806	90806	she	158	“ The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to receive your education , ”
90810	90829	90806	90806	she	158	“ The exams will therefore take place as usual , and I trust you are all studying hard . ”
90872	90888	90889	90889	she	158	“ Professor Dumbledore ’s instructions were to keep the school running as normally as possible , ”
90892	90913	90889	90889	she	158	“ And that , I need hardly point out , means finding out how much you have learned this year . ”
90977	90987	90988	90988	he	84	“ Can you imagine me taking exams with this ? ”
91019	91025	91026	91026	she	158	“ I have good news , ”
91041	91047	91048	91049	several people	1894	“ Dumbledore ’s coming back ! ”
91053	91062	91064	91069	a girl at the Ravenclaw table	1895	“ You ’ve caught the Heir of Slytherin ! ”
91071	91078	91080	91080	Wood	193	“ Quidditch matches are back on ! ”
91093	91164	91089	91090	Professor McGonagall	158	“ Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last . Tonight , we will be able to revive those people who have been Petrified . I need hardly remind you all that one of them may well be able to tell us who , or what , attacked them . I am hopeful that this dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit . ”
91209	91222	91223	91223	he	99	“ It wo n’t matter that we never asked Myrtle , then ! ”
91228	91282	91223	91223	he	99	“ Hermione’ll probably have all the answers when they wake her up ! Mind you , she ’ll go crazy when she finds out we ’ve got exams in three days ’ time . She has n’t studied . It might be kinder to leave her where she is till they ’re over . ”
91315	91320	91322	91322	Ron	99	“ What ’s up ? ”
91364	91369	91371	91371	Ron	99	“ Spit it out , ”
91411	91420	91421	91421	Ginny	128	“ I ’ve got to tell you something , ”
91430	91435	91437	91437	Harry	84	“ What is it ? ”
91451	91454	91456	91456	Ron	99	“ What ? ”
91486	91505	91469	91469	Harry	84	“ Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets ? Have you seen something ? Someone acting oddly ? ”
91527	91555	91518	91519	Percy Weasley	120	“ If you ’ve finished eating , I ’ll take that seat , Ginny . I ’m starving , I ’ve only just come off patrol duty . ”
91594	91597	91599	91599	Ron	99	“ Percy ! ”
91602	91613	91599	91599	Ron	99	“ She was just about to tell us something important ! ”
91624	91630	91631	91631	he	120	“ What sort of thing ? ”
91636	91654	91599	91599	Ron	99	“ I just asked her if she ’d seen anything odd , and she started to say — ”
91655	91671	91673	91673	Percy	120	“ Oh — that — that ’s nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets , ”
91677	91683	91685	91685	Ron	99	“ How do you know ? ”
91691	91769	91599	91599	Ron	99	“ Well , er , if you must know , Ginny , er , walked in on me the other day when I was — well , never mind — the point is , she spotted me doing something and I , um , I asked her not to mention it to anybody . I must say , I did think she ’d keep her word . It ’s nothing , really , I ’d just rather — ”
91779	91787	91789	91789	Ron	99	“ What were you doing , Percy ? ”
91793	91805	91789	91789	Ron	99	“ Go on , tell us , we wo n’t laugh . ”
91812	91824	91806	91806	Percy	120	“ Pass me those rolls , Harry , I ’m starving . ”
91945	91950	91951	91951	he	206	“ Mark my words , ”
91960	91995	91951	91951	he	206	“ The first words out of those poor Petrified people ’s mouths will be ‘ It was Hagrid . ’ Frankly , I ’m astounded Professor McGonagall thinks all these security measures are necessary . ”
91996	92002	92004	92004	Harry	84	“ I agree , sir , ”
92014	92020	92022	92022	Lockhart	206	“ Thank you , Harry , ”
92036	92062	92022	92022	Lockhart	206	“ I mean , we teachers have quite enough to be getting on with , without walking students to classes and standing guard all night ... ”
92063	92068	92070	92070	Ron	99	“ That ’s right , ”
92075	92096	92070	92070	Ron	99	“ Why do n’t you leave us here , sir , we ’ve only got one more corridor to go — ”
92097	92108	92110	92110	Lockhart	206	“ You know , Weasley , I think I will , ”
92112	92123	92110	92110	Lockhart	206	“ I really should go and prepare my next class — ”
92129	92134	92135	92135	Ron	99	“ Prepare his class , ”
92140	92150	92135	92135	Ron	99	“ Gone to curl his hair , more like . ”
92191	92201	92181	92181	they	1900	“ Potter ! Weasley ! What are you doing ? ”
92217	92224	92225	92225	Ron	99	“ We were — we were — ”
92228	92239	92225	92225	Ron	99	“ We were going to — to go and see — ”
92240	92243	92245	92245	Harry	84	“ Hermione , ”
92256	92267	92268	92268	Harry	84	“ We have n’t seen her for ages , Professor , ”
92279	92310	92268	92268	Harry	84	“ and we thought we ’d sneak into the hospital wing , you know , and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and , er , not to worry — ”
92345	92349	92350	92350	she	158	“ Of course , ”
92367	92422	92350	92350	she	158	“ Of course , I realize this has all been hardest on the friends of those who have been ... I quite understand . Yes , Potter , of course you may visit Miss Granger . I will inform Professor Binns where you ’ve gone . Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given my permission . ”
92454	92457	92459	92459	Ron	99	“ That , ”
92462	92474	92459	92459	Ron	99	“ was the best story you ’ve ever come up with . ”
92511	92523	92524	92524	she	219	“ There ’s just no point talking to a Petrified person , ”
92584	92595	92597	92597	Ron	99	“ Wonder if she did see the attacker , though ? ”
92607	92622	92597	92597	Ron	99	“ Because if he sneaked up on them all , no one’ll ever know ... ”
92684	92691	92692	92692	Ron	99	“ Try and get it out , ”
92954	92957	92958	92958	he	99	“ Ron , ”
92961	93012	92958	92958	he	99	“ This is it . This is the answer . The monster in the Chamber ’s a basilisk — a giant serpent ! That ’s why I ’ve been hearing that voice all over the place , and nobody else has heard it . It ’s because I understand Parseltongue ... ”
93022	93154	93013	93013	Harry	84	“ The basilisk kills people by looking at them . But no one ’s died — because no one looked it straight in the eye . Colin saw it through his camera . The basilisk burned up all the film inside it , but Colin just got Petrified . Justin ... Justin must ’ve seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick ! Nick got the full blast of it , but he could n’t die again ... and Hermione and that Ravenclaw prefect were found with a mirror next to them . Hermione had just realized the monster was a basilisk . I bet you anything she warned the first person she met to look around corners with a mirror first ! And that girl pulled out her mirror — and — ”
93161	93166	93167	93167	he	99	“ And Mrs. Norris ? ”
93184	93188	93189	93189	he	84	“ The water ... ”
93193	93212	93189	93189	he	84	“ The flood from Moaning Myrtle ’s bathroom . I bet you Mrs. Norris only saw the reflection ... ”
93235	93255	93256	93256	he	84	“ ‘ The Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster , which is fatal to it ’ ! ”
93260	93297	93256	93256	he	84	“ Hagrid ’s roosters were killed ! The Heir of Slytherin did n’t want one anywhere near the castle once the Chamber was opened ! ‘ Spiders flee before the Basilisk ’ ! It all fits ! ”
93298	93310	93312	93312	Ron	99	“ But how ’s the basilisk been getting around the place ? ”
93314	93324	93312	93312	Ron	99	“ A giant snake ... Someone would ’ve seen ... ”
93343	93346	93347	93347	he	84	“ Pipes , ”
93350	93372	93347	93347	he	84	“ Pipes ... Ron , it ’s been using the plumbing . I ’ve been hearing that voice inside the walls ... ”
93380	93389	93390	93390	he	99	“ The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets ! ”
93394	93408	93390	93390	he	99	“ What if it ’s a bathroom ? What if it ’s in — ”
93409	93416	93418	93418	Harry	84	“ — Moaning Myrtle ’s bathroom , ”
93435	93439	93441	93441	Harry	84	“ This means , ”
93443	93474	93441	93441	Harry	84	“ I ca n’t be the only Parselmouth in the school . The Heir of Slytherin ’s one , too . That ’s how he ’s been controlling the basilisk . ”
93475	93483	93485	93485	Ron	99	“ What ’re we going to do ? ”
93492	93500	93485	93485	Ron	99	“ Should we go straight to McGonagall ? ”
93501	93509	93511	93511	Harry	84	“ Let ’s go to the staffroom , ”
93516	93530	93511	93511	Harry	84	“ She ’ll be there in ten minutes . It ’s nearly break . ”
93605	93628	93597	93598	Professor McGonagall	158	“ All students to return to their House dormitories at once . All teachers return to the staffroom . Immediately , please . ”
93637	93645	93629	93629	Harry	84	“ Not another attack ? Not now ? ”
93646	93652	93654	93654	Ron	99	“ What ’ll we do ? ”
93658	93665	93654	93654	Ron	99	“ Go back to the dormitory ? ”
93666	93669	93671	93671	Harry	84	“ No , ”
93694	93718	93689	93690	the teachers	2348	“ In here . Let ’s hear what it ’s all about . Then we can tell them what we ’ve found out . ”
93777	93782	93783	93783	she	158	“ It has happened , ”
93789	93805	93783	93783	she	158	“ A student has been taken by the monster . Right into the Chamber itself . ”
93834	93841	93822	93822	Snape	90	“ How can you be sure ? ”
93842	93848	93850	93851	Professor McGonagall	158	“ The Heir of Slytherin , ”
93858	93880	93850	93851	Professor McGonagall	158	“ left another message . Right underneath the first one . ‘ Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever . ’ ”
93887	93892	93894	93895	Madam Hooch	253	“ Who is it ? ”
93909	93913	93894	93895	Madam Hooch	253	“ Which student ? ”
93914	93918	93920	93921	Professor McGonagall	158	“ Ginny Weasley , ”
93936	93948	93950	93951	Professor McGonagall	158	“ We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow , ”
93953	93965	93950	93951	Professor McGonagall	158	“ This is the end of Hogwarts . Dumbledore always said ... ”
93996	94008	93992	93992	he	206	“ So sorry — dozed off — what have I missed ? ”
94033	94038	94039	94039	he	90	“ Just the man , ”
94042	94073	94029	94029	Snape	90	“ The very man . A girl has been snatched by the monster , Lockhart . Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself . Your moment has come at last . ”
94077	94084	94087	94088	Professor Sprout	176	“ That ’s right , Gilderoy , ”
94090	94114	94087	94088	Professor Sprout	176	“ Were n’t you saying just last night that you ’ve known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is ? ”
94115	94122	94124	94124	Lockhart	206	“ I — well , I — ”
94126	94144	94147	94148	Professor Flitwick	192	“ Yes , did n’t you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it ? ”
94150	94161	94087	94088	Professor Sprout	176	“ D - did I ? I do n’t recall — ”
94162	94185	94187	94187	Snape	90	“ I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you had n’t had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested , ”
94189	94216	94187	94187	Snape	90	“ Did n’t you say that the whole affair had been bungled , and that you should have been given a free rein from the first ? ”
94227	94239	94087	94088	Professor Sprout	176	“ I — I really never — you may have misunderstood — ”
94240	94252	94254	94255	Professor McGonagall	158	“ We ’ll leave it to you , then , Gilderoy , ”
94257	94297	94254	94255	Professor McGonagall	158	“ Tonight will be an excellent time to do it . We ’ll make sure everyone ’s out of your way . You ’ll be able to tackle the monster all by youself . A free rein at last . ”
94342	94348	94349	94349	he	206	“ V - very well , ”
94352	94368	94349	94349	he	206	“ I ’ll — I ’ll be in my office , getting — getting ready . ”
94375	94378	94380	94381	Professor McGonagall	158	“ Right , ”
94388	94443	94380	94381	Professor McGonagall	158	“ that ’s got him out from under our feet . The Heads of Houses should go and inform their students what has happened . Tell them the Hogwarts Express will take them home first thing tomorrow . Will the rest of you please make sure no students have been left outside their dormitories . ”
94560	94567	94569	94569	Ron	99	“ She knew something , Harry , ”
94586	94623	94624	94624	Ron	99	“ That ’s why she was taken . It was n’t some stupid thing about Percy at all . She ’d found out something about the Chamber of Secrets . That must be why she was — ”
94630	94647	94624	94624	Ron	99	“ I mean , she was a pureblood . There ca n’t be any other reason . ”
94683	94686	94688	94688	Ron	99	“ Harry , ”
94690	94706	94688	94688	Ron	99	“ D’you think there ’s any chance at all she ’s not — you know — ”
94726	94731	94733	94733	Ron	99	“ D’you know what ? ”
94735	94782	94733	94733	Ron	99	“ I think we should go and see Lockhart . Tell him what we know . He ’s going to try and get into the Chamber . We can tell him where we think it is , and tell him it ’s a basilisk in there . ”
94910	94919	94920	94920	he	84	“ Oh — Mr. Potter — Mr. Weasley — ”
94930	94945	94920	94920	he	84	“ I ’m rather busy at the moment — if you would be quick — ”
94946	94957	94959	94959	Harry	84	“ Professor , we ’ve got some information for you , ”
94961	94969	94959	94959	Harry	84	“ We think it ’ll help you . ”
94970	94980	94984	94984	Lockhart	206	“ Er — well — it ’s not terribly — ”
94995	95004	94984	94984	Lockhart	206	“ I mean — well — all right — ”
95075	95081	95083	95083	Harry	84	“ Are you going somewhere ? ”
95085	95092	95094	95094	Lockhart	206	“ Er , well , yes , ”
95120	95130	95111	95111	he	206	“ Urgent call — unavoidable — got to go — ”
95131	95137	95139	95139	Ron	99	“ What about my sister ? ”
95142	95152	95154	95154	Lockhart	206	“ Well , as to that — most unfortunate — ”
95174	95182	95160	95160	he	206	“ No one regrets more than I — ”
95183	95194	95196	95196	Harry	84	“ You ’re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ! ”
95198	95215	95196	95196	Harry	84	“ You ca n’t go now ! Not with all the Dark stuff going on here ! ”
95216	95229	95230	95230	Lockhart	206	“ Well — I must say — when I took the job — ”
95242	95253	95230	95230	Lockhart	206	“ nothing in the job description — did n’t expect — ”
95254	95262	95264	95264	Harry	84	“ You mean you ’re running away ? ”
95267	95278	95264	95264	Harry	84	“ After all that stuff you did in your books — ”
95279	95285	95287	95287	Lockhart	206	“ Books can be misleading , ”
95290	95295	95296	95296	Harry	84	“ You wrote them ! ”
95299	95304	95306	95306	Lockhart	206	“ My dear boy , ”
95315	95399	95306	95306	Lockhart	206	“ Do use your common sense . My books would n’t have sold half as well if people did n’t think I ’d done all those things . No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock , even if he did save a village from werewolves . He ’d look dreadful on the front cover . No dress sense at all . And the witch who banished the Bandon Banshee had a hairy chin . I mean , come on — ”
95400	95418	95420	95420	Harry	84	“ So you ’ve just been taking credit for what a load of other people have done ? ”
95423	95428	95430	95430	Lockhart	206	“ Harry , Harry , ”
95437	95546	95433	95433	his	206	“ it ’s not nearly as simple as that . There was work involved . I had to track these people down . Ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did . Then I had to put a Memory Charm on them so they would n’t remember doing it . If there ’s one thing I pride myself on , it ’s my Memory Charms . No , it ’s been a lot of work , Harry . It ’s not all book signings and publicity photos , you know . You want fame , you have to be prepared for a long hard slog . ”
95559	95564	95565	95565	he	206	“ Let ’s see , ”
95568	95582	95565	95565	he	206	“ I think that ’s everything . Yes . Only one thing left . ”
95593	95631	95583	95583	He	206	“ Awfully sorry , boys , but I ’ll have to put a Memory Charm on you now . Ca n’t have you blabbing my secrets all over the place . I ’d never sell another book — ”
95650	95653	95647	95647	Harry	84	“ Expelliarmus ! ”
95685	95697	95699	95699	Harry	84	“ Should n’t have let Professor Snape teach us that one , ”
95728	95736	95738	95738	Lockhart	206	“ What d’you want me to do ? ”
95741	95760	95738	95738	Lockhart	206	“ I do n’t know where the Chamber of Secrets is . There ’s nothing I can do . ”
95761	95767	95769	95769	Harry	84	“ You ’re in luck , ”
95779	95798	95769	95769	Harry	84	“ We think we know where it is . And what ’s inside it . Let ’s go . ”
95861	95868	95869	95869	she	230	“ Oh , it ’s you , ”
95876	95884	95869	95869	she	230	“ What do you want this time ? ”
95885	95893	95895	95895	Harry	84	“ To ask you how you died , ”
95919	95926	95927	95927	she	230	“ Ooooh , it was dreadful , ”
95932	96033	95927	95927	she	230	“ It happened right in here . I died in this very stall . I remember it so well . I ’d hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses . The door was locked , and I was crying , and then I heard somebody come in . They said something funny . A different language , I think it must have been . Anyway , what really got me was that it was a boy speaking . So I unlocked the door , to tell him to go and use his own toilet , and then — ”
96042	96046	96034	96034	Myrtle	230	“ I died . ”
96047	96050	96052	96052	Harry	84	“ How ? ”
96054	96058	96060	96060	Myrtle	230	“ No idea , ”
96065	96095	96060	96060	Myrtle	230	“ I just remember seeing a pair of great , big , yellow eyes . My whole body sort of seized up , and then I was floating away ... ”
96102	96134	96096	96096	She	230	“ And then I came back again . I was determined to haunt Olive Hornby , you see . Oh , she was sorry she ’d ever laughed at my glasses . ”
96135	96144	96146	96146	Harry	84	“ Where exactly did you see the eyes ? ”
96148	96152	96154	96154	Myrtle	230	“ Somewhere there , ”
96234	96241	96243	96243	Myrtle	230	“ That tap ’s never worked , ”
96252	96255	96257	96257	Ron	99	“ Harry , ”
96259	96267	96257	96257	Ron	99	“ Say something . Something in Parseltongue . ”
96268	96271	96272	96272	Harry	84	“ But — ”
96312	96316	96317	96317	he	84	“ Open up , ”
96330	96333	96334	96334	he	99	“ English , ”
96369	96373	96374	96374	he	84	“ Open up , ”
96471	96478	96479	96479	he	84	“ I ’m going down there , ”
96517	96521	96523	96523	Ron	99	“ Me too , ”
96530	96540	96542	96542	Lockhart	206	“ Well , you hardly seem to need me , ”
96552	96557	96542	96542	Lockhart	206	“ I ’ll just — ”
96578	96584	96585	96585	Ron	99	“ You can go first , ”
96599	96602	96603	96603	he	206	“ Boys , ”
96610	96619	96603	96603	he	206	“ Boys , what good will it do ? ”
96638	96645	96646	96646	he	206	“ I really do n’t think — ”
96837	96846	96848	96848	Harry	84	“ We must be miles under the school , ”
96858	96865	96867	96867	Ron	99	“ Under the lake , probably , ”
96890	96893	96894	96894	Harry	84	“ Lumos ! ”
96904	96908	96909	96909	he	84	“ C’m on , ”
96957	96960	96961	96961	Harry	84	“ Remember , ”
96970	96982	96961	96961	Harry	84	“ any sign of movement , close your eyes right away ... ”
97067	97076	97078	97078	Ron	99	“ Harry — there ’s something up there — ”
97114	97120	97121	97121	he	84	“ Maybe it ’s asleep , ”
97222	97225	97227	97227	Ron	99	“ Blimey , ”
97246	97250	97252	97252	Ron	99	“ Get up , ”
97309	97317	97318	97318	he	84	“ The adventure ends here , boys ! ”
97321	97371	97318	97318	he	84	“ I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school , tell them I was too late to save the girl , and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body — say good - bye to your memories ! ”
97385	97388	97372	97372	He	84	“ Obliviate ! ”
97452	97455	97456	97456	he	84	“ Ron ! ”
97459	97466	97456	97456	he	84	“ Are you okay ? Ron ! ”
97467	97472	97474	97474	Ron	99	“ I ’m here ! ”
97483	97502	97474	97474	Ron	99	“ I ’m okay — this git ’s not , though — he got blasted by the wand — ”
97511	97514	97519	97519	Ron	99	“ ow ! ”
97528	97532	97533	97533	Ron	99	“ What now ? ”
97541	97553	97533	97533	Ron	99	“ We ca n’t get through — it ’ll take ages ... ”
97610	97613	97696	97696	Ron	99	“ ow ! ”
97646	97650	97651	97651	he	84	“ Wait there , ”
97656	97675	97651	97651	he	84	“ Wait with Lockhart . I ’ll go on ... If I ’m not back in an hour ... ”
97683	97694	97696	97696	Ron	99	“ I ’ll try and shift some of this rock , ”
97709	97723	97696	97696	Ron	99	“ So you can — can get back through . And , Harry — ”
97724	97731	97733	97733	Harry	84	“ See you in a bit , ”
97889	97892	97894	97894	Harry	84	“ Open , ”
98190	98193	98194	98194	Harry	84	“ Ginny ! ”
98206	98220	98221	98221	He	84	“ Ginny — do n’t be dead — please do n’t be dead — ”
98266	98273	98274	98274	Harry	84	“ Ginny , please wake up , ”
98291	98297	98328	98328	He	1985	“ She wo n’t wake , ”
98355	98361	98353	98353	him	1985	“ Tom — Tom Riddle ? ”
98374	98384	98385	98385	Harry	84	“ What d’you mean , she wo n’t wake ? ”
98389	98399	98385	98385	Harry	84	“ She ’s not — she ’s not — ? ”
98400	98406	98408	98408	Riddle	282	“ She ’s still alive , ”
98410	98415	98408	98408	Riddle	282	“ But only just . ”
98452	98458	98459	98459	Harry	84	“ Are you a ghost ? ”
98463	98467	98469	98469	Riddle	282	“ A memory , ”
98472	98481	98469	98469	Riddle	282	“ Preserved in a diary for fifty years . ”
98533	98543	98544	98544	Harry	84	“ You ’ve got to help me , Tom , ”
98553	98590	98544	98544	Harry	84	“ We ’ve got to get her out of here . There ’s a basilisk ... I do n’t know where it is , but it could be along any moment ... Please , help me — ”
98624	98630	98596	98596	Harry	84	“ Did you see — ? ”
98650	98653	98655	98655	Harry	84	“ Thanks , ”
98686	98689	98691	98691	Harry	84	“ Listen , ”
98703	98715	98691	98691	Harry	84	“ We ’ve got to go ! If the basilisk comes — ”
98716	98726	98728	98728	Riddle	282	“ It wo n’t come until it is called , ”
98747	98752	98753	98753	he	84	“ What d’you mean ? ”
98756	98769	98753	98753	he	84	“ Look , give me my wand , I might need it — ”
98775	98783	98784	98784	he	282	“ You wo n’t be needing it , ”
98792	98803	98787	98787	Harry	84	“ What d’you mean , I wo n’t be — ? ”
98804	98817	98819	98819	Riddle	282	“ I ’ve waited a long time for this , Harry Potter , ”
98821	98834	98819	98819	Riddle	282	“ For the chance to see you . To speak to you . ”
98835	98838	98840	98840	Harry	84	“ Look , ”
98845	98867	98840	98840	Harry	84	“ I do n’t think you get it . We ’re in the Chamber of Secrets . We can talk later — ”
98868	98876	98878	98878	Riddle	282	“ We ’re going to talk now , ”
98905	98913	98914	98914	he	282	“ How did Ginny get like this ? ”
98918	98927	98929	98929	Riddle	282	“ Well , that ’s an interesting question , ”
98932	98965	98929	98929	Riddle	282	“ And quite a long story . I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley ’s like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger . ”
98966	98973	98975	98975	Harry	84	“ What are you talking about ? ”
98977	98981	98983	98983	Riddle	282	“ The diary , ”
98985	99030	98983	98983	Riddle	282	“ My diary . Little Ginny ’s been writing in it for months and months , telling me all her pitiful worries and woes — how her brothers tease her , how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books , how ”
99037	99055	98983	98983	Riddle	282	“ how she did n’t think famous , good , great Harry Potter would ever like her ... ”
99080	99103	99104	99104	he	282	“ It ’s very boring , having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven - year - old girl , ”
99108	99169	99104	99104	he	282	“ But I was patient . I wrote back . I was sympathetic , I was kind . Ginny simply loved me . No one ’s ever understood me like you , Tom ... I ’m so glad I ’ve got this diary to confide in ... It ’s like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket ... ”
99198	99293	99104	99104	he	282	“ If I say it myself , Harry , I ’ve always been able to charm the people I needed . So Ginny poured out her soul to me , and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted ... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears , her darkest secrets . I grew powerful , far more powerful than little Miss Weasley . Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets , to start pouring a little of my soul back into her ... ”
99294	99299	99301	99301	Harry	84	“ What d’you mean ? ”
99310	99320	99322	99322	Riddle	282	“ Have n’t you guessed yet , Harry Potter ? ”
99325	99363	99322	99322	Riddle	282	“ Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets . She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls . She set the serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods , and the Squib ’s cat . ”
99364	99367	99368	99368	Harry	84	“ No , ”
99371	99374	99376	99376	Riddle	282	“ Yes , ”
99379	99420	99421	99421	he	282	“ Of course , she did n’t know what she was doing at first . It was very amusing . I wish you could have seen her new diary entries ... far more interesting , they became ... Dear Tom , ”
99430	99551	99421	99421	he	282	“ I think I ’m losing my memory . There are rooster feathers all over my robes and I do n’t know how they got there . Dear Tom , I ca n’t remember what I did on the night of Halloween , but a cat was attacked and I ’ve got paint all down my front . Dear Tom , Percy keeps telling me I ’m pale and I ’m not myself . I think he suspects me ... There was another attack today and I do n’t know where I was . Tom , what am I going to do ? I think I ’m going mad ... I think I ’m the one attacking everyone , Tom ! ”
99566	99583	99585	99585	Riddle	282	“ It took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting her diary , ”
99587	99648	99585	99585	Riddle	282	“ But she finally became suspicious and tried to dispose of it . And that ’s where you came in , Harry . You found it , and I could n’t have been more delighted . Of all the people who could have picked it up , it was you , the very person I was most anxious to meet ... ”
99649	99659	99661	99661	Harry	84	“ And why did you want to meet me ? ”
99680	99695	99697	99697	Riddle	282	“ Well , you see , Ginny told me all about you , Harry , ”
99699	99705	99697	99697	Riddle	282	“ Your whole fascinating history . ”
99724	99766	99719	99719	their	1988	“ I knew I must find out more about you , talk to you , meet you if I could . So I decided to show you my famous capture of that great oaf , Hagrid , to gain your trust — ”
99767	99773	99775	99775	Harry	84	“ Hagrid ’s my friend , ”
99782	99801	99777	99777	his	84	“ And you framed him , did n’t you ? I thought you made a mistake , but — ”
99809	99955	99804	99804	his	282	“ It was my word against Hagrid ’s , Harry . Well , you can imagine how it looked to old Armando Dippet . On the one hand , Tom Riddle , poor but brilliant , parentless but so brave , school prefect , model student ... on the other hand , big , blundering Hagrid , in trouble every other week , trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed , sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls ... but I admit , even I was surprised how well the plan worked . I thought someone must realize that Hagrid could n’t possibly be the Heir of Slytherin . It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance ... as though Hagrid had the brains , or the power !
99956	100006	99804	99804	his	282	“ Only the Transfiguration teacher , Dumbledore , seemed to think Hagrid was innocent . He persuaded Dippet to keep Hagrid and train him as gamekeeper . Yes , I think Dumbledore might have guessed ... Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did ... ”
100007	100016	100018	100018	Harry	84	“ I bet Dumbledore saw right through you , ”
100024	100041	100043	100043	Riddle	282	“ Well , he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid was expelled , ”
100046	100130	100043	100043	Riddle	282	“ I knew it would n’t be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school . But I was n’t going to waste those long years I ’d spent searching for it . I decided to leave behind a diary , preserving my sixteen - year - old self in its pages , so that one day , with luck , I would be able to lead another in my footsteps , and finish Salazar Slytherin ’s noble work . ”
100131	100140	100142	100142	Harry	84	“ Well , you have n’t finished it , ”
100145	100179	100142	100142	Harry	84	“ No one ’s died this time , not even the cat . In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again — ”
100180	100188	100190	100190	Riddle	282	“ Have n’t I already told you , ”
100193	100217	100190	100190	Riddle	282	“ that killing Mudbloods does n’t matter to me anymore ? For many months now , my new target has been — you . ”
100223	100384	100142	100142	Harry	84	“ Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was opened , it was Ginny who was writing to me , not you . She saw you with the diary , you see , and panicked . What if you found out how to work it , and I repeated all her secrets to you ? What if , even worse , I told you who ’d been strangling roosters ? So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back . But I knew what I must do . It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin ’s heir . From everything Ginny had told me about you , I knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery — particularly if one of your best friends was attacked . And Ginny had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak Parseltongue ...
100385	100473	100597	100597	He	282	“ So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down here to wait . She struggled and cried and became very boring . But there is n’t much life left in her ... She put too much into the diary , into me . Enough to let me leave its pages at last ... I have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here . I knew you ’d come . I have many questions for you , Harry Potter . ”
100474	100478	100479	100479	Harry	84	“ Like what ? ”
100486	100489	100491	100491	Riddle	282	“ Well , ”
100496	100540	100491	100491	Riddle	282	“ how is it that you — a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent — managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time ? How did you escape with nothing but a scar , while Lord Voldemort ’s powers were destroyed ? ”
100553	100562	100564	100564	Harry	84	“ Why do you care how I escaped ? ”
100567	100574	100564	100564	Harry	84	“ Voldemort was after your time ... ”
100575	100578	100580	100580	Riddle	282	“ Voldemort , ”
100583	100596	100580	100580	Riddle	282	“ is my past , present , and future , Harry Potter ... ”
100642	100646	100647	100647	he	282	“ You see ? ”
100650	100773	100647	100647	he	282	“ It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts , to my most intimate friends only , of course . You think I was going to use my filthy Muggle father ’s name forever ? I , in whose veins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself , through my mother ’s side ? I , keep the name of a foul , common Muggle , who abandoned me even before I was born , just because he found out his wife was a witch ? No , Harry — I fashioned myself a new name , a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak , when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world ! ”
100816	100821	100822	100822	he	84	“ You ’re not , ”
100832	100836	100838	100838	Riddle	282	“ Not what ? ”
100840	100849	100851	100851	Harry	84	“ Not the greatest sorcerer in the world , ”
100856	100920	100851	100851	Harry	84	“ Sorry to disappoint you and all that , but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore . Everyone says so . Even when you were strong , you did n’t dare try and take over at Hogwarts . Dumbledore saw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you now , wherever you ’re hiding these days — ”
100939	100955	100956	100956	he	282	“ Dumbledore ’s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me ! ”
100959	100970	100971	100971	Harry	84	“ He ’s not as gone as you might think ! ”
101209	101215	101217	101217	Riddle	282	“ That ’s a phoenix ... ”
101225	101228	101229	101229	Harry	84	“ Fawkes ? ”
101245	101249	101251	101251	Riddle	282	“ And that — ”
101263	101272	101251	101251	Riddle	282	“ that ’s the old school Sorting Hat — ”
101320	101350	101299	101299	He	282	“ This is what Dumbledore sends his defender ! A songbird and an old hat ! Do you feel brave , Harry Potter ? Do you feel safe now ? ”
101389	101395	101397	101397	Riddle	282	“ To business , Harry , ”
101403	101440	101441	101441	he	282	“ Twice — in your past , in my future — we have met . And twice I failed to kill you . How did you survive ? Tell me everything . The longer you talk , ”
101445	101452	101441	101441	he	282	“ the longer you stay alive . ”
101548	101562	101564	101564	Harry	84	“ No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me , ”
101567	101599	101600	101600	he	84	“ I do n’t know myself . But I know why you could n’t kill me . Because my mother died to save me . My common Muggle - born mother , ”
101608	101661	101600	101600	he	84	“ She stopped you killing me . And I ’ve seen the real you , I saw you last year . You ’re a wreck . You ’re barely alive . That ’s where all your power got you . You ’re in hiding . You ’re ugly , you ’re foul — ”
101676	101790	101668	101668	he	282	“ So . Your mother died to save you . Yes , that ’s a powerful counter - charm . I can see now ... there is nothing special about you , after all . I wondered , you see . Because there are strange likenesses between us , Harry Potter . Even you must have noticed . Both half - bloods , orphans , raised by Muggles . Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself . We even look something alike ... But after all , it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me . That ’s all I wanted to know . ”
101813	101856	101857	101857	He	282	“ Now , Harry , I ’m going to teach you a little lesson . Let ’s match the powers of Lord Voldemort , Heir of Salazar Slytherin , against famous Harry Potter , and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him ... ”
101924	101937	101920	101920	he	282	“ Speak to me , Slytherin , greatest of the Hogwarts Four . ”
102035	102041	102030	102030	Harry	84	“ Do n’t leave me ! ”
102102	102106	102097	102097	Riddle	282	“ Kill him . ”
102411	102414	102417	102417	Riddle	282	“ NO ! ”
102420	102444	102417	102417	Riddle	282	“ LEAVE THE BIRD ! LEAVE THE BIRD ! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU ! YOU CAN STILL SMELL HIM ! KILL HIM ! ”
102483	102490	102491	102491	Harry	84	“ Help me , help me , ”
102495	102500	102491	102491	Harry	84	“ someone — anyone — ”
102681	102701	102702	102702	Harry	84	“ KILL THE BOY ! LEAVE THE BIRD ! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU ! SNIFF — SMELL HIM ! ”
102984	102987	102989	102989	Harry	84	“ Fawkes , ”
102992	102999	102989	102989	Harry	84	“ You were fantastic , Fawkes ... ”
103036	103044	103046	103046	Riddle	282	“ You ’re dead , Harry Potter , ”
103052	103076	103046	103046	Riddle	282	“ Dead . Even Dumbledore ’s bird knows it . Do you see what he ’s doing , Potter ? He ’s crying . ”
103101	103126	103149	103149	Riddle	282	“ I ’m going to sit here and watch you die , Harry Potter . Take your time . I ’m in no hurry . ”
103139	103147	103149	103149	Riddle	282	“ So ends the famous Harry Potter , ”
103154	103216	103149	103149	Riddle	282	“ Alone in the Chamber of Secrets , forsaken by his friends , defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged . You ’ll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon , Harry ... She bought you twelve years of borrowed time ... but Lord Voldemort got you in the end , as you knew he must ... ”
103298	103304	103306	103306	Riddle	282	“ Get away , bird , ”
103311	103323	103306	103306	Riddle	282	“ Get away from him — I said , get away — ”
103359	103363	103365	103365	Riddle	282	“ Phoenix tears ... ”
103374	103384	103365	103365	Riddle	282	“ Of course ... healing powers ... I forgot ... ”
103392	103420	103385	103385	He	282	“ But it makes no difference . In fact , I prefer it this way . Just you and me , Harry Potter ... you and me ... ”
103725	103819	103709	103709	She	128	“ Harry — oh , Harry — I tried to tell you at b - breakfast , but I c - couldn’t say it in front of Percy — it was me , Harry — but I — I s - swear I d - didn’t mean to — R - Riddle made me , he t - took me over — and — how did you kill that — that thing ? W - where ’s Riddle ? The last thing I r - remember is him coming out of the diary — ”
103820	103826	103828	103828	Harry	84	“ It ’s all right , ”
103842	103866	103828	103828	Harry	84	“ Riddle ’s finished . Look ! Him and the basilisk . C’m on , Ginny , let ’s get out of here — ”
103867	103875	103876	103876	Ginny	128	“ I ’m going to be expelled ! ”
103887	103921	103879	103879	Harry	84	“ I ’ve looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever since B - Bill came and n - now I ’ll have to leave and — w - what’ll Mum and Dad say ? ”
103997	104000	104001	104001	Harry	84	“ Ron ! ”
104007	104017	104001	104001	Harry	84	“ Ginny ’s okay ! I ’ve got her ! ”
104051	104054	104055	104055	Ron	99	“ Ginny ! ”
104071	104096	104055	104055	Ron	99	“ You ’re alive ! I do n’t believe it ! What happened ? How — what — where did that bird come from ? ”
104106	104112	104114	104114	Harry	84	“ He ’s Dumbledore ’s , ”
104120	104129	104131	104131	Ron	99	“ How come you ’ve got a sword ? ”
104143	104154	104156	104156	Harry	84	“ I ’ll explain when we get out of here , ”
104171	104174	104162	104162	Ginny	128	“ But — ”
104175	104178	104179	104179	Harry	84	“ Later , ”
104211	104216	104194	104194	Ron	99	“ Where ’s Lockhart ? ”
104217	104221	104223	104223	Ron	99	“ Back there , ”
104239	104251	104223	104223	Ron	99	“ He ’s in a bad way . Come and see . ”
104293	104299	104301	104301	Ron	99	“ His memory ’s gone , ”
104303	104350	104301	104301	Ron	99	“ The Memory Charm backfired . Hit him instead of us . Has n’t got a clue who he is , or where he is , or who we are . I told him to come and wait here . He ’s a danger to himself . ”
104361	104364	104365	104365	he	206	“ Hello , ”
104368	104385	104365	104365	he	206	“ Odd sort of place , this , is n’t it ? Do you live here ? ”
104386	104389	104391	104391	Ron	99	“ No , ”
104411	104425	104426	104426	he	206	“ Have you thought how we ’re going to get back up this ? ”
104476	104487	104489	104489	Ron	99	“ He looks like he wants you to grab hold ... ”
104494	104509	104489	104489	Ron	99	“ But you ’re much too heavy for a bird to pull up there — ”
104510	104513	104515	104515	Harry	84	“ Fawkes , ”
104517	104524	104515	104515	Harry	84	“ is n’t an ordinary bird . ”
104532	104553	104525	104525	He	84	“ We ’ve got to hold on to each other . Ginny , grab Ron ’s hand . Professor Lockhart — ”
104554	104559	104561	104561	Ron	99	“ He means you , ”
104566	104574	104525	104525	He	84	“ You hold Ginny ’s other hand — ”
104652	104663	104645	104645	Lockhart	206	“ Amazing ! Amazing ! This is just like magic ! ”
104726	104731	104732	104732	she	230	“ You ’re alive , ”
104738	104748	104749	104749	he	84	“ There ’s no need to sound so disappointed , ”
104763	104789	104791	104791	Myrtle	230	“ Oh , well ... I ’d just been thinking ... if you had died , you ’d have been welcome to share my toilet , ”
104796	104799	104801	104801	Ron	99	“ Urgh ! ”
104815	104834	104801	104801	Ron	99	“ Harry ! I think Myrtle ’s grown fond of you ! You ’ve got competition , Ginny ! ”
104846	104850	104852	104852	Ron	99	“ Where now ? ”
104941	104944	104961	104961	She	122	“ Ginny ! ”
105049	105064	105082	105083	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ You saved her ! You saved her ! How did you do it ? ”
105065	105076	105078	105079	Professor McGonagall	158	“ I think we ’d all like to know that , ”
105222	105226	105227	105228	Professor McGonagall	158	“ Very well , ”
105235	105275	105232	105232	he	84	“ so you found out where the entrance was — breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along the way , I might add — but how on earth did you all get out of there alive , Potter ? ”
105402	105408	105410	105410	Dumbledore	106	“ What interests me most , ”
105413	105439	105410	105410	Dumbledore	106	“ is how Lord Voldemort managed to enchant Ginny , when my sources tell me he is currently in hiding in the forests of Albania . ”
105453	105460	105462	105463	Mr. Weasley	133	“ W - what ’s that ? ”
105469	105494	105462	105463	Mr. Weasley	133	“ You - Know - Who ? En - enchant Ginny ? But Ginny ’s not ... Ginny has n’t been ... has she ? ”
105495	105501	105503	105503	Harry	84	“ It was this diary , ”
105515	105524	105503	105503	Harry	84	“ Riddle wrote it when he was sixteen ... ”
105547	105550	105551	105551	he	106	“ Brilliant , ”
105555	105571	105572	105572	He	106	“ Of course , he was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen . ”
105585	105679	105572	105572	He	106	“ Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle . I taught him myself , fifty years ago , at Hogwarts . He disappeared after leaving the school ... traveled far and wide ... sank so deeply into the Dark Arts , consorted with the very worst of our kind , underwent so many dangerous , magical transformations , that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort , he was barely recognizable . Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever , handsome boy who was once Head Boy here . ”
105680	105685	105687	105688	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ But , Ginny , ”
105690	105704	105687	105688	Mrs. Weasley	122	“ What ’s our Ginny got to do with — with — him ? ”
105705	105711	105712	105712	Ginny	128	“ His d - diary ! ”
105715	105736	105712	105712	Ginny	128	“ I ’ve b - been writing in it , and he ’s been w - writing back all year — ”
105737	105740	105742	105743	Mr. Weasley	133	“ Ginny ! ”
105747	105809	105742	105743	Mr. Weasley	133	“ Have n’t I taught you anything ? What have I always told you ? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you ca n’t see where it keeps its brain . Why did n’t you show the diary to me , or your mother ? A suspicious object like that , it was clearly full of Dark Magic — ”
105810	105817	105819	105819	Ginny	128	“ I d - didn’t know , ”
105821	105850	105819	105819	Ginny	128	“ I found it inside one of the books Mum got me . I th - thought someone had just left it in there and forgotten about it — ”
105851	105864	105865	105865	Dumbledore	106	“ Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away , ”
105872	105901	105902	105902	He	106	“ This has been a terrible ordeal for her . There will be no punishment . Older and wiser wizards than she have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort . ”
105912	105934	105935	105935	he	106	“ Bed rest and perhaps a large , steaming mug of hot chocolate . I always find that cheers me up , ”
105944	105976	105935	105935	he	106	“ You will find that Madam Pomfrey is still awake . She ’s just giving out Mandrake juice — I daresay the basilisk ’s victims will be waking up any moment . ”
105977	105983	105985	105985	Ron	99	“ So Hermione ’s okay ! ”
105988	105999	106001	106001	Dumbledore	106	“ There has been no lasting harm done , Ginny , ”
106019	106025	106026	106027	Professor Dumbledore	106	“ You know , Minerva , ”
106034	106055	106026	106027	Professor Dumbledore	106	“ I think all this merits a good feast . Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens ? ”
106056	106059	106061	106062	Professor McGonagall	158	“ Right , ”
106071	106086	106061	106062	Professor McGonagall	158	“ I ’ll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley , shall I ? ”
106087	106090	106092	106092	Dumbledore	106	“ Certainly , ”
106129	106152	106154	106154	Dumbledore	106	“ I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if you broke any more school rules , ”
106163	106179	106180	106180	Dumbledore	106	“ Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our words , ”
106186	106215	106180	106180	Dumbledore	106	“ You will both receive Special Awards for Services to the School and — let me see — yes , I think two hundred points apiece for Gryffindor . ”
106232	106251	106252	106252	Dumbledore	106	“ But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this dangerous adventure , ”
106255	106262	106252	106252	Dumbledore	106	“ Why so modest , Gilderoy ? ”
106314	106318	106319	106319	Ron	99	“ Professor Dumbledore , ”
106323	106338	106319	106319	Ron	99	“ there was an accident down in the Chamber of Secrets . Professor Lockhart — ”
106339	106345	106347	106347	Lockhart	206	“ Am I a professor ? ”
106352	106364	106347	106347	Lockhart	206	“ Goodness . I expect I was hopeless , was I ? ”
106365	106378	106379	106379	Ron	99	“ He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired , ”
106385	106389	106391	106391	Dumbledore	106	“ Dear me , ”
106403	106412	106394	106394	his	106	“ Impaled upon your own sword , Gilderoy ! ”
106413	106416	106418	106418	Lockhart	206	“ Sword ? ”
106421	106434	106435	106435	He	106	“ Have n’t got a sword . That boy has , though . ”
106440	106447	106435	106435	He	106	“ He ’ll lend you one . ”
106448	106462	106463	106463	Dumbledore	106	“ Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the infirmary , too ? ”
106468	106479	106463	106463	Dumbledore	106	“ I ’d like a few more words with Harry ... ”
106511	106517	106518	106518	he	106	“ Sit down , Harry , ”
106529	106542	106544	106544	Dumbledore	106	“ First of all , Harry , I want to thank you , ”
106550	106573	106544	106544	Dumbledore	106	“ You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber . Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you . ”
106595	106603	106605	106605	Dumbledore	106	“ And so you met Tom Riddle , ”
106608	106618	106605	106605	Dumbledore	106	“ I imagine he was most interested in you ... ”
106634	106651	106668	106668	his	106	“ Professor Dumbledore ... Riddle said I ’m like him . Strange likenesses , he said ... ”
106652	106658	106660	106660	Dumbledore	106	“ Did he , now ? ”
106673	106682	106660	106660	Dumbledore	106	“ And what do you think , Harry ? ”
106683	106693	106695	106695	Harry	84	“ I do n’t think I ’m like him ! ”
106704	106719	106695	106695	Harry	84	“ I mean , I ’m — I ’m in Gryffindor , I ’m ... ”
106733	106736	106737	106737	he	84	“ Professor , ”
106744	106778	106737	106737	he	84	“ The Sorting Hat told me I ’d — I ’d have done well in Slytherin . Everyone thought I was Slytherin ’s heir for a while ... because I can speak Parseltongue ... ”
106779	106787	106789	106789	Dumbledore	106	“ You can speak Parseltongue , Harry , ”
106792	106845	106789	106789	Dumbledore	106	“ because Lord Voldemort — who is the last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin — can speak Parseltongue . Unless I ’m much mistaken , he transferred some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar . Not something he intended to do , I ’m sure ... ”
106846	106856	106857	106857	Harry	84	“ Voldemort put a bit of himself in me ? ”
106862	106868	106789	106789	Dumbledore	106	“ It certainly seems so . ”
106869	106877	106878	106878	Harry	84	“ So I should be in Slytherin , ”
106888	106903	106878	106878	Harry	84	“ The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin ’s power in me , and it — ”
106904	106910	106912	106912	Dumbledore	106	“ Put you in Gryffindor , ”
106915	106956	106957	106957	he	106	“ Listen to me , Harry . You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand - picked students . His own very rare gift , Parseltongue — resourcefulness — determination — a certain disregard for rules , ”
106965	106983	106957	106957	he	106	“ Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor . You know why that was . Think . ”
106984	106992	106994	106994	Harry	84	“ It only put me in Gryffindor , ”
107000	107010	106994	106994	Harry	84	“ because I asked not to go in Slytherin ... ”
107011	107014	107016	107016	Dumbledore	106	“ Exactly , ”
107022	107052	107016	107016	Dumbledore	106	“ Which makes you very different from Tom Riddle . It is our choices , Harry , that show what we truly are , far more than our abilities . ”
107062	107085	107053	107053	Harry	84	“ If you want proof , Harry , that you belong in Gryffindor , I suggest you look more closely at this . ”
107139	107155	107157	107157	Dumbledore	106	“ Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat , Harry , ”
107193	107240	107241	107241	he	106	“ What you need , Harry , is some food and sleep . I suggest you go down to the feast , while I write to Azkaban — we need our gamekeeper back . And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet , too , ”
107245	107274	107241	107241	he	106	“ We ’ll be needing a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ... Dear me , we do seem to run through them , do n’t we ? ”
107333	107339	107341	107341	Dumbledore	106	“ Good evening , Lucius , ”
107447	107450	107451	107451	he	106	“ So ! ”
107453	107474	107451	107451	he	106	“ You ’ve come back . The governors suspended you , but you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts . ”
107475	107483	107485	107485	Dumbledore	106	“ Well , you see , Lucius , ”
107490	107586	107485	107485	Dumbledore	106	“ the other eleven governors contacted me today . It was something like being caught in a hailstorm of owls , to tell the truth . They ’d heard that Arthur Weasley ’s daughter had been killed and wanted me back here at once . They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after all . Very strange tales they told me , too ... Several of them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they did n’t agree to suspend me in the first place . ”
107604	107614	107615	107615	he	114	“ So — have you stopped the attacks yet ? ”
107618	107625	107615	107615	he	114	“ Have you caught the culprit ? ”
107626	107630	107632	107632	Dumbledore	106	“ We have , ”
107638	107641	107643	107644	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ Well ? ”
107647	107652	107643	107644	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ Who is it ? ”
107653	107663	107665	107665	Dumbledore	106	“ The same person as last time , Lucius , ”
107667	107686	107665	107665	Dumbledore	106	“ But this time , Lord Voldemort was acting through somebody else . By means of this diary . ”
107755	107759	107761	107762	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ I see ... ”
107767	107772	107774	107774	Dumbledore	106	“ A clever plan , ”
107789	107794	107796	107797	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ Because if Harry here ”
107806	107847	107796	107797	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ and his friend Ron had n’t discovered this book , why — Ginny Weasley might have taken all the blame . No one would ever have been able to prove she had n’t acted of her own free will ... ”
107859	107863	107864	107864	Dumbledore	106	“ And imagine , ”
107868	107938	107864	107864	Dumbledore	106	“ what might have happened then ... The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure - blood families . Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection Act , if his own daughter was discovered attacking and killing Muggle - borns ... Very fortunate the diary was discovered , and Riddle ’s memories wiped from it . Who knows what the consequences might have been otherwise ... ”
107946	107950	107951	107951	he	114	“ Very fortunate , ”
108007	108025	108027	108027	Harry	84	“ Do n’t you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary , Mr. Malfoy ? ”
108035	108050	108051	108051	he	114	“ How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it ? ”
108054	108062	108064	108064	Harry	84	“ Because you gave it to her , ”
108066	108090	108064	108064	Harry	84	“ In Flourish and Blotts . You picked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary inside it , did n’t you ? ”
108102	108106	108107	108107	he	114	“ Prove it , ”
108110	108122	108124	108124	Dumbledore	106	“ Oh , no one will be able to do that , ”
108130	108198	108124	108124	Dumbledore	106	“ Not now that Riddle has vanished from the book . On the other hand , I would advise you , Lucius , not to go giving out any more of Lord Voldemort ’s old school things . If any more of them find their way into innocent hands , I think Arthur Weasley , for one , will make sure they are traced back to you ... ”
108235	108242	108227	108227	he	84	“ We ’re going , Dobby ! ”
108294	108298	108299	108299	he	84	“ Professor Dumbledore , ”
108303	108316	108299	108299	he	84	“ Can I give that diary back to Mr. Malfoy , please ? ”
108317	108322	108324	108324	Dumbledore	106	“ Certainly , Harry , ”
108327	108336	108324	108324	Dumbledore	106	“ But hurry . The feast , remember ... ”
108414	108418	108419	108419	he	84	“ Mr. Malfoy , ”
108427	108435	108419	108419	he	84	“ I ’ve got something for you — ”
108448	108453	108437	108437	he	84	“ What the — ? ”
108477	108496	108497	108497	he	114	“ You ’ll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days , Harry Potter , ”
108501	108509	108497	108497	he	114	“ They were meddlesome fools , too . ”
108515	108525	108510	108510	He	114	“ Come , Dobby . I said , come . ”
108555	108562	108564	108565	the elf	397	“ Master has given a sock , ”
108569	108576	108564	108565	the elf	397	“ Master gave it to Dobby . ”
108577	108582	108584	108585	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ What ’s that ? ”
108587	108593	108584	108585	Mr. Malfoy	114	“ What did you say ? ”
108594	108599	108601	108601	Dobby	104	“ Got a sock , ”
108605	108622	108601	108601	Dobby	104	“ Master threw it , and Dobby caught it , and Dobby — Dobby is free . ”
108639	108649	108634	108634	he	114	“ You ’ve lost me my servant , boy ! ”
108654	108662	108651	108651	Dobby	104	“ You shall not harm Harry Potter ! ”
108720	108726	108727	108727	he	104	“ You shall go now , ”
108737	108750	108727	108727	he	104	“ You shall not touch Harry Potter . You shall go now . ”
108781	108787	108789	108790	the elf	397	“ Harry Potter freed Dobby ! ”
108811	108818	108789	108790	the elf	397	“ Harry Potter set Dobby free ! ”
108819	108827	108829	108829	Harry	84	“ Least I could do , Dobby , ”
108833	108845	108829	108829	Harry	84	“ Just promise never to try and save my life again . ”
108861	108871	108873	108873	Harry	84	“ I ’ve just got one question , Dobby , ”
108885	108912	108875	108875	Dobby	104	“ You told me all this had nothing to do with He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named , remember ? Well — ”
108913	108921	108923	108923	Dobby	104	“ It was a clue , sir , ”
108935	108960	108923	108923	Dobby	104	“ Was giving you a clue . The Dark Lord , before he changed his name , could be freely named , you see ? ”
108961	108964	108966	108966	Harry	84	“ Right , ”
108969	108992	108966	108966	Harry	84	“ Well , I ’d better go . There ’s a feast , and my friend Hermione should be awake by now ... ”
109005	109016	109017	109017	he	84	“ Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew ! ”
109020	109026	109017	109017	he	84	“ Farewell , Harry Potter ! ”
109080	109089	109091	109091	Justin	180	“ You solved it ! You solved it ! ”
109177	109182	109184	109184	Hermione	100	“ Oh , no ! ”
109235	109238	109240	109240	Ron	99	“ Shame , ”
109249	109258	109240	109240	Ron	99	“ He was starting to grow on me . ”
109295	109307	109308	109308	Ron	99	“ but we ’ve had plenty of practice at that anyway , ”
109462	109482	109504	109504	Fred	110	“ Ginny — what did you see Percy doing , that he did n’t want you to tell anyone ? ”
109483	109488	109490	109490	Ginny	128	“ Oh , that , ”
109494	109503	109490	109490	Ginny	128	“ Well — Percy ’s got a girlfriend . ”
109515	109518	109504	109504	Fred	110	“ What ? ”
109519	109529	109531	109531	Ginny	128	“ It ’s that Ravenclaw prefect , Penelope Clearwater , ”
