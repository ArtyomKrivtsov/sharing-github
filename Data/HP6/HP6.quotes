757	763	706	710	The man in the painting	583	“ That can be rearranged , ”
784	794	723	725	the Prime Minister	542	“ But I really was rather hoping to speak — ”

829	837	839	841	the Prime Minister	542	“ I ... oh ... very well , ”

1092	1099	1100	1100	he	542	“ How can I help you ? ”
1123	1131	1133	1133	Fudge	129	“ Difficult to know where to begin , ”
1152	1161	1133	1133	Fudge	129	“ What a week , what a week ... ”
1162	1172	1174	1176	the Prime Minister	542	“ Had a bad one too , have you ? ”
1200	1206	1208	1208	Fudge	129	“ Yes , of course , ”
1222	1256	1208	1208	Fudge	129	“ I ’ve been having the same week you have , Prime Minister . The Brockdale Bridge ... the Bones and Vance murders ... not to mention the ruckus in the West Country ... ”
1257	1286	1287	1287	Fudge	129	“ You — er — your — I mean to say , some of your people were — were involved in those — those things , were they ? ”
1298	1304	1305	1305	he	129	“ Of course they were , ”
1308	1318	1305	1305	he	129	“ Surely you ’ve realized what ’s going on ? ”
1319	1322	1324	1326	the Prime Minister	542	“ I ... ”
1658	1663	1664	1664	he	129	“ Not to worry , ”
1668	1760	1664	1664	he	129	“ it ’s odds - on you ’ll never see me again . I ’ll only bother you if there ’s something really serious going on our end , something that ’s likely to affect the Muggles — the non - magical population , I should say . Otherwise , it ’s live and let live . And I must say , you ’re taking it a lot better than your predecessor . He tried to throw me out the window , thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition . ”
1774	1786	1769	1769	his	542	“ You ’re — you ’re not a hoax , then ? ”
1796	1799	1801	1801	Fudge	129	“ No , ”

1830	1833	1835	1837	the Prime Minister	542	“ But , ”
1852	1863	1835	1837	the Prime Minister	542	“ but why — why has nobody told me — ? ”
1864	1883	1885	1885	Fudge	129	“ The Minister of Magic only reveals him- or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day , ”
1895	1906	1885	1885	Fudge	129	“ We find it the best way to maintain secrecy . ”
1907	1911	1913	1915	the Prime Minister	542	“ But then , ”
1917	1929	1913	1915	the Prime Minister	542	“ why has n’t a former Prime Minister warned me — ? ”
1938	1952	1933	1933	Fudge	129	“ My dear Prime Minister , are you ever going to tell anybody ? ”
2354	2356	2351	2357	a man named “ Serious ” Black	634	“ Serious ”
2363	2366	2351	2357	a man named “ Serious ” Black	634	“ Hogwarts , ”
2386	2395	2396	2396	Fudge	129	“ ... I ’ve just come from Azkaban , ”
2418	2436	2438	2438	he	129	“ Middle of the North Sea , you know , nasty flight ... the dementors are in uproar ”
2441	2497	2438	2438	he	129	“ they ’ve never had a breakout before . Anyway , I had to come to you , Prime Minister . Black ’s a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin You - Know - Who ... But of course , you do n’t even know who You - Know - Who is ! ”
2513	2533	2498	2498	He	129	“ Well , sit down , sit down , I ’d better fill you in ... Have a whiskey ... ”
2661	2667	2668	2668	He	129	“ So you think that ... ”
2680	2684	2668	2668	He	129	“ Lord Vol — ”
2685	2698	2700	2700	Fudge	129	“ He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named ! ”
2702	2727	2668	2668	He	129	“ I ’m sorry ... You think that He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named is still alive , then ? ”
2728	2736	2738	2738	Fudge	129	“ Well , Dumbledore says he is , ”
2753	2816	2741	2741	he	129	“ but we ’ve never found him . If you ask me , he ’s not dangerous unless he ’s got support , so it ’s Black we ought to be worrying about . You ’ll put out that warning , then ? Excellent . Well , I hope we do n’t see each other again , Prime Minister ! Good night . ”
2879	2882	2830	2834	a harassed - looking Fudge	645	“ involved , ”
2934	2942	2943	2943	Fudge	129	“ Oh , and I almost forgot , ”
2947	3003	2943	2943	Fudge	129	“ We ’re importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament , quite routine , but the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures tells me that it ’s down in the rule book that we have to notify you if we ’re bringing highly dangerous creatures into the country . ”
3004	3011	3013	3015	the Prime Minister	542	“ I — what — dragons ? ”
3017	3022	3024	3024	Fudge	129	“ Yes , three , ”
3026	3038	3024	3024	Fudge	129	“ And a sphinx . Well , good day to you . ”
3091	3096	3098	3100	the Prime Minister	542	“ A mass breakout ? ”
3103	3114	3116	3116	Fudge	129	“ No need to worry , no need to worry ! ”
3126	3144	3116	3116	Fudge	129	“ We ’ll have them rounded up in no time — just thought you ought to know ! ”
3153	3161	3162	3162	Fudge	129	“ Now , wait just one moment ! ”
3331	3348	3350	3352	the Prime Minister	542	“ How should I know what ’s going on in the — er — Wizarding community ? ”
3355	3371	3350	3352	the Prime Minister	542	“ I have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without — ”
3372	3379	3380	3380	Fudge	129	“ We have the same concerns , ”
3383	3446	3380	3380	Fudge	129	“ The Brockdale Bridge did n’t wear out . That was n’t really a hurricane . Those murders were not the work of Muggles . And Herbert Chorley ’s family would be safer without him . We are currently making arrangements to have him transferred to St. Mungo ’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries . The move should be effected tonight . ”
3447	3459	3461	3463	the Prime Minister	542	“ What do you ... I ’m afraid I ... What ? ”
3475	3507	3465	3465	Fudge	129	“ Prime Minister , I am very sorry to have to tell you that he ’s back . He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named is back . ”
3508	3525	3465	3465	Fudge	129	“ Back ? When you say ‘ back ’ ... he ’s alive ? I mean — ”
3577	3582	3584	3584	Fudge	129	“ Yes , alive , ”
3586	3654	3584	3584	Fudge	129	“ That is — I do n’t know — is a man alive if he ca n’t be killed ? I do n’t really understand it , and Dumbledore wo n’t explain properly — but anyway , he ’s certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing , so I suppose , for the purposes of our discussion , yes , he ’s alive . ”
3699	3719	3796	3796	he	129	“ Is Serious Black with — er — He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named ? ”
3720	3725	3727	3727	Fudge	129	“ Black ? Black ? ”
3738	3795	3796	3796	he	129	“ Sirius Black , you mean ? Merlin ’s beard , no . Black ’s dead . Turns out we were — er — mistaken about Black . He was innocent after all . And he was n’t in league with He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named either . I mean , ”
3807	3855	3796	3796	he	129	“ all the evidence pointed — we had more than fifty eyewitnesses — but anyway , as I say , he ’s dead . Murdered , as a matter of fact . On Ministry of Magic premises . There ’s going to be an inquiry , actually ... ”
3945	3974	3942	3942	Fudge	129	“ But Black ’s by - the - by now . The point is , we ’re at war , Prime Minister , and steps must be taken . ”
3975	3979	3981	3983	the Prime Minister	542	“ At war ? ”
3986	3997	3981	3983	the Prime Minister	542	“ Surely that ’s a little bit of an overstatement ? ”
3998	4027	4029	4029	Fudge	129	“ He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in January , ”
4051	4091	4029	4029	Fudge	129	“ Since they have moved into the open , they have been wreaking havoc . The Brockdale Bridge — he did it , Prime Minister , he threatened a mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him and — ”
4092	4127	4129	4131	the Prime Minister	542	“ Good grief , so it ’s your fault those people were killed and I ’m having to answer questions about rusted rigging and corroded expansion joints and I do n’t know what else ! ”
4134	4138	4140	4140	Fudge	129	“ My fault ! ”
4145	4159	4140	4140	Fudge	129	“ Are you saying you would have caved in to blackmail like that ? ”
4160	4164	4166	4168	the Prime Minister	542	“ Maybe not , ”
4178	4198	4166	4168	the Prime Minister	542	“ but I would have put all my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity ! ”
4199	4212	4214	4214	Fudge	129	“ Do you really think I was n’t already making every effort ? ”
4217	4266	4214	4214	Fudge	129	“ Every Auror in the Ministry was — and is — trying to find him and round up his followers , but we happen to be talking about one of the most powerful wizards of all time , a wizard who has eluded capture for almost three decades ! ”
4267	4287	4289	4291	the Prime Minister	542	“ So I suppose you ’re going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the West Country too ? ”
4336	4342	4344	4344	Fudge	129	“ That was no hurricane , ”
4347	4351	4353	4355	the Prime Minister	542	“ Excuse me ! ”
4364	4378	4353	4355	the Prime Minister	542	“ Trees uprooted , roofs ripped off , lampposts bent , horrible injuries — ”
4379	4386	4388	4388	Fudge	129	“ It was the Death Eaters , ”
4390	4413	4388	4388	Fudge	129	“ He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named ’s followers . And ... and we suspect giant involvement . ”
4430	4434	4423	4423	he	542	“ What involvement ? ”
4438	4455	4456	4456	he	129	“ He used giants last time , when he wanted to go for the grand effect , ”
4459	4526	4456	4456	he	129	“ The Office of Misinformation has been working around the clock , we ’ve had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened , we ’ve got most of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around Somerset , but we ca n’t find the giant — it ’s been a disaster . ”
4527	4533	4535	4537	the Prime Minister	542	“ You do n’t say ! ”
4540	4554	4556	4556	Fudge	129	“ I wo n’t deny that morale is pretty low at the Ministry , ”
4558	4570	4556	4556	Fudge	129	“ What with all that , and then losing Amelia Bones . ”
4571	4575	4456	4456	he	129	“ Losing who ? ”
4576	4631	4556	4556	Fudge	129	“ Amelia Bones . Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement . We think He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named may have murdered her in person , because she was a very gifted witch and — and all the evidence was that she put up a real fight . ”
4651	4660	4662	4664	the Prime Minister	542	“ But that murder was in the newspapers , ”
4672	4722	4662	4664	the Prime Minister	542	“ Our newspapers . Amelia Bones ... it just said she was a middle - aged woman who lived alone . It was a — a nasty killing , was n’t it ? It ’s had rather a lot of publicity . The police are baffled , you see . ”
4726	4734	4735	4735	he	129	“ Well , of course they are , ”
4738	4794	4735	4735	he	129	“ Killed in a room that was locked from the inside , was n’t she ? We , on the other hand , know exactly who did it , not that that gets us any further toward catching him . And then there was Emmeline Vance , maybe you did n’t hear about that one — ”
4795	4801	4803	4805	the Prime Minister	542	“ Oh yes I did ! ”
4807	4846	4803	4805	the Prime Minister	542	“ It happened just around the corner from here , as a matter of fact . The papers had a field day with it , ‘ breakdown of law and order in the Prime Minister ’s backyard — ’ ”
4847	4857	4859	4859	Fudge	129	“ And as if all that was n’t enough , ”
4868	4888	4859	4859	Fudge	129	“ we ’ve got dementors swarming all over the place , attacking people left , right , and center ... ”
4911	4921	4922	4922	he	129	“ I thought dementors guard the prisoners in Azkaban , ”
4926	4930	4932	4932	Fudge	129	“ They did , ”
4935	4969	4932	4932	Fudge	129	“ But not anymore . They ’ve deserted the prison and joined He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named . I wo n’t pretend that was n’t a blow . ”
4970	4973	4975	4977	the Prime Minister	542	“ But , ”
4986	5005	4975	4977	the Prime Minister	542	“ did n’t you tell me they ’re the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people ? ”
5006	5025	5026	5028	The Prime Minister	542	“ That ’s right . And they ’re breeding . That ’s what ’s causing all this mist . ”
5066	5089	4975	4977	the Prime Minister	542	“ Now see here , Fudge — you ’ve got to do something ! It ’s your responsibility as Minister of Magic ! ”
5090	5146	5148	5148	Fudge	129	“ My dear Prime Minister , you ca n’t honestly think I ’m still Minister of Magic after all this ? I was sacked three days ago ! The whole Wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight . I ’ve never known them so united in my whole term of office ! ”
5194	5200	5201	5201	he	542	“ I ’m very sorry , ”
5205	5214	5201	5201	he	542	“ If there ’s anything I can do ? ”
5215	5281	5282	5282	Fudge	129	“ It ’s very kind of you , Prime Minister , but there is nothing . I was sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to introduce you to my successor . I rather thought he ’d be here by now , but of course , he ’s very busy at the moment , with so much going on . ”
5322	5340	5314	5314	Fudge	129	“ He ’ll be here in a moment , he ’s just finishing a letter to Dumbledore . ”
5341	5347	5349	5349	Fudge	129	“ I wish him luck , ”
5358	5404	5349	5349	Fudge	129	“ I ’ve been writing to Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight , but he wo n’t budge . If he ’d just been prepared to persuade the boy , I might still be ... Well , maybe Scrimgeour will have more success . ”
5435	5460	5512	5512	Fudge	129	“ To the Prime Minister of Muggles . Requesting a meeting . Urgent . Kindly respond immediately . Rufus Scrimgeour , Minister of Magic . ”
5461	5468	5470	5472	the Prime Minister	542	“ Yes , yes , fine , ”
5646	5652	5661	5661	his	129	“ How do you do ? ”
5685	5691	5692	5692	he	140	“ Fudge told you everything ? ”
5716	5721	5723	5725	the Prime Minister	542	“ Er — yes , ”
5727	5743	5723	5725	the Prime Minister	542	“ And if you do n’t mind , I ’d rather that door remained unlocked . ”
5744	5752	5754	5754	Scrimgeour	140	“ I ’d rather not be interrupted , ”
5757	5761	5762	5762	he	140	“ or watched , ”
5780	5810	5762	5762	he	140	“ Right , well , I ’m a busy man , so let ’s get down to business . First of all , we need to discuss your security . ”
5824	5841	5815	5815	himself	542	“ I am perfectly happy with the security I ’ve already got , thank you very — ”
5842	5849	5850	5850	Scrimgeour	140	“ Well , we ’re not , ”
5854	5883	5850	5850	Scrimgeour	140	“ It ’ll be a poor lookout for the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse . The new secretary in your outer office — ”
5884	5902	5904	5906	the Prime Minister	542	“ I ’m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt , if that ’s what you ’re suggesting ! ”
5909	5925	5904	5906	the Prime Minister	542	“ He ’s highly efficient , gets through twice the work the rest of them — ”
5926	5935	5937	5937	Scrimgeour	140	“ That ’s because he ’s a wizard , ”
5946	5962	5937	5937	Scrimgeour	140	“ A highly trained Auror , who has been assigned to you for your protection . ”
5963	5970	5972	5974	the Prime Minister	542	“ Now , wait a moment ! ”
5976	5995	5972	5974	the Prime Minister	542	“ You ca n’t just put your people into my office , I decide who works for me — ”
5996	6005	6007	6007	Scrimgeour	140	“ I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt ? ”
6010	6022	6007	6007	Scrimgeour	140	“ I am — that ’s to say , I was — ”
6023	6033	6035	6035	Scrimgeour	140	“ Then there ’s no problem , is there ? ”
6037	6056	6058	6060	the Prime Minister	542	“ I ... well , as long as Shacklebolt ’s work continues to be ... er ... excellent , ”
6071	6082	6083	6083	he	542	“ Now , about Herbert Chorley , your Junior Minister , ”
6086	6100	6083	6083	he	542	“ The one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck . ”
6101	6106	6108	6110	the Prime Minister	542	“ What about him ? ”
6112	6124	6126	6126	Scrimgeour	140	“ He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperius Curse , ”
6128	6142	6126	6126	Scrimgeour	140	“ It ’s addled his brains , but he could still be dangerous . ”
6143	6149	6151	6153	the Prime Minister	542	“ He ’s only quacking ! ”
6156	6171	6151	6153	the Prime Minister	542	“ Surely a bit of a rest ... Maybe go easy on the drink ... ”
6172	6205	6207	6207	Scrimgeour	140	“ A team of Healers from St. Mungo ’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as we speak . So far he has attempted to strangle three of them , ”
6209	6225	6207	6207	Scrimgeour	140	“ I think it best that we remove him from Muggle society for a while . ”
6226	6241	6243	6245	the Prime Minister	542	“ I ... well ... He ’ll be all right , wo n’t he ? ”
6259	6317	6248	6248	Scrimgeour	140	“ Well , that ’s really all I had to say . I will keep you posted of developments , Prime Minister — or , at least , I shall probably be too busy to come personally , in which case I shall send Fudge here . He has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity . ”
6384	6410	6380	6380	him	542	“ But for heaven ’s sake — you ’re wizards ! You can do magic ! Surely you can sort out — well — anything ! ”
6438	6454	6434	6434	he	129	“ The trouble is , the other side can do magic too , Prime Minister . ”
6648	6651	6643	6645	another hooded figure	726	“ Wait ! ”
6711	6716	6718	6719	a woman	729	“ Just a fox , ”
6728	6739	6718	6719	a woman	729	“ I thought perhaps an Auror — Cissy , wait ! ”
6769	6778	6742	6754	quarry , who had paused and looked back at the flash of light	730	“ Cissy — Narcissa — listen to me — ”
6797	6803	6791	6792	the other	733	“ Go back , Bellatrix ! ”
6804	6811	6779	6781	The second woman	731	“ You must listen to me ! ”
6812	6828	6791	6792	the other	733	“ I ’ve listened already . I ’ve made my decision . Leave me alone ! ”
6894	6899	6901	6901	Bellatrix	145	“ He lives here ? ”
6908	6929	6901	6901	Bellatrix	145	“ Here ? In this Muggle dunghill ? We must be the first of our kind ever to set foot — ”
6954	6959	6936	6936	she	144	“ Cissy , wait ! ”
7040	7055	7015	7015	she	749	“ Cissy , you must not do this , you ca n’t trust him — ”
7056	7067	7092	7092	she	145	“ The Dark Lord trusts him , does n’t he ? ”
7068	7079	7080	7080	Bellatrix	145	“ The Dark Lord is ... I believe ... mistaken , ”
7103	7130	7092	7092	she	145	“ In any case , we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone . This is a betrayal of the Dark Lord ’s — ”
7131	7137	7139	7139	Narcissa	144	“ Let go , Bellatrix ! ”
7164	7175	7160	7160	Bellatrix	145	“ Cissy , your own sister ? You would n’t — ”
7176	7186	7187	7187	Narcissa	144	“ There is nothing I would n’t do anymore ! ”
7228	7231	7216	7216	Bellatrix	145	“ Narcissa ! ”
7454	7457	7459	7460	the man	764	“ Narcissa ! ”
7481	7487	7459	7460	the man	764	“ What a pleasant surprise ! ”
7488	7491	7492	7492	she	144	“ Severus , ”
7499	7510	7492	7492	she	144	“ May I speak to you ? It ’s urgent . ”
7511	7516	7517	7517	He	764	“ But of course . ”
7539	7542	7543	7543	she	144	“ Snape , ”
7551	7554	7555	7555	he	764	“ Bellatrix , ”
7739	7749	7750	7750	Snape	147	“ So , what can I do for you ? ”
7763	7774	7775	7775	Narcissa	144	“ We ... we are alone , are n’t we ? ”
7779	7801	7802	7802	He	147	“ Yes , of course . Well , Wormtail ’s here , but we ’re not counting vermin , are we ? ”
7836	7849	7851	7851	Snape	147	“ As you have clearly realized , Wormtail , we have guests , ”
7909	7912	7913	7913	he	764	“ Narcissa ! ”
7921	7928	7913	7913	he	764	“ And Bellatrix ! How charming — ”
7929	7942	7944	7944	Snape	147	“ Wormtail will get us drinks , if you ’d like them , ”
7946	7956	7944	7944	Snape	147	“ And then he will return to his bedroom . ”
7968	7975	7976	7976	he	148	“ I am not your servant ! ”
7984	8003	7961	7961	Snape	147	“ Really ? I was under the impression that the Dark Lord placed you here to assist me . ”
8004	8023	7961	7961	Snape	147	“ To assist , yes — but not to make you drinks and — and clean your house ! ”
8024	8040	8042	8042	Snape	147	“ I had no idea , Wormtail , that you were craving more dangerous assignments , ”
8045	8060	8042	8042	Snape	147	“ This can be easily arranged : I shall speak to the Dark Lord — ”
8061	8073	7961	7961	Snape	147	“ I can speak to him myself if I want to ! ”
8074	8080	8082	8082	Snape	147	“ Of course you can , ”
8086	8106	8082	8082	Snape	147	“ But in the meantime , bring us drinks . Some of the elf - made wine will do . ”
8232	8237	8238	8238	he	148	“ The Dark Lord , ”
8270	8301	8264	8264	she	144	“ Severus , I ’m sorry to come here like this , but I had to see you . I think you are the only one who can help me — ”
8343	8347	8349	8349	Snape	147	“ My apologies , ”
8351	8377	8349	8349	Snape	147	“ He has lately taken to listening at doors , I do n’t know what he means by it ... You were saying , Narcissa ? ”
8389	8413	8378	8378	She	144	“ Severus , I know I ought not to be here , I have been told to say nothing to anyone , but — ”
8414	8423	8425	8425	Bellatrix	145	“ Then you ought to hold your tongue ! ”
8427	8433	8425	8425	Bellatrix	145	“ Particularly in present company ! ”
8434	8440	8442	8442	Snape	147	“ ‘ Present company ’ ? ”
8445	8457	8442	8442	Snape	147	“ And what am I to understand by that , Bellatrix ? ”
8458	8474	8425	8425	Bellatrix	145	“ That I do n’t trust you , Snape , as you very well know ! ”
8524	8552	8554	8554	Snape	147	“ Narcissa , I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is bursting to say ; it will save tedious interruptions . Well , continue , Bellatrix , ”
8556	8567	8554	8554	Snape	147	“ Why is it that you do not trust me ? ”
8568	8573	8574	8574	she	145	“ A hundred reasons ! ”
8592	8706	8574	8574	she	145	“ Where to start ! Where were you when the Dark Lord fell ? Why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished ? What have you been doing all these years that you ’ve lived in Dumbledore ’s pocket ? Why did you stop the Dark Lord procuring the Sorcerer ’s Stone ? Why did you not return at once when the Dark Lord was reborn ? Where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the Dark Lord ? And why , Snape , is Harry Potter still alive , when you have had him at your mercy for five years ? ”
8742	8848	8739	8739	Snape	147	“ Before I answer you — oh yes , Bellatrix , I am going to answer ! You can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back , and carry false tales of my treachery to the Dark Lord ! Before I answer you , I say , let me ask a question in turn . Do you really think that the Dark Lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions ? And do you really think that , had I not been able to give satisfactory answers , I would be sitting here talking to you ? ”
8852	8861	8739	8739	Snape	147	“ I know he believes you , but ... ”
8862	8896	9007	9007	Snape	147	“ You think he is mistaken ? Or that I have somehow hoodwinked him ? Fooled the Dark Lord , the greatest wizard , the most accomplished Legilimens the world has ever seen ? ”
8933	8995	8920	8920	He	147	“ You ask where I was when the Dark Lord fell . I was where he had ordered me to be , at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , because he wished me to spy upon Albus Dumbledore . You know , I presume , that it was on the Dark Lord ’s orders that I took up the post ? ”
9011	9041	9043	9043	he	147	“ You ask why I did not attempt to find him when he vanished . For the same reason that Avery , Yaxley , the Carrows , Greyback , Lucius ”
9051	9104	9043	9043	he	147	“ and many others did not attempt to find him . I believed him finished . I am not proud of it , I was wrong , but there it is ... If he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time , he would have very few followers left . ”
9105	9111	9113	9113	Bellatrix	145	“ He ’d have me ! ”
9116	9128	9113	9113	Bellatrix	145	“ I , who spent many years in Azkaban for him ! ”
9129	9137	9139	9139	Snape	147	“ Yes , indeed , most admirable , ”
9145	9168	9139	9139	Snape	147	“ Of course , you were n’t a lot of use to him in prison , but the gesture was undoubtedly fine — ”
9169	9172	9173	9173	she	145	“ Gesture ! ”
9184	9202	9179	9179	she	145	“ While I endured the dementors , you remained at Hogwarts , comfortably playing Dumbledore ’s pet ! ”
9203	9207	9209	9209	Snape	147	“ Not quite , ”
9212	9249	9209	9209	Snape	147	“ He would n’t give me the Defense Against the Dark Arts job , you know . Seemed to think it might , ah , bring about a relapse ... tempt me into my old ways . ”
9250	9267	9268	9268	she	145	“ This was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord , not to teach your favorite subject ? ”
9271	9294	9268	9268	she	145	“ Why did you stay there all that time , Snape ? Still spying on Dumbledore for a master you believed dead ? ”
9295	9298	9300	9300	Snape	147	“ Hardly , ”
9302	9348	9300	9300	Snape	147	“ although the Dark Lord is pleased that I never deserted my post : I had sixteen years of information on Dumbledore to give him when he returned , a rather more useful welcome - back present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant Azkaban is ... ”
9349	9354	9209	9209	Snape	147	“ But you stayed — ”
9355	9363	9365	9365	Snape	147	“ Yes , Bellatrix , I stayed , ”
9377	9451	9452	9452	he	147	“ I had a comfortable job that I preferred to a stint in Azkaban . They were rounding up the Death Eaters , you know . Dumbledore ’s protection kept me out of jail ; it was most convenient and I used it . I repeat : The Dark Lord does not complain that I stayed , so I do not see why you do . I think you next wanted to know , ”
9469	9608	9452	9452	he	147	“ why I stood between the Dark Lord and the Sorcerer ’s Stone . That is easily answered . He did not know whether he could trust me . He thought , like you , that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to Dumbledore ’s stooge . He was in a pitiable condition , very weak , sharing the body of a mediocre wizard . He did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to Dumbledore or the Ministry . I deeply regret that he did not trust me . He would have returned to power three years sooner . As it was , I saw only greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal the stone and , I admit , I did all I could to thwart him . ”
9624	9652	9615	9615	she	145	“ But you did n’t return when he came back , you did n’t fly back to him at once when you felt the Dark Mark burn — ”
9653	9669	9452	9452	he	147	“ Correct . I returned two hours later . I returned on Dumbledore ’s orders . ”
9670	9676	9677	9677	she	145	“ On Dumbledore ’s — ? ”
9685	9688	9690	9690	Snape	147	“ Think ! ”
9695	9867	9690	9690	Snape	147	“ Think ! By waiting two hours , just two hours , I ensured that I could remain at Hogwarts as a spy ! By allowing Dumbledore to think that I was only returning to the Dark Lord ’s side because I was ordered to , I have been able to pass information on Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix ever since ! Consider , Bellatrix : The Dark Mark had been growing stronger for months . I knew he must be about to return , all the Death Eaters knew ! I had plenty of time to think about what I wanted to do , to plan my next move , to escape like Karkaroff , did n’t I ? The Dark Lord ’s initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely , I assure you , when I explained that I remained faithful , although Dumbledore thought I was his man . Yes , the Dark Lord thought that I had left him forever , but he was wrong . ”
9868	9876	9878	9878	Bellatrix	145	“ But what use have you been ? ”
9880	9890	9878	9878	Bellatrix	145	“ What useful information have we had from you ? ”
9891	9903	9905	9905	Snape	147	“ My information has been conveyed directly to the Dark Lord , ”
9907	9918	9905	9905	Snape	147	“ If he chooses not to share it with you — ”
9919	9926	9928	9928	Bellatrix	145	“ He shares everything with me ! ”
9935	9947	9928	9928	Bellatrix	145	“ He calls me his most loyal , his most faithful — ”
9948	9952	9954	9954	Snape	147	“ Does he ? ”
9965	9977	9954	9954	Snape	147	“ Does he still , after the fiasco at the Ministry ? ”
9978	9985	9987	9987	Bellatrix	145	“ That was not my fault ! ”
9991	10013	9987	9987	Bellatrix	145	“ The Dark Lord has , in the past , entrusted me with his most precious — if Lucius had n’t — ”
10014	10028	10030	10030	Narcissa	144	“ Do n’t you dare — do n’t you dare blame my husband ! ”
10045	10053	10055	10055	Snape	147	“ There is no point apportioning blame , ”
10058	10066	10055	10055	Snape	147	“ What is done , is done . ”
10067	10073	10075	10075	Bellatrix	145	“ But not by you ! ”
10078	10100	10075	10075	Bellatrix	145	“ No , you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers , were you not , Snape ? ”
10101	10109	10111	10111	Snape	147	“ My orders were to remain behind , ”
10113	10168	10111	10111	Snape	147	“ Perhaps you disagree with the Dark Lord , perhaps you think that Dumbledore would not have noticed if I had joined forces with the Death Eaters to fight the Order of the Phoenix ? And — forgive me — you speak of dangers ... you were facing six teenagers , were you not ? ”
10169	10188	10190	10190	Bellatrix	145	“ They were joined , as you very well know , by half of the Order before long ! ”
10192	10222	10190	10190	Bellatrix	145	“ And , while we are on the subject of the Order , you still claim you can not reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters , do n’t you ? ”
10223	10307	10111	10111	Snape	147	“ I am not the Secret - Keeper ; I can not speak the name of the place . You understand how the enchantment works , I think ? The Dark Lord is satisfied with the information I have passed him on the Order . It led , as perhaps you have guessed , to the recent capture and murder of Emmeline Vance , and it certainly helped dispose of Sirius Black , though I give you full credit for finishing him off . ”
10322	10357	10308	10308	He	785	“ You are avoiding my last question , Snape . Harry Potter . You could have killed him at any point in the past five years . You have not done it . Why ? ”
10358	10369	10371	10371	Snape	147	“ Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord ? ”
10373	10387	10371	10371	Snape	147	“ He ... lately , we ... I am asking you , Snape ! ”
10388	10412	10308	10308	He	785	“ If I had murdered Harry Potter , the Dark Lord could not have used his blood to regenerate , making him invincible — ”
10413	10424	10425	10425	she	787	“ You claim you foresaw his use of the boy ! ”
10428	10479	10308	10308	He	785	“ I do not claim it ; I had no idea of his plans ; I have already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead . I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Potter survived , at least until a year ago ... ”
10480	10489	10308	10308	He	785	“ But why did you keep him alive ? ”
10490	10742	10308	10308	He	785	“ Have you not understood me ? It was only Dumbledore ’s protection that was keeping me out of Azkaban ! Do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me ? But there was more to it than that . I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him , rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard , which was how he had survived the Dark Lord ’s attack . Indeed , many of the Dark Lord ’s old followers thought Potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more . I was curious , I admit it , and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle . Of course , it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all . He has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends . He is mediocre to the last degree , though as obnoxious and self - satisfied as was his father before him . I have done my utmost to have him thrown out of Hogwarts , where I believe he scarcely belongs , but kill him , or allow him to be killed in front of me ? I would have been a fool to risk it with Dumbledore close at hand . ”
10743	10759	10761	10761	Bellatrix	145	“ And through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore has never suspected you ? ”
10763	10779	10761	10761	Bellatrix	145	“ He has no idea of your true allegiance , he trusts you implicitly still ? ”
10780	10788	10790	10790	Snape	147	“ I have played my part well , ”
10792	10870	10790	10790	Snape	147	“ And you overlook Dumbledore ’s greatest weakness : He has to believe the best of people . I spun him a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff , fresh from my Death Eater days , and he embraced me with open arms — though , as I say , never allowing me nearer the Dark Arts than he could help . Dumbledore has been a great wizard — oh yes , he has , ”
10881	10955	10790	10790	Snape	147	“ the Dark Lord acknowledges it . I am pleased to say , however , that Dumbledore is growing old . The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook him . He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were . But through all these years , he has never stopped trusting Severus Snape , and therein lies my great value to the Dark Lord . ”
10984	10997	10978	10978	Snape	147	“ Now ... you came to ask me for help , Narcissa ? ”
11010	11042	11004	11004	her	144	“ Yes , Severus . I — I think you are the only one who can help me , I have nowhere else to turn . Lucius is in jail and ... ”
11057	11069	11070	11070	Narcissa	144	“ The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it , ”
11078	11096	11070	11070	Narcissa	144	“ He wishes none to know of the plan . It is ... very secret . But — ”
11097	11110	11112	11112	Snape	147	“ If he has forbidden it , you ought not to speak , ”
11116	11125	11112	11112	Snape	147	“ The Dark Lord ’s word is law . ”
11152	11155	11156	11156	she	145	“ There ! ”
11163	11181	11156	11156	she	145	“ Even Snape says so : You were told not to talk , so hold your silence ! ”
11222	11233	11234	11234	he	147	“ It so happens that I know of the plan , ”
11241	11280	11234	11234	he	147	“ I am one of the few the Dark Lord has told . Nevertheless , had I not been in on the secret , Narcissa , you would have been guilty of great treachery to the Dark Lord . ”
11281	11290	11292	11292	Narcissa	144	“ I thought you must know about it ! ”
11298	11306	11292	11292	Narcissa	144	“ He trusts you so , Severus ... ”
11307	11314	11316	11316	Bellatrix	145	“ You know about the plan ? ”
11330	11334	11316	11316	Bellatrix	145	“ You know ? ”
11335	11338	11340	11340	Snape	147	“ Certainly , ”
11342	11379	11340	11340	Snape	147	“ But what help do you require , Narcissa ? If you are imagining I can persuade the Dark Lord to change his mind , I am afraid there is no hope , none at all . ”
11380	11383	11384	11384	she	145	“ Severus , ”
11394	11402	11384	11384	she	145	“ My son ... my only son ... ”
11403	11409	11411	11411	Bellatrix	145	“ Draco should be proud , ”
11414	11457	11411	11411	Bellatrix	145	“ The Dark Lord is granting him a great honor . And I will say this for Draco : He is n’t shrinking away from his duty , he seems glad of a chance to prove himself , excited at the prospect — ”
11473	11514	11574	11574	Snape	147	“ That ’s because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store ! Why , Severus ? Why my son ? It is too dangerous ! This is vengeance for Lucius ’s mistake , I know it ! ”
11544	11557	11558	11558	she	144	“ That ’s why he ’s chosen Draco , is n’t it ? ”
11561	11566	11558	11558	she	144	“ To punish Lucius ? ”
11567	11572	11574	11574	Snape	147	“ If Draco succeeds , ”
11582	11591	11574	11574	Snape	147	“ he will be honored above all others . ”
11592	11599	11601	11601	Narcissa	144	“ But he wo n’t succeed ! ”
11603	11615	11601	11601	Narcissa	144	“ How can he , when the Dark Lord himself — ? ”
11626	11688	11623	11623	her	144	“ I only meant ... that nobody has yet succeeded ... Severus ... please ... You are , you have always been , Draco ’s favorite teacher ... You are Lucius ’s old friend ... I beg you ... You are the Dark Lord ’s favorite , his most trusted advisor ... Will you speak to him , persuade him — ? ”
11689	11708	11710	11710	Snape	147	“ The Dark Lord will not be persuaded , and I am not stupid enough to attempt it , ”
11713	11771	11710	11710	Snape	147	“ I can not pretend that the Dark Lord is not angry with Lucius . Lucius was supposed to be in charge . He got himself captured , along with how many others , and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain . Yes , the Dark Lord is angry , Narcissa , very angry indeed . ”
11772	11785	11787	11787	Narcissa	144	“ Then I am right , he has chosen Draco in revenge ! ”
11789	11806	11787	11787	Narcissa	144	“ He does not mean him to succeed , he wants him to be killed trying ! ”
11856	11891	11853	11853	she	144	“ You could do it . You could do it instead of Draco , Severus . You would succeed , of course you would , and he would reward you beyond all of us — ”
11915	11969	11911	11911	he	147	“ He intends me to do it in the end , I think . But he is determined that Draco should try first . You see , in the unlikely event that Draco succeeds , I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little longer , fulfilling my useful role as spy . ”
11970	11986	11911	11911	he	147	“ In other words , it does n’t matter to him if Draco is killed ! ”
11987	11995	11997	11997	Snape	147	“ The Dark Lord is very angry , ”
12000	12025	11997	11997	Snape	147	“ He failed to hear the prophecy . You know as well as I do , Narcissa , that he does not forgive easily . ”
12041	12050	11997	11997	Snape	147	“ My only son ... my only son ... ”
12051	12057	12059	12059	Bellatrix	145	“ You should be proud ! ”
12062	12084	12059	12059	Bellatrix	145	“ If I had sons , I would be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord ! ”
12135	12149	12121	12121	He	147	“ Narcissa , that ’s enough . Drink this . Listen to me . ”
12166	12178	12121	12121	He	147	“ It might be possible ... for me to help Draco . ”
12193	12218	12179	12179	She	792	“ Severus — oh , Severus — you would help him ? Would you look after him , see he comes to no harm ? ”
12219	12224	12225	12225	She	792	“ I can try . ”
12266	12289	12237	12237	she	792	“ If you are there to protect him ... Severus , will you swear it ? Will you make the Unbreakable Vow ? ”
12290	12295	12237	12237	she	792	“ The Unbreakable Vow ? ”
12316	12358	12304	12304	Bellatrix	145	“ Are n’t you listening , Narcissa ? Oh , he ’ll try , I ’m sure ... The usual empty words , the usual slithering out of action ... oh , on the Dark Lord ’s orders , of course ! ”
12387	12399	12400	12400	he	147	“ Certainly , Narcissa , I shall make the Unbreakable Vow , ”
12404	12415	12400	12400	he	147	“ Perhaps your sister will consent to be our Bonder . ”
12444	12453	12455	12455	Snape	147	“ You will need your wand , Bellatrix , ”
12466	12477	12478	12478	he	147	“ And you will need to move a little closer , ”
12506	12530	12503	12503	Narcissa	144	“ Will you , Severus , watch over my son , Draco , as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord ’s wishes ? ”
12531	12535	12537	12537	Snape	147	“ I will , ”
12563	12580	12503	12503	Narcissa	144	“ And will you , to the best of your ability , protect him from harm ? ”
12581	12585	12587	12587	Snape	147	“ I will , ”
12611	12626	12628	12628	Narcissa	144	“ And , should it prove necessary ... if it seems Draco will fail ... ”
12645	12662	12628	12628	Narcissa	144	“ will you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform ? ”
12684	12688	12690	12690	Snape	147	“ I will , ”
12943	12959	12961	12963	one agitated Obliviator	799	“ We ’re not allowed to talk about it , do n’t ask me anything , ”
13101	13106	13100	13100	Potter	136	“ the Chosen One , ”
13402	13422	13424	13425	the Minister	826	“ For obvious reasons , the Ministry will not be going into detail about its stringent new security plans , ”
13480	13510	13476	13478	Mrs. Augusta Longbottom	161	“ My grandson , Neville — a good friend of Harry Potter ’s , incidentally , who fought the Death Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in June and — ”
13851	13853	13872	13872	Dumbledore	138	“ yes ”
14165	14177	14162	14162	Vernon	165	“ Who the blazes is calling at this time of night ? ”
14238	14261	14262	14262	Harry	136	“ Good evening . You must be Mr. Dursley . I daresay Harry has told you I would be coming for him ? ”
14386	14405	14407	14407	Dumbledore	138	“ Judging by your look of stunned disbelief , Harry did not warn you that I was coming , ”
14410	14439	14407	14407	Dumbledore	138	“ However , let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house . It is unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times . ”
14454	14465	14467	14467	Dumbledore	138	“ It is a long time since my last visit , ”
14478	14488	14467	14467	Dumbledore	138	“ I must say , your agapanthus are flourishing . ”
14575	14582	14584	14584	Dumbledore	138	“ Ah , good evening Harry , ”
14602	14607	14584	14584	Dumbledore	138	“ Excellent , excellent . ”
14636	14638	14627	14638	any man who could look at Harry and say “ excellent ”	3757	“ excellent ”
14652	14661	14662	14662	he	165	“ I do n’t mean to be rude — ”
14675	14687	14688	14688	Dumbledore	138	“ — yet , sadly , accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often , ”
14694	14714	14688	14688	Dumbledore	138	“ Best to say nothing at all , my dear man . Ah , and this must be Petunia . ”
14764	14768	14770	14770	Dumbledore	138	“ Albus Dumbledore , ”
14781	14789	14790	14790	Harry	136	“ We have corresponded , of course . ”
14819	14829	14811	14812	Aunt Petunia	168	“ And this must be your son , Dudley ? ”
14897	14911	14894	14894	he	138	“ Shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room ? ”
14972	14983	14984	14984	Harry	136	“ Are n’t — are n’t we leaving , sir ? ”
14988	15007	15009	15009	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , indeed we are , but there are a few matters we need to discuss first , ”
15011	15039	15009	15009	Dumbledore	138	“ And I would prefer not to do so in the open . We shall trespass upon your aunt and uncle ’s hospitality only a little longer . ”
15040	15047	15080	15080	He	138	“ You will , will you ? ”
15067	15070	15072	15072	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , ”
15075	15079	15072	15072	Dumbledore	138	“ I shall . ”
15138	15146	15148	15148	Dumbledore	138	“ We may as well be comfortable , ”
15181	15190	15152	15152	he	138	“ Sir — what happened to your — ? ”
15191	15196	15198	15198	Dumbledore	138	“ Later , Harry , ”
15200	15205	15198	15198	Dumbledore	138	“ Please sit down . ”
15226	15239	15240	15240	Dumbledore	138	“ I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment , ”
15246	15264	15240	15240	Dumbledore	138	“ but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness . ”
15312	15322	15324	15324	Dumbledore	138	“ Madam Rosmerta ’s finest oak - matured mead , ”
15404	15409	15411	15411	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , Harry , ”
15417	15471	15411	15411	Dumbledore	138	“ a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us . By us , I mean the Order of the Phoenix . But first of all I must tell you that Sirius ’s will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned . ”
15501	15506	15484	15484	Harry	136	“ Oh . Right . ”
15507	15518	15519	15519	Dumbledore	138	“ This is , in the main , fairly straightforward , ”
15523	15555	15519	15519	Dumbledore	138	“ You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts , and you inherit all of Sirius ’s personal possessions . The slightly problematic part of the legacy — ”
15556	15562	15564	15565	Uncle Vernon	165	“ His godfather ’s dead ? ”
15605	15613	15598	15598	he	136	“ He ’s dead ? His godfather ? ”
15614	15617	15619	15619	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , ”
15635	15639	15640	15640	he	138	“ Our problem , ”
15653	15666	15640	15640	he	138	“ is that Sirius also left you number twelve , Grimmauld Place . ”
15667	15675	15677	15678	Uncle Vernon	165	“ He ’s been left a house ? ”
15691	15700	15702	15702	Harry	136	“ You can keep using it as headquarters , ”
15704	15722	15702	15702	Harry	136	“ I do n’t care . You can have it , I do n’t really want it . ”
15773	15778	15780	15780	Dumbledore	138	“ That is generous , ”
15782	15793	15780	15780	Dumbledore	138	“ We have , however , vacated the building temporarily . ”
15794	15797	15803	15803	Dumbledore	138	“ Why ? ”
15798	15801	15803	15803	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , ”
15828	15923	15809	15810	Uncle Vernon	165	“ Black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line , to the next male with the name of ‘ Black . ’ Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother , Regulus , predeceased him and both were childless . While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house , it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it can not be owned by anyone other than a pureblood . ”
15954	15960	15961	15961	he	136	“ I bet there has , ”
15964	15967	15969	15969	Dumbledore	138	“ Quite , ”
15971	16008	15969	15969	Dumbledore	138	“ And if such an enchantment exists , then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius ’s living relatives , which would mean his cousin , Bellatrix Lestrange . ”
16045	16048	16049	16049	he	136	“ No , ”
16052	16067	16069	16069	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , obviously we would prefer that she did n’t get it either , ”
16072	16143	16069	16069	Dumbledore	138	“ The situation is fraught with complications . We do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it , for example , making it Unplottable , will hold now that ownership has passed from Sirius ’s hands . It might be that Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment . Naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position . ”
16144	16161	16167	16167	Dumbledore	138	“ But how are you going to find out if I ’m allowed to own it ? ”
16162	16165	16167	16167	Dumbledore	138	“ Fortunately , ”
16169	16176	16167	16167	Dumbledore	138	“ there is a simple test . ”
16202	16212	16198	16199	Uncle Vernon	165	“ Will you get these ruddy things off us ? ”
16246	16254	16260	16260	he	138	“ Oh , I ’m so sorry , ”
16271	16286	16260	16260	he	138	“ But it would have been better manners to drink it , you know . ”
16329	16333	16334	16334	Dumbledore	138	“ You see , ”
16352	16366	16334	16334	Dumbledore	138	“ if you have indeed inherited the house , you have also inherited — ”
16480	16487	16476	16477	Uncle Vernon	165	“ What the hell is that ? ”
16488	16491	16493	16493	Dumbledore	138	“ Kreacher , ”
16495	16508	16510	16513	the house - elf	873	“ Kreacher wo n’t , Kreacher wo n’t , Kreacher wo n’t ! ”
16533	16574	16510	16513	the house - elf	873	“ Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix , oh yes , Kreacher belongs to the Blacks , Kreacher wants his new mistress , Kreacher wo n’t go to the Potter brat , Kreacher wo n’t , wo n’t , wo n’t — ”
16575	16583	16585	16585	Dumbledore	138	“ As you can see , Harry , ”
16594	16604	16589	16589	Kreacher	172	“ wo n’t , wo n’t , wo n’t , ”
16605	16618	16510	16513	the house - elf	873	“ Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership . ”
16619	16625	16627	16627	Harry	136	“ I do n’t care , ”
16642	16649	16627	16627	Harry	136	“ I do n’t want him . ”
16650	16663	16510	16513	the house - elf	873	“ Wo n’t , wo n’t , wo n’t , wo n’t — ”
16664	16699	16627	16627	Harry	136	“ You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix Lestrange ? Bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for the past year ? ”
16700	16713	16510	16513	the house - elf	873	“ Wo n’t , wo n’t , wo n’t , wo n’t — ”
16756	16762	16764	16764	Dumbledore	138	“ Give him an order , ”
16766	16802	16764	16764	Dumbledore	138	“ If he has passed into your ownership , he will have to obey . If not , then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress . ”
16803	16815	16855	16855	He	172	“ Wo n’t , wo n’t , wo n’t , WON’T ! ”
16835	16841	16816	16816	Kreacher	172	“ Kreacher , shut up ! ”
16914	16921	16923	16923	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , that simplifies matters , ”
16926	16952	16923	16923	Dumbledore	138	“ It seems that Sirius knew what he was doing . You are the rightful owner of number twelve , Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher . ”
16953	16966	16967	16967	Harry	136	“ Do I — do I have to keep him with me ? ”
16980	16989	16991	16991	Dumbledore	138	“ Not if you do n’t want to , ”
16993	17030	16991	16991	Dumbledore	138	“ If I might make a suggestion , you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there . In that way , the other house - elves could keep an eye on him . ”
17031	17034	17036	17036	Harry	136	“ Yeah , ”
17040	17072	17036	17036	Harry	136	“ yeah , I ’ll do that . Er — Kreacher — I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other house - elves . ”
17111	17114	17116	17116	Dumbledore	138	“ Good , ”
17118	17156	17116	17116	Dumbledore	138	“ There is also the matter of the hippogriff , Buckbeak . Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died , but Buckbeak is yours now , so if you would prefer to make different arrangements — ”
17157	17160	17162	17162	Harry	136	“ No , ”
17166	17180	17162	17162	Harry	136	“ he can stay with Hagrid . I think Buckbeak would prefer that . ”
17181	17187	17189	17189	Dumbledore	138	“ Hagrid will be delighted , ”
17193	17255	17189	17189	Dumbledore	138	“ He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again . Incidentally , we have decided , in the interests of Buckbeak ’s safety , to rechristen him ‘ Witherwings ’ for the time being , though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death . Now , Harry , is your trunk packed ? ”
17256	17259	17269	17269	Dumbledore	138	“ Erm ... ”
17260	17268	17269	17269	Dumbledore	138	“ Doubtful that I would turn up ? ”
17273	17285	17287	17287	Harry	136	“ I ’ll just go and — er — finish off , ”
17442	17450	17439	17439	he	136	“ Professor — I ’m ready now . ”
17451	17454	17456	17456	Dumbledore	138	“ Good , ”
17458	17466	17468	17468	he	136	“ Just one last thing , then . ”
17478	17497	17468	17468	he	136	“ As you will no doubt be aware , Harry comes of age in a year ’s time — ”
17498	17501	17503	17504	Aunt Petunia	168	“ No , ”
17516	17521	17523	17523	Dumbledore	138	“ I ’m sorry ? ”
17526	17553	17468	17468	he	136	“ No , he does n’t . He ’s a month younger than Dudley , and Dudders does n’t turn eighteen until the year after next . ”
17554	17557	17559	17559	Dumbledore	138	“ Ah , ”
17562	17576	17559	17559	Dumbledore	138	“ but in the Wizarding world , we come of age at seventeen . ”
17581	17584	17577	17578	Uncle Vernon	165	“ Preposterous , ”
17590	17683	17684	17684	Dumbledore	138	“ Now , as you already know , the wizard called Lord Voldemort has returned to this country . The Wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare . Harry , whom Lord Voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions , is in even greater danger now than the day when I left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago , with a letter explaining about his parents ’ murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him as though he were your own . ”
17725	17783	17689	17689	his	138	“ You did not do as I asked . You have never treated Harry as a son . He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands . The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you . ”
17807	17817	17819	17820	Uncle Vernon	165	“ Us — mistreat Dudders ? What d’you — ? ”
17844	17954	17837	17837	he	138	“ The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house ‘ home . ’ However miserable he has been here , however unwelcome , however badly treated , you have at least , grudgingly , allowed him houseroom . This magic will cease to operate the moment that Harry turns seventeen ; in other words , at the moment he becomes a man . I ask only this : that you allow Harry to return , once more , to this house , before his seventeenth birthday , which will ensure that the protection continues until that time . ”
18005	18017	18027	18027	his	138	“ Well , Harry ... time for us to be off , ”
18032	18038	18039	18039	he	138	“ Until we meet again , ”
18073	18076	18078	18078	Harry	136	“ Bye , ”
18103	18116	18117	18117	he	138	“ We do not want to be encumbered by these just now , ”
18126	18155	18117	18117	he	138	“ I shall send them to the Burrow to await us there . However , I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak ... just in case . ”
18221	18242	18206	18206	his	138	“ And now , Harry , let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress , adventure . ”
18363	18373	18374	18374	he	138	“ Keep your wand at the ready , Harry , ”
18378	18394	18330	18330	he	136	“ But I thought I ’m not allowed to use magic outside school , sir ? ”
18395	18402	18404	18404	Dumbledore	138	“ If there is an attack , ”
18406	18437	18404	18404	Dumbledore	138	“ I give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you . However , I do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight . ”
18438	18444	18330	18330	he	136	“ Why not , sir ? ”
18445	18451	18453	18453	Dumbledore	138	“ You are with me , ”
18456	18463	18453	18453	Dumbledore	138	“ This will do , Harry . ”
18477	18490	18491	18491	he	138	“ You have not , of course , passed your Apparition Test , ”
18494	18497	18499	18499	Harry	136	“ No , ”
18501	18510	18499	18499	Harry	136	“ I thought you had to be seventeen ? ”
18511	18515	18517	18517	Dumbledore	138	“ You do , ”
18519	18558	18517	18517	Dumbledore	138	“ So you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly . My left , if you do n’t mind — as you have noticed , my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment . ”
18566	18570	18572	18572	Dumbledore	138	“ Very good , ”
18574	18581	18572	18572	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , here we go . ”
18750	18756	18758	18758	Dumbledore	138	“ Are you all right ? ”
18766	18776	18758	18758	Dumbledore	138	“ The sensation does take some getting used to . ”
18777	18782	18784	18784	Harry	136	“ I ’m fine , ”
18802	18811	18784	18784	Harry	136	“ But I think I might prefer brooms ... ”
18830	18834	18812	18812	Dumbledore	138	“ This way . ”
18866	18873	18875	18875	Dumbledore	138	“ So tell me , Harry , ”
18877	18888	18875	18875	Dumbledore	138	“ Your scar ... has it been hurting at all ? ”
18905	18908	18909	18909	he	136	“ No , ”
18912	18938	18909	18909	he	136	“ and I ’ve been wondering about that . I thought it would be burning all the time now Voldemort ’s getting so powerful again . ”
18954	18965	18967	18967	Dumbledore	138	“ I , on the other hand , thought otherwise , ”
18969	18999	18967	18967	Dumbledore	138	“ Lord Voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying . It appears that he is now employing Occlumency against you . ”
19000	19008	19010	19010	Harry	136	“ Well , I ’m not complaining , ”
19050	19053	19047	19047	Dumbledore	138	“ Professor ? ”
19054	19057	18967	18967	Dumbledore	138	“ Harry ? ”
19058	19066	19047	19047	Dumbledore	138	“ Er — where exactly are we ? ”
19067	19080	18967	18967	Dumbledore	138	“ This , Harry , is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton . ”
19081	19089	19047	19047	Dumbledore	138	“ And what are we doing here ? ”
19090	19103	19105	19105	Dumbledore	138	“ Ah yes , of course , I have n’t told you , ”
19107	19160	19105	19105	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , I have lost count of the number of times I have said this in recent years , but we are , once again , one member of staff short . We are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts . ”
19161	19171	19047	19047	Dumbledore	138	“ How can I help with that , sir ? ”
19172	19185	19187	19187	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh , I think we ’ll find a use for you , ”
19190	19196	19187	19187	Dumbledore	138	“ Left here , Harry . ”
19251	19268	19235	19235	Harry	136	“ Professor , why could n’t we just Apparate directly into your old colleague ’s house ? ”
19269	19284	19286	19286	Dumbledore	138	“ Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door , ”
19288	19323	19286	19286	Dumbledore	138	“ Courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry . In any case , most Wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Apparators . At Hogwarts , for instance — ”
19324	19337	19339	19339	Harry	136	“ — you ca n’t Apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds , ”
19342	19348	19339	19339	Harry	136	“ Hermione Granger told me . ”
19349	19361	19286	19286	Dumbledore	138	“ And she is quite right . We turn left again . ”
19404	19419	19339	19339	Harry	136	“ Sir , I saw in the Daily Prophet that Fudge has been sacked ... ”
19420	19423	19425	19425	Dumbledore	138	“ Correct , ”
19435	19463	19425	19425	Dumbledore	138	“ He has been replaced , as I am sure you also saw , by Rufus Scrimgeour , who used to be Head of the Auror office . ”
19464	19475	19477	19477	Harry	136	“ Is he ... Do you think he ’s good ? ”
19479	19484	19486	19486	Dumbledore	138	“ An interesting question , ”
19488	19504	19486	19486	Dumbledore	138	“ He is able , certainly . A more decisive and forceful personality than Cornelius . ”
19505	19512	19425	19425	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , but I meant — ”
19513	19545	19486	19486	Dumbledore	138	“ I know what you meant . Rufus is a man of action and , having fought Dark wizards for most of his working life , does not underestimate Lord Voldemort . ”
19584	19595	19580	19580	he	138	“ And ... sir ... I saw about Madam Bones . ”
19596	19599	19601	19601	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , ”
19604	19624	19601	19601	Dumbledore	138	“ A terrible loss . She was a great witch . Just up here , I think — ouch . ”
19633	19642	19580	19580	he	138	“ Professor , what happened to your — ? ”
19643	19652	19654	19654	Dumbledore	138	“ I have no time to explain now , ”
19656	19670	19654	19654	Dumbledore	138	“ It is a thrilling tale , I wish to do it justice . ”
19695	19720	19671	19671	He	138	“ Sir — I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl , about security measures we should all take against the Death Eaters ... ”
19721	19729	19731	19731	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , I received one myself , ”
19736	19743	19731	19731	Dumbledore	138	“ Did you find it useful ? ”
19744	19748	19671	19671	He	138	“ Not really . ”
19749	19786	19731	19731	Dumbledore	138	“ No , I thought not . You have not asked me , for instance , what is my favorite flavor of jam , to check that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an impostor . ”
19787	19792	19793	19793	Harry	136	“ I did n’t ... ”
19807	19844	19731	19731	Dumbledore	138	“ For future reference , Harry , it is raspberry ... although of course , if I were a Death Eater , I would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself . ”
19845	19850	19852	19852	Harry	136	“ Er ... right , ”
19854	19879	19852	19852	Harry	136	“ Well , on that leaflet , it said something about Inferi . What exactly are they ? The leaflet was n’t very clear . ”
19880	19885	19887	19887	Dumbledore	138	“ They are corpses , ”
19890	19948	19887	19887	Dumbledore	138	“ Dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark wizard ’s bidding . Inferi have not been seen for a long time , however , not since Voldemort was last powerful ... He killed enough people to make an army of them , of course . This is the place , Harry , just here ... ”
20000	20011	19995	19995	Harry	136	“ Oh dear . Oh dear , dear , dear . ”
20050	20059	20060	20060	he	138	“ Wand out and follow me , Harry , ”
20099	20102	20091	20091	his	138	“ Lumos . ”
20265	20272	20273	20273	he	138	“ Not pretty , is it ? ”
20277	20286	20273	20273	he	138	“ Yes , something horrible has happened here . ”
20339	20355	20356	20356	Harry	136	“ Maybe there was a fight and — and they dragged him off , Professor ? ”
20382	20389	20391	20391	Dumbledore	138	“ I do n’t think so , ”
20404	20411	20391	20391	Dumbledore	138	“ You mean he ’s — ? ”
20412	20419	20431	20431	his	138	“ Still here somewhere ? Yes . ”
20444	20447	20431	20431	his	138	“ Ouch ! ”
20448	20454	20456	20456	Dumbledore	138	“ Good evening , Horace , ”
20507	20520	20521	20521	he	913	“ There was no need to stick the wand in that hard , ”
20530	20534	20521	20521	he	913	“ It hurt . ”
20587	20593	20594	20594	he	913	“ What gave it away ? ”
20627	20632	20634	20634	Dumbledore	138	“ My dear Horace , ”
20639	20661	20634	20634	Dumbledore	138	“ if the Death Eaters really had come to call , the Dark Mark would have been set over the house . ”
20673	20678	20679	20679	he	915	“ The Dark Mark , ”
20682	20715	20679	20679	he	915	“ Knew there was something ... ah well . Would n’t have had time anyway , I ’d only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room . ”
20730	20739	20741	20741	Dumbledore	138	“ Would you like my assistance clearing up ? ”
20744	20747	20749	20750	the other	733	“ Please , ”
20860	20870	20872	20872	Dumbledore	138	“ What kind of blood was that , incidentally ? ”
20884	20891	20893	20894	the wizard	915	“ On the walls ? Dragon , ”
20928	20933	20935	20936	the wizard	915	“ Yes , dragon , ”
20939	20961	20935	20936	the wizard	915	“ My last bottle , and prices are sky - high at the moment . Still , it might be reusable . ”
20990	20996	20962	20962	He	915	“ Hmm . Bit dusty . ”
21018	21021	21022	21022	he	915	“ Oho , ”
21043	21046	21022	21022	he	915	“ Oho ! ”
21047	21050	21052	21052	Dumbledore	138	“ This , ”
21061	21081	21052	21052	Dumbledore	138	“ is Harry Potter . Harry , this is an old friend and colleague of mine , Horace Slughorn . ”
21091	21115	21087	21087	his	183	“ So that ’s how you thought you ’d persuade me , is it ? Well , the answer ’s no , Albus . ”
21137	21149	21151	21151	Dumbledore	138	“ I suppose we can have a drink , at least ? ”
21153	21160	21151	21151	Dumbledore	138	“ For old time ’s sake ? ”
21164	21172	21173	21173	he	183	“ All right then , one drink , ”
21264	21267	21268	21268	he	183	“ Hmpf , ”
21282	21285	21286	21286	He	183	“ Here — ”
21333	21344	21345	21345	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , how have you been keeping , Horace ? ”
21348	21353	21355	21355	Slughorn	183	“ Not so well , ”
21359	21389	21355	21355	Slughorn	183	“ Weak chest . Wheezy . Rheumatism too . Ca n’t move like I used to . Well , that ’s to be expected . Old age . Fatigue . ”
21390	21411	21413	21413	Dumbledore	138	“ And yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice , ”
21415	21428	21413	21413	Dumbledore	138	“ You ca n’t have had more than three minutes ’ warning ? ”
21438	21458	21459	21459	he	183	“ Two . Did n’t hear my Intruder Charm go off , I was taking a bath . Still , ”
21471	21503	21459	21459	he	183	“ the fact remains that I ’m an old man , Albus . A tired old man who ’s earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts . ”
21570	21583	21585	21585	Dumbledore	138	“ You ’re not yet as old as I am , Horace , ”
21587	21599	21601	21601	Slughorn	183	“ Well , maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself , ”
21615	21625	21604	21604	His	183	“ Reactions not what they were , I see . ”
21626	21632	21634	21634	Dumbledore	138	“ You ’re quite right , ”
21666	21681	21660	21660	Harry	136	“ I am undoubtedly slower than I was . But on the other hand ... ”
21770	21793	21795	21795	Dumbledore	138	“ So , all these precautions against intruders , Horace ... are they for the Death Eaters ’ benefit , or mine ? ”
21797	21815	21817	21817	Slughorn	183	“ What would the Death Eaters want with a poor broken - down old buffer like me ? ”
21819	21840	21842	21842	Dumbledore	138	“ I imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion , torture , and murder , ”
21844	21858	21842	21842	Dumbledore	138	“ Are you really telling me that they have n’t come recruiting yet ? ”
21870	21970	21859	21859	Slughorn	183	“ I have n’t given them the chance . I ’ve been on the move for a year . Never stay in one place more than a week . Move from Muggle house to Muggle house — the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands — it ’s been very pleasant , I ’ll be sorry to leave . It ’s quite easy once you know how , one simple Freezing Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of Sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors do n’t spot you bringing in the piano . ”
21971	21974	21976	21976	Dumbledore	138	“ Ingenious , ”
21978	22010	21976	21976	Dumbledore	138	“ But it sounds a rather tiring existence for a broken - down old buffer in search of a quiet life . Now , if you were to return to Hogwarts — ”
22011	22067	22143	22143	Slughorn	183	“ If you ’re going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school , you can save your breath , Albus ! I might have been in hiding , but some funny rumors have reached me since Dolores Umbridge left ! If that ’s how you treat teachers these days — ”
22068	22078	22080	22080	Dumbledore	138	“ Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd , ”
22082	22113	22080	22080	Dumbledore	138	“ I think you , Horace , would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs ‘ filthy half - breeds . ’ ”
22114	22124	22126	22126	Slughorn	183	“ That ’s what she did , did she ? ”
22128	22136	22126	22126	Slughorn	183	“ Idiotic woman . Never liked her . ”
22149	22152	22153	22153	Harry	136	“ Sorry , ”
22157	22169	22153	22153	Harry	136	“ It ’s just — I did n’t like her either . ”
22176	22181	22183	22183	Slughorn	183	“ Are you leaving ? ”
22190	22203	22205	22205	Dumbledore	138	“ No , I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom , ”
22207	22210	22212	22212	Slughorn	183	“ Oh , ”
22217	22226	22212	22212	Slughorn	183	“ Second on the left down the hall . ”
22289	22303	22304	22304	he	183	“ Do n’t think I do n’t know why he ’s brought you , ”
22334	22342	22314	22314	Slughorn	183	“ You look very like your father . ”
22343	22351	22353	22353	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I ’ve been told , ”
22355	22365	22314	22314	Slughorn	183	“ Except for your eyes . You ’ve got — ”
22366	22374	22375	22375	Harry	136	“ My mother ’s eyes , yeah . ”
22388	22417	22418	22418	Slughorn	183	“ Hmpf . Yes , well . You should n’t have favorites as a teacher , of course , but she was one of mine . Your mother , ”
22429	22473	22418	22418	Slughorn	183	“ Lily Evans . One of the brightest I ever taught . Vivacious , you know . Charming girl . I used to tell her she ought to have been in my House . Very cheeky answers I used to get back too . ”
22474	22480	22498	22498	he	183	“ Which was your House ? ”
22481	22488	22490	22490	Slughorn	183	“ I was Head of Slytherin , ”
22492	22497	22498	22498	he	183	“ Oh , now , ”
22518	22578	22498	22498	he	183	“ do n’t go holding that against me ! You ’ll be Gryffindor like her , I suppose ? Yes , it usually goes in families . Not always , though . Ever heard of Sirius Black ? You must have done — been in the papers for the last couple of years — died a few weeks ago — ”
22596	22658	22659	22659	He	931	“ Well , anyway , he was a big pal of your father ’s at school . The whole Black family had been in my House , but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor ! Shame — he was a talented boy . I got his brother , Regulus , when he came along , but I ’d have liked the set . ”
22698	22732	22677	22677	he	931	“ Your mother was Muggle - born , of course . Could n’t believe it when I found out . Thought she must have been pure - blood , she was so good . ”
22733	22744	22746	22746	Harry	136	“ One of my best friends is Muggle - born , ”
22748	22758	22746	22746	Harry	136	“ and she ’s the best in our year . ”
22759	22770	22772	22772	Slughorn	183	“ Funny how that sometimes happens , is n’t it ? ”
22774	22778	22780	22780	Harry	136	“ Not really , ”
22791	22800	22801	22801	he	183	“ You must n’t think I ’m prejudiced ! ”
22804	22876	22801	22801	he	183	“ No , no , no ! Have n’t I just said your mother was one of my all - time favorite students ? And there was Dirk Cresswell in the year after her too — now Head of the Goblin Liaison Office , of course — another Muggle - born , a very gifted student , and still gives me excellent inside information on the goings - on at Gringotts ! ”
22912	23035	22877	22877	He	183	“ All ex - students , all signed . You ’ll notice Barnabas Cuffe , editor of the Daily Prophet , he ’s always interested to hear my take on the day ’s news . And Ambrosius Flume , of Honeydukes — a hamper every birthday , and all because I was able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkiss , who gave him his first job ! And at the back — you ’ll see her if you just crane your neck — that ’s Gwenog Jones , who of course captains the Holyhead Harpies ... People are always astonished to hear I ’m on first - name terms with the Harpies , and free tickets whenever I want them ! ”
23045	23061	23063	23063	Harry	136	“ And all these people know where to find you , to send you stuff ? ”
23115	23120	23121	23121	he	183	“ Of course not , ”
23129	23142	23121	23121	he	183	“ I have been out of touch with everybody for a year . ”
23166	23239	23163	23163	he	183	“ Still ... the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times . All very well for Dumbledore to talk , but taking up a post at Hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix ! And while I ’m sure they ’re very admirable and brave and all the rest of it , I do n’t personally fancy the mortality rate — ”
23240	23254	23256	23256	Harry	136	“ You do n’t have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts , ”
23296	23336	23285	23285	Sirius	135	“ Most of the teachers are n’t in it , and none of them has ever been killed — well , unless you count Quirrell , and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with Voldemort . ”
23379	23410	23411	23411	Harry	136	“ I reckon the staff are safer than most people while Dumbledore ’s headmaster ; he ’s supposed to be the only one Voldemort ever feared , is n’t he ? ”
23435	23463	23464	23464	he	183	“ Well , yes , it is true that He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named has never sought a fight with Dumbledore , ”
23468	23543	23464	23464	he	183	“ And I suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the Death Eaters , He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named can hardly count me a friend ... in which case , I might well be safer a little closer to Albus ... I can not pretend that Amelia Bones ’s death did not shake me ... If she , with all her Ministry contacts and protection ... ”
23562	23571	23572	23572	he	138	“ Oh , there you are , Albus , ”
23575	23587	23572	23572	he	138	“ You ’ve been a very long time . Upset stomach ? ”
23588	23599	23601	23601	Dumbledore	138	“ No , I was merely reading the Muggle magazines , ”
23603	23635	23601	23601	Dumbledore	138	“ I do love knitting patterns . Well , Harry , we have trespassed upon Horace ’s hospitality quite long enough ; I think it is time for us to leave . ”
23654	23659	23649	23649	Slughorn	183	“ You ’re leaving ? ”
23660	23677	23683	23683	Slughorn	183	“ Yes , indeed . I think I know a lost cause when I see one . ”
23678	23682	23649	23649	Slughorn	183	“ Lost ... ? ”
23710	23725	23727	23727	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , I ’m sorry you do n’t want the job , Horace , ”
23738	23769	23727	23727	Dumbledore	138	“ Hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again . Our greatly increased security notwithstanding , you will always be welcome to visit , should you wish to . ”
23770	23782	23826	23826	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes ... well ... very gracious ... as I say ... ”
23783	23790	23727	23727	Dumbledore	138	“ Good - bye , then . ”
23791	23794	23796	23796	Harry	136	“ Bye , ”
23813	23825	23727	23727	Dumbledore	138	“ All right , all right , I ’ll do it ! ”
23841	23849	23830	23830	Slughorn	183	“ You will come out of retirement ? ”
23850	23855	23857	23857	Slughorn	183	“ Yes , yes , ”
23860	23869	23857	23857	Slughorn	183	“ I must be mad , but yes . ”
23870	23873	23875	23875	Dumbledore	138	“ Wonderful , ”
23879	23894	23875	23875	Dumbledore	138	“ Then , Horace , we shall see you on the first of September . ”
23895	23903	23905	23905	Slughorn	183	“ Yes , I daresay you will , ”
23923	23933	23916	23916	Slughorn	183	“ I ’ll want a pay rise , Dumbledore ! ”
23961	23967	23969	23969	Dumbledore	138	“ Well done , Harry , ”
23971	23978	23980	23980	Harry	136	“ I did n’t do anything , ”
23984	24010	23969	23969	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh yes you did . You showed Horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts . Did you like him ? ”
24011	24014	24022	24022	Slughorn	183	“ Er ... ”
24065	24068	24070	24070	Dumbledore	138	“ Horace , ”
24083	24088	24070	24070	Dumbledore	138	“ likes his comfort . ”
24126	24133	24134	24134	Dumbledore	138	“ I tell you all this , ”
24137	24206	24134	24134	Dumbledore	138	“ not to turn you against Horace — or , as we must now call him , Professor Slughorn — but to put you on your guard . He will undoubtedly try to collect you , Harry . You would be the jewel of his collection ; ‘ the Boy Who Lived ’ ... or , as they call you these days , ‘ the Chosen One . ’ ”
24272	24286	24258	24258	Dumbledore	138	“ This will do , Harry . If you will grasp my arm . ”
24392	24401	24403	24403	Dumbledore	138	“ If you do n’t mind , Harry , ”
24412	24432	24403	24403	Dumbledore	138	“ I ’d like a few words with you before we part . In private . Perhaps in here ? ”
24493	24545	24476	24476	his	138	“ I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it , Harry , but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry . Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you . ”
24578	24584	24575	24576	Uncle Vernon	165	“ His godfather ’s dead ? ”
24599	24604	24606	24606	Dumbledore	138	“ It was cruel , ”
24609	24635	24606	24606	Dumbledore	138	“ that you and Sirius had such a short time together . A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship . ”
24710	24716	24717	24717	Harry	136	“ It ’s just hard , ”
24726	24737	24717	24717	Harry	136	“ to realize he wo n’t write to me again . ”
24800	24813	24815	24815	Dumbledore	138	“ Sirius represented much to you that you had never known before , ”
24818	24826	24815	24815	Dumbledore	138	“ Naturally , the loss is devastating ... ”
24827	24837	24839	24839	Harry	136	“ But while I was at the Dursleys ’ ... ”
24846	24904	24905	24905	he	136	“ I realized I ca n’t shut myself away or — or crack up . Sirius would n’t have wanted that , would he ? And anyway , life ’s too short ... Look at Madam Bones , look at Emmeline Vance ... It could be me next , could n’t it ? But if it is , ”
24922	24948	24905	24905	he	136	“ I ’ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can , and Voldemort too if I can manage it . ”
24949	24965	24967	24967	Dumbledore	138	“ Spoken both like your mother and father ’s son and Sirius ’s true godson ! ”
24978	25029	24967	24967	Dumbledore	138	“ I take my hat off to you — or I would , if I were not afraid of showering you in spiders . And now , Harry , on a closely related subject ... I gather that you have been taking the Daily Prophet over the last two weeks ? ”
25030	25033	25035	25035	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
25045	25070	24905	24905	he	136	“ Then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in the Hall of Prophecy ? ”
25071	25074	25076	25076	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
25079	25090	25076	25076	Harry	136	“ And now everyone knows that I ’m the one — ”
25091	25098	25100	25100	Dumbledore	138	“ No , they do not , ”
25102	25194	25100	25100	Dumbledore	138	“ There are only two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and Lord Voldemort , and they are both standing in this smelly , spidery broom shed . It is true , however , that many have guessed , correctly , that Voldemort sent his Death Eaters to steal a prophecy , and that the prophecy concerned you . Now , I think I am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said ? ”
25195	25198	25200	25200	Harry	136	“ No , ”
25202	25211	25213	25213	Dumbledore	138	“ A wise decision , on the whole , ”
25215	25240	25241	25241	he	138	“ Although I think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends , Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger . Yes , ”
25249	25271	25245	25245	Harry	136	“ I think they ought to know . You do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them . ”
25272	25278	25289	25289	Dumbledore	138	“ I did n’t want — ”
25279	25287	25289	25289	Dumbledore	138	“ — to worry or frighten them ? ”
25303	25341	25289	25289	Dumbledore	138	“ Or perhaps , to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened ? You need your friends , Harry . As you so rightly said , Sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away . ”
25359	25383	25356	25356	He	138	“ On a different , though related , subject , it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year . ”
25384	25390	25392	25392	Harry	136	“ Private — with you ? ”
25401	25419	25356	25356	He	138	“ Yes . I think it is time that I took a greater hand in your education . ”
25420	25430	25356	25356	He	138	“ What will you be teaching me , sir ? ”
25431	25444	25446	25446	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh , a little of this , a little of that , ”
25471	25494	25460	25460	he	138	“ If I ’m having lessons with you , I wo n’t have to do Occlumency lessons with Snape , will I ? ”
25495	25508	25460	25460	he	138	“ Professor Snape , Harry — and no , you will not . ”
25509	25512	25514	25514	Harry	136	“ Good , ”
25518	25524	25514	25514	Harry	136	“ because they were a — ”
25537	25552	25554	25554	Dumbledore	138	“ I think the word ‘ fiasco ’ would be a good one here , ”
25561	25578	25579	25579	he	136	“ Well , that means I wo n’t see much of Professor Snape from now on , ”
25582	25609	25579	25579	he	136	“ because he wo n’t let me carry on Potions unless I get ‘ Outstanding ’ in my O.W.L. , which I know I have n’t . ”
25610	25621	25623	25623	Dumbledore	138	“ Do n’t count your owls before they are delivered , ”
25626	25688	25623	25623	Dumbledore	138	“ Which , now I think of it , ought to be some time later today . Now , two more things , Harry , before we part . Firstly , I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with you at all times from this moment onward . Even within Hogwarts itself . Just in case , you understand me ? ”
25692	25781	25689	25689	Harry	136	“ And lastly , while you stay here , the Burrow has been given the highest security the Ministry of Magic can provide . These measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to Arthur and Molly — all their post , for instance , is being searched at the Ministry before being sent on . They do not mind in the slightest , for their only concern is your safety . However , it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them . ”
25782	25786	25788	25788	Harry	136	“ I understand , ”
25791	25797	25799	25799	Dumbledore	138	“ Very well , then , ”
25814	25840	25799	25799	Dumbledore	138	“ I see a light in the kitchen . Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are . ”
25896	25901	25909	25910	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Who ’s there ? ”
25913	25917	25909	25910	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Declare yourself ! ”
25918	25928	25984	25984	Dumbledore	138	“ It is I , Dumbledore , bringing Harry . ”
25952	25976	25937	25938	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Harry , dear ! Gracious , Albus , you gave me a fright , you said not to expect you before morning ! ”
25977	25982	25984	25984	Dumbledore	138	“ We were lucky , ”
25992	26016	25984	25984	Dumbledore	138	“ Slughorn proved much more persuadable than I had expected . Harry ’s doing , of course . Ah , hello , Nymphadora ! ”
26064	26069	26070	26070	she	962	“ Hello , Professor , ”
26073	26078	26070	26070	she	962	“ Wotcher , Harry . ”
26079	26084	26087	26087	she	962	“ Hi , Tonks . ”
26123	26130	26131	26131	she	962	“ I ’d better be off , ”
26145	26155	26131	26131	she	962	“ Thanks for the tea and sympathy , Molly . ”
26156	26165	26167	26167	Dumbledore	138	“ Please do n’t leave on my account , ”
26170	26186	26167	26167	Dumbledore	138	“ I can not stay , I have urgent matters to discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour . ”
26187	26198	26200	26200	Tonks	209	“ No , no , I need to get going , ”
26208	26212	26200	26200	Tonks	209	“ ’ Night — ”
26213	26234	26167	26167	Dumbledore	138	“ Dear , why not come to dinner at the weekend , Remus and Mad - Eye are coming — ? ”
26235	26250	26200	26200	Tonks	209	“ No , really , Molly ... thanks anyway ... Good night , everyone . ”
26287	26299	26301	26301	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , I shall see you at Hogwarts , Harry , ”
26303	26314	26301	26301	Dumbledore	138	“ Take care of yourself . Molly , your servant . ”
26363	26369	26370	26370	she	202	“ You ’re like Ron , ”
26379	26416	26370	26370	she	202	“ Both of you look as though you ’ve had Stretching Jinxes put on you . I swear Ron ’s grown four inches since I last bought him school robes . Are you hungry , Harry ? ”
26417	26423	26425	26425	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I am , ”
26435	26447	26502	26503	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Sit down , dear , I ’ll knock something up . ”
26471	26477	26478	26478	he	136	“ So Hermione ’s here ? ”
26489	26500	26511	26511	her	202	“ Oh yes , she arrived the day before yesterday , ”
26530	26551	26511	26511	her	202	“ Everyone ’s in bed , of course , we did n’t expect you for hours . Here you are — ”
26594	26599	26612	26612	her	202	“ Bread , dear ? ”
26600	26606	26612	26612	her	202	“ Thanks , Mrs. Weasley . ”
26650	26661	26643	26644	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ So you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job ? ”
26678	26685	26687	26688	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ He taught Arthur and me , ”
26690	26714	26687	26688	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ He was at Hogwarts for ages , started around the same time as Dumbledore , I think . Did you like him ? ”
26733	26740	26742	26743	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I know what you mean , ”
26748	26848	26742	26743	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Of course he can be charming when he wants to be , but Arthur ’s never liked him much . The Ministry ’s littered with Slughorn ’s old favorites , he was always good at giving leg ups , but he never had much time for Arthur — did n’t seem to think he was enough of a highflier . Well , that just shows you , even Slughorn makes mistakes . I do n’t know whether Ron ’s told you in any of his letters — it ’s only just happened — but Arthur ’s been promoted ! ”
26883	26888	26889	26889	he	136	“ That ’s great ! ”
26892	26897	26899	26900	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ You are sweet , ”
26913	26966	26899	26900	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Yes , Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation , and Arthur ’s heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects . It ’s a big job , he ’s got ten people reporting to him now ! ”
26967	26972	26976	26976	her	202	“ What exactly — ? ”
26999	27007	27008	27008	Harry	136	“ Is Mr. Weasley still at work ? ”
27011	27039	27040	27040	She	202	“ Yes , he is . As a matter of fact , he ’s a tiny bit late ... He said he ’d be back around midnight ... ”
27132	27136	27221	27221	she	202	“ mortal peril . ”
27137	27148	27150	27151	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ It ’s been like that for a while now , ”
27159	27216	27150	27151	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ ever since You - Know - Who came back into the open . I suppose everybody ’s in mortal danger now ... I do n’t think it can be just our family ... but I do n’t know anyone else who ’s got a clock like this , so I ca n’t check . Oh ! ”
27236	27239	27221	27221	she	202	“ traveling . ”
27240	27245	27221	27221	she	202	“ He ’s coming ! ”
27288	27295	27284	27284	she	202	“ Arthur , is that you ? ”
27296	27299	27301	27302	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Yes , ”
27307	27327	27301	27302	Mr. Weasley	204	“ But I would say that even if I were a Death Eater , dear . Ask the question ! ”
27328	27333	27284	27284	she	202	“ Oh , honestly ... ”
27334	27337	27301	27302	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Molly ! ”
27338	27351	27284	27284	she	202	“ All right , all right ... What is your dearest ambition ? ”
27352	27361	27301	27302	Mr. Weasley	204	“ To find out how airplanes stay up . ”
27391	27404	27284	27284	she	202	“ Molly ! I ’ve got to ask you your question first ! ”
27405	27415	27284	27284	she	202	“ Arthur , really , this is just silly ... ”
27416	27431	27284	27284	she	202	“ What do you like me to call you when we ’re alone together ? ”
27479	27482	27484	27487	a mortified Mrs. Weasley	968	“ Mollywobbles , ”
27498	27501	27503	27504	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Correct , ”
27506	27514	27503	27504	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Now you can let me in . ”
27547	27566	27568	27569	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I still do n’t see why we have to go through that every time you come home , ”
27586	27605	27577	27577	she	202	“ I mean , a Death Eater might have forced the answer out of you before impersonating you ! ”
27606	27633	27577	27577	she	202	“ I know , dear , but it ’s Ministry procedure , and I have to set an example . Something smells good — onion soup ? ”
27645	27656	27577	27577	she	202	“ Harry ! We did n’t expect you until morning ! ”
27684	27733	27671	27672	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Thanks , Molly . It ’s been a tough night . Some idiot ’s started selling Metamorph - Medals . Just sling them around your neck and you ’ll be able to change your appearance at will . A hundred thousand disguises , all for ten Galleons ! ”
27734	27745	27671	27672	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ And what really happens when you put them on ? ”
27746	27785	27671	27672	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color , but a couple of people have also sprouted tentaclelike warts all over their bodies . As if St. Mungo ’s did n’t have enough to do already ! ”
27786	27801	27803	27804	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find funny , ”
27807	27813	27803	27804	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Are you sure — ? ”
27814	27820	27822	27823	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Of course I am ! ”
27825	27844	27822	27823	Mr. Weasley	204	“ The boys would n’t do anything like that now , not when people are desperate for protection ! ”
27845	27858	27671	27672	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ So is that why you ’re late , Metamorph - Medals ? ”
27859	27894	27822	27823	Mr. Weasley	204	“ No , we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in Elephant and Castle , but luckily the Magical Law Enforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we got there ... ”
27903	27906	27908	27911	an undeceived Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Bed , ”
27915	27936	27908	27911	an undeceived Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I ’ve got Fred and George ’s room all ready for you , you ’ll have it to yourself . ”
27937	27944	27671	27672	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Why , where are they ? ”
27945	27969	27971	27972	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Oh , they ’re in Diagon Alley , sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as they ’re so busy , ”
27974	28012	27971	27972	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I must say , I did n’t approve at first , but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business ! Come on , dear , your trunk ’s already up there . ”
28013	28020	28022	28022	Harry	136	“ ’ Night , Mr. Weasley , ”
28042	28047	28049	28050	Mr. Weasley	204	“ G’night , Harry , ”
28077	28081	28070	28072	All the hands	976	“ mortal peril . ”
28361	28364	28351	28351	he	136	“ Wuzzgoinon ? ”
28365	28375	28384	28384	he	136	“ We did n’t know you were here already ! ”
28396	28404	28406	28407	a girl	982	“ Ron , do n’t hit him ! ”
28464	28468	28453	28454	Ron Weasley	201	“ All right ? ”
28469	28474	28476	28476	Harry	136	“ Never been better , ”
28491	28494	28476	28476	Harry	136	“ You ? ”
28495	28499	28501	28501	Ron	201	“ Not bad , ”
28513	28527	28501	28501	Ron	201	“ When did you get here ? Mum ’s only just told us ! ”
28528	28535	28476	28476	Harry	136	“ About one o’clock this morning . ”
28536	28549	28501	28501	Ron	201	“ Were the Muggles all right ? Did they treat you okay ? ”
28550	28555	28557	28557	Harry	136	“ Same as usual , ”
28570	28593	28557	28557	Harry	136	“ they did n’t talk to me much , but I like it better that way . How ’re you , Hermione ? ”
28594	28601	28603	28603	Hermione	179	“ Oh , I ’m fine , ”
28649	28660	28646	28646	he	136	“ What ’s the time ? Have I missed breakfast ? ”
28661	28682	28684	28684	Ron	201	“ Do n’t worry about that , Mum ’s bringing you up a tray ; she reckons you look underfed , ”
28690	28699	28684	28684	Ron	201	“ So , what ’s been going on ? ”
28700	28720	28646	28646	he	136	“ Nothing much , I ’ve just been stuck at my aunt and uncle ’s , have n’t I ? ”
28721	28726	28728	28728	Ron	201	“ Come off it ! ”
28730	28738	28728	28728	Ron	201	“ You ’ve been off with Dumbledore ! ”
28739	28769	28646	28646	he	136	“ It was n’t that exciting . He just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement . His name ’s Horace Slughorn . ”
28770	28773	28775	28775	Ron	201	“ Oh , ”
28780	28784	28775	28775	Ron	201	“ We thought — ”
28801	28812	28646	28646	he	136	“ — we thought it ’d be something like that . ”
28813	28817	28819	28819	Harry	136	“ You did ? ”
28823	28858	28646	28646	he	136	“ Yeah ... yeah , now Umbridge has left , obviously we need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher , do n’t we ? So , er , what ’s he like ? ”
28859	28877	28879	28879	Harry	136	“ He looks a bit like a walrus , and he used to be Head of Slytherin , ”
28881	28887	28879	28879	Harry	136	“ Something wrong , Hermione ? ”
28914	28936	28904	28904	She	179	“ No , of course not ! So , um , did Slughorn seem like he ’ll be a good teacher ? ”
28937	28940	28942	28942	Harry	136	“ Dunno , ”
28944	28956	28942	28942	Harry	136	“ He ca n’t be worse than Umbridge , can he ? ”
28957	28967	28975	28975	Ron	201	“ I know someone who ’s worse than Umbridge , ”
28987	28992	28975	28975	Ron	201	“ Hi , Harry . ”
28993	29000	29001	29001	Ron	201	“ What ’s up with you ? ”
29004	29009	29011	29011	Ginny	218	“ It ’s her , ”
29021	29028	29014	29014	herself	218	“ She ’s driving me mad . ”
29029	29036	29038	29038	Hermione	179	“ What ’s she done now ? ”
29041	29059	29038	29038	Hermione	179	“ It ’s the way she talks to me — you ’d think I was about three ! ”
29060	29064	29069	29069	her	179	“ I know , ”
29072	29080	29069	29069	her	179	“ She ’s so full of herself . ”
29102	29114	29097	29097	Ron	201	“ Ca n’t you two lay off her for five seconds ? ”
29115	29125	29127	29127	Ginny	218	“ Oh , that ’s right , defend her , ”
29129	29141	29127	29127	Ginny	218	“ We all know you ca n’t get enough of her . ”
29166	29172	29163	29163	Harry	136	“ Who are you — ? ”
29275	29279	29280	29280	she	986	“ ’ Arry , ”
29287	29295	29280	29280	she	986	“ Eet ’ as been too long ! ”
29320	29340	29305	29306	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ There was no need to bring up the tray , I was just about to do it myself ! ”
29341	29347	29349	29350	Fleur Delacour	220	“ Eet was no trouble , ”
29381	29417	29374	29374	her	986	“ I ’ ave been longing to see ’ i m. You remember my seester , Gabrielle ? She never stops talking about ’ Arry Potter . She will be delighted to see you again . ”
29418	29426	29427	29427	Harry	136	“ Oh ... is she here too ? ”
29430	29438	29440	29440	Fleur	220	“ No , no , silly boy , ”
29446	29461	29440	29440	Fleur	220	“ I mean next summer , when we — but do you not know ? ”
29478	29489	29468	29468	she	986	“ We had n’t got around to telling him yet . ”
29512	29522	29490	29490	Fleur	220	“ Bill and I are going to be married ! ”
29523	29526	29528	29528	Harry	136	“ Oh , ”
29553	29560	29543	29543	Ginny	218	“ Wow . Er — congratulations ! ”
29571	29654	29561	29561	She	986	“ Bill is very busy at ze moment , working very ’ ard , and I only work part - time at Gringotts for my Eenglish , so he brought me ’ ere for a few days to get to know ’ is family properly . I was so pleased to ’ ear you would be coming — zere is n’t much to do ’ ere , unless you like cooking and chickens ! Well — enjoy your breakfast , ’ Arry ! ”
29685	29688	29677	29678	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ tchah ! ”
29689	29694	29696	29696	Ginny	218	“ Mum hates her , ”
29699	29706	29708	29709	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I do not hate her ! ”
29715	29730	29708	29709	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I just think they ’ve hurried into this engagement , that ’s all ! ”
29731	29740	29742	29742	Ron	201	“ They ’ve known each other a year , ”
29756	29831	29708	29709	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Well , that ’s not very long ! I know why it ’s happened , of course . It ’s all this uncertainty with You - Know - Who coming back , people think they might be dead tomorrow , so they ’re rushing all sorts of decisions they ’d normally take time over . It was the same last time he was powerful , people eloping left , right , and center — ”
29832	29838	29840	29840	Ginny	218	“ Including you and Dad , ”
29843	29865	29867	29868	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Yes , well , your father and I were made for each other , what was the point in waiting ? ”
29870	29904	29867	29868	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Whereas Bill and Fleur ... well ... what have they really got in common ? He ’s a hardworking , down - to - earth sort of person , whereas she ’s — ”
29905	29909	29911	29911	Ginny	218	“ A cow , ”
29915	29961	29911	29911	Ginny	218	“ But Bill ’s not that down - to - earth . He ’s a Curse - Breaker , is n’t he , he likes a bit of adventure , a bit of glamour ... I expect that ’s why he ’s gone for Phlegm . ”
29962	29970	29972	29973	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Stop calling her that , Ginny , ”
29982	30001	29977	29977	Harry	136	“ Well , I ’d better get on ... Eat your eggs while they ’re warm , Harry . ”
30035	30052	30053	30053	Harry	136	“ Do n’t you get used to her if she ’s staying in the same house ? ”
30056	30062	30064	30064	Ron	201	“ Well , you do , ”
30066	30079	30064	30064	Ron	201	“ but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly , like then ... ”
30080	30085	30087	30087	Hermione	179	“ It ’s pathetic , ”
30116	30126	30127	30127	Ginny	218	“ You do n’t really want her around forever ? ”
30140	30161	30137	30137	she	179	“ Well , Mum ’s going to put a stop to it if she can , I bet you anything . ”
30162	30171	30173	30173	Harry	136	“ How ’s she going to manage that ? ”
30175	30213	30137	30137	she	179	“ She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner . I think she ’s hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead . I hope he does , I ’d much rather have her in the family . ”
30214	30221	30223	30223	Ron	201	“ Yeah , that ’ll work , ”
30226	30269	30223	30223	Ron	201	“ Listen , no bloke in his right mind ’s going to fancy Tonks when Fleur ’s around . I mean , Tonks is okay - looking when she is n’t doing stupid things to her hair and her nose , but — ”
30270	30280	30282	30282	Ginny	218	“ She ’s a damn sight nicer than Phlegm , ”
30284	30296	30298	30298	Hermione	179	“ And she ’s more intelligent , she ’s an Auror ! ”
30303	30319	30321	30321	Harry	136	“ Fleur ’s not stupid , she was good enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament , ”
30323	30329	30331	30331	Hermione	179	“ Not you as well ! ”
30334	30351	30353	30353	Ginny	218	“ I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ‘ ’ Arry , ’ do you ? ”
30356	30359	30361	30361	Harry	136	“ No , ”
30369	30382	30361	30361	Harry	136	“ I was just saying , Phlegm — I mean , Fleur — ”
30383	30394	30396	30396	Ginny	218	“ I ’d much rather have Tonks in the family , ”
30398	30406	30396	30396	Ginny	218	“ At least she ’s a laugh . ”
30407	30418	30420	30420	Ron	201	“ She has n’t been much of a laugh lately , ”
30422	30437	30420	30420	Ron	201	“ Every time I ’ve seen her she ’s looked more like Moaning Myrtle . ”
30438	30444	30446	30446	Hermione	179	“ That ’s not fair , ”
30448	30469	30446	30446	Hermione	179	“ She still has n’t got over what happened ... you know ... I mean , he was her cousin ! ”
30509	30518	30520	30520	Ron	201	“ Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other ! ”
30522	30538	30520	30520	Ron	201	“ Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that their families never met — ”
30539	30546	30548	30548	Hermione	179	“ That ’s not the point , ”
30550	30560	30548	30548	Hermione	179	“ She thinks it was her fault he died ! ”
30561	30570	30572	30572	Harry	136	“ How does she work that one out ? ”
30579	30612	30520	30520	Ron	201	“ Well , she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange , was n’t she ? I think she feels that if only she had finished her off , Bellatrix could n’t have killed Sirius . ”
30613	30618	30620	30620	Ron	201	“ That ’s stupid , ”
30622	30629	30631	30631	Hermione	179	“ It ’s survivor ’s guilt , ”
30633	30660	30631	30631	Hermione	179	“ I know Lupin ’s tried to talk her round , but she ’s still really down . She ’s actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing ! ”
30661	30666	30520	30520	Ron	201	“ With her — ? ”
30667	30679	30681	30681	Hermione	179	“ She ca n’t change her appearance like she used to , ”
30683	30698	30681	30681	Hermione	179	“ I think her powers must have been affected by shock , or something . ”
30699	30708	30710	30710	Harry	136	“ I did n’t know that could happen , ”
30712	30717	30719	30719	Hermione	179	“ Nor did I , ”
30721	30731	30719	30719	Hermione	179	“ but I suppose if you ’re really depressed ... ”
30744	30747	30748	30748	she	202	“ Ginny , ”
30751	30761	30748	30748	she	202	“ come downstairs and help me with the lunch . ”
30762	30770	30772	30772	Ginny	218	“ I ’m talking to this lot ! ”
30776	30779	30781	30782	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Now ! ”
30787	30804	30806	30806	Ginny	218	“ She only wants me there so she does n’t have to be alone with Phlegm ! ”
30837	30847	30848	30848	she	218	“ You lot had better come down quickly too , ”
30908	30913	30914	30914	Hermione	179	“ What ’s this ? ”
30927	30930	30932	30932	Ron	201	“ Dunno , ”
30934	30959	30932	30932	Ron	201	“ but if Fred and George’ve left it here , it ’s probably not ready for the joke shop yet , so be careful . ”
30960	30970	30972	30972	Harry	136	“ Your mum said the shop ’s going well , ”
30974	30987	30972	30972	Harry	136	“ Said Fred and George have got a real flair for business . ”
30988	30994	30996	30996	Ron	201	“ That ’s an understatement , ”
30998	31050	30996	30996	Ron	201	“ They ’re raking in the Galleons ! I ca n’t wait to see the place , we have n’t been to Diagon Alley yet , because Mum says Dad ’s got to be there for extra security and he ’s been really busy at work , but it sounds excellent . ”
31051	31057	31059	31059	Harry	136	“ And what about Percy ? ”
31077	31088	31059	31059	Harry	136	“ Is he talking to your mum and dad again ? ”
31089	31092	31094	31094	Ron	201	“ Nope , ”
31096	31112	31059	31059	Harry	136	“ But he knows your dad was right all along now about Voldemort being back — ”
31113	31131	31133	31133	Hermione	179	“ Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right , ”
31135	31145	31133	31133	Hermione	179	“ I heard him telling your mum , Ron . ”
31146	31158	31160	31160	Ron	201	“ Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore would say , ”
31162	31175	31177	31177	Harry	136	“ He ’s going to be giving me private lessons this year , ”
31192	31198	31200	31200	Ron	201	“ You kept that quiet ! ”
31202	31208	31210	31210	Harry	136	“ I only just remembered , ”
31213	31224	31210	31210	Harry	136	“ He told me last night in your broom shed . ”
31225	31233	31235	31235	Ron	201	“ Blimey ... private lessons with Dumbledore ! ”
31240	31248	31235	31235	Ron	201	“ I wonder why he ’s ... ? ”
31319	31346	31299	31299	his	136	“ I do n’t know exactly why he ’s going to be giving me lessons , but I think it must be because of the prophecy . ”
31371	31386	31362	31362	He	136	“ You know , the one they were trying to steal at the Ministry . ”
31387	31396	31398	31398	Hermione	179	“ Nobody knows what it said , though , ”
31401	31406	31398	31398	Hermione	179	“ It got smashed . ”
31407	31413	31415	31415	Ron	201	“ Although the Prophet says — ”
31421	31424	31418	31418	Hermione	179	“ Shh ! ”
31425	31433	31435	31435	Harry	136	“ The Prophet ’s got it right , ”
31454	31500	31501	31501	Harry	136	“ That glass ball that smashed was n’t the only record of the prophecy . I heard the whole thing in Dumbledore ’s office , he was the one the prophecy was made to , so he could tell me . From what it said , ”
31507	31538	31501	31501	Harry	136	“ it looks like I ’m the one who ’s got to finish off Voldemort ... At least , it said neither of us could live while the other survives . ”
31569	31572	31574	31574	Harry	136	“ Hermione ! ”
31610	31621	31622	31622	she	179	“ I squeezed it and it — it punched me ! ”
31647	31652	31654	31654	Ron	201	“ Do n’t worry , ”
31664	31677	31654	31654	Ron	201	“ Mum’ll fix that , she ’s good at healing minor injuries — ”
31678	31687	31689	31689	Hermione	179	“ Oh well , never mind that now ! ”
31692	31699	31689	31689	Hermione	179	“ Harry , oh , Harry ... ”
31711	31768	31769	31769	She	179	“ We wondered , after we got back from the Ministry ... Obviously , we did n’t want to say anything to you , but from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy , how it was about you and Voldemort , well , we thought it might be something like this ... Oh , Harry ... ”
31777	31782	31769	31769	She	179	“ Are you scared ? ”
31783	31791	31793	31793	Harry	136	“ Not as much as I was , ”
31795	31825	31793	31793	Harry	136	“ When I first heard it , I was ... but now , it seems as though I always knew I ’d have to face him in the end ... ”
31826	31855	31857	31857	Ron	201	“ When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in person , we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy , ”
31860	31902	31857	31857	Ron	201	“ And we were kind of right , were n’t we ? He would n’t be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner , would n’t waste his time — he must think you ’ve got a chance ! ”
31903	31908	31910	31910	Hermione	179	“ That ’s true , ”
31912	31937	31910	31910	Hermione	179	“ I wonder what he ’ll teach you , Harry ? Really advanced defensive magic , probably ... powerful countercurses ... anti - jinxes ... ”
32028	32035	32037	32037	Hermione	179	“ ... and evasive enchantments generally , ”
32039	32073	32037	32037	Hermione	179	“ Well , at least you know one lesson you ’ll be having this year , that ’s one more than Ron and me . I wonder when our O.W.L. results will come ? ”
32074	32087	32089	32089	Ron	201	“ Ca n’t be long now , it ’s been a month , ”
32091	32095	32097	32097	Harry	136	“ Hang on , ”
32112	32125	32097	32097	Harry	136	“ I think Dumbledore said our O.W.L. results would be arriving today ! ”
32126	32129	32131	32131	Hermione	179	“ Today ? ”
32133	32151	32131	32131	Hermione	179	“ Today ? But why did n’t you — oh my God — you should have said — ”
32158	32170	32152	32152	She	179	“ I ’m going to see whether any owls have come ... ”
32216	32223	32224	32225	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ It just wo n’t budge , ”
32249	32257	32224	32225	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Bruises , Cuts , and Abrasions . ”
32258	32272	32224	32225	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ This has always worked before , I just ca n’t understand it . ”
32273	32295	32297	32297	Ginny	218	“ It ’ll be Fred and George ’s idea of a funny joke , making sure it ca n’t come off , ”
32299	32308	32310	32310	Hermione	179	“ But it ’s got to come off ! ”
32312	32323	32310	32310	Hermione	179	“ I ca n’t go around looking like this forever ! ”
32324	32341	32343	32344	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ You wo n’t , dear , we ’ll find an antidote , do n’t worry , ”
32347	32360	32362	32362	Fleur	220	“ Bill told me ’ ow Fred and George are very amusing ! ”
32367	32377	32379	32379	Hermione	179	“ Yes , I can hardly breathe for laughing , ”
32398	32415	32381	32381	She	179	“ Mrs. Weasley , you ’re quite , quite sure no owls have arrived this morning ? ”
32416	32426	32428	32429	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Yes , dear , I ’d have noticed , ”
32432	32446	32428	32429	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ But it ’s barely nine , there ’s still plenty of time ... ”
32447	32456	32458	32458	Hermione	179	“ I know I messed up Ancient Runes , ”
32461	32499	32458	32458	Hermione	179	“ I definitely made at least one serious mistranslation . And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all . I thought Transfiguration went all right at the time , but looking back — ”
32500	32518	32520	32520	Ron	201	“ Hermione , will you shut up , you ’re not the only one who ’s nervous ! ”
32522	32535	32520	32520	Ron	201	“ And when you ’ve got your ten ‘ Outstanding ’ O.W.L.s ... ”
32536	32546	32551	32551	her	179	“ Do n’t , do n’t , do n’t ! ”
32555	32563	32551	32551	her	179	“ I know I ’ve failed everything ! ”
32564	32571	32572	32572	Harry	136	“ What happens if we fail ? ”
32587	32609	32551	32551	her	179	“ We discuss our options with our Head of House , I asked Professor McGonagall at the end of last term . ”
32623	32627	32629	32629	Fleur	220	“ At Beauxbatons , ”
32632	32665	32629	32629	Fleur	220	“ we ’ ad a different way of doing things . I think eet was better . We sat our examinations after six years of study , not five , and then — ”
32699	32705	32707	32707	Ron	201	“ They ’re definitely owls , ”
32719	32727	32729	32729	Harry	136	“ And there are three of them , ”
32737	32744	32746	32746	Hermione	179	“ One for each of us , ”
32752	32762	32746	32746	Hermione	179	“ Oh no ... oh no ... oh no ... ”
32814	32818	32820	32820	Hermione	179	“ Oh no ! ”
33043	33045	33053	33053	He	136	“ Outstanding ”
33074	33089	33090	33090	he	201	“ Only failed Divination and History of Magic , and who cares about them ? ”
33096	33101	33090	33090	he	201	“ Here — swap — ”
33112	33114	33102	33102	Harry	136	“ Outstandings ”
33117	33130	33132	33132	Ron	201	“ Knew you ’d be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts , ”
33140	33151	33132	33132	Ron	201	“ We ’ve done all right , have n’t we ? ”
33152	33156	33158	33159	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Well done ! ”
33167	33181	33158	33159	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Seven O.W.L.s , that ’s more than Fred and George got together ! ”
33182	33185	33187	33187	Ginny	218	“ Hermione ? ”
33198	33204	33191	33191	Hermione	179	“ How did you do ? ”
33205	33211	33213	33213	Hermione	179	“ I — not bad , ”
33219	33226	33228	33228	Ron	201	“ Oh , come off it , ”
33243	33263	33264	33264	He	201	“ Yep — nine ‘ Outstandings ’ and one ‘ Exceeds Expectations ’ at Defense Against the Dark Arts . ”
33278	33288	33264	33264	He	201	“ You ’re actually disappointed , are n’t you ? ”
33298	33307	33309	33309	Ron	201	“ Well , we ’re N.E.W.T. students now ! ”
33311	33320	33309	33309	Ron	201	“ Mum , are there any more sausages ? ”
33685	33695	33696	33696	he	136	“ There have been another couple of dementor attacks , ”
33711	33773	33700	33701	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ And they ’ve found Igor Karkaroff ’s body in a shack up north . The Dark Mark had been set over it — well , frankly , I ’m surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death Eaters ; Sirius ’s brother , Regulus , only managed a few days as far as I can remember . ”
33774	33779	33781	33782	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Yes , well , ”
33786	33795	33781	33782	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ perhaps we should talk about something diff — ”
33796	33806	33808	33808	Bill	222	“ Did you hear about Florean Fortescue , Remus ? ”
33819	33825	33817	33817	Fleur	220	“ The man who ran — ”
33826	33837	33838	33838	Harry	136	“ — the ice - cream place in Diagon Alley ? ”
33854	33870	33838	33838	Harry	136	“ He used to give me free ice creams . What ’s happened to him ? ”
33871	33882	33817	33817	Fleur	220	“ Dragged off , by the look of his place . ”
33883	33886	33888	33888	Ron	201	“ Why ? ”
33898	33917	33817	33817	Fleur	220	“ Who knows ? He must ’ve upset them somehow . He was a good man , Florean . ”
33918	33924	33926	33927	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Talking of Diagon Alley , ”
33929	33937	33926	33927	Mr. Weasley	204	“ looks like Ollivander ’s gone too . ”
33938	33942	33944	33944	Ginny	218	“ The wandmaker ? ”
33949	33976	33817	33817	Fleur	220	“ That ’s the one . Shop ’s empty . No sign of a struggle . No one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped . ”
33977	33988	33817	33817	Fleur	220	“ But wands — what ’ll people do for wands ? ”
33989	33998	34000	34000	Lupin	210	“ They ’ll make do with other makers , ”
34002	34025	34000	34000	Lupin	210	“ But Ollivander was the best , and if the other side have got him it ’s not so good for us . ”
34056	34065	34067	34067	Hermione	179	“ That gives you equal status with prefects ! ”
34070	34081	34067	34067	Hermione	179	“ You can use our special bathroom now and everything ! ”
34082	34094	34096	34096	Ron	201	“ Wow , I remember when Charlie wore one of these , ”
34104	34132	34096	34096	Ron	201	“ Harry , this is so cool , you ’re my Captain — if you let me back on the team , I suppose , ha ha ... ”
34133	34157	34159	34160	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Well , I do n’t suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer now you ’ve got these , ”
34168	34196	34159	34160	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ We ’ll go on Saturday as long as your father does n’t have to go into work again . I ’m not going there without him . ”
34197	34221	34223	34223	Ron	201	“ Mum , d’you honestly think You - Know - Who ’s going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts ? ”
34225	34236	34238	34239	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Fortescue and Ollivander went on holiday , did they ? ”
34246	34267	34238	34239	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ If you think security ’s a laughing matter you can stay behind and I ’ll get your things myself — ”
34268	34285	34287	34287	Ron	201	“ No , I wanna come , I want to see Fred and George ’s shop ! ”
34290	34314	34316	34317	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Then you just buck up your ideas , young man , before I decide you ’re too immature to come with us ! ”
34334	34338	34316	34317	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ mortal peril , ”
34353	34364	34316	34317	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ And that goes for returning to Hogwarts as well ! ”
34393	34407	34384	34384	her	1021	“ Blimey ... you ca n’t even make a joke round here anymore ... ”
34473	34478	34480	34480	Ron	201	“ Where ’s mine ? ”
34488	34497	34499	34499	Bill	222	“ That ’s already Harry ’s , idiot , ”
34501	34564	34499	34499	Bill	222	“ I got it out of your vault for you , Harry , because it ’s taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment , the goblins have tightened security so much . Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity Probe stuck up his ... Well , trust me , this way ’s easier . ”
34565	34570	34572	34572	Harry	136	“ Thanks , Bill , ”
34578	34586	34588	34588	Fleur	220	“ ’ E is always so thoughtful , ”
34663	34674	34676	34676	Ron	201	“ It ’s good Dad can get us these again , ”
34719	34734	34739	34739	his	204	“ Do n’t get used to it , it ’s only because of Harry , ”
34770	34796	34750	34752	the Ministry driver	1030	“ He ’s been given top - grade security status . And we ’ll be joining up with additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too . ”
34868	34875	34877	34878	the driver	1034	“ Here you are , then , ”
34905	34921	34892	34892	he	1034	“ I ’m to wait for you , any idea how long you ’ll be ? ”
34922	34931	34933	34934	Mr. Weasley	204	“ A couple of hours , I expect , ”
34936	34945	34933	34934	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Ah , good , he ’s here ! ”
35010	35013	35014	35014	he	176	“ Harry ! ”
35035	35062	35014	35014	he	176	“ Buckbeak — Witherwings , I mean — yeh should see him , Harry , he ’s so happy ter be back in the open air — ”
35063	35069	35071	35071	Harry	136	“ Glad he ’s pleased , ”
35080	35091	35071	35071	Harry	136	“ We did n’t know ‘ security ’ meant you ! ”
35092	35124	35126	35126	Hagrid	176	“ I know , jus ’ like old times , innit ? See , the Ministry wanted ter send a bunch o ’ Aurors , but Dumbledore said I ’d do , ”
35141	35155	35126	35126	Hagrid	176	“ Let ’s get goin’ then — after yeh , Molly , Arthur — ”
35206	35226	35202	35202	Hagrid	176	“ Jus ’ passin ’ through today , Tom , sure yeh understand , Hogwarts business , yeh know . ”
35484	35493	35494	35494	he	1053	“ One for your little girl , madam ? ”
35507	35513	35494	35494	he	1053	“ Protect her pretty neck ? ”
35514	35521	35523	35524	Mr. Weasley	204	“ If I were on duty ... ”
35533	35552	35554	35555	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Yes , but do n’t go arresting anyone now , dear , we ’re in a hurry , ”
35562	35614	35554	35555	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I think we ’d better do Madam Malkin ’s first , Hermione wants new dress robes , and Ron ’s showing much too much ankle in his school robes , and you must need new ones too , Harry , you ’ve grown so much — come on , everyone — ”
35615	35634	35636	35637	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Molly , it does n’t make sense for all of us to go to Madam Malkin ’s , ”
35639	35663	35636	35637	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Why do n’t those three go with Hagrid , and we can go to Flourish and Blotts and get everyone ’s schoolbooks ? ”
35664	35670	35672	35673	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I do n’t know , ”
35696	35704	35672	35673	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Hagrid , do you think — ? ”
35705	35719	35721	35721	Hagrid	176	“ Don ’ fret , they ’ll be fine with me , Molly , ”
35829	35845	35847	35847	Hagrid	176	“ Migh ’ be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us , ”
35863	35873	35847	35847	Hagrid	176	“ I ’ll stand guard outside , all right ? ”
35928	35953	35967	35968	Madam Malkin	241	“ ... not a child , in case you have n’t noticed , Mother . I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone . ”
35975	36010	35967	35968	Madam Malkin	241	“ Now , dear , your mother ’s quite right , none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore , it ’s nothing to do with being a child — ”
36011	36023	35967	35968	Madam Malkin	241	“ Watch where you ’re sticking that pin , will you ! ”
36100	36118	36120	36121	Draco Malfoy	159	“ If you ’re wondering what the smell is , Mother , a Mudblood just walked in , ”
36123	36137	36139	36140	Madam Malkin	241	“ I do n’t think there ’s any need for language like that ! ”
36157	36170	36171	36171	she	241	“ And I do n’t want wands drawn in my shop either ! ”
36210	36224	36199	36199	Hermione	179	“ No , do n’t , honestly , it ’s not worth it ... ”
36225	36238	36240	36240	Malfoy	159	“ Yeah , like you ’d dare do magic out of school , ”
36242	36257	36240	36240	Malfoy	159	“ Who blacked your eye , Granger ? I want to send them flowers . ”
36258	36264	36266	36267	Madam Malkin	241	“ That ’s quite enough ! ”
36277	36282	36266	36267	Madam Malkin	241	“ Madam — please — ”
36293	36298	36299	36299	she	144	“ Put those away , ”
36307	36328	36299	36299	she	144	“ If you attack my son again , I shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do . ”
36329	36332	36334	36334	Harry	136	“ Really ? ”
36369	36386	36360	36360	He	136	“ Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in , are you ? ”
36396	36414	36423	36424	Narcissa Malfoy	144	“ Really , you should n’t accuse — dangerous thing to say — wands away , please ! ”
36428	36459	36423	36424	Narcissa Malfoy	144	“ I see that being Dumbledore ’s favorite has given you a false sense of security , Harry Potter . But Dumbledore wo n’t always be there to protect you . ”
36468	36507	36460	36460	Harry	136	“ Wow ... look at that ... he ’s not here now ! So why not have a go ? They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband ! ”
36527	36541	36542	36542	Malfoy	144	“ Do n’t you dare talk to my mother like that , Potter ! ”
36545	36553	36555	36555	Narcissa	144	“ It ’s all right , Draco , ”
36568	36585	36560	36560	her	144	“ I expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius . ”
36592	36597	36599	36599	Hermione	179	“ Harry , no ! ”
36614	36628	36599	36599	Hermione	179	“ Think ... You must n’t ... You ’ll be in such trouble ... ”
36670	36690	36658	36658	She	241	“ I think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more , dear , let me just — ”
36691	36694	36696	36696	Malfoy	159	“ Ouch ! ”
36703	36725	36696	36696	Malfoy	159	“ Watch where you ’re putting your pins , woman ! Mother — I do n’t think I want these anymore — ”
36745	36752	36754	36754	Narcissa	144	“ You ’re right , Draco , ”
36763	36785	36754	36754	Narcissa	144	“ now I know the kind of scum that shops here ... We ’ll do better at Twilfitt and Tatting ’s . ”
36817	36822	36824	36825	Madam Malkin	241	“ Well , really ! ”
36908	36912	36914	36914	Hagrid	176	“ Got ev’rything ? ”
36923	36927	36929	36929	Harry	136	“ Just about , ”
36931	36938	36929	36929	Harry	136	“ Did you see the Malfoys ? ”
36939	36942	36944	36944	Hagrid	176	“ Yeah , ”
36948	36974	36944	36944	Hagrid	176	“ Bu ’ they wouldn ’ dare make trouble in the middle o ’ Diagon Alley , Harry . Don ’ worry abou ’ them . ”
37010	37015	37017	37018	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Everyone all right ? ”
37020	37051	37017	37018	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Got your robes ? Right then , we can pop in at the Apothecary and Eeylops on the way to Fred and George ’s — stick close , now ... ”
37125	37134	37135	37136	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ We really have n’t got too long , ”
37139	37172	37135	37136	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ So we ’ll just have a quick look around and then back to the car . We must be close , that ’s number ninety - two ... ninety - four ... ”
37173	37176	37178	37178	Ron	201	“ Whoa , ”
37339	37346	37331	37331	Her	202	“ U - No - Poo . ”

37636	37692	37694	37694	Hermione	179	“ ‘ One simple incantation and you will enter a top - quality , highly realistic , thirty - minute daydream , easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable ( side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling ) . Not for sale to under - sixteens . ’ You know , ”
37701	37708	37694	37694	Hermione	179	“ that really is extraordinary magic ! ”
37709	37715	37733	37733	Fred	215	“ For that , Hermione , ”
37722	37730	37733	37733	Fred	215	“ you can have one for free . ”
37752	37759	37760	37760	They	1092	“ How are you , Harry ? ”
37764	37775	37760	37760	They	1092	“ And what ’s happened to your eye , Hermione ? ”
37776	37781	37782	37782	she	179	“ Your punching telescope , ”
37786	37795	37797	37797	Fred	215	“ Oh blimey , I forgot about those , ”
37799	37802	37797	37797	Fred	215	“ Here — ”
37828	37842	37844	37844	Fred	215	“ Just dab it on , that bruise’ll be gone within the hour , ”
37846	37866	37844	37844	Fred	215	“ We had to find a decent bruise remover . We ’re testing most of our products on ourselves . ”
37871	37880	37881	37881	she	179	“ It is safe , is n’t it ? ”
37884	37890	37892	37892	Fred	215	“ ’ Course it is , ”

37953	37992	37946	37946	Fred	215	“ For freaks like Dad , you know , who love Muggle stuff . It ’s not a big earner , but we do fairly steady business , they ’re great novelties ... Oh , here ’s George ... ”
38002	38039	38040	38040	he	136	“ Giving him the tour ? Come through the back , Harry , that ’s where we ’re making the real money — pocket anything , you , and you ’ll pay in more than Galleons ! ”
38097	38107	38109	38109	Fred	215	“ We ’ve just developed this more serious line , ”
38111	38117	38109	38109	Fred	215	“ Funny how it happened ... ”
38118	38143	38145	38145	George	216	“ You would n’t believe how many people , even people who work at the Ministry , ca n’t do a decent Shield Charm , ”
38147	38161	38145	38145	George	216	“ ’ Course , they did n’t have you teaching them , Harry . ”
38162	38223	38109	38109	Fred	215	“ That ’s right ... Well , we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh , you know , challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off . But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff ! And we ’re still getting massive orders ! ”
38224	38239	38145	38145	George	216	“ So we ’ve expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks , Shield Gloves ... ”
38240	38264	38109	38109	Fred	215	“ ... I mean , they would n’t help much against the Unforgivable Curses , but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes ... ”
38265	38292	38294	38294	George	216	“ And then we thought we ’d get into the whole area of Defense Against the Dark Arts , because it ’s such a money spinner , ”
38297	38325	38294	38294	George	216	“ This is cool . Look , Instant Darkness Powder , we ’re importing it from Peru . Handy if you want to make a quick escape . ”
38326	38340	38342	38342	Fred	215	“ And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves , look , ”
38367	38397	38342	38342	Fred	215	“ You just drop one surreptitiously and it ’ll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight , giving you a diversion if you need one . ”
38398	38401	38403	38403	Harry	136	“ Handy , ”
38407	38410	38412	38412	George	216	“ Here , ”
38448	38467	38468	38468	she	1100	“ There ’s a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron , Mr. Weasley and Mr. Weasley , ”
38482	38486	38478	38478	Fred	215	“ Mr. Weasley , ”
38495	38506	38508	38508	George	216	“ Right you are , Verity , I ’m coming , ”
38511	38528	38508	38508	George	216	“ Harry , you help yourself to anything you want , all right ? No charge . ”
38529	38536	38538	38538	Harry	136	“ I ca n’t do that ! ”
38555	38562	38564	38564	Fred	215	“ You do n’t pay here , ”
38573	38576	38508	38508	George	216	“ But — ”
38577	38592	38594	38594	George	216	“ You gave us our start - up loan , we have n’t forgotten , ”
38597	38618	38594	38594	George	216	“ Take whatever you like , and just remember to tell people where you got it , if they ask . ”
38656	38668	38670	38670	Fred	215	“ Have n’t you girls found our special WonderWitch products yet ? ”
38672	38678	38670	38670	Fred	215	“ Follow me , ladies ... ”
38710	38715	38717	38717	Fred	215	“ There you go , ”
38720	38731	38717	38717	Fred	215	“ Best range of love potions you ’ll find anywhere . ”
38738	38743	38744	38744	she	218	“ Do they work ? ”
38747	38772	38732	38732	Ginny	218	“ Certainly they work , for up to twenty - four hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question — ”
38773	38782	38784	38784	George	216	“ — and the attractiveness of the girl , ”
38792	38803	38804	38804	he	1107	“ But we ’re not selling them to our sister , ”
38811	38829	38804	38804	he	1107	“ not when she ’s already got about five boys on the go from what we ’ve — ”
38830	38843	38845	38845	Ginny	218	“ Whatever you ’ve heard from Ron is a big fat lie , ”
38860	38865	38845	38845	Ginny	218	“ What ’s this ? ”
38866	38874	38876	38876	Fred	215	“ Guaranteed ten - second pimple vanisher , ”
38878	38910	38876	38876	Fred	215	“ Excellent on everything from boils to blackheads , but do n’t change the subject . Are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called Dean Thomas ? ”
38911	38917	38919	38919	Ginny	218	“ Yes , I am , ”
38921	38941	38919	38919	Ginny	218	“ And last time I looked , he was definitely one boy , not five . What are those ? ”
38975	38979	38981	38981	George	216	“ Pygmy Puffs , ”
38983	39001	38981	38981	George	216	“ Miniature puffskeins , we ca n’t breed them fast enough . So what about Michael Corner ? ”
39002	39013	39015	39015	Ginny	218	“ I dumped him , he was a bad loser , ”
39035	39041	39015	39015	Ginny	218	“ They ’re really cute ! ”
39042	39050	39052	39052	Fred	215	“ They ’re fairly cuddly , yes , ”
39054	39069	39052	39052	Fred	215	“ But you ’re moving through boyfriends a bit fast , are n’t you ? ”
39104	39118	39119	39119	she	218	“ It ’s none of your business . And I ’ll thank you , ”
39138	39149	39119	39119	she	218	“ not to tell tales about me to these two ! ”
39150	39163	39165	39165	Fred	215	“ That ’s three Galleons , nine Sickles , and a Knut , ”
39176	39180	39165	39165	Fred	215	“ Cough up . ”
39181	39187	39119	39119	she	218	“ I ’m your brother ! ”
39188	39211	39165	39165	Fred	215	“ And that ’s our stuff you ’re nicking . Three Galleons , nine Sickles . I ’ll knock off the Knut . ”
39212	39224	39119	39119	she	218	“ But I have n’t got three Galleons , nine Sickles ! ”
39225	39244	39165	39165	Fred	215	“ You ’d better put it back then , and mind you put it on the right shelves . ”
39276	39291	39292	39292	she	202	“ If I see you do that again I ’ll jinx your fingers together , ”
39296	39306	39308	39308	Ginny	218	“ Mum , can I have a Pygmy Puff ? ”
39312	39316	39318	39319	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ A what ? ”
39322	39330	39331	39332	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Look , they ’re so sweet ... ”
39400	39407	39409	39409	Harry	136	“ Wonder where his mummy is ? ”
39413	39424	39426	39426	Ron	201	“ Given her the slip by the looks of it , ”
39428	39433	39435	39435	Hermione	179	“ Why , though ? ”
39552	39559	39561	39561	Harry	136	“ Get under here , quick , ”
39572	39582	39584	39584	Hermione	179	“ Oh — I do n’t know , Harry , ”
39592	39596	39598	39598	Ron	201	“ Come on ! ”
39672	39680	39682	39682	Harry	136	“ He was going in that direction , ”
39698	39702	39690	39692	the humming Hagrid	176	“ C’m on . ”
39723	39732	39733	39733	she	179	“ That ’s him , is n’t it ? ”
39736	39740	39733	39733	she	179	“ Turning left ? ”
39741	39745	39747	39747	Ron	201	“ Big surprise , ”
39765	39774	39776	39776	Harry	136	“ Quick , or we ’ll lose him , ”
39781	39787	39789	39789	Hermione	179	“ Our feet’ll be seen ! ”
39817	39823	39825	39825	Harry	136	“ It does n’t matter , ”
39828	39832	39825	39825	Harry	136	“ Just hurry ! ”
39909	39912	39901	39901	Hermione	179	“ Ouch ! ”
39913	39923	39924	39924	she	179	“ Shh ! Look ! He ’s in there ! ”
40052	40063	40065	40065	Hermione	179	“ If only we could hear what they ’re saying ! ”
40067	40071	40073	40073	Ron	201	“ We can ! ”
40076	40082	40073	40073	Ron	201	“ Hang on — damn — ”
40102	40108	40083	40083	He	201	“ Extendable Ears , look ! ”
40109	40112	40114	40114	Hermione	179	“ Fantastic ! ”
40138	40149	40117	40117	Ron	201	“ Oh , I hope the door is n’t Imperturbable — ”
40150	40153	40155	40155	Ron	201	“ No ! ”
40158	40161	40155	40155	Ron	201	“ Listen ! ”
40198	40207	40179	40179	Malfoy	159	“ ... you know how to fix it ? ”
40208	40211	40213	40213	Borgin	253	“ Possibly , ”
40227	40247	40220	40220	he	253	“ I ’ll need to see it , though . Why do n’t you bring it into the shop ? ”
40248	40253	40255	40255	Malfoy	159	“ I ca n’t , ”
40257	40277	40255	40255	Malfoy	159	“ It ’s got to stay put . I just need you to tell me how to do it . ”
40286	40313	40282	40282	his	253	“ Well , without seeing it , I must say it will be a very difficult job , perhaps impossible . I could n’t guarantee anything . ”
40314	40317	40319	40319	Malfoy	159	“ No ? ”
40335	40344	40331	40331	Malfoy	159	“ Perhaps this will make you more confident . ”
40386	40390	40392	40392	Malfoy	159	“ Tell anyone , ”
40394	40433	40392	40392	Malfoy	159	“ and there will be retribution . You know Fenrir Greyback ? He ’s a family friend . He ’ll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you ’re giving the problem your full attention . ”
40434	40442	40392	40392	Malfoy	159	“ There will be no need for — ”
40443	40449	40451	40451	Malfoy	159	“ I ’ll decide that , ”
40453	40477	40451	40451	Malfoy	159	“ Well , I ’d better be off . And do n’t forget to keep that one safe , I ’ll need it . ”
40478	40488	40392	40392	Malfoy	159	“ Perhaps you ’d like to take it now ? ”
40489	40519	40451	40451	Malfoy	159	“ No , of course I would n’t , you stupid little man , how would I look carrying that down the street ? Just do n’t sell it . ”
40520	40527	40392	40392	Malfoy	159	“ Of course not ... sir . ”
40546	40563	40451	40451	Malfoy	159	“ Not a word to anyone , Borgin , and that includes my mother , understand ? ”
40564	40569	40571	40571	Borgin	253	“ Naturally , naturally , ”
40639	40645	40647	40647	Ron	201	“ What was that about ? ”
40655	40658	40660	40660	Harry	136	“ Dunno , ”
40665	40695	40660	40660	Harry	136	“ He wants something mended ... and he wants to reserve something in there ... Could you see what he pointed at when he said ‘ that one ’ ? ”
40696	40705	40734	40734	She	179	“ No , he was behind that cabinet — ”
40706	40712	40714	40714	Hermione	179	“ You two stay here , ”
40716	40722	40734	40734	She	179	“ What are you — ? ”
40776	40786	40787	40787	Hermione	179	“ Hello , horrible morning , is n’t it ? ”
40818	40825	40826	40826	she	179	“ Is this necklace for sale ? ”
40837	40849	40851	40852	Mr. Borgin	253	“ If you ’ve got one and a half thousand Galleons , ”
40855	40870	40872	40872	Hermione	179	“ Oh — er — no , I have n’t got quite that much , ”
40877	40889	40872	40872	Hermione	179	“ And ... what about this lovely — um — skull ? ”
40890	40894	40914	40915	Mr. Borgin	253	“ Sixteen Galleons . ”
40895	40913	40872	40872	Hermione	179	“ So it ’s for sale , then ? It is n’t being ... kept for anyone ? ”
40951	41014	40943	40943	she	179	“ The thing is , that — er — boy who was in here just now , Draco Malfoy , well , he ’s a friend of mine , and I want to get him a birthday present , but if he ’s already reserved anything , I obviously do n’t want to get him the same thing , so ... um ... ”
41033	41036	41037	41037	he	253	“ Out , ”
41041	41045	41037	41037	he	253	“ Get out ! ”
41085	41089	41091	41091	Ron	201	“ Ah well , ”
41100	41112	41091	41091	Ron	201	“ Worth a try , but you were a bit obvious — ”
41113	41131	41132	41132	she	179	“ Well , next time you can show me how it ’s done , Master of Mystery ! ”
41330	41343	41345	41345	Hermione	179	“ Yes , I ’ve already agreed it was fishy , Harry , ”
41387	41401	41350	41350	She	179	“ But have n’t we agreed there could be a lot of explanations ? ”
41402	41412	41414	41414	Ron	201	“ Maybe he ’s broken his Hand of Glory , ”
41429	41439	41418	41418	he	201	“ Remember that shriveled - up arm Malfoy had ? ”
41440	41459	41461	41461	Harry	136	“ But what about when he said , ‘ Do n’t forget to keep that one safe ’ ? ”
41467	41488	41461	41461	Harry	136	“ That sounded to me like Borgin ’s got another one of the broken objects , and Malfoy wants both . ”
41489	41493	41495	41495	Ron	201	“ You reckon ? ”
41508	41514	41516	41516	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I do , ”
41528	41544	41525	41525	he	136	“ Malfoy ’s father ’s in Azkaban . Do n’t you think Malfoy’d like revenge ? ”
41551	41563	41545	41545	Ron	201	“ Malfoy , revenge ? What can he do about it ? ”
41564	41575	41577	41577	Harry	136	“ That ’s my point , I do n’t know ! ”
41581	41605	41577	41577	Harry	136	“ But he ’s up to something and I think we should take it seriously . His father ’s a Death Eater and — ”
41632	41635	41637	41637	Hermione	179	“ Harry ? ”
41643	41648	41637	41637	Hermione	179	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
41649	41660	41662	41662	Ron	201	“ Your scar ’s not hurting again , is it ? ”
41665	41672	41674	41674	Harry	136	“ He ’s a Death Eater , ”
41677	41688	41674	41674	Harry	136	“ He ’s replaced his father as a Death Eater ! ”
41700	41721	41695	41695	Ron	201	“ Malfoy ? He ’s sixteen , Harry ! You think You - Know - Who would let Malfoy join ? ”
41722	41730	41732	41732	Hermione	179	“ It seems very unlikely , Harry , ”
41740	41747	41732	41732	Hermione	179	“ What makes you think — ? ”
41748	41794	41695	41695	Ron	201	“ In Madam Malkin ’s . She did n’t touch him , but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve . It was his left arm . He ’s been branded with the Dark Mark . ”
41803	41806	41808	41808	Ron	201	“ Well ... ”
41814	41828	41830	41830	Hermione	179	“ I think he just wanted to get out of there , Harry , ”
41832	41842	41843	41843	Harry	136	“ He showed Borgin something we could n’t see , ”
41848	41882	41843	41843	Harry	136	“ Something that seriously scared Borgin . It was the Mark , I know it — he was showing Borgin who he was dealing with , you saw how seriously Borgin took him ! ”
41890	41898	41885	41885	Hermione	179	“ I ’m not sure , Harry ... ”
41899	41917	41923	41923	he	136	“ Yeah , I still do n’t reckon You - Know - Who would let Malfoy join ... ”
41983	41994	41995	41995	she	218	“ I would n’t go in the kitchen just now , ”
41999	42008	41995	41995	she	218	“ There ’s a lot of Phlegm around . ”
42009	42020	42021	42021	Harry	136	“ I ’ll be careful not to slip in it . ”
42073	42119	42055	42056	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ ... Bill and I ’ ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids , Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer . I am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold — pink would of course be ’ orrible with Ginny ’s ’ air — ”
42120	42125	42127	42128	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Ah , Harry ! ”
42137	42172	42127	42128	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Good , I wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to Hogwarts tomorrow . We ’ve got Ministry cars again , and there will be Aurors waiting at the station — ”
42173	42181	42183	42183	Harry	136	“ Is Tonks going to be there ? ”
42191	42211	42256	42257	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ No , I do n’t think so , she ’s been stationed somewhere else from what Arthur said . ”
42212	42223	42224	42224	Fleur	220	“ She has let ’ erself go , zat Tonks , ”
42239	42247	42224	42224	Fleur	220	“ A big mistake if you ask — ”
42248	42254	42256	42257	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Yes , thank you , ”
42265	42296	42256	42257	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ You ’d better get on , Harry , I want the trunks ready tonight , if possible , so we do n’t have the usual last - minute scramble . ”
42365	42372	42374	42374	Fleur	220	“ Au revoir , ’ Arry , ”
42479	42488	42490	42491	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Quick , quick , through the barrier , ”
42503	42512	42490	42491	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Harry had better go first , with — ”
42546	42553	42555	42555	Harry	136	“ I can walk , thanks , ”
42650	42657	42659	42659	Hermione	179	“ We ca n’t , Harry , ”
42664	42687	42659	42659	Hermione	179	“ Ron and I ’ve got to go to the prefects ’ carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit . ”
42688	42695	42697	42697	Harry	136	“ Oh yeah , I forgot , ”
42699	42723	42725	42726	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ You ’d better get straight on the train , all of you , you ’ve only got a few minutes to go , ”
42732	42742	42729	42729	her	202	“ Well , have a lovely term , Ron ... ”
42743	42754	42756	42756	Harry	136	“ Mr. Weasley , can I have a quick word ? ”
42769	42773	42775	42776	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Of course , ”
42884	42892	42893	42893	Harry	136	“ When we were in Diagon Alley , ”
42905	42937	42897	42898	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Am I about to discover where you , Ron , and Hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred and George ’s shop ? ”
42938	42944	42897	42898	Mr. Weasley	204	“ How did you — ? ”
42945	42962	42897	42898	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Harry , please . You ’re talking to the man who raised Fred and George . ”
42963	42979	42897	42898	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Er ... yeah , all right , we were n’t in the back room . ”
42980	42992	42897	42898	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Very well , then , let ’s hear the worst . ”
42993	43007	42897	42898	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Well , we followed Draco Malfoy . We used my Invisibility Cloak . ”
43008	43026	42897	42898	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Did you have any particular reason for doing so , or was it a mere whim ? ”
43027	43037	43039	43039	Harry	136	“ Because I thought Malfoy was up to something , ”
43052	43067	43042	43043	Mr. Weasley	204	“ He ’d given his mother the slip and I wanted to know why . ”
43068	43074	43076	43077	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Of course you did , ”
43082	43091	43076	43077	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Well ? Did you find out why ? ”
43092	43100	43102	43102	Harry	136	“ He went into Borgin and Burkes , ”
43104	43158	43102	43102	Harry	136	“ and started bullying the bloke in there , Borgin , to help him fix something . And he said he wanted Borgin to keep something else for him . He made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing . Like they were a pair . And ... ”
43165	43211	43076	43077	Mr. Weasley	204	“ There ’s something else . We saw Malfoy jump about a mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm . I think he ’s been branded with the Dark Mark . I think he ’s replaced his father as a Death Eater . ”
43224	43244	43221	43221	he	204	“ Harry , I doubt whether You - Know - Who would allow a sixteen - year - old — ”
43245	43262	43264	43264	Harry	136	“ Does anyone really know what You - Know - Who would or would n’t do ? ”
43267	43311	43221	43221	he	204	“ Mr. Weasley , I ’m sorry , but is n’t it worth investigating ? If Malfoy wants something fixing , and he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done , it ’s probably something Dark or dangerous , is n’t it ? ”
43312	43323	43325	43326	Mr. Weasley	204	“ I doubt it , to be honest , Harry , ”
43329	43354	43325	43326	Mr. Weasley	204	“ You see , when Lucius Malfoy was arrested , we raided his house . We took away everything that might have been dangerous . ”
43355	43362	43364	43364	Harry	136	“ I think you missed something , ”
43367	43372	43374	43375	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Well , maybe , ”
43407	43413	43415	43416	Mr. Weasley	204	“ You ’d better hurry , ”
43423	43428	43419	43420	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Harry , quickly ! ”
43446	43474	43476	43477	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Now , dear , you ’re coming to us for Christmas , it ’s all fixed with Dumbledore , so we ’ll see you quite soon , ”
43497	43507	43483	43483	Harry	136	“ You make sure you look after yourself and — ”
43514	43520	43521	43521	She	202	“ — be good and — ”
43529	43534	43521	43521	She	202	“ — stay safe ! ”
43651	43654	43676	43676	He	136	“ Chosen One ”
43683	43691	43676	43676	He	136	“ Fancy trying to find a compartment ? ”
43692	43706	43708	43708	Ginny	218	“ I ca n’t , Harry , I said I ’d meet Dean , ”
43711	43716	43708	43708	Ginny	218	“ See you later . ”
43717	43720	43722	43722	Harry	136	“ Right , ”
43791	43796	43803	43803	him	136	“ Hi , Harry ! ”
43805	43808	43810	43810	Harry	136	“ Neville ! ”
43826	43831	43833	43841	a girl with long hair and large misty eyes	1188	“ Hello , Harry , ”
43849	43858	43833	43841	a girl with long hair and large misty eyes	1188	“ Luna , hi , how are you ? ”
43859	43866	43868	43868	Luna	261	“ Very well , thank you , ”
43895	43903	43905	43905	Harry	136	“ Quibbler still going strong , then ? ”
43926	43935	43937	43937	Luna	261	“ Oh yes , circulation ’s well up , ”
43940	43946	43948	43948	Harry	136	“ Let ’s find seats , ”
43981	43989	43991	43991	Neville	162	“ They ’re even staring at us ! ”
43998	44005	43991	43991	Neville	162	“ Because we ’re with you ! ”
44006	44020	44022	44022	Harry	136	“ They ’re staring at you because you were at the Ministry too , ”
44034	44052	44022	44022	Harry	136	“ Our little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet , you must ’ve seen it . ”
44053	44067	44069	44069	Neville	162	“ Yes , I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity , ”
44071	44101	44069	44069	Neville	162	“ but she was really pleased . Says I ’m starting to live up to my dad at long last . She bought me a new wand , look ! ”
44112	44118	44119	44119	he	162	“ Cherry and unicorn hair , ”
44123	44149	44119	44119	he	162	“ We think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold , he vanished next day — oi , come back here , Trevor ! ”
44171	44183	44185	44185	Luna	261	“ Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year , Harry ? ”
44202	44216	44218	44218	Harry	136	“ No point now we ’ve got rid of Umbridge , is there ? ”
44242	44254	44282	44282	Luna	261	“ I liked the D.A. ! I learned loads with you ! ”
44255	44262	44264	44264	Luna	261	“ I enjoyed the meetings too , ”
44267	44274	44264	44264	Luna	261	“ It was like having friends . ”
44334	44339	44423	44423	she	1198	“ You ask him ! ”
44340	44345	44377	44377	her	1198	“ No , you ! ”
44346	44352	44423	44423	she	1198	“ I ’ll do it ! ”
44383	44395	44396	44396	she	1198	“ Hi , Harry , I ’m Romilda , Romilda Vane , ”
44402	44422	44423	44423	she	1198	“ Why do n’t you join us in our compartment ? You do n’t have to sit with them , ”
44474	44481	44483	44483	Harry	136	“ They ’re friends of mine , ”
44486	44489	44491	44492	the girl	4164	“ Oh , ”
44498	44503	44491	44492	the girl	4164	“ Oh . Okay . ”
44515	44526	44528	44528	Luna	261	“ People expect you to have cooler friends than us , ”
44539	44544	44546	44546	Harry	136	“ You are cool , ”
44549	44565	44546	44546	Harry	136	“ None of them was at the Ministry . They did n’t fight with me . ”
44566	44576	44578	44578	Luna	261	“ That ’s a very nice thing to say , ”
44597	44606	44608	44608	Neville	162	“ We did n’t face him , though , ”
44632	44674	44627	44627	Trevor	265	“ You did . You should hear my gran talk about you . ‘ That Harry Potter ’s got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together ! ’ She ’d give anything to have you as a grandson ... ”
44712	44715	44718	44718	him	162	“ Acceptable , ”
44856	44859	44855	44859	no “ Chosen One ”	4249	“ Chosen One ”
44891	44902	44904	44904	Neville	162	“ You all right , Harry ? You look funny , ”
44909	44914	44906	44906	Harry	136	“ Sorry — I — ”
44915	44920	44922	44922	Luna	261	“ Wrackspurt got you ? ”
44934	44939	44922	44922	Luna	261	“ I — what ? ”
44940	44961	44962	44962	she	261	“ A Wrackspurt ... They ’re invisible . They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy , ”
44965	44976	44962	44962	she	261	“ I thought I felt one zooming around in here . ”
45070	45083	45085	45085	Ron	201	“ Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up , I ’m starving , ”
45099	45111	45112	45112	he	201	“ Hi , Neville . Hi , Luna . Guess what ? ”
45119	45146	45112	45112	he	201	“ Malfoy ’s not doing prefect duty . He ’s just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins , we saw him when we passed . ”
45181	45191	45169	45169	prefect	1209	“ What did he do when he saw you ? ”
45192	45196	45198	45198	Ron	201	“ The usual , ”
45207	45221	45223	45223	he	201	“ Not like him , though , is it ? Well — that is ”
45230	45242	45223	45223	he	201	“ but why is n’t he out there bullying first years ? ”
45243	45246	45248	45248	Harry	136	“ Dunno , ”
45275	45283	45285	45285	Hermione	179	“ Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad , ”
45287	45299	45285	45285	Hermione	179	“ Maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that . ”
45300	45307	45309	45309	Harry	136	“ I do n’t think so , ”
45311	45317	45309	45309	Harry	136	“ I think he ’s — ”
45343	45359	45360	45360	she	1211	“ I ’m supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry P - Potter , ”
45410	45415	45416	45416	Ron	201	“ What is it ? ”
45424	45428	45430	45430	Harry	136	“ An invitation , ”
45432	45438	45440	45440	Neville	162	“ Who ’s Professor Slughorn ? ”
45449	45453	45455	45455	Harry	136	“ New teacher , ”
45457	45472	45455	45455	Harry	136	“ Well , I suppose we ’ll have to go , wo n’t we ? ”
45473	45482	45484	45484	Neville	162	“ But what does he want me for ? ”
45494	45498	45500	45500	Harry	136	“ No idea , ”
45520	45523	45524	45524	he	136	“ Listen , ”
45534	45563	45524	45524	he	136	“ let ’s go under the Invisibility Cloak , then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way , see what he ’s up to . ”
45764	45769	45771	45771	Slughorn	199	“ Harry , m’boy ! ”
45821	45839	45799	45799	His	199	“ Good to see you , good to see you ! And you must be Mr. Longbottom ! ”
45937	45945	45946	45946	Slughorn	199	“ Now , do you know everyone ? ”
45952	45963	45946	45946	Slughorn	199	“ Blaise Zabini is in your year , of course — ”
45991	46008	46009	46009	McLaggen	272	“ This is Cormac McLaggen , perhaps you ’ve come across each other — ? No ? ”
46032	46047	46026	46026	Neville	162	“ — and this is Marcus Belby , I do n’t know whether — ? ”
46063	46076	46077	46077	Slughorn	199	“ — and this charming young lady tells me she knows you ! ”
46092	46101	46103	46103	Slughorn	199	“ Well now , this is most pleasant , ”
46106	46166	46103	46103	Slughorn	199	“ A chance to get to know you all a little better . Here , take a napkin . I ’ve packed my own lunch ; the trolley , as I remember it , is heavy on licorice wands , and a poor old man ’s digestive system is n’t quite up to such things ... Pheasant , Belby ? ”
46179	46198	46199	46199	Slughorn	199	“ I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles , ”
46213	46239	46199	46199	Slughorn	199	“ Outstanding wizard , outstanding , and his Order of Merlin most well - deserved . Do you see much of your uncle , Marcus ? ”
46271	46274	46276	46276	Slughorn	199	“ Anapneo , ”
46293	46303	46305	46305	Belby	273	“ Not ... not much of him , no , ”
46311	46323	46325	46325	Slughorn	199	“ Well , of course , I daresay he ’s busy , ”
46332	46345	46325	46325	Slughorn	199	“ I doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work ! ”
46346	46350	46352	46352	Belby	273	“ I suppose ... ”
46374	46400	46368	46368	Slughorn	199	“ Er ... he and my dad do n’t get on very well , you see , so I do n’t really know much about ... ”
46418	46425	46427	46427	Slughorn	199	“ Now , you , Cormac , ”
46429	46464	46427	46427	Slughorn	199	“ I happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius , because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in , I think , Norfolk ? ”
46465	46477	46479	46479	McLaggen	272	“ Oh , yeah , that was fun , that was , ”
46481	46500	46479	46479	McLaggen	272	“ We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour — this was before he became Minister , obviously — ”
46501	46511	46513	46513	Slughorn	199	“ Ah , you know Bertie and Rufus too ? ”
46531	46536	46526	46526	Belby	273	“ Now tell me ... ”
46689	46693	46695	46695	Slughorn	199	“ And now , ”
46713	46735	46736	46736	He	199	“ Harry Potter ! Where to begin ? I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer ! ”
46758	46771	46736	46736	He	199	“ ‘ The Chosen One , ’ they ’re calling you now ! ”
46788	46792	46794	46794	Slughorn	199	“ Of course , ”
46800	46840	46794	46794	Slughorn	199	“ there have been rumors for years ... I remember when — well — after that terrible night — Lily — James — and you survived — and the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary — ”
46865	46879	46794	46794	Slughorn	199	“ Yeah , Zabini , because you ’re so talented ... at posing ... ”
46880	46884	46886	46886	Slughorn	199	“ Oh dear ! ”
46905	46940	46892	46892	Ginny	218	“ You want to be careful , Blaise ! I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous Bat - Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage ! I would n’t cross her ! ”
46946	46949	46951	46951	Slughorn	199	“ Anyway , ”
46958	47020	46951	46951	Slughorn	199	“ Such rumors this summer . Of course , one does n’t know what to believe , the Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies , make mistakes — but there seems little doubt , given the number of witnesses , that there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all ! ”
47047	47096	47042	47042	Slughorn	199	“ So modest , so modest , no wonder Dumbledore is so fond — you were there , then ? But the rest of the stories — so sensational , of course , one does n’t know quite what to believe — this fabled prophecy , for instance — ”
47097	47104	47106	47106	Neville	162	“ We never heard a prophecy , ”
47116	47121	47123	47123	Ginny	218	“ That ’s right , ”
47126	47153	47123	47123	Ginny	218	“ Neville and I were both there too , and all this ‘ Chosen One ’ rubbish is just the Prophet making things up as usual . ”
47154	47164	47166	47166	Slughorn	199	“ You were both there too , were you ? ”
47188	47205	47206	47206	Slughorn	199	“ Yes ... well ... it is true that the Prophet often exaggerates , of course ... ”
47214	47238	47206	47206	Slughorn	199	“ I remember dear Gwenog telling me ( Gwenog Jones , I mean , of course , Captain of the Holyhead Harpies ) — ”
47301	47304	47298	47298	he	199	“ Slug Club ”
47350	47415	47416	47416	he	199	“ Good gracious , it ’s getting dark already ! I did n’t notice that they ’d lit the lamps ! You ’d better go and change into your robes , all of you . McLaggen , you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails . Harry , Blaise — any time you ’re passing . Same goes for you , miss , ”
47421	47432	47416	47416	he	199	“ Well , off you go , off you go ! ”
47468	47476	47478	47478	Neville	162	“ I ’m glad that ’s over , ”
47480	47488	47478	47478	Neville	162	“ Strange man , is n’t he ? ”
47489	47497	47499	47499	Harry	136	“ Yeah , he is a bit , ”
47506	47517	47499	47499	Harry	136	“ How come you ended up in there , Ginny ? ”
47518	47526	47528	47528	Ginny	218	“ He saw me hex Zacharias Smith , ”
47530	47601	47528	47528	Ginny	218	“ You remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D.A. ? He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him — when Slughorn came in I thought I was going to get detention , but he just thought it was a really good hex and invited me to lunch ! Mad , eh ? ”
47602	47615	47617	47617	Harry	136	“ Better reason for inviting someone than because their mother ’s famous , ”
47628	47634	47617	47617	Harry	136	“ or because their uncle — ”
47763	47771	47773	47773	Harry	136	“ I ’ll see you two later , ”
47789	47796	47798	47798	Neville	162	“ But what ’re you — ? ”
47800	47803	47805	47805	Harry	136	“ Later ! ”
47903	47911	47916	47916	he	271	“ What ’s wrong with this thing ? ”
48174	48179	48181	48181	Malfoy	159	“ So , Zabini , ”
48183	48189	48181	48181	Malfoy	159	“ what did Slughorn want ? ”
48190	48202	48204	48204	Zabini	271	“ Just trying to make up to well - connected people , ”
48213	48222	48204	48204	Zabini	271	“ Not that he managed to find many . ”
48232	48239	48240	48240	he	159	“ Who else had he invited ? ”
48243	48248	48250	48250	Zabini	271	“ McLaggen from Gryffindor , ”
48252	48264	48266	48266	Malfoy	159	“ Oh yeah , his uncle ’s big in the Ministry , ”
48268	48278	48266	48266	Malfoy	159	“ — someone else called Belby , from Ravenclaw — ”
48279	48288	48290	48290	Pansy	284	“ Not him , he ’s a prat ! ”
48292	48304	48306	48306	Zabini	271	“ — and Longbottom , Potter , and that Weasley girl , ”
48320	48325	48308	48308	Malfoy	159	“ He invited Longbottom ? ”
48326	48338	48340	48340	Zabini	271	“ Well , I assume so , as Longbottom was there , ”
48343	48352	48308	48308	Malfoy	159	“ What ’s Longbottom got to interest Slughorn ? ”
48356	48374	48376	48376	Malfoy	159	“ Potter , precious Potter , obviously he wanted a look at ‘ the Chosen One , ’ ”
48378	48391	48376	48376	Malfoy	159	“ but that Weasley girl ! What ’s so special about her ? ”
48392	48400	48402	48402	Pansy	284	“ A lot of boys like her , ”
48417	48444	48402	48402	Pansy	284	“ Even you think she ’s good - looking , do n’t you , Blaise , and we all know how hard you are to please ! ”
48445	48462	48464	48464	Zabini	271	“ I would n’t touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like , ”
48489	48547	48402	48402	Pansy	284	“ Well , I pity Slughorn ’s taste . Maybe he ’s going a bit senile . Shame , my father always said he was a good wizard in his day . My father used to be a bit of a favorite of his . Slughorn probably has n’t heard I ’m on the train , or — ”
48548	48557	48559	48559	Zabini	271	“ I would n’t bank on an invitation , ”
48561	48622	48559	48559	Zabini	271	“ He asked me about Nott ’s father when I first arrived . They used to be old friends , apparently , but when he heard he ’d been caught at the Ministry he did n’t look happy , and Nott did n’t get an invitation , did he ? I do n’t think Slughorn ’s interested in Death Eaters . ”
48635	48662	48663	48663	Malfoy	159	“ Well , who cares what he ’s interested in ? What is he , when you come down to it ? Just some stupid teacher . ”
48667	48699	48663	48663	Malfoy	159	“ I mean , I might not even be at Hogwarts next year , what ’s it matter to me if some fat old has - been likes me or not ? ”
48700	48715	48717	48717	Pansy	284	“ What do you mean , you might not be at Hogwarts next year ? ”
48726	48733	48735	48735	Malfoy	159	“ Well , you never know , ”
48743	48758	48735	48735	Malfoy	159	“ I might have — er — moved on to bigger and better things . ”
48837	48844	48824	48824	Pansy	284	“ Do you mean — Him ? ”
48848	48925	48845	48845	Malfoy	159	“ Mother wants me to complete my education , but personally , I do n’t see it as that important these days . I mean , think about it ... When the Dark Lord takes over , is he going to care how many O.W.L.s or N.E.W.T.s anyone ’s got ? Of course he is n’t ... It ’ll be all about the kind of service he received , the level of devotion he was shown . ”
48926	48940	48942	48942	Zabini	271	“ And you think you ’ll be able to do something for him ? ”
48945	48956	48942	48942	Zabini	271	“ Sixteen years old and not even fully qualified yet ? ”
48957	48996	48998	48998	Malfoy	159	“ I ’ve just said , have n’t I ? Maybe he does n’t care if I ’m qualified . Maybe the job he wants me to do is n’t something that you need to be qualified for , ”
49032	49038	49040	49040	Malfoy	159	“ I can see Hogwarts , ”
49058	49067	49050	49050	he	159	“ We ’d better get our robes on . ”
49309	49314	49315	49315	Malfoy	159	“ You go on , ”
49337	49345	49325	49325	her	1273	“ I just want to check something . ”
49450	49454	49435	49435	he	159	“ Petrificus Totalus ! ”
49542	49547	49548	49548	he	159	“ I thought so , ”
49552	49577	49548	49548	he	159	“ I heard Goyle ’s trunk hit you . And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came back ... ”
49589	49609	49611	49611	he	159	“ You did n’t hear anything I care about , Potter . But while I ’ve got you here ... ”
49631	49644	49611	49611	he	159	“ That ’s from my father . Now , let ’s see ... ”
49662	49679	49680	49680	he	159	“ I do n’t reckon they ’ll find you till the train ’s back in London , ”
49684	49694	49680	49680	he	159	“ See you around , Potter ... or not . ”
49992	49996	50045	50045	he	136	“ Accio Wand ! ”
50188	50193	50202	50202	Harry	136	“ Wotcher , Harry . ”
50257	50268	50269	50269	she	209	“ We ’d better get out of here , quickly , ”
50290	50298	50269	50269	she	209	“ Come on , we ’ll jump . ”
50409	50414	50401	50401	she	209	“ Who did it ? ”
50415	50419	50421	50421	Harry	136	“ Draco Malfoy , ”
50424	50430	50421	50421	Harry	136	“ Thanks for ... well ... ”
50431	50435	50437	50437	Tonks	209	“ No problem , ”
50474	50485	50451	50451	she	209	“ I can fix your nose if you stand still . ”
50541	50544	50546	50546	Tonks	209	“ Episkey , ”
50575	50580	50560	50560	He	136	“ Thanks a lot ! ”
50581	50600	50602	50602	Tonks	209	“ You ’d better put that Cloak back on , and we can walk up to the school , ”
50638	50644	50646	50646	Harry	136	“ Was that a Patronus ? ”
50657	50686	50618	50618	her	209	“ Yes , I ’m sending word to the castle that I ’ve got you or they ’ll worry . Come on , we ’d better not dawdle . ”
50699	50706	50687	50687	They	1306	“ How did you find me ? ”
50707	50751	50618	50618	her	209	“ I noticed you had n’t left the train and I knew you had that Cloak . I thought you might be hiding for some reason . When I saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought I ’d check . ”
50752	50762	50763	50763	Harry	136	“ But what are you doing here , anyway ? ”
50766	50781	50783	50783	Tonks	209	“ I ’m stationed in Hogsmeade now , to give the school extra protection , ”
50785	50799	50618	50618	her	209	“ Is it just you who ’s stationed up here , or — ? ”
50800	50813	50763	50763	Harry	136	“ No , Proudfoot , Savage , and Dawlish are here too . ”
50814	50824	50618	50618	her	209	“ Dawlish , that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year ? ”
50825	50830	50763	50763	Harry	136	“ That ’s right . ”
51097	51100	51101	51101	he	136	“ Alohomora ! ”
51116	51124	51126	51126	Tonks	209	“ That wo n’t work on these , ”
51128	51134	51126	51126	Tonks	209	“ Dumbledore bewitched them himself . ”
51139	51146	51147	51147	he	136	“ I could climb a wall , ”
51150	51157	51159	51159	Tonks	209	“ No , you could n’t , ”
51162	51181	51159	51159	Tonks	209	“ Anti - intruder jinxes on all of them . Security ’s been tightened a hundredfold this summer . ”
51182	51186	51188	51188	Harry	136	“ Well then , ”
51200	51216	51188	51188	Harry	136	“ I suppose I ’ll just have to sleep out here and wait for morning . ”
51217	51225	51227	51227	Tonks	209	“ Someone ’s coming down for you , ”
51229	51232	51227	51227	Tonks	209	“ Look . ”
51336	51343	51345	51345	Snape	147	“ Well , well , well , ”
51369	51396	51349	51349	his	147	“ Nice of you to turn up , Potter , although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance . ”
51397	51409	51410	51410	Harry	136	“ I could n’t change , I did n’t have my — ”
51419	51440	51414	51414	Snape	147	“ There is no need to wait , Nymphadora , Potter is quite — ah — safe in my hands . ”
51441	51450	51452	51452	Tonks	209	“ I meant Hagrid to get the message , ”
51456	51483	51485	51485	Snape	147	“ Hagrid was late for the start - of - term feast , just like Potter here , so I took it instead . And incidentally , ”
51496	51506	51485	51485	Snape	147	“ I was interested to see your new Patronus . ”
51538	51550	51552	51552	Snape	147	“ I think you were better off with the old one , ”
51561	51568	51552	51552	Snape	147	“ The new one looks weak . ”
51601	51605	51606	51606	Harry	136	“ Good night , ”
51626	51632	51606	51606	Harry	136	“ Thanks for ... everything . ”
51633	51639	51606	51606	Harry	136	“ See you , Harry . ”
51814	51825	51827	51827	Snape	147	“ Fifty points from Gryffindor for lateness , I think , ”
51829	51880	51827	51827	Snape	147	“ And , let me see , another twenty for your Muggle attire . You know , I do n’t believe any House has ever been in negative figures this early in the term : We have n’t even started pudding . You might have set a record , Potter . ”
51916	51929	51930	51930	Snape	147	“ I suppose you wanted to make an entrance , did you ? ”
51933	51959	51930	51930	Snape	147	“ And with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect . ”
52100	52124	52097	52097	Snape	147	“ No Cloak . You can walk in so that everyone sees you , which is what you wanted , I ’m sure . ”
52250	52265	52267	52267	Ron	201	“ Where ’ve you — blimey , what ’ve you done to your face ? ”
52280	52289	52291	52291	Harry	136	“ Why , what ’s wrong with it ? ”
52303	52310	52312	52312	Hermione	179	“ You ’re covered in blood ! ”
52314	52318	52312	52312	Hermione	179	“ Come here — ”
52325	52328	52319	52319	She	179	“ Tergeo ! ”
52336	52339	52341	52341	Harry	136	“ Thanks , ”
52349	52356	52341	52341	Harry	136	“ How ’s my nose looking ? ”
52357	52360	52362	52362	Hermione	179	“ Normal , ”
52365	52381	52362	52362	Hermione	179	“ Why should n’t it ? Harry , what happened ? We ’ve been terrified ! ”
52382	52389	52391	52391	Harry	136	“ I ’ll tell you later , ”
52429	52432	52434	52434	Hermione	179	“ But — ”
52436	52442	52444	52444	Harry	136	“ Not now , Hermione , ”
52542	52550	52552	52552	Hermione	179	“ You missed the Sorting , anyway , ”
52563	52569	52571	52571	Harry	136	“ Hat say anything interesting ? ”
52580	52603	52552	52552	Hermione	179	“ More of the same , really ... advising us all to unite in the face of our enemies , you know . ”
52604	52611	52552	52552	Hermione	179	“ Dumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all ? ”
52612	52639	52552	52552	Hermione	179	“ Not yet , but he always saves his proper speech for after the feast , does n’t he ? It ca n’t be long now . ”
52640	52650	52552	52552	Hermione	179	“ Snape said Hagrid was late for the feast — ”
52651	52660	52662	52662	Ron	201	“ You ’ve seen Snape ? How come ? ”
52669	52674	52676	52676	Harry	136	“ Bumped into him , ”
52679	52688	52690	52690	Hermione	179	“ Hagrid was only a few minutes late , ”
52692	52703	52690	52690	Hermione	179	“ Look , he ’s waving at you , Harry . ”
52976	52984	52985	52985	Hermione	179	“ So what did Professor Slughorn want ? ”
52988	52998	53000	53000	Harry	136	“ To know what really happened at the Ministry , ”
53002	53009	53011	53011	Hermione	179	“ Him and everyone else here , ”
53013	53030	53011	53011	Hermione	179	“ People were interrogating us about it on the train , were n’t they , Ron ? ”
53031	53034	53036	53036	Ron	201	“ Yeah , ”
53038	53053	53036	53036	Ron	201	“ All wanting to know if you really are ‘ the Chosen One ’ — ”
53054	53069	53071	53073	Nearly Headless Nick	297	“ There has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts , ”
53091	53157	53036	53036	Ron	201	“ I am considered something of a Potter authority ; it is widely known that we are friendly . I have assured the spirit community that I will not pester you for information , however . ‘ Harry Potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence , ’ I told them . ‘ I would rather die than betray his trust . ’ ”
53158	53172	53173	53173	Ron	201	“ That ’s not saying much , seeing as you ’re already dead , ”
53176	53190	53192	53194	Nearly Headless Nick	297	“ Once again , you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe , ”
53241	53250	53251	53251	he	138	“ The very best of evenings to you ! ”
53269	53276	53278	53278	Hermione	179	“ What happened to his hand ? ”
53344	53350	53351	53351	he	138	“ Nothing to worry about , ”
53355	53382	53351	53351	he	138	“ Now ... to our new students , welcome , to our old students , welcome back ! Another year full of magical education awaits you ... ”
53383	53397	53398	53398	Harry	136	“ His hand was like that when I saw him over the summer , ”
53403	53423	53398	53398	Harry	136	“ I thought he ’d have cured it by now , though ... or Madam Pomfrey would ’ve done . ”
53424	53433	53435	53435	Hermione	179	“ It looks as if it ’s died , ”
53442	53463	53435	53435	Hermione	179	“ But there are some injuries you ca n’t cure ... old curses ... and there are poisons without antidotes ... ”
53464	53548	53398	53398	Harry	136	“ ... and Mr. Filch , our caretaker , has asked me to say that there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes . Those wishing to play for their House Quidditch teams should give their names to their Heads of House as usual . We are also looking for new Quidditch commentators , who should do likewise . We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year . Professor Slughorn ”
53550	53592	53398	53398	Harry	136	“ Slughorn stood up , his bald head gleaming in the candlelight , his big waistcoated belly casting the table below into shadow — is a former colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master . ”
53593	53596	53398	53398	Harry	136	“ Potions ? ”
53597	53600	53398	53398	Harry	136	“ Potions ? ”
53617	53620	53622	53622	Ron	201	“ Potions ? ”
53633	53638	53631	53631	Harry	136	“ But you said — ”
53639	53645	53650	53650	his	138	“ Professor Snape , meanwhile , ”
53661	53676	53650	53650	his	138	“ will be taking over the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher . ”
53677	53680	53682	53682	Harry	136	“ No ! ”
53745	53764	53766	53766	Hermione	179	“ But Harry , you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts ! ”
53768	53774	53776	53776	Harry	136	“ I thought he was ! ”
53871	53880	53881	53881	he	136	“ Well , there ’s one good thing , ”
53885	53896	53881	53881	he	136	“ Snape’ll be gone by the end of the year . ”
53897	53903	53905	53905	Ron	201	“ What do you mean ? ”
53907	53942	53881	53881	he	136	“ That job ’s jinxed . No one ’s lasted more than a year ... Quirrell actually died doing it ... Personally , I ’m going to keep my fingers crossed for another death ... ”
53943	53946	53948	53948	Hermione	179	“ Harry ! ”
53954	53970	53972	53972	Ron	201	“ He might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the year , ”
53975	53992	53972	53972	Ron	201	“ That Slughorn bloke might not want to stay long - term . Moody did n’t . ”
54074	54099	54051	54051	Dumbledore	138	“ Now , as everybody in this Hall knows , Lord Voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength . ”
54147	54312	54136	54136	he	159	“ I can not emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is , and how much care each of us at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe . The castle ’s magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer , we are protected in new and more powerful ways , but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff . I urge you , therefore , to abide by any security restrictions that your teachers might impose upon you , however irksome you might find them — in particular , the rule that you are not to be out of bed after hours . I implore you , should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle , to report it to a member of staff immediately . I trust you to conduct yourselves , always , with the utmost regard for your own and others ’ safety . ”
54327	54373	54322	54322	he	138	“ But now , your beds await , as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish , and I know that your top priority is to be well - rested for your lessons tomorrow . Let us therefore say good night . Pip pip ! ”
54484	54492	54493	54493	he	201	“ What really happened to your nose ? ”
54540	54552	54553	54553	he	201	“ I saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose , ”
54557	54566	54568	54568	Harry	136	“ Yeah , well , never mind that , ”
54571	54586	54568	54568	Harry	136	“ Listen to what he was saying before he found out I was there ... ”
54612	54640	54608	54608	Ron	201	“ Come on , Harry , he was just showing off for Parkinson ... What kind of mission would You - Know - Who have given him ? ”
54641	54660	54601	54601	Harry	136	“ How d’you know Voldemort does n’t need someone at Hogwarts ? It would n’t be the first — ”
54661	54674	54608	54608	Ron	201	“ I wish yeh’d stop sayin ’ tha ’ name , Harry , ”
54694	54700	54702	54702	Harry	136	“ Dumbledore uses that name , ”
54705	54716	54718	54718	Hagrid	176	“ Yeah , well , tha ’s Dumbledore , innit ? ”
54721	54735	54718	54718	Hagrid	176	“ So how come yeh were late , Harry ? I was worried . ”
54736	54744	54746	54746	Harry	136	“ Got held up on the train , ”
54748	54754	54746	54746	Harry	136	“ Why were you late ? ”
54755	54761	54763	54763	Hagrid	176	“ I was with Grawp , ”
54766	54813	54763	54763	Hagrid	176	“ Los ’ track o ’ the time . He ’s got a new home up in the mountains now , Dumbledore fixed it — nice big cave . He ’s much happier than he was in the forest . We were havin’ a good chat . ”
54814	54817	54819	54819	Harry	136	“ Really ? ”
54873	54883	54885	54885	Hagrid	176	“ Oh yeah , he ’s really come on , ”
54888	54907	54885	54885	Hagrid	176	“ Yeh’ll be amazed . I ’m thinkin ’ o ’ trainin ’ him up as me assistant . ”
54933	54966	54974	54974	he	201	“ Anyway , I ’ll see yeh tomorrow , firs ’ lesson ’s straight after lunch . Come early an ’ yeh can say hello ter Buck — I mean , Witherwings ! ”
55007	55020	54997	54997	Ron	201	“ You ’re not taking Care of Magical Creatures , are you ? ”
55026	55036	55021	55021	Ron	201	“ And you ’re not either , are you ? ”
55043	55047	55049	55049	Ron	201	“ And Hermione , ”
55051	55059	55049	55049	Ron	201	“ she ’s not , is she ? ”
55131	55145	55147	55147	Ron	201	“ But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson , was n’t he ? ”
55156	55159	55160	55160	she	179	“ Well , ”
55164	55194	55160	55160	she	179	“ I do n’t know ... It would be like Malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is ... but that ’s a big lie to tell ... ”
55195	55198	55200	55200	Harry	136	“ Exactly , ”
55235	55242	55243	55243	Ron	201	“ It ’s rude to point , ”
55298	55330	55295	55295	Ron	201	“ I love being a sixth year . And we ’re going to be getting free time this year . Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax . ”
55331	55344	55346	55346	Hermione	179	“ We ’re going to need that time for studying , Ron ! ”
55356	55363	55365	55365	Ron	201	“ Yeah , but not today , ”
55367	55380	55365	55365	Ron	201	“ Today ’s going to be a real doss , I reckon . ”
55381	55385	55387	55387	Hermione	179	“ Hold it ! ”
55419	55429	55430	55430	she	179	“ Fanged Frisbees are banned , hand it over , ”
55472	55483	55456	55456	Ron	201	“ Excellent , I ’ve always wanted one of these . ”
55584	55599	55600	55600	she	179	“ But he ca n’t really think we ’d continue Care of Magical Creatures ! ”
55606	55623	55600	55600	she	179	“ I mean , when has any of us expressed ... you know ... any enthusiasm ? ”
55624	55633	55635	55635	Ron	201	“ That ’s it , though , innit ? ”
55644	55681	55635	55635	Ron	201	“ We were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid . But he thinks we liked the stupid subject . D’you reckon anyone ’s going to go on to N.E.W.T. ? ”
55859	55864	55865	55865	she	232	“ Herbology , fine , ”
55868	55942	55865	55865	she	232	“ Professor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an ‘ Outstanding ’ O.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark Arts with ‘ Exceeds Expectations . ’ But the problem is Transfiguration . I ’m sorry , Longbottom , but an ‘ Acceptable ’ really is n’t good enough to continue to N.E.W.T. level . I just do n’t think you ’d be able to cope with the coursework . ”
55958	55982	55948	55949	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration , anyway ? I ’ve never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it . ”
55990	55995	55983	55983	Neville	162	“ my grandmother wants . ”
55996	55999	56001	56002	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Hmph , ”
56004	56041	56001	56002	Professor McGonagall	232	“ It ’s high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she ’s got , rather than the one she thinks she ought to have — particularly after what happened at the Ministry . ”
56060	56102	56166	56167	Professor McGonagall	232	“ I ’m sorry , Longbottom , but I can not let you into my N.E.W.T. class . I see that you have an ‘ Exceeds Expectations ’ in Charms , however — why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms ? ”
56103	56113	56115	56115	Neville	162	“ My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option , ”
56117	56121	56123	56124	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Take Charms , ”
56126	56152	56123	56124	Professor McGonagall	232	“ and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L. , the subject is not necessarily worthless . ”
56217	56230	56240	56240	her	232	“ He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year , ”
56255	56266	56248	56248	she	232	“ The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney . ”
56279	56286	56288	56289	Professor McGonagall	232	“ So , Potter , Potter ... ”
56300	56356	56295	56295	she	232	“ Charms , Defense Against the Dark Arts , Herbology , Transfiguration ... all fine . I must say , I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark , Potter , very pleased . Now , why have n’t you applied to continue with Potions ? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror ? ”
56357	56379	56248	56248	she	232	“ It was , but you told me I had to get an ‘ Outstanding ’ in my O.W.L. , Professor . ”
56380	56420	56295	56295	she	232	“ And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject . Professor Slughorn , however , is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with ‘ Exceeds Expectations ’ at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with Potions ? ”
56421	56424	56426	56426	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
56428	56442	56426	56426	Harry	136	“ but I did n’t buy the books or any ingredients or anything — ”
56443	56457	56459	56460	Professor McGonagall	232	“ I ’m sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some , ”
56462	56513	56459	56460	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Very well , Potter , here is your schedule . Oh , by the way — twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the Gryffindor Quidditch team . I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure . ”
56540	56543	56545	56545	Ron	201	“ Look , ”
56553	56575	56545	56545	Ron	201	“ we ’ve got a free period now ... and a free period after break ... and after lunch ... excellent ! ”
56617	56628	56629	56629	she	310	“ I thought you ’d get that , well done , ”
56644	56652	56629	56629	she	310	“ Tell me when you call trials ! ”
56653	56659	56661	56661	Harry	136	“ Do n’t be stupid , ”
56663	56681	56661	56661	Harry	136	“ you do n’t need to try out , I ’ve watched you play for five years ... ”
56682	56691	56692	56692	she	310	“ You must n’t start off like that , ”
56696	56734	56692	56692	she	310	“ For all you know , there ’s someone much better than me out there . Good teams have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing the old faces , or letting in their friends ... ”
56829	56838	56839	56839	she	179	“ We got so much homework for Runes , ”
56850	56870	56839	56839	she	179	“ A fifteen - inch essay , two translations , and I ’ve got to read these by Wednesday ! ”
56871	56874	56876	56876	Ron	201	“ Shame , ”
56878	56882	56883	56883	she	179	“ You wait , ”
56887	56895	56883	56883	she	179	“ I bet Snape gives us loads . ”
56932	56935	56936	56936	he	205	“ Inside , ”
57020	57032	57034	57034	Snape	205	“ I have not asked you to take out your books , ”
57070	57085	57086	57086	His	205	“ I wish to speak to you , and I want your fullest attention . ”
57111	57126	57086	57086	His	205	“ You have had five teachers in this subject so far , I believe . ”
57153	57211	57150	57150	Harry	136	“ Naturally , these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities . Given this confusion I am surprised so many of you scraped an O.W.L. in this subject . I shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work , which will be much more advanced . ”
57240	57245	57247	57247	Snape	205	“ The Dark Arts , ”
57249	57304	57247	57247	Snape	205	“ are many , varied , ever - changing , and eternal . Fighting them is like fighting a many - headed monster , which , each time a neck is severed , sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before . You are fighting that which is unfixed , mutating , indestructible . ”
57344	57348	57350	57350	Snape	205	“ Your defenses , ”
57356	57374	57376	57376	he	205	“ must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo . These pictures ”
57387	57406	57408	57408	he	205	“ give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer , for instance , the Cruciatus Curse ”
57422	57428	57408	57408	he	205	“ feel the Dementor ’s Kiss ”
57444	57452	57408	57408	he	205	“ or provoke the aggression of the Inferius ”
57461	57470	57472	57473	Parvati Patil	308	“ Has an Inferius been seen , then ? ”
57481	57491	57472	57473	Parvati Patil	308	“ Is it definite , is he using them ? ”
57492	57503	57505	57505	Snape	205	“ The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past , ”
57507	57526	57505	57505	Snape	205	“ which means you would be well - advised to assume he might use them again . Now ... ”
57559	57585	57545	57545	they	1410	“ ... you are , I believe , complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells . What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell ? ”
57615	57622	57606	57606	he	205	“ Very well — Miss Granger ? ”
57623	57640	57642	57642	Hermione	179	“ Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you ’re about to perform , ”
57644	57654	57642	57642	Hermione	179	“ which gives you a split - second advantage . ”
57655	57673	57675	57675	Snape	205	“ An answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book of Spells , Grade Six , ”
57687	57736	57738	57738	his	205	“ but correct in essentials . Yes , those who progress to using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spell - casting . Not all wizards can do this , of course ; it is a question of concentration and mind power which some ”
57747	57750	57738	57738	his	205	“ lack . ”
57782	57788	57789	57789	Snape	205	“ You will now divide , ”
57793	57823	57789	57789	Snape	205	“ into pairs . One partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking . The other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence . Carry on . ”
58024	58029	58031	58031	Snape	205	“ Pathetic , Weasley , ”
58037	58045	58031	58031	Snape	205	“ Here — let me show you — ”
58069	58072	58066	58066	he	136	“ Protego ! ”
58106	58121	58160	58160	he	205	“ Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells , Potter ? ”
58122	58125	58127	58127	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
58130	58135	58160	58160	he	205	“ Yes , sir . ”
58136	58150	58160	58160	he	205	“ There ’s no need to call me ‘ sir , ’ Professor . ”
58185	58194	58196	58196	Snape	205	“ Detention , Saturday night , my office , ”
58198	58217	58196	58196	Snape	205	“ I do not take cheek from anyone , Potter ... not even ‘ the Chosen One . ’ ”
58218	58225	58227	58227	Ron	201	“ That was brilliant , Harry ! ”
58243	58252	58254	58254	Hermione	179	“ You really should n’t have said it , ”
58260	58265	58254	58254	Hermione	179	“ What made you ? ”
58266	58280	58282	58282	Harry	136	“ He tried to jinx me , in case you did n’t notice ! ”
58284	58341	58282	58282	Harry	136	“ I had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons ! Why does n’t he use another guinea pig for a change ? What ’s Dumbledore playing at , anyway , letting him teach Defense ? Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts ? He loves them ! All that unfixed , indestructible stuff — ”
58342	58345	58347	58347	Hermione	179	“ Well , ”
58349	58359	58347	58347	Hermione	179	“ I thought he sounded a bit like you . ”
58360	58364	58347	58347	Hermione	179	“ Like me ? ”
58365	58429	58347	58347	Hermione	179	“ Yes , when you were telling us what it ’s like to face Voldemort . You said it was n’t just memorizing a bunch of spells , you said it was just you and your brains and your guts — well , was n’t that what Snape was saying ? That it really comes down to being brave and quick - thinking ? ”
58456	58463	58435	58435	she	179	“ Harry ! Hey , Harry ! ”
58493	58497	58499	58499	Sloper	315	“ For you , ”
58501	58518	58499	58499	Sloper	315	“ Listen , I heard you ’re the new Captain . When ’re you holding trials ? ”
58519	58526	58528	58528	Harry	136	“ I ’m not sure yet , ”
58545	58552	58528	58528	Harry	136	“ I ’ll let you know . ”
58553	58567	58569	58569	Harry	136	“ Oh , right . I was hoping it ’d be this weekend — ”
58609	58615	58617	58617	Ron	201	“ He enjoys Acid Pops ? ”
58633	58647	58649	58649	Harry	136	“ It ’s the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study , ”
58655	58676	58649	58649	Harry	136	“ Ha ! Snape ’s not going to be pleased ... I wo n’t be able to do his detention ! ”
58902	58905	58906	58906	Ernie	317	“ Harry , ”
58918	58966	58915	58915	Harry	136	“ did n’t get a chance to speak in Defense Against the Dark Arts this morning . Good lesson , I thought , but Shield Charms are old hat , of course , for us old D.A. lags ... And how are you , Ron — Hermione ? ”
58973	58976	58968	58968	they	1435	“ fine , ”
59176	59186	59188	59199	Slughorn , whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors	1441	“ Now then , now then , now then , ”
59201	59223	59188	59199	Slughorn , whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors	1441	“ Scales out , everyone , and potion kits , and do n’t forget your copies of Advanced Potion - Making ... ”
59224	59227	59229	59229	Harry	136	“ Sir ? ”
59235	59240	59188	59199	Slughorn , whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors	1441	“ Harry , m’boy ? ”
59241	59273	59188	59199	Slughorn , whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors	1441	“ I have n’t got a book or scales or anything — nor ’s Ron — we did n’t realize we ’d be able to do the N.E.W.T. , you see — ”
59274	59343	59188	59199	Slughorn , whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors	1441	“ Ah , yes , Professor McGonagall did mention ... not to worry , my dear boy , not to worry at all . You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today , and I ’m sure we can lend you some scales , and we ’ve got a small stock of old books here , they ’ll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts ... ”
59391	59395	59397	59397	Slughorn	199	“ Now then , ”
59424	59490	59397	59397	Slughorn	199	“ I ’ve prepared a few potions for you to have a look at , just out of interest , you know . These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s . You ought to have heard of ’em , even if you have n’t made ’em yet . Anyone tell me what this one is ? ”
59538	59557	59559	59559	Hermione	179	“ It ’s Veritaserum , a colorless , odorless potion that forces the drinker to tell the truth , ”
59561	59568	59570	59570	Slughorn	199	“ Very good , very good ! ”
59573	59576	59577	59577	he	199	“ Now , ”
59589	59611	59577	59577	he	199	“ this one here is pretty well known ... Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too ... Who can — ? ”
59620	59628	59629	59629	she	179	“ It ’s Polyjuice Potion , sir , ”
59682	59698	59700	59700	Slughorn	199	“ Excellent , excellent ! Now , this one here ... yes , my dear ? ”
59716	59721	59700	59700	Slughorn	199	“ It ’s Amortentia ! ”
59722	59734	59736	59736	Slughorn	199	“ It is indeed . It seems almost foolish to ask , ”
59744	59754	59736	59736	Slughorn	199	“ but I assume you know what it does ? ”
59755	59767	59769	59769	Hermione	179	“ It ’s the most powerful love potion in the world ! ”
59771	59792	59700	59700	Slughorn	199	“ Quite right ! You recognized it , I suppose , by its distinctive mother - of - pearl sheen ? ”
59793	59802	59804	59804	Hermione	179	“ And the steam rising in characteristic spirals , ”
59807	59838	59804	59804	Hermione	179	“ and it ’s supposed to smell differently to each of us , according to what attracts us , and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and — ”
59851	59861	59863	59863	Slughorn	199	“ May I ask your name , my dear ? ”
59870	59876	59941	59941	Slughorn	199	“ Hermione Granger , sir . ”
59877	59902	59863	59863	Slughorn	199	“ Granger ? Granger ? Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth - Granger , who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers ? ”
59903	59923	59941	59941	Slughorn	199	“ No , I do n’t think so , sir . I ’m Muggle - born , you see . ”
59966	60005	59950	59950	he	199	“ Oho ! ‘ One of my best friends is Muggle - born , and she ’s the best in our year ! ’ I ’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke , Harry ? ”
60006	60011	60013	60013	Harry	136	“ Yes , sir , ”
60015	60032	60034	60034	Slughorn	199	“ Well , well , take twenty well - earned points for Gryffindor , Miss Granger , ”
60065	60083	60054	60054	Hermione	179	“ Did you really tell him I ’m the best in the year ? Oh , Harry ! ”
60084	60094	60096	60096	Ron	201	“ Well , what ’s so impressive about that ? ”
60105	60126	60096	60096	Ron	201	“ You are the best in the year — I ’d ’ve told him so if he ’d asked me ! ”
60132	60134	60127	60127	Hermione	179	“ shhing ”
60152	60200	60201	60201	he	199	“ Amortentia does n’t really create love , of course . It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love . No , this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession . It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room — oh yes , ”
60218	60244	60246	60246	Slughorn	199	“ When you have seen as much of life as I have , you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love ... And now , ”
60248	60258	60246	60246	Slughorn	199	“ it is time for us to start work . ”
60259	60273	60275	60276	Ernie Macmillan	317	“ Sir , you have n’t told us what ’s in this one , ”
60324	60327	60329	60329	Slughorn	199	“ Oho , ”
60355	60383	60384	60384	he	199	“ Yes . That . Well , that one , ladies and gentlemen , is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis . I take it , ”
60402	60414	60392	60392	Hermione	179	“ that you know what Felix Felicis does , Miss Granger ? ”
60415	60421	60423	60423	Hermione	179	“ It ’s liquid luck , ”
60426	60432	60423	60423	Hermione	179	“ It makes you lucky ! ”
60473	60496	60498	60498	Slughorn	199	“ Quite right , take another ten points for Gryffindor . Yes , it ’s a funny little potion , Felix Felicis , ”
60500	60542	60498	60498	Slughorn	199	“ Desperately tricky to make , and disastrous to get wrong . However , if brewed correctly , as this has been , you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed ... at least until the effects wear off . ”
60543	60556	60558	60559	Terry Boot	323	“ Why do n’t people drink it all the time , sir ? ”
60562	60579	60581	60581	Slughorn	199	“ Because if taken in excess , it causes giddiness , recklessness , and dangerous overconfidence , ”
60583	60608	60581	60581	Slughorn	199	“ Too much of a good thing , you know ... highly toxic in large quantities . But taken sparingly , and very occasionally ... ”
60609	60618	60620	60621	Michael Corner	251	“ Have you ever taken it , sir ? ”
60626	60632	60634	60634	Slughorn	199	“ Twice in my life , ”
60636	60663	60634	60634	Slughorn	199	“ Once when I was twenty - four , once when I was fifty - seven . Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast . Two perfect days . ”
60686	60690	60692	60692	Slughorn	199	“ And that , ”
60700	60714	60692	60692	Slughorn	199	“ is what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson . ”
60732	60740	60742	60742	Slughorn	199	“ One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis , ”
60765	60840	60842	60842	Slughorn	199	“ Enough for twelve hours ’ luck . From dawn till dusk , you will be lucky in everything you attempt . Now , I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organized competitions ... sporting events , for instance , examinations , or elections . So the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only ... and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary ! So , ”
60847	60941	60842	60842	Slughorn	199	“ how are you to win my fabulous prize ? Well , by turning to page ten of Advanced Potion - Making . We have a little over an hour left to us , which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death . I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before , and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody . The person who does best , however , will win little Felix here . Off you go ! ”
61166	61174	61150	61150	Hermione	179	“ smooth , black currant – colored liquid ”
61257	61270	61275	61275	Slughorn	199	“ Sir , I think you knew my grandfather , Abraxas Malfoy ? ”
61283	61286	61288	61288	Slughorn	199	“ Yes , ”
61295	61319	61288	61288	Slughorn	199	“ I was sorry to hear he had died , although of course it was n’t unexpected , dragon pox at his age ... ”
61404	61412	61399	61399	Harry	136	“ Can I borrow your silver knife ? ”
61607	61614	61616	61616	Hermione	179	“ How are you doing that ? ”
61645	61651	61701	61701	his	201	“ Add a clockwise stir — ”
61652	61662	61663	61663	she	179	“ No , no , the book says counterclockwise ! ”
61749	61756	61758	61758	Slughorn	199	“ And time ’s ... up ! ”
61760	61766	61758	61758	Slughorn	199	“ Stop stirring , please ! ”
61858	61863	61864	61864	he	199	“ The clear winner ! ”
61870	61926	61864	61864	he	199	“ Excellent , excellent , Harry ! Good lord , it ’s clear you ’ve inherited your mother ’s talent . She was a dab hand at Potions , Lily was ! Here you are , then , here you are — one bottle of Felix Felicis , as promised , and use it well ! ”
61970	61977	61978	61978	he	201	“ How did you do that ? ”
61988	61995	61997	61997	Harry	136	“ Got lucky , I suppose , ”
62038	62046	62047	62047	he	136	“ I s’pose you think I cheated ? ”
62055	62069	62070	62070	she	179	“ Well , it was n’t exactly your own work , was it ? ”
62074	62083	62085	62085	Ron	201	“ He only followed different instructions to ours , ”
62087	62108	62085	62085	Ron	201	“ Could ’ve been a catastrophe , could n’t it ? But he took a risk and it paid off . ”
62114	62151	62109	62109	He	136	“ Slughorn could ’ve handed me that book , but no , I get the one no one ’s ever written on . Puked on , by the look of page fifty - two , but — ”
62152	62156	62191	62191	Ginny	218	“ Hang on , ”
62196	62217	62191	62191	Ginny	218	“ Did I hear right ? You ’ve been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book , Harry ? ”
62234	62239	62240	62240	he	136	“ It ’s nothing , ”
62248	62272	62240	62240	he	136	“ It ’s not like , you know , Riddle ’s diary . It ’s just an old textbook someone ’s scribbled on . ”
62273	62282	62245	62245	his	136	“ But you ’re doing what it says ? ”
62283	62306	62240	62240	he	136	“ I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins , honestly , Ginny , there ’s nothing funny — ”
62307	62314	62316	62316	Hermione	179	“ Ginny ’s got a point , ”
62323	62347	62316	62316	Hermione	179	“ We ought to check that there ’s nothing odd about it . I mean , all these funny instructions , who knows ? ”
62348	62351	62357	62357	she	218	“ Hey ! ”
62375	62379	62380	62380	she	218	“ Specialis Revelio ! ”
62410	62413	62415	62415	Harry	136	“ Finished ? ”
62418	62433	62415	62415	Harry	136	“ Or d’you want to wait and see if it does a few backflips ? ”
62434	62440	62442	62442	Hermione	179	“ It seems all right , ”
62451	62466	62442	62442	Hermione	179	“ I mean , it really does seem to be ... just a textbook . ”
62467	62477	62479	62479	Harry	136	“ Good . Then I ’ll have it back , ”
62690	62692	62687	62687	she	179	“ official ”
62799	62803	62805	62805	Hermione	179	“ Or herself , ”
62825	62848	62816	62816	Ron	201	“ It might have been a girl . I think the handwriting looks more like a girl ’s than a boy ’s . ”
62849	62860	62861	62861	Harry	136	“ The Half - Blood Prince , he was called , ”
62864	62872	62861	62861	Harry	136	“ How many girls have been Princes ? ”
62928	62947	62907	62907	Harry	136	“ It ’s five to eight , I ’d better go , I ’ll be late for Dumbledore . ”
62948	62951	62953	62953	Hermione	179	“ Ooooh ! ”
62960	62978	62953	62953	Hermione	179	“ Good luck ! We ’ll wait up , we want to hear what he teaches you ! ”
62979	62985	62987	62987	Ron	201	“ Hope it goes okay , ”
63046	63053	63054	63054	she	298	“ Two of spades : conflict , ”
63068	63101	63054	63054	she	298	“ Seven of spades : an ill omen . Ten of spades : violence . Knave of spades : a dark young man , possibly troubled , one who dislikes the questioner — ”
63116	63125	63126	63126	she	298	“ Well , that ca n’t be right , ”
63189	63193	63195	63195	Harry	136	“ Acid Pops , ”
63250	63254	63256	63256	Dumbledore	138	“ Come in , ”
63260	63266	63268	63268	Harry	136	“ Good evening , sir , ”
63277	63288	63290	63290	Dumbledore	138	“ Ah , good evening , Harry . Sit down , ”
63294	63308	63290	63290	Dumbledore	138	“ I hope you ’ve had an enjoyable first week back at school ? ”
63309	63316	63318	63318	Harry	136	“ Yes , thanks , sir , ”
63320	63334	63290	63290	Dumbledore	138	“ You must have been busy , a detention under your belt already ! ”
63335	63338	63340	63340	Harry	136	“ Er , ”
63351	63368	63290	63290	Dumbledore	138	“ I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead . ”
63369	63372	63374	63374	Harry	136	“ Right , ”
63484	63489	63491	63491	Dumbledore	138	“ So , Harry , ”
63498	63526	63491	63491	Dumbledore	138	“ You have been wondering , I am sure , what I have planned for you during these — for want of a better word — lessons ? ”
63527	63532	63456	63456	his	328	“ Yes , sir . ”
63533	63569	63491	63491	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , I have decided that it is time , now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago , for you to be given certain information . ”
63575	63594	63596	63596	Harry	136	“ You said , at the end of last term , you were going to tell me everything , ”
63611	63614	63615	63615	he	136	“ Sir , ”
63618	63624	63626	63626	Dumbledore	138	“ And so I did , ”
63629	63694	63626	63626	Dumbledore	138	“ I told you everything I know . From this point forth , we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork . From here on in , Harry , I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher , who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron . ”
63695	63703	63705	63705	Harry	136	“ But you think you ’re right ? ”
63707	63751	63626	63626	Dumbledore	138	“ Naturally I do , but as I have already proven to you , I make mistakes like the next man . In fact , being — forgive me — rather cleverer than most men , my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger . ”
63752	63755	63757	63757	Harry	136	“ Sir , ”
63760	63784	63757	63757	Harry	136	“ does what you ’re going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy ? Will it help me ... survive ? ”
63785	63798	63800	63800	Dumbledore	138	“ It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy , ”
63817	63830	63800	63800	Dumbledore	138	“ and I certainly hope that it will help you to survive . ”
63895	63900	63883	63883	He	138	“ You look worried . ”
63961	63981	63957	63957	Dumbledore	138	“ This time , you enter the Pensieve with me ... and , even more unusually , with permission . ”
63982	63990	63957	63957	Dumbledore	138	“ Where are we going , sir ? ”
63991	64002	64004	64004	Dumbledore	138	“ For a trip down Bob Ogden ’s memory lane , ”
64021	64027	63957	63957	Dumbledore	138	“ Who was Bob Ogden ? ”
64028	64040	64042	64042	Dumbledore	138	“ He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement , ”
64044	64094	64042	64042	Dumbledore	138	“ He died some time ago , but not before I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me . We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties . If you will stand , Harry ... ”
64117	64125	63957	63957	Dumbledore	138	“ Shall — shall I , sir ? ”
64126	64132	64135	64135	his	138	“ No matter , Harry — ”
64146	64156	64157	64157	Harry	136	“ Sir — how did you injure your hand ? ”
64174	64197	63957	63957	Dumbledore	138	“ Now is not the moment for that story , Harry . Not yet . We have an appointment with Bob Ogden . ”
64221	64225	64227	64227	Dumbledore	138	“ After you , ”
65074	65080	65062	65062	he	1533	“ You ’re not welcome . ”
65151	65165	65148	65148	he	330	“ Er — good morning . I ’m from the Ministry of Magic — ”
65166	65172	65199	65200	the stranger	1536	“ You ’re not welcome . ”
65173	65186	65188	65188	Ogden	330	“ Er — I ’m sorry — I do n’t understand you , ”
65232	65243	65245	65245	Dumbledore	138	“ You understand him , I ’m sure , Harry ? ”
65248	65254	65256	65256	Harry	136	“ Yes , of course , ”
65261	65268	65256	65256	Harry	136	“ Why ca n’t Ogden — ? ”
65286	65292	65305	65308	The man in rags	1537	“ He ’s speaking Parseltongue ? ”
65293	65297	65299	65299	Dumbledore	138	“ Very good , ”
65325	65330	65331	65331	Ogden	330	“ Now , look — ”
65365	65368	65389	65389	him	1538	“ Morfin ! ”
65474	65480	65482	65484	the older man	1542	“ Ministry , is it ? ”
65491	65494	65496	65496	Ogden	330	“ Correct ! ”
65503	65515	65496	65496	Ogden	330	“ And you , I take it , are Mr. Gaunt ? ”
65516	65519	65521	65521	Gaunt	331	“ S’right , ”
65523	65533	65521	65521	Gaunt	331	“ Got you in the face , did he ? ”
65534	65540	65542	65542	Ogden	330	“ Yes , he did ! ”
65544	65556	65558	65558	Gaunt	331	“ Should ’ve made your presence known , should n’t you ? ”
65561	65582	65558	65558	Gaunt	331	“ This is private property . Ca n’t just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself . ”
65583	65591	65593	65593	Ogden	330	“ Defend himself against what , man ? ”
65601	65610	65611	65611	Ogden	330	“ Busybodies . Intruders . Muggles and filth . ”
65653	65663	65640	65641	Mr. Gaunt	331	“ Get in the house . Do n’t argue . ”
65748	65762	65764	65764	Ogden	330	“ It ’s your son I ’m here to see , Mr. Gaunt , ”
65781	65790	65767	65767	he	330	“ That was Morfin , was n’t it ? ”
65791	65798	65800	65802	the old man	1545	“ Ar , that was Morfin , ”
65805	65812	65813	65813	he	1545	“ Are you pure - blood ? ”
65819	65827	65829	65829	Ogden	330	“ That ’s neither here nor there , ”
65867	65887	65847	65847	He	1545	“ Now I come to think about it , I ’ve seen noses like yours down in the village . ”
65888	65905	65907	65907	Ogden	330	“ I do n’t doubt it , if your son ’s been let loose on them , ”
65909	65918	65907	65907	Ogden	330	“ Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside ? ”
65919	65922	65847	65847	He	1545	“ Inside ? ”
65923	65946	65907	65907	Ogden	330	“ Yes , Mr. Gaunt . I ’ve already told you . I ’m here about Morfin . We sent an owl — ”
65947	65955	65957	65957	Gaunt	331	“ I ’ve no use for owls , ”
65959	65966	65957	65957	Gaunt	331	“ I do n’t open letters . ”
65967	65981	65983	65983	Ogden	330	“ Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors , ”
65986	66009	65983	65983	Ogden	330	“ I am here following a serious breach of Wizarding law , which occurred here in the early hours of this morning — ”
66010	66020	66022	66022	Gaunt	331	“ All right , all right , all right ! ”
66024	66041	66022	66022	Gaunt	331	“ Come in the bleeding house , then , and much good it ’ll do you ! ”
66250	66255	66257	66257	Gaunt	331	“ M’daughter , Merope , ”
66267	66271	66273	66273	Ogden	330	“ Good morning , ”
66305	66311	66313	66313	Ogden	330	“ Well , Mr. Gaunt , ”
66315	66345	66313	66313	Ogden	330	“ to get straight to the point , we have reason to believe that your son , Morfin , performed magic in front of a Muggle late last night . ”
66360	66365	66366	66366	Gaunt	331	“ Pick it up ! ”
66371	66397	66366	66366	Gaunt	331	“ That ’s it , grub on the floor like some filthy Muggle , what ’s your wand for , you useless sack of muck ? ”
66398	66404	66406	66406	Ogden	330	“ Mr. Gaunt , please ! ”
66491	66502	66488	66488	Gaunt	331	“ Mend it , you pointless lump , mend it ! ”
66528	66531	66519	66519	Ogden	330	“ Reparo . ”
66569	66601	66563	66563	he	331	“ Lucky the nice man from the Ministry ’s here , is n’t it ? Perhaps he ’ll take you off my hands , perhaps he does n’t mind dirty Squibs ... ”
66661	66665	66666	66666	Ogden	330	“ Mr. Gaunt , ”
66670	66682	66666	66666	Ogden	330	“ as I ’ve said : the reason for my visit — ”
66683	66691	66693	66693	Gaunt	331	“ I heard you the first time ! ”
66695	66719	66693	66693	Gaunt	331	“ And so what ? Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him — what about it , then ? ”
66720	66727	66729	66729	Ogden	330	“ Morfin has broken Wizarding law , ”
66732	66741	66742	66742	Gaunt	331	“ ‘ Morfin has broken Wizarding law . ’ ”
66758	66775	66754	66754	Morfin	191	“ He taught a filthy Muggle a lesson , that ’s illegal now , is it ? ”
66776	66779	66781	66781	Ogden	330	“ Yes , ”
66783	66790	66781	66781	Ogden	330	“ I ’m afraid it is . ”
66806	66816	66818	66818	Gaunt	331	“ What ’s that , then , his sentence ? ”
66825	66837	66820	66820	his	331	“ It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing — ”
66838	66855	66791	66791	He	331	“ Summons ! Summons ? Who do you think you are , summoning my son anywhere ? ”
66856	66867	66869	66869	Ogden	330	“ I ’m Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad , ”
66871	66882	66884	66884	Gaunt	331	“ And you think we ’re scum , do you ? ”
66903	66933	66884	66884	Gaunt	331	“ Scum who ’ll come running when the Ministry tells ’em to ? Do you know who you ’re talking to , you filthy little Mudblood , do you ? ”
66934	66948	66950	66950	Ogden	330	“ I was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr. Gaunt , ”
66960	66965	66967	66967	Gaunt	331	“ That ’s right ! ”
67013	67076	66987	66987	he	331	“ See this ? See this ? Know what it is ? Know where it came from ? Centuries it ’s been in our family , that ’s how far back we go , and pure - blood all the way ! Know how much I ’ve been offered for this , with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone ? ”
67077	67084	67086	67086	Ogden	330	“ I ’ve really no idea , ”
67100	67117	67086	67086	Ogden	330	“ and it ’s quite beside the point , Mr. Gaunt . Your son has committed — ”
67168	67172	67173	67173	he	136	“ See this ? ”
67194	67203	67205	67205	Ogden	330	“ I see it , I see it ! ”
67208	67212	67214	67214	Gaunt	331	“ Slytherin ’s ! ”
67216	67237	67214	67214	Gaunt	331	“ Salazar Slytherin ’s ! We ’re his last living descendants , what do you say to that , eh ? ”
67238	67245	67247	67247	Ogden	330	“ Mr. Gaunt , your daughter ! ”
67277	67280	67282	67282	Gaunt	331	“ So ! ”
67299	67334	67287	67287	he	331	“ Do n’t you go talking to us as if we ’re dirt on your shoes ! Generations of purebloods , wizards all — more than you can say , I do n’t doubt ! ”
67372	67376	67378	67378	Ogden	330	“ Mr. Gaunt , ”
67381	67420	67422	67422	he	330	“ I am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand . I am here because of Morfin , Morfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night . Our information ”
67431	67454	67422	67422	he	330	“ is that Morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said Muggle , causing him to erupt in highly painful hives . ”
67458	67464	67466	67466	Gaunt	331	“ Be quiet , boy , ”
67476	67486	67487	67487	Gaunt	331	“ And so what if he did , then ? ”
67493	67514	67487	67487	Gaunt	331	“ I expect you ’ve wiped the Muggle ’s filthy face clean for him , and his memory to boot — ”
67515	67528	67530	67530	Ogden	330	“ That ’s hardly the point , is it , Mr. Gaunt ? ”
67532	67542	67530	67530	Ogden	330	“ This was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless — ”
67543	67562	67564	67564	Gaunt	331	“ Ar , I had you marked out as a Muggle - lover the moment I saw you , ”
67574	67582	67584	67584	Ogden	330	“ This discussion is getting us nowhere , ”
67587	67605	67606	67606	He	330	“ It is clear from your son ’s attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions . ”
67616	67649	67606	67606	He	330	“ Morfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and causing harm and distress to that same Mugg — ”
67730	67738	67741	67742	a girl	982	“ My God , what an eyesore ! ”
67764	67777	67755	67755	she	982	“ Could n’t your father have that hovel cleared away , Tom ? ”
67778	67784	67786	67788	a young man	1571	“ It ’s not ours , ”
67792	67839	67786	67788	a young man	1571	“ Everything on the other side of the valley belongs to us , but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called Gaunt , and his children . The son ’s quite mad , you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village — ”
67864	67869	67871	67872	his father	3709	“ Keep your seat , ”
67878	67881	67883	67884	the girl	4164	“ Tom , ”
67900	67916	67883	67884	the girl	4164	“ I might be wrong — but has somebody nailed a snake to that door ? ”
67917	67925	67927	67928	the man	764	“ Good lord , you ’re right ! ”
67932	67960	67927	67928	the man	764	“ That ’ll be the son , I told you he ’s not right in the head . Do n’t look at it , Cecilia , darling . ”
67972	67977	67979	67979	Morfin	191	“ ‘ Darling , ’ ”
67988	68005	67979	67979	Morfin	191	“ ‘ Darling , ’ he called her . So he would n’t have you anyway . ”
68019	68024	68026	68026	Gaunt	331	“ What ’s that ? ”
68041	68049	68026	68026	Gaunt	331	“ What did you say , Morfin ? ”
68050	68058	68060	68060	Morfin	191	“ She likes looking at that Muggle , ”
68080	68104	68069	68069	he	191	“ Always in the garden when he passes , peering through the hedge at him , is n’t she ? And last night — ”
68119	68136	68114	68114	Morfin	191	“ Hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home , was n’t she ? ”
68137	68149	68151	68151	Gaunt	331	“ Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle ? ”
68182	68187	68189	68189	Gaunt	331	“ Is it true ? ”
68205	68227	68189	68189	Gaunt	331	“ My daughter — pure - blooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin — hankering after a filthy , dirt - veined Muggle ? ”
68245	68253	68255	68255	Morfin	191	“ But I got him , Father ! ”
68257	68283	68255	68255	Morfin	191	“ I got him as he went by and he did n’t look so pretty with hives all over him , did he , Merope ? ”
68284	68296	68298	68298	Gaunt	331	“ You disgusting little Squib , you filthy little blood traitor ! ”
68318	68321	68316	68316	Ogden	330	“ No ! ”
68334	68337	68327	68327	Ogden	330	“ Relashio ! ”
68507	68516	68518	68518	Dumbledore	138	“ I think that will do , Harry , ”
68556	68566	68568	68568	Harry	136	“ What happened to the girl in the cottage ? ”
68584	68593	68581	68581	his	138	“ Merope , or whatever her name was ? ”
68594	68600	68602	68602	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh , she survived , ”
68618	68694	68602	68602	Dumbledore	138	“ Ogden Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes . Morfin and his father attempted to fight , but both were overpowered , removed from the cottage , and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot . Morfin , who already had a record of Muggle attacks , was sentenced to three years in Azkaban . Marvolo , who had injured several Ministry employees in addition to Ogden , received six months . ”
68695	68698	68699	68699	Harry	136	“ Marvolo ? ”
68703	68708	68710	68710	Dumbledore	138	“ That ’s right , ”
68716	68727	68710	68710	Dumbledore	138	“ I am glad to see you ’re keeping up . ”
68728	68735	68602	68602	Dumbledore	138	“ That old man was — ? ”
68736	68743	68745	68745	Dumbledore	138	“ Voldemort ’s grandfather , yes , ”
68747	68870	68745	68745	Dumbledore	138	“ Marvolo , his son , Morfin , and his daughter , Merope , were the last of the Gaunts , a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins . Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born . He , as you saw , was left in squalor and poverty , with a very nasty temper , a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride , and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son , and rather more than his daughter . ”
68871	68875	68877	68877	Harry	136	“ So Merope , ”
68889	68906	68877	68877	Harry	136	“ so Merope was ... Sir , does that mean she was ... Voldemort ’s mother ? ”
68907	68911	68913	68913	Dumbledore	138	“ It does , ”
68915	68937	68913	68913	Dumbledore	138	“ And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort ’s father . I wonder whether you noticed ? ”
68938	68950	68877	68877	Harry	136	“ The Muggle Morfin attacked ? The man on the horse ? ”
68951	68956	68958	68958	Dumbledore	138	“ Very good indeed , ”
68962	68995	68958	68958	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , that was Tom Riddle senior , the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret , burning passion . ”
68996	69003	69004	69004	Harry	136	“ And they ended up married ? ”
69021	69028	69030	69030	Dumbledore	138	“ I think you are forgetting , ”
69032	69144	69030	69030	Dumbledore	138	“ that Merope was a witch . I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father . Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban , once she was alone and free for the first time in her life , then , I am sure , she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years . Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion , and fall in love with her instead ? ”
69145	69150	69151	69151	Harry	136	“ The Imperius Curse ? ”
69154	69160	69151	69151	Harry	136	“ Or a love potion ? ”
69161	69391	69030	69030	Dumbledore	138	“ Very good . Personally , I am inclined to think that she used a love potion . I am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her , and I do not think it would have been very difficult , some hot day , when Riddle was riding alone , to persuade him to take a drink of water . In any case , within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed , the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal . You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire ’s son ran off with the tramp ’s daughter , Merope . But the villagers ’ shock was nothing to Marvolo ’s . He returned from Azkaban , expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table . Instead , he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell , explaining what she had done . From all that I have been able to discover , he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth . The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death — or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself . Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo , and he did not live to see Morfin return to the cottage . ”
69392	69414	69151	69151	Harry	136	“ And Merope ? She ... she died , did n’t she ? Was n’t Voldemort brought up in an orphanage ? ”
69415	69420	69422	69422	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , indeed , ”
69424	69432	69151	69151	Harry	136	“ But she did have his baby . ”
69433	69454	69151	69151	Harry	136	“ But not until a year after they were married . Tom Riddle left her while she was still pregnant . ”
69455	69460	69462	69462	Harry	136	“ What went wrong ? ”
69464	69473	69462	69462	Harry	136	“ Why did the love potion stop working ? ”
69474	69481	69483	69483	Dumbledore	138	“ Again , this is guesswork , ”
69485	69593	69483	69483	Dumbledore	138	“ but I believe that Merope , who was deeply in love with her husband , could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means . I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion . Perhaps , besotted as she was , she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return . Perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby ’s sake . If so , she was wrong on both counts . He left her , never saw her again , and never troubled to discover what became of his son . ”
69615	69626	69628	69628	Dumbledore	138	“ I think that will do for tonight , Harry , ”
69635	69640	69642	69642	Harry	136	“ Yes , sir , ”
69655	69670	69644	69644	He	136	“ Sir ... is it important to know all this about Voldemort ’s past ? ”
69671	69678	69680	69680	Dumbledore	138	“ Very important , I think , ”
69682	69696	69644	69644	He	136	“ And it ... it ’s got something to do with the prophecy ? ”
69697	69707	69644	69644	He	136	“ It has everything to do with the prophecy . ”
69708	69711	69713	69713	Harry	136	“ Right , ”
69743	69760	69738	69738	he	136	“ Sir , am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything you ’ve told me ? ”
69771	69833	69761	69761	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trustworthy . But Harry , I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else . It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I know , or suspect , about Lord Voldemort ’s secrets . ”
69834	69853	69761	69761	Dumbledore	138	“ No , sir , I ’ll make sure it ’s just Ron and Hermione . Good night . ”
69905	69908	69910	69910	Harry	136	“ Sir , ”
69916	69920	69910	69910	Harry	136	“ That ring — ”
69921	69924	69926	69926	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes ? ”
69928	69941	69910	69910	Harry	136	“ You were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that night . ”
69942	69947	69948	69948	Dumbledore	138	“ So I was , ”
69951	69970	69910	69910	Harry	136	“ But is n’t it ... sir , is n’t it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed Ogden ? ”
69976	69981	69971	69971	Dumbledore	138	“ The very same . ”
69982	69994	69910	69910	Harry	136	“ But how come — ? Have you always had it ? ”
69995	70004	70006	70006	Dumbledore	138	“ No , I acquired it very recently , ”
70008	70028	70006	70006	Dumbledore	138	“ A few days before I came to fetch you from your aunt and uncle ’s , in fact . ”
70029	70045	69910	69910	Harry	136	“ That would be around the time you injured your hand , then , sir ? ”
70046	70055	70006	70006	Dumbledore	138	“ Around that time , yes , Harry . ”
70063	70070	70059	70059	Dumbledore	138	“ Sir , how exactly — ? ”
70071	70088	69910	69910	Harry	136	“ Too late , Harry ! You shall hear the story another time . Good night . ”
70089	70095	70059	70059	Dumbledore	138	“ Good night , sir . ”
70416	70425	70427	70427	Hermione	179	“ We ’ve got to go and explain , ”
70447	70456	70458	70458	Ron	201	“ We ’ve got Quidditch tryouts this morning ! ”
70460	70492	70458	70458	Ron	201	“ And we ’re supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti Charm from Flitwick ! Anyway , explain what ? How are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject ? ”
70493	70500	70502	70502	Hermione	179	“ We did n’t hate it ! ”
70504	70516	70518	70518	Ron	201	“ Speak for yourself , I have n’t forgotten the skrewts , ”
70521	70564	70518	70518	Ron	201	“ And I ’m telling you now , we ’ve had a narrow escape . You did n’t hear him going on about his gormless brother — we ’d have been teaching Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if we ’d stayed . ”
70565	70573	70575	70575	Hermione	179	“ I hate not talking to Hagrid , ”
70580	70588	70589	70589	Harry	136	“ We ’ll go down after Quidditch , ”
70615	70631	70632	70632	He	136	“ But trials might take all morning , the number of people who have applied . ”
70645	70659	70632	70632	He	136	“ I dunno why the team ’s this popular all of a sudden . ”
70660	70668	70670	70670	Hermione	179	“ Oh , come on , Harry , ”
70675	70705	70670	70670	Hermione	179	“ It ’s not Quidditch that ’s popular , it ’s you ! You ’ve never been more interesting , and frankly , you ’ve never been more fanciable . ”
70728	70805	70715	70715	Hermione	179	“ Everyone knows you ’ve been telling the truth now , do n’t they ? The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about Voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times . And now they ’re calling you ‘ the Chosen One ’ — well , come on , ca n’t you see why people are fascinated by you ? ”
70829	70887	70934	70934	Hermione	179	“ And you ’ve been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar . You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood , but you stuck to your story anyway ... ”
70888	70906	70908	70908	Ron	201	“ You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry , look , ”
70915	70933	70934	70934	Hermione	179	“ And it does n’t hurt that you ’ve grown about a foot over the summer either , ”
70940	70945	70947	70947	Ron	201	“ I ’m tall , ”
71098	71101	71103	71103	Harry	136	“ Ha ! ”
71125	71129	71131	71131	Hermione	179	“ Oh good , ”
71135	71145	71131	71131	Hermione	179	“ Now you can give that graffitied copy back . ”
71146	71151	71153	71153	Harry	136	“ Are you mad ? ”
71155	71169	71153	71153	Harry	136	“ I ’m keeping it ! Look , I ’ve thought it out — ”
71194	71197	71189	71189	his	136	“ Diffindo ! ”
71232	71235	71220	71220	He	136	“ Reparo ! ”
71264	71284	71220	71220	He	136	“ I ’ll give Slughorn back the new one , he ca n’t complain , it cost nine Galleons . ”
71328	71334	71336	71336	Ron	201	“ Anyone we know dead ? ”
71355	71366	71368	71368	Hermione	179	“ No , but there have been more dementor attacks , ”
71370	71375	71368	71368	Hermione	179	“ And an arrest . ”
71376	71381	71383	71383	Harry	136	“ Excellent , who ? ”
71390	71394	71396	71396	Hermione	179	“ Stan Shunpike , ”
71398	71401	71403	71403	Harry	136	“ What ? ”
71407	71453	71396	71396	Hermione	179	“ ‘ Stanley Shunpike , conductor on the popular Wizarding conveyance the Knight Bus , has been arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity . Mr. Shunpike , 21 , was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his Clapham home ... ’ ”
71454	71462	71464	71464	Harry	136	“ Stan Shunpike , a Death Eater ? ”
71478	71482	71467	71476	the spotty youth he had first met three years before	1614	“ No way ! ”
71483	71494	71496	71496	Ron	201	“ He might have been put under the Imperius Curse , ”
71499	71505	71496	71496	Ron	201	“ You never can tell . ”
71506	71514	71516	71516	Hermione	179	“ It does n’t look like it , ”
71523	71546	71547	71547	She	179	“ It says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters ’ secret plans in a pub . ”
71558	71580	71547	71547	She	179	“ If he was under the Imperius Curse , he ’d hardly stand around gossiping about their plans , would he ? ”
71581	71598	71600	71600	Ron	201	“ It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did , ”
71602	71628	71600	71600	Ron	201	“ Is n’t he the one who claimed he was going to become Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela ? ”
71629	71636	71638	71638	Harry	136	“ Yeah , that ’s him , ”
71640	71653	71638	71638	Harry	136	“ I dunno what they ’re playing at , taking Stan seriously . ”
71654	71667	71669	71669	Hermione	179	“ They probably want to look as though they ’re doing something , ”
71673	71707	71669	71669	Hermione	179	“ People are terrified — you know the Patil twins ’ parents want them to go home ? And Eloise Midgen has already been withdrawn . Her father picked her up last night . ”
71708	71711	71713	71713	Ron	201	“ What ! ”
71719	71750	71713	71713	Ron	201	“ But Hogwarts is safer than their homes , bound to be ! We ’ve got Aurors , and all those extra protective spells , and we ’ve got Dumbledore ! ”
71751	71764	71766	71766	Hermione	179	“ I do n’t think we ’ve got him all the time , ”
71782	71802	71766	71766	Hermione	179	“ Have n’t you noticed ? His seat ’s been empty as often as Hagrid ’s this past week . ”
71842	71857	71859	71859	Hermione	179	“ I think he ’s left the school to do something with the Order , ”
71865	71879	71859	71859	Hermione	179	“ I mean ... it ’s all looking serious , is n’t it ? ”
72173	72186	72187	72187	he	136	“ We met on the train , in old Sluggy ’s compartment , ”
72202	72208	72187	72187	he	136	“ Cormac McLaggen , Keeper . ”
72209	72221	72223	72223	Harry	136	“ You did n’t try out last year , did you ? ”
72247	72260	72262	72262	McLaggen	272	“ I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials , ”
72270	72281	72262	72262	McLaggen	272	“ Ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet . ”
72282	72285	72287	72287	Harry	136	“ Right , ”
72289	72298	72287	72287	Harry	136	“ Well ... if you wait over there ... ”
72340	72344	72332	72332	McLaggen	272	“ old Sluggy ’s ”
72525	72538	72540	72540	Harry	136	“ If there ’s anyone else here who ’s not from Gryffindor , ”
72550	72556	72540	72540	Harry	136	“ leave now , please ! ”
72682	72706	72707	72707	he	136	“ That ’s my final decision and if you do n’t get out of the way for the Keepers I ’ll hex you , ”
72995	72999	73019	73020	Lavender Brown	306	“ Good luck ! ”
73138	73146	73148	73148	McLaggen	272	“ His sister did n’t really try , ”
73171	73179	73162	73162	Harry	136	“ She gave him an easy save . ”
73180	73183	73185	73185	Harry	136	“ Rubbish , ”
73188	73197	73185	73185	Harry	136	“ That was the one he nearly missed . ”
73212	73218	73198	73198	McLaggen	272	“ Give me another go . ”
73219	73222	73224	73224	Harry	136	“ No , ”
73226	73258	73224	73224	Harry	136	“ You ’ve had your go . You saved four . Ron saved five . Ron ’s Keeper , he won it fair and square . Get out of my way . ”
73303	73307	73308	73308	he	136	“ Well done , ”
73311	73317	73308	73308	he	136	“ You flew really well — ”
73318	73325	73331	73331	Hermione	179	“ You did brilliantly , Ron ! ”
73455	73467	73468	73468	Ron	201	“ I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty , ”
73473	73491	73468	73468	Ron	201	“ Tricky shot from Demelza , did you see , had a bit of spin on it — ”
73492	73501	73503	73503	Hermione	179	“ Yes , yes , you were magnificent , ”
73508	73517	73519	73519	Ron	201	“ I was better than that McLaggen anyway , ”
73526	73548	73519	73519	Ron	201	“ Did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth ? Looked like he ’d been Confunded ... ”
73618	73622	73624	73624	Hermione	179	“ Oh dear , ”
73627	73639	73624	73624	Hermione	179	“ He ’s still a bit scary , is n’t he ? ”
73640	73654	73656	73656	Ron	201	“ Come off it , you ’ve ridden him , have n’t you ? ”
73686	73691	73692	73692	Harry	136	“ How are you ? ”
73708	73724	73692	73692	Harry	136	“ Missing him ? But you ’re okay here with Hagrid , are n’t you ? ”
73725	73728	73767	73767	Fang	355	“ Oi ! ”
73776	73795	73767	73767	Fang	355	“ Git away from him ! He ’ll have yer fingers — oh . It ’s yeh lot . ”
73837	73841	73843	73843	Hermione	179	“ Oh dear ! ”
73848	73855	73857	73857	Harry	136	“ Do n’t worry about it , ”
73870	73883	73860	73860	He	136	“ Hagrid ! Open up , we want to talk to you ! ”
73891	73906	73907	73907	Harry	136	“ If you do n’t open the door , we ’ll blast it open ! ”
73915	73918	73920	73920	Hermione	179	“ Harry ! ”
73925	73931	73920	73920	Hermione	179	“ You ca n’t possibly — ”
73932	73938	73940	73940	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I can ! ”
73942	73946	73940	73940	Harry	136	“ Stand back — ”
73987	73993	73994	73994	he	176	“ I ’m a teacher ! ”
73999	74015	73994	73994	he	176	“ A teacher , Potter ! How dare yeh threaten ter break down my door ! ”
74016	74023	74025	74025	Harry	136	“ I ’m sorry , sir , ”
74044	74055	74040	74040	Hagrid	176	“ Since when have yeh called me ‘ sir ’ ? ”
74056	74067	73994	73994	he	176	“ Since when have you called me ‘ Potter ’ ? ”
74068	74074	74076	74076	Hagrid	176	“ Oh , very clever , ”
74078	74102	74076	74076	Hagrid	176	“ Very amusin ’ . That ’s me outsmarted , innit ? All righ ’ , come in then , yeh ungrateful little ... ”
74124	74127	74129	74129	Hagrid	176	“ Well ? ”
74163	74181	74147	74147	Fang	355	“ What ’s this ? Feelin ’ sorry for me ? Reckon I ’m lonely or summat ? ”
74182	74185	74187	74187	Harry	136	“ No , ”
74191	74198	74187	74187	Harry	136	“ We wanted to see you . ”
74199	74205	74207	74207	Hermione	179	“ We ’ve missed you ! ”
74210	74217	74219	74219	Hagrid	176	“ Missed me , have yeh ? ”
74221	74227	74219	74219	Hagrid	176	“ Yeah . Righ ’ . ”
74288	74291	74297	74297	he	1681	“ Hagrid , ”
74324	74340	74297	74297	he	1681	“ we really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures , you know . ”
74369	74373	74375	74375	Hermione	179	“ We did ! ”
74377	74389	74375	74375	Hermione	179	“ But none of us could fit it into our schedules ! ”
74390	74396	74398	74398	Hagrid	176	“ Yeah . Righ ’ , ”
74467	74474	74476	74476	Harry	136	“ What are they , Hagrid ? ”
74496	74502	74504	74504	Hagrid	176	“ Jus ’ giant grubs , ”
74506	74513	74515	74515	Ron	201	“ And they grow into ... ? ”
74520	74528	74530	74530	Hagrid	176	“ They won ’ grow inter nuthin’ , ”
74532	74541	74530	74530	Hagrid	176	“ I got ’em ter feed ter Aragog . ”
74551	74554	74556	74556	Hermione	179	“ Hagrid ! ”
74584	74589	74556	74556	Hermione	179	“ What is it ? ”
74590	74596	74598	74598	Hagrid	176	“ It ’s ... him ... ”
74615	74664	74607	74607	he	176	“ It ’s ... Aragog ... I think he ’s dyin ’ ... He got ill over the summer an ’ he ’s not gettin ’ better ... I don ’ know what I ’ll do if he ... if he ... We ’ve bin tergether so long ... ”
74766	74777	74778	74778	Hermione	179	“ Is there — is there anything we can do ? ”
74791	74801	74803	74803	Hagrid	176	“ I don ’ think there is , Hermione , ”
74814	74843	74803	74803	Hagrid	176	“ See , the rest o ’ the tribe ... Aragog ’s family ... they ’re gettin ’ a bit funny now he ’s ill ... bit restive ... ”
74844	74859	74861	74861	Ron	201	“ Yeah , I think we saw a bit of that side of them , ”
74866	74890	74891	74891	Hagrid	176	“ ... I don ’ reckon it ’d be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo ’ , ”
74905	74919	74895	74895	his	176	“ But thanks fer offerin ’ , Hermione ... It means a lot ... ”
74974	74991	74992	74992	he	176	“ Ar , I always knew yeh’d find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables , ”
75001	75011	74992	74992	he	176	“ Even if yeh applied fer Time - Turners — ”
75012	75019	75021	75021	Hermione	179	“ We could n’t have done , ”
75023	75048	75021	75021	Hermione	179	“ We smashed the entire stock of Ministry Time - Turners when we were there last summer . It was in the Daily Prophet . ”
75049	75055	75057	75057	Hagrid	176	“ Ar , well then , ”
75059	75108	75057	75057	Hagrid	176	“ There ’s no way yeh could ’ve done it ... I ’m sorry I ’ve bin — yeh know — I ’ve jus ’ bin worried abou ’ Aragog ... an ’ I did wonder whether , if Professor Grubbly - Plank had bin teachin ’ yeh — ”
75160	75165	75167	75167	Harry	136	“ I ’m starving , ”
75205	75225	75187	75187	he	136	“ And I ’ve got that detention with Snape tonight , I have n’t got much time for dinner ... ”
75286	75289	75291	75291	Hermione	179	“ What ? ”
75294	75300	75302	75302	Harry	136	“ If you ask me , ”
75305	75328	75302	75302	Harry	136	“ McLaggen looks like he was Confunded this morning . And he was standing right in front of where you were sitting . ”
75332	75343	75344	75344	she	179	“ Oh , all right then , I did it , ”
75347	75396	75344	75344	she	179	“ But you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny ! Anyway , he ’s got a nasty temper , you saw how he reacted when he did n’t get in — you would n’t have wanted someone like that on the team . ”
75397	75400	75402	75402	Harry	136	“ No , ”
75404	75433	75402	75402	Harry	136	“ No , I suppose that ’s true . But was n’t that dishonest , Hermione ? I mean , you ’re a prefect , are n’t you ? ”
75434	75440	75441	75441	she	179	“ Oh , be quiet , ”
75448	75455	75457	75457	Ron	201	“ What are you two doing ? ”
75471	75474	75476	75476	Harry	136	“ Nothing , ”
75524	75538	75539	75539	he	199	“ Harry , Harry , just the man I was hoping to see ! ”
75557	75645	75539	75539	he	199	“ I was hoping to catch you before dinner ! What do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead ? We ’re having a little party , just a few rising stars , I ’ve got McLaggen coming and Zabini , the charming Melinda Bobbin — I do n’t know whether you know her ? Her family owns a large chain of apothecaries — and , of course , I hope very much that Miss Granger will favor me by coming too . ”
75676	75684	75686	75686	Harry	136	“ I ca n’t come , Professor , ”
75690	75700	75686	75686	Harry	136	“ I ’ve got a detention with Professor Snape . ”
75701	75705	75707	75707	Slughorn	199	“ Oh dear ! ”
75714	75770	75709	75709	his	199	“ Dear , dear , I was counting on you , Harry ! Well , now , I ’ll just have to have a word with Severus and explain the situation . I ’m sure I ’ll be able to persuade him to postpone your detention . Yes , I ’ll see you both later ! ”
75779	75789	75791	75791	Harry	136	“ He ’s got no chance of persuading Snape , ”
75801	75826	75791	75791	Harry	136	“ This detention ’s already been postponed once ; Snape did it for Dumbledore , but he wo n’t do it for anyone else . ”
75827	75846	75854	75854	she	179	“ Oh , I wish you could come , I do n’t want to go on my own ! ”
75860	75873	75875	75875	Ron	201	“ I doubt you ’ll be alone , Ginny’ll probably be invited , ”
75975	75979	75981	75981	Harry	136	“ Anything new ? ”
75983	75987	75988	75988	Hermione	179	“ Not really ... ”
76000	76018	76019	76019	she	179	“ Oh , look , your dad ’s in here , Ron — he ’s all right ! ”
76031	76096	76024	76024	Ron	201	“ It just says he ’s been to visit the Malfoys ’ house . ‘ This second search of the Death Eater ’s residence does not seem to have yielded any results . Arthur Weasley of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that his team had been acting upon a confidential tip - off . ’ ”
76097	76102	76104	76104	Harry	136	“ Yeah , mine ! ”
76106	76150	76104	76104	Harry	136	“ I told him at King ’s Cross about Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix ! Well , if it ’s not at their house , he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him — ”
76151	76161	76163	76163	Hermione	179	“ But how can he have done , Harry ? ”
76174	76187	76163	76163	Hermione	179	“ We were all searched when we arrived , were n’t we ? ”
76188	76192	76194	76194	Harry	136	“ Were you ? ”
76199	76204	76194	76194	Harry	136	“ I was n’t ! ”
76205	76273	76163	76163	Hermione	179	“ Oh no , of course you were n’t , I forgot you were late ... Well , Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors when we got into the entrance hall . Any Dark object would have been found , I know for a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated . So you see , Malfoy ca n’t have brought in anything dangerous ! ”
76298	76310	76311	76311	he	136	“ Someone ’s sent it to him by owl , then , ”
76314	76320	76311	76311	he	136	“ His mother or someone . ”
76321	76330	76332	76332	Hermione	179	“ All the owls are being checked too , ”
76334	76351	76332	76332	Hermione	179	“ Filch told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he could reach . ”
76405	76415	76395	76395	his	201	“ Can you think of any way Malfoy — ? ”
76416	76424	76426	76426	Ron	201	“ Oh , drop it , Harry , ”
76428	76456	76458	76458	Harry	136	“ Listen , it ’s not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione and me to his stupid party , neither of us wanted to go , you know ! ”
76463	76475	76477	76477	Ron	201	“ Well , as I ’m not invited to any parties , ”
76485	76494	76477	76477	Ron	201	“ I think I ’ll go to bed . ”
76515	76518	76520	76522	the new Chaser	1703	“ Harry ? ”
76533	76542	76524	76525	Demelza Robins	350	“ I ’ve got a message for you . ”
76543	76548	76550	76550	Harry	136	“ From Professor Slughorn ? ”
76556	76563	76565	76565	Demelza	350	“ No ... from Professor Snape , ”
76572	76639	76565	76565	Demelza	350	“ He says you ’re to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detention — er — no matter how many party invitations you ’ve received . And he wanted you to know you ’ll be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones , to use in Potions and — and he says there ’s no need to bring protective gloves . ”
76640	76643	76645	76645	Harry	136	“ Right , ”
76648	76655	76645	76645	Harry	136	“ Thanks a lot , Demelza . ”
77214	77217	77218	77218	Harry	136	“ nonverbal . ”
77295	77298	77281	77281	he	136	“ Aaaaaaaargh ! ”
77355	77358	77360	77360	Harry	136	“ Sorry ! ”
77385	77395	77371	77371	Neville	162	“ Hang on — I ’ll let you down — ”
77466	77469	77471	77471	Harry	136	“ Sorry , ”
77484	77487	77489	77489	Ron	201	“ Tomorrow , ”
77495	77505	77489	77489	Ron	201	“ I ’d rather you set the alarm clock . ”
77578	77596	77597	77597	Ron	201	“ ... and then there was another flash of light and I landed on the bed again ! ”
77626	77644	77645	77645	she	179	“ Was this spell , by any chance , another one from that potion book of yours ? ”
77653	77665	77648	77648	Harry	136	“ Always jump to the worst conclusion , do n’t you ? ”
77666	77670	77605	77605	Hermione	179	“ Was it ? ”
77671	77683	77648	77648	Harry	136	“ Well ... yeah , it was , but so what ? ”
77684	77703	77605	77605	Hermione	179	“ So you just decided to try out an unknown , handwritten incantation and see what would happen ? ”
77704	77714	77716	77716	Harry	136	“ Why does it matter if it ’s handwritten ? ”
77728	77740	77742	77742	Hermione	179	“ Because it ’s probably not Ministry of Magic – approved , ”
77744	77748	77749	77749	she	179	“ And also , ”
77760	77775	77749	77749	she	179	“ because I ’m starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy . ”
77786	77792	77794	77794	Ron	201	“ It was a laugh ! ”
77804	77815	77794	77794	Ron	201	“ Just a laugh , Hermione , that ’s all ! ”
77816	77825	77827	77827	Hermione	179	“ Dangling people upside down by the ankle ? ”
77829	77843	77827	77827	Hermione	179	“ Who puts their time and energy into making up spells like that ? ”
77844	77849	77851	77851	Ron	201	“ Fred and George , ”
77855	77867	77851	77851	Ron	201	“ it ’s their kind of thing . And , er — ”
77868	77872	77874	77874	Harry	136	“ My dad , ”
77882	77885	77887	77887	Ron	201	“ What ? ”
77892	77899	77901	77901	Harry	136	“ My dad used this spell , ”
77903	77910	77901	77901	Harry	136	“ I — Lupin told me . ”
77969	77979	77981	77981	Hermione	179	“ Maybe your dad did use it , Harry , ”
77983	78024	77981	77981	Hermione	179	“ but he ’s not the only one . We ’ve seen a whole bunch of people use it , in case you ’ve forgotten . Dangling people in the air . Making them float along , asleep , helpless . ”
78056	78061	78062	78062	he	201	“ That was different , ”
78066	78091	78092	78092	he	201	“ They were abusing it . Harry and his dad were just having a laugh . You do n’t like the Prince , Hermione , ”
78102	78112	78092	78092	he	201	“ because he ’s better than you at Potions — ”
78113	78123	78125	78125	Hermione	179	“ It ’s got nothing to do with that ! ”
78131	78194	78125	78125	Hermione	179	“ I just think it ’s very irresponsible to start performing spells when you do n’t even know what they ’re for , and stop talking about ‘ the Prince ’ as if it ’s his title , I bet it ’s just a stupid nickname , and it does n’t seem as though he was a very nice person to me ! ”
78195	78206	78208	78208	Harry	136	“ I do n’t see where you get that from , ”
78211	78237	78208	78208	Harry	136	“ If he ’d been a budding Death Eater he would n’t have been boasting about being ‘ half - blood , ’ would he ? ”
78272	78294	78296	78296	Hermione	179	“ The Death Eaters ca n’t all be pure - blood , there are n’t enough pure - blood wizards left , ”
78299	78336	78296	78296	Hermione	179	“ I expect most of them are half - bloods pretending to be pure . It ’s only Muggle - borns they hate , they ’d be quite happy to let you and Ron join up . ”
78337	78351	78353	78353	Ron	201	“ There is no way they ’d let me be a Death Eater ! ”
78378	78398	78372	78373	Ernie Macmillan	317	“ My whole family are blood traitors ! That ’s as bad as Muggle - borns to Death Eaters ! ”
78399	78408	78410	78410	Harry	136	“ And they ’d love to have me , ”
78413	78430	78410	78410	Harry	136	“ We ’d be best pals if they did n’t keep trying to do me in . ”
78453	78466	78451	78451	Ginny	218	“ Hey , Harry , I ’m supposed to give you this . ”
78487	78499	78500	78500	Harry	136	“ Thanks , Ginny ... It ’s Dumbledore ’s next lesson ! ”
78516	78520	78500	78500	Harry	136	“ Monday evening ! ”
78528	78538	78539	78539	he	136	“ Want to join us in Hogsmeade , Ginny ? ”
78542	78554	78555	78555	she	179	“ I ’m going with Dean — might see you there , ”
78609	78622	78624	78624	Ron	201	“ What does it matter if we ’re smuggling Dark stuff OUT ? ”
78635	78648	78624	78624	Ron	201	“ Surely you ought to be checking what we bring back IN ? ”
78802	78806	78808	78808	Ron	201	“ Thank God , ”
78821	78829	78808	78808	Ron	201	“ Let ’s stay here all afternoon . ”
78830	78835	78808	78808	Ron	201	“ Harry , m’boy ! ”
78844	78848	78850	78850	Harry	136	“ Oh no , ”
78895	78910	78912	78912	Slughorn	199	“ Harry , that ’s three of my little suppers you ’ve missed now ! ”
78921	78945	78912	78912	Slughorn	199	“ It wo n’t do , m’boy , I ’m determined to have you ! Miss Granger loves them , do n’t you ? ”
78946	78949	78951	78951	Hermione	179	“ Yes , ”
78954	78959	78951	78951	Hermione	179	“ they ’re really — ”
78960	78971	78973	78973	Slughorn	199	“ So why do n’t you come along , Harry ? ”
78975	78986	78988	78988	Harry	136	“ Well , I ’ve had Quidditch practice , Professor , ”
79039	79057	79059	79059	Slughorn	199	“ Well , I certainly expect you to win your first match after all this hard work ! ”
79061	79088	79059	79059	Slughorn	199	“ But a little recreation never hurt anybody . Now , how about Monday night , you ca n’t possibly want to practice in this weather ... ”
79089	79110	79141	79141	he	1737	“ I ca n’t , Professor , I ’ve got — er — an appointment with Professor Dumbledore that evening . ”
79111	79115	79117	79117	Slughorn	199	“ Unlucky again ! ”
79120	79134	79117	79117	Slughorn	199	“ Ah , well ... you ca n’t evade me forever , Harry ! ”
79165	79178	79180	79180	Hermione	179	“ I ca n’t believe you ’ve wriggled out of another one , ”
79186	79203	79183	79183	her	179	“ They ’re not that bad , you know ... They ’re even quite fun sometimes ... ”
79214	79231	79210	79210	Ron	201	“ Oh , look — they ’ve got deluxe sugar quills — those would last hours ! ”
79280	79289	79291	79291	Harry	136	“ Let ’s go to the Three Broomsticks , ”
79293	79299	79291	79291	Harry	136	“ It ’ll be warm . ”
79447	79450	79443	79444	the man	764	“ Mundungus ! ”
79489	79498	79500	79501	Mundungus Fletcher	364	“ Oh , ’ ello , ’ Arry , ”
79511	79521	79500	79501	Mundungus Fletcher	364	“ Well , do n’t let me keep ya . ”
79547	79554	79556	79556	Harry	136	“ Are you selling this stuff ? ”
79572	79583	79585	79585	Mundungus	364	“ Oh , well , got ta scrape a living , ”
79587	79591	79585	79585	Mundungus	364	“ Gimme that ! ”
79602	79606	79607	79607	Ron	201	“ Hang on , ”
79611	79616	79607	79607	Ron	201	“ This looks familiar — ”
79617	79621	79623	79623	Mundungus	364	“ Thank you ! ”
79641	79652	79623	79623	Mundungus	364	“ Well , I ’ll see you all — OUCH ! ”
79680	79683	79685	79685	Hermione	179	“ Harry ! ”
79687	79696	79698	79698	Harry	136	“ You took that from Sirius ’s house , ”
79721	79731	79698	79698	Harry	136	“ That had the Black family crest on it . ”
79732	79740	79742	79742	Mundungus	364	“ I — no — what — ? ”
79750	79767	79769	79769	Harry	136	“ What did you do , go back the night he died and strip the place ? ”
79771	79776	79698	79698	Harry	136	“ I — no — ”
79777	79783	79793	79793	Hermione	179	“ Give it to me ! ”
79784	79791	79793	79793	Hermione	179	“ Harry , you must n’t ! ”
79855	79863	79835	79835	Harry	136	“ COME BACK , YOU THIEVING — ! ”
79864	79872	79830	79830	CRACK	365	“ There ’s no point , Harry . ”
79887	79903	79835	79835	Harry	136	“ Mundungus will probably be in London by now . There ’s no point yelling . ”
79904	79915	79835	79835	Harry	136	“ He ’s nicked Sirius ’s stuff ! Nicked it ! ”
79916	79922	79924	79924	Tonks	209	“ Yes , but still , ”
79936	79945	79924	79924	Tonks	209	“ You should get out of the cold . ”
79968	79976	79964	79964	Harry	136	“ He was nicking Sirius ’s stuff ! ”
79977	79993	79995	79995	Hermione	179	“ I know , Harry , but please do n’t shout , people are staring , ”
79997	80010	79995	79995	Hermione	179	“ Go and sit down , I ’ll get you a drink . ”
80031	80039	80040	80040	Harry	136	“ Ca n’t the Order control Mundungus ? ”
80051	80072	80040	80040	Harry	136	“ Ca n’t they at least stop him stealing everything that ’s not fixed down when he ’s at headquarters ? ”
80073	80076	80078	80078	Hermione	179	“ Shh ! ”
80119	80138	80109	80109	Zabini	271	“ Harry , I ’d be annoyed too , I know it ’s your things he ’s stealing — ”
80158	80166	80167	80167	he	136	“ Yeah , it ’s my stuff ! ”
80170	80203	80167	80167	he	136	“ No wonder he was n’t pleased to see me ! Well , I ’m going to tell Dumbledore what ’s going on , he ’s the only one who scares Mundungus . ”
80204	80208	80210	80210	Hermione	179	“ Good idea , ”
80220	80229	80210	80210	Hermione	179	“ Ron , what are you staring at ? ”
80230	80233	80235	80235	Ron	201	“ Nothing , ”
80274	80288	80290	80290	Hermione	179	“ I expect ‘ nothing ’s ’ in the back getting more firewhisky , ”
80358	80373	80355	80355	she	179	“ Shall we call it a day and go back to school , then ? ”
80559	80570	80573	80573	Katie	310	“ It ’s nothing to do with you , Leanne ! ”
80856	80860	80861	80861	he	136	“ Stay there ! ”
80871	80878	80861	80861	he	136	“ I ’m going for help ! ”
80930	80933	80934	80934	he	136	“ Hagrid ! ”
80948	80951	80953	80953	Hagrid	176	“ Harry ! ”
80975	80994	80968	80968	his	176	“ Jus ’ bin visitin ’ Grawp , he ’s comin ’ on so well yeh wouldn ’ — ”
80995	81010	80953	80953	Hagrid	176	“ Hagrid , someone ’s hurt back there , or cursed , or something — ”
81011	81015	81017	81017	Hagrid	176	“ Wha ’ ? ”
81032	81038	81040	81040	Harry	136	“ Someone ’s been cursed ! ”
81042	81055	80953	80953	Hagrid	176	“ Cursed ? Who ’s bin cursed — not Ron ? Hermione ? ”
81056	81072	81040	81040	Harry	136	“ No , it ’s not them , it ’s Katie Bell — this way ... ”
81119	81123	81125	81125	Hagrid	176	“ Get back ! ”
81127	81132	81125	81125	Hagrid	176	“ Lemme see her ! ”
81133	81140	81142	81142	Leanne	366	“ Something ’s happened to her ! ”
81144	81151	81142	81142	Leanne	366	“ I do n’t know what — ”
81219	81228	81204	81204	Hermione	179	“ It ’s Leanne , is n’t it ? ”
81233	81246	81229	81230	The girl	4164	“ Did it just happen all of a sudden , or — ? ”
81247	81255	81257	81257	Leanne	366	“ It was when that package tore , ”
81300	81306	81291	81291	Harry	136	“ Do n’t touch it ! ”
81324	81331	81333	81333	Harry	136	“ I ’ve seen that before , ”
81340	81365	81366	81366	He	136	“ It was on display in Borgin and Burkes ages ago . The label said it was cursed . Katie must have touched it . ”
81379	81388	81370	81370	Leanne	366	“ How did Katie get hold of this ? ”
81389	81455	81462	81462	Hermione	179	“ Well , that ’s why we were arguing . She came back from the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks holding it , said it was a surprise for somebody at Hogwarts and she had to deliver it . She looked all funny when she said it ... Oh no , oh no , I bet she ’d been Imperiused and I did n’t realize ! ”
81468	81482	81462	81462	Hermione	179	“ She did n’t say who ’d given it to her , Leanne ? ”
81483	81530	81462	81462	Hermione	179	“ No ... she would n’t tell me ... and I said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school , but she just would n’t listen and ... and then I tried to grab it from her ... and — and — ”
81539	81548	81550	81550	Hermione	179	“ We ’d better get up to school , ”
81558	81573	81552	81552	her	179	“ We ’ll be able to find out how she is . Come on ... ”
81606	81617	81618	81618	he	136	“ We ’ll need to show this to Madam Pomfrey , ”
81656	81718	81643	81643	he	136	“ Malfoy knows about this necklace . It was in a case at Borgin and Burkes four years ago , I saw him having a good look at it while I was hiding from him and his dad . This is what he was buying that day when we followed him ! He remembered it and he went back for it ! ”
81719	81727	81729	81729	Ron	201	“ I — I dunno , Harry , ”
81732	81757	81729	81729	Ron	201	“ Loads of people go to Borgin and Burkes ... and did n’t that girl say Katie got it in the girls ’ bathroom ? ”
81758	81781	81643	81643	he	136	“ She said she came back from the bathroom with it , she did n’t necessarily get it in the bathroom itself — ”
81782	81785	81787	81787	Ron	201	“ McGonagall ! ”
81812	81842	81797	81798	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell — upstairs to my office at once , please ! What ’s that you ’re holding , Potter ? ”
81843	81851	81853	81853	Harry	136	“ It ’s the thing she touched , ”
81855	81859	81861	81862	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Good lord , ”
81874	81886	81887	81887	she	232	“ No , no , Filch , they ’re with me ! ”
81906	81931	81901	81901	his	294	“ Take this necklace to Professor Snape at once , but be sure not to touch it , keep it wrapped in the scarf ! ”
81993	81996	81997	81997	she	232	“ Well ? ”
82001	82005	81997	81997	she	232	“ What happened ? ”
82098	82102	82104	82105	Professor McGonagall	232	“ All right , ”
82110	82133	82104	82105	Professor McGonagall	232	“ go up to the hospital wing , please , Leanne , and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock . ”
82153	82162	82141	82142	Professor McGonagall	232	“ What happened when Katie touched the necklace ? ”
82163	82171	82173	82173	Harry	136	“ She rose up in the air , ”
82183	82203	82173	82173	Harry	136	“ and then began to scream , and collapsed . Professor , can I see Professor Dumbledore , please ? ”
82204	82214	82216	82217	Professor McGonagall	232	“ The headmaster is away until Monday , Potter , ”
82222	82225	82226	82226	Harry	136	“ Away ? ”
82230	82237	82239	82240	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Yes , Potter , away ! ”
82243	82264	82239	82240	Professor McGonagall	232	“ But anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me , I ’m sure ! ”
82323	82335	82340	82340	him	136	“ I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace , Professor . ”
82373	82383	82385	82386	Professor McGonagall	232	“ That is a very serious accusation , Potter , ”
82393	82400	82385	82386	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Do you have any proof ? ”
82401	82404	82406	82406	Harry	136	“ No , ”
82408	82411	82413	82413	he	136	“ but ... ”
82447	82458	82436	82436	he	136	“ Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair ? ”
82459	82511	82436	82436	he	136	“ No , Professor , he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something , he did n’t have it with him . But that ’s not the point , the thing is that he bought something at the same time , and I think it was that necklace — ”
82512	82524	82436	82436	he	136	“ You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package ? ”
82525	82542	82436	82436	he	136	“ No , Professor , he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him — ”
82543	82547	82548	82548	Hermione	179	“ But Harry , ”
82551	82569	82548	82548	Hermione	179	“ Borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him , and Malfoy said no — ”
82570	82582	82584	82584	Harry	136	“ Because he did n’t want to touch it , obviously ! ”
82587	82606	82608	82608	Hermione	179	“ What he actually said was , ‘ How would I look carrying that down the street ? ’ ”
82610	82625	82627	82627	Ron	201	“ Well , he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace , ”
82629	82634	82636	82636	Hermione	179	“ Oh , Ron , ”
82639	82706	82707	82707	she	179	“ it would be all wrapped up , so he would n’t have to touch it , and quite easy to hide inside a cloak , so nobody would see it ! I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky , something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street — and in any case , ”
82717	82771	82707	82707	she	179	“ I asked Borgin about the necklace , do n’t you remember ? When I went in to try and find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep , I saw it there . And Borgin just told me the price , he did n’t say it was already sold or anything — ”
82772	82814	82826	82826	Hermione	179	“ Well , you were being really obvious , he realized what you were up to within about five seconds , of course he was n’t going to tell you — anyway , Malfoy could ’ve sent off for it since — ”
82815	82820	82822	82823	Professor McGonagall	232	“ That ’s enough ! ”
82836	82882	82828	82828	her	179	“ Potter , I appreciate you telling me this , but we can not point the finger of blame at Mr. Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased . The same is probably true of hundreds of people — ”
82883	82891	82893	82893	Ron	201	“ — that ’s what I said — ”
82895	82929	82828	82828	her	179	“ — and in any case , we have put stringent security measures in place this year . I do not believe that necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge — ”
82930	82933	82828	82828	her	179	“ But — ”
82934	82941	82943	82944	Professor McGonagall	232	“ — and what is more , ”
82953	82962	82943	82944	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Mr. Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today . ”
82970	82978	82963	82963	Harry	136	“ How do you know , Professor ? ”
82979	83014	83015	83015	she	232	“ Because he was doing detention with me . He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row . So , thank you for telling me your suspicions , Potter , ”
83023	83047	83018	83018	she	232	“ but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell . Good day to you all . ”
83096	83111	83113	83113	Ron	201	“ So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace to ? ”
83125	83130	83132	83132	Hermione	179	“ Goodness only knows , ”
83134	83157	83132	83132	Hermione	179	“ But whoever it was has had a narrow escape . No one could have opened that package without touching the necklace . ”
83158	83169	83171	83171	Harry	136	“ It could ’ve been meant for loads of people , ”
83173	83220	83171	83171	Harry	136	“ Dumbledore — the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him , he must be one of their top targets . Or Slughorn — Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really wanted him and they ca n’t be pleased that he ’s sided with Dumbledore . Or — ”
83221	83225	83227	83227	Hermione	179	“ Or you , ”
83232	83238	83240	83240	Harry	136	“ Could n’t have been , ”
83242	83314	83240	83240	Harry	136	“ or Katie would ’ve just turned around in the lane and given it to me , would n’t she ? I was behind her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks . It would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts , what with Filch searching everyone who goes in and out . I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle ? ”
83315	83324	83326	83326	Hermione	179	“ Harry , Malfoy was n’t in Hogsmeade ! ”
83335	83345	83347	83347	Harry	136	“ He must have used an accomplice , then , ”
83349	83382	83347	83347	Harry	136	“ Crabbe or Goyle — or , come to think of it , another Death Eater , he ’ll have loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now he ’s joined up — ”
83399	83402	83404	83404	Hermione	179	“ Dilligrout , ”
83474	83493	83495	83495	Ron	201	“ It was n’t a very slick attack , really , when you stop and think about it , ”
83519	83538	83495	83495	Ron	201	“ The curse did n’t even make it into the castle . Not what you ’d call foolproof . ”
83539	83544	83546	83546	Hermione	179	“ You ’re right , ”
83566	83578	83546	83546	Hermione	179	“ It was n’t very well thought - out at all . ”
83579	83594	83596	83596	Harry	136	“ But since when has Malfoy been one of the world ’s great thinkers ? ”
83669	83679	83681	83681	Harry	136	“ Oh , and Malfoy knows , of course , ”
83805	83818	83819	83819	Dumbledore	138	“ You have had a busy time while I have been away , ”
83822	83831	83819	83819	Dumbledore	138	“ I believe you witnessed Katie ’s accident . ”
83832	83841	83779	83779	he	138	“ Yes , sir . How is she ? ”
83842	83918	83819	83819	Dumbledore	138	“ Still very unwell , although she was relatively lucky . She appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin : There was a tiny hole in her glove . Had she put it on , had she even held it in her ungloved hand , she would have died , perhaps instantly . Luckily Professor Snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse — ”
83919	83923	83925	83925	Harry	136	“ Why him ? ”
83928	83934	83925	83925	Harry	136	“ Why not Madam Pomfrey ? ”
83935	83938	83953	83955	Phineas Nigellus Black	370	“ Impertinent , ”
83979	83997	83966	83966	his	370	“ I would not have permitted a student to question the way Hogwarts operated in my day . ”
83998	84006	84008	84008	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , thank you , Phineas , ”
84011	84054	84008	84008	Dumbledore	138	“ Professor Snape knows much more about the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey , Harry . Anyway , the St. Mungo ’s staff are sending me hourly reports , and I am hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery in time . ”
84055	84064	84065	84065	Harry	136	“ Where were you this weekend , sir ? ”
84092	84101	84103	84103	Dumbledore	138	“ I would rather not say just now , ”
84105	84116	84103	84103	Dumbledore	138	“ However , I shall tell you in due course . ”
84117	84121	84123	84123	Harry	136	“ You will ? ”
84127	84134	84136	84136	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , I expect so , ”
84159	84162	84164	84164	Harry	136	“ Sir , ”
84167	84174	84164	84164	Harry	136	“ I met Mundungus in Hogsmeade . ”
84175	84196	84198	84198	Dumbledore	138	“ Ah yes , I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating your inheritance with light - fingered contempt , ”
84204	84247	84198	84198	Dumbledore	138	“ He has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the Three Broomsticks ; I rather think he dreads facing me . However , rest assured that he will not be making away with any more of Sirius ’s old possessions . ”
84248	84261	84263	84264	Phineas Nigellus	370	“ That mangy old half - blood has been stealing Black heirlooms ? ”
84288	84291	84293	84293	Harry	136	“ Professor , ”
84300	84319	84293	84293	Harry	136	“ did Professor McGonagall tell you what I told her after Katie got hurt ? About Draco Malfoy ? ”
84320	84330	84332	84332	Dumbledore	138	“ She told me of your suspicions , yes , ”
84334	84340	84293	84293	Harry	136	“ And do you — ? ”
84341	84362	84364	84364	Dumbledore	138	“ I shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in Katie ’s accident , ”
84366	84379	84364	84364	Dumbledore	138	“ But what concerns me now , Harry , is our lesson . ”
84445	84511	84563	84563	He	138	“ You will remember , I am sure , that we left the tale of Lord Voldemort ’s beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle , Tom Riddle , had abandoned his witch wife , Merope , and returned to his family home in Little Hangleton . Merope was left alone in London , expecting the baby who would one day become Lord Voldemort . ”
84512	84524	84563	84563	He	138	“ How do you know she was in London , sir ? ”
84525	84535	84537	84537	Dumbledore	138	“ Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke , ”
84539	84562	84537	84537	Dumbledore	138	“ who , by an odd coincidence , helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing . ”
84627	84789	84597	84625	a little old man revolving slowly in the Pensieve , silver as a ghost but much more solid , with a thatch of hair that completely covered his eyes	1818	“ Yes , we acquired it in curious circumstances . It was brought in by a young witch just before Christmas , oh , many years ago now . She said she needed the gold badly , well , that much was obvious . Covered in rags and pretty far along ... Going to have a baby , see . She said the locket had been Slytherin ’s . Well , we hear that sort of story all the time , ‘ Oh , this was Merlin ’s , this was , his favorite teapot , ’ but when I looked at it , it had his mark all right , and a few simple spells were enough to tell me the truth . Of course , that made it near enough priceless . She did n’t seem to have any idea how much it was worth . Happy to get ten Galleons for it . Best bargain we ever made ! ”
84816	84824	84826	84826	Harry	136	“ He only gave her ten Galleons ? ”
84829	84839	84841	84841	Dumbledore	138	“ Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity , ”
84843	84891	84841	84841	Dumbledore	138	“ So we know that , near the end of her pregnancy , Merope was alone in London and in desperate need of gold , desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession , the locket that was one of Marvolo ’s treasured family heirlooms . ”
84892	84899	84901	84901	Harry	136	“ But she could do magic ! ”
84904	84921	84901	84901	Harry	136	“ She could have got food and everything for herself by magic , could n’t she ? ”
84922	84925	84927	84927	Dumbledore	138	“ Ah , ”
84929	85028	84927	84927	Dumbledore	138	“ perhaps she could . But it is my belief — I am guessing again , but I am sure I am right — that when her husband abandoned her , Merope stopped using magic . I do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer . Of course , it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers ; that can happen . In any case , as you are about to see , Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life . ”
85029	85040	84901	84901	Harry	136	“ She would n’t even stay alive for her son ? ”
85046	85057	85043	85043	his	138	“ Could you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort ? ”
85058	85061	85063	85063	Harry	136	“ No , ”
85066	85082	85063	85063	Harry	136	“ but she had a choice , did n’t she , not like my mother — ”
85083	85091	85093	85093	Dumbledore	138	“ Your mother had a choice too , ”
85096	85146	85093	85093	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her , but do not judge her too harshly , Harry . She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your mother ’s courage . And now , if you will stand ... ”
85147	85153	85154	85154	Harry	136	“ Where are we going ? ”
85168	85172	85174	85174	Dumbledore	138	“ This time , ”
85176	85204	85174	85174	Dumbledore	138	“ we are going to enter my memory . I think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate . After you , Harry ... ”
85260	85265	85267	85267	Dumbledore	138	“ There I am , ”
85336	85342	85344	85344	Harry	136	“ Nice suit , sir , ”
85423	85446	85416	85421	a scruffy girl wearing an apron	1830	“ Good afternoon . I have an appointment with a Mrs. Cole , who , I believe , is the matron here ? ”
85447	85450	85452	85456	the bewildered - looking girl	1831	“ Oh , ”
85465	85477	85478	85478	she	1831	“ Um ... just a mo ’ ... MRS . COLE ! ”
85501	85512	85494	85495	The girl	4164	“ Come in , she ’s on ’ er way . ”
85592	85627	85628	85628	she	1837	“ ... and take the iodine upstairs to Martha , Billy Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalley ’s oozing all over his sheets — chicken pox on top of everything else , ”
85663	85667	85669	85669	Dumbledore	138	“ Good afternoon , ”
85681	85705	85676	85677	Mrs. Cole	372	“ My name is Albus Dumbledore . I sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today . ”
85723	85742	85719	85719	she	372	“ Oh yes . Well — well then — you ’d better come into my room . Yes . ”
85795	85818	85820	85820	Dumbledore	138	“ I am here , as I told you in my letter , to discuss Tom Riddle and arrangements for his future , ”
85822	85827	85829	85830	Mrs. Cole	372	“ Are you family ? ”
85832	85840	85842	85842	Dumbledore	138	“ No , I am a teacher , ”
85844	85857	85842	85842	Dumbledore	138	“ I have come to offer Tom a place at my school . ”
85858	85866	85785	85785	herself	372	“ What school ’s this , then ? ”
85867	85873	85875	85875	Dumbledore	138	“ It is called Hogwarts , ”
85877	85887	85785	85785	herself	372	“ And how come you ’re interested in Tom ? ”
85888	85899	85785	85785	herself	372	“ We believe he has qualities we are looking for . ”
85900	85923	85785	85785	herself	372	“ You mean he ’s won a scholarship ? How can he have done ? He ’s never been entered for one . ”
85924	85938	85785	85785	herself	372	“ Well , his name has been down for our school since birth — ”
85939	85947	85785	85785	herself	372	“ Who registered him ? His parents ? ”
86002	86005	86007	86007	Dumbledore	138	“ Here , ”
86022	86031	86014	86014	he	138	“ I think this will make everything clear . ”
86055	86062	86063	86063	she	372	“ That seems perfectly in order , ”
86094	86106	86107	86107	she	372	“ Er — may I offer you a glass of gin ? ”
86116	86122	86124	86124	Dumbledore	138	“ Thank you very much , ”
86186	86212	86167	86167	she	372	“ I was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom Riddle ’s history ? I think he was born here in the orphanage ? ”
86213	86218	86220	86221	Mrs. Cole	372	“ That ’s right , ”
86229	86313	86220	86221	Mrs. Cole	372	“ I remember it clear as anything , because I ’d just started here myself . New Year ’s Eve and bitter cold , snowing , you know . Nasty night . And this girl , not much older than I was myself at the time , came staggering up the front steps . Well , she was n’t the first . We took her in , and she had the baby within the hour . And she was dead in another hour . ”
86326	86335	86337	86337	Dumbledore	138	“ Did she say anything before she died ? ”
86339	86350	86337	86337	Dumbledore	138	“ Anything about the boy ’s father , for instance ? ”
86351	86361	86363	86364	Mrs. Cole	372	“ Now , as it happens , she did , ”
86389	86548	86363	86364	Mrs. Cole	372	“ I remember she said to me , ‘ I hope he looks like his papa , ’ and I wo n’t lie , she was right to hope it , because she was no beauty — and then she told me he was to be named Tom , for his father , and Marvolo , for her father — yes , I know , funny name , is n’t it ? We wondered whether she came from a circus — and she said the boy ’s surname was to be Riddle . And she died soon after that without another word . Well , we named him just as she ’d said , it seemed so important to the poor girl , but no Tom nor Marvolo nor any kind of Riddle ever came looking for him , nor any family at all , so he stayed in the orphanage and he ’s been here ever since . ”
86578	86585	86575	86575	she	372	“ He ’s a funny boy . ”
86586	86589	86591	86591	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , ”
86593	86600	86575	86575	she	372	“ I thought he might be . ”
86601	86632	86575	86575	she	372	“ He was a funny baby too . He hardly ever cried , you know . And then , when he got a little older , he was ... odd . ”
86633	86639	86641	86641	Dumbledore	138	“ Odd in what way ? ”
86644	86649	86641	86641	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , he — ”
86676	86690	86668	86668	she	372	“ He ’s definitely got a place at your school , you say ? ”
86691	86694	86696	86696	Dumbledore	138	“ Definitely , ”
86698	86707	86668	86668	she	372	“ And nothing I say can change that ? ”
86708	86711	86713	86713	Dumbledore	138	“ Nothing , ”
86715	86725	86668	86668	she	372	“ You ’ll be taking him away , whatever ? ”
86726	86729	86731	86731	Dumbledore	138	“ Whatever , ”
86762	86769	86755	86755	she	372	“ He scares the other children . ”
86770	86778	86780	86780	Dumbledore	138	“ You mean he is a bully ? ”
86782	86789	86791	86792	Mrs. Cole	372	“ I think he must be , ”
86797	86817	86791	86792	Mrs. Cole	372	“ but it ’s very hard to catch him at it . There have been incidents ... Nasty things ... ”
86848	86890	86833	86833	She	372	“ Billy Stubbs ’s rabbit ... well , Tom said he did n’t do it and I do n’t see how he could have done , but even so , it did n’t hang itself from the rafters , did it ? ”
86891	86900	86902	86902	Dumbledore	138	“ I should n’t think so , no , ”
86905	86937	86939	86940	Mrs. Cole	372	“ But I ’m jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it . All I know is he and Billy had argued the day before . And then ”
86956	87050	86939	86940	Mrs. Cole	372	“ on the summer outing — we take them out , you know , once a year , to the countryside or to the seaside — well , Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop were never quite right afterwards , and all we ever got out of them was that they ’d gone into a cave with Tom Riddle . He swore they ’d just gone exploring , but something happened in there , I ’m sure of it . And , well , there have been a lot of things , funny things ... ”
87070	87087	87051	87051	She	372	“ I do n’t think many people will be sorry to see the back of him . ”
87088	87105	87107	87107	Dumbledore	138	“ You understand , I ’m sure , that we will not be keeping him permanently ? ”
87109	87125	87107	87107	Dumbledore	138	“ He will have to return here , at the very least , every summer . ”
87126	87145	87147	87148	Mrs. Cole	372	“ Oh , well , that ’s better than a whack on the nose with a rusty poker , ”
87184	87194	87167	87167	she	372	“ I suppose you ’d like to see him ? ”
87195	87199	87201	87201	Dumbledore	138	“ Very much , ”
87273	87278	87280	87281	Mrs. Cole	372	“ Here we are , ”
87307	87341	87301	87301	She	372	“ Tom ? You ’ve got a visitor . This is Mr. Dumberton — sorry , Dunderbore . He ’s come to tell you — well , I ’ll let him do it . ”
87469	87477	87479	87479	Dumbledore	138	“ How do you do , Tom ? ”
87527	87533	87502	87502	Dumbledore	138	“ I am Professor Dumbledore . ”
87534	87539	87541	87541	Riddle	340	“ ‘ Professor ’ ? ”
87547	87573	87543	87543	He	340	“ Is that like ‘ doctor ’ ? What are you here for ? Did she get you in to have a look at me ? ”
87588	87593	87595	87595	Dumbledore	138	“ No , no , ”
87599	87606	87608	87608	Riddle	340	“ I do n’t believe you , ”
87610	87625	87608	87608	Riddle	340	“ She wants me looked at , does n’t she ? Tell the truth ! ”
87698	87703	87689	87689	he	138	“ Who are you ? ”
87704	87747	87664	87664	he	138	“ I have told you . My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work at a school called Hogwarts . I have come to offer you a place at my school — your new school , if you would like to come . ”
87771	87846	87757	87757	He	340	“ You ca n’t kid me ! The asylum , that ’s where you ’re from , is n’t it ? ‘ Professor , ’ yes , of course — well , I ’m not going , see ? That old cat ’s the one who should be in the asylum . I never did anything to little Amy Benson or Dennis Bishop , and you can ask them , they ’ll tell you ! ”
87847	87855	87857	87857	Dumbledore	138	“ I am not from the asylum , ”
87860	87899	87857	87857	Dumbledore	138	“ I am a teacher and , if you will sit down calmly , I shall tell you about Hogwarts . Of course , if you would rather not come to the school , nobody will force you — ”
87900	87909	87911	87911	Riddle	340	“ I ’d like to see them try , ”
87913	87916	87917	87917	Dumbledore	138	“ Hogwarts , ”
87932	87942	87917	87917	Dumbledore	138	“ is a school for people with special abilities — ”
87943	87949	87917	87917	Dumbledore	138	“ I ’m not mad ! ”
87950	87975	87917	87917	Dumbledore	138	“ I know that you are not mad . Hogwarts is not a school for mad people . It is a school of magic . ”
88012	88015	88016	88016	he	340	“ Magic ? ”
88022	88027	88029	88029	Dumbledore	138	“ That ’s right , ”
88031	88044	88029	88029	Dumbledore	138	“ It ’s ... it ’s magic , what I can do ? ”
88045	88054	88029	88029	Dumbledore	138	“ What is it that you can do ? ”
88055	88059	88061	88061	Riddle	340	“ All sorts , ”
88081	88129	88077	88077	he	340	“ I can make things move without touching them . I can make animals do what I want them to do , without training them . I can make bad things happen to people who annoy me . I can make them hurt if I want to . ”
88159	88166	88167	88167	he	340	“ I knew I was different , ”
88175	88190	88167	88167	he	340	“ I knew I was special . Always , I knew there was something . ”
88191	88199	88201	88201	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , you were quite right , ”
88214	88220	88201	88201	Dumbledore	138	“ You are a wizard . ”
88268	88275	88298	88298	he	340	“ Are you a wizard too ? ”
88276	88282	88298	88298	he	340	“ Yes , I am . ”
88283	88287	88289	88289	Riddle	340	“ Prove it , ”
88306	88311	88302	88302	he	340	“ Tell the truth . ”
88317	88333	88314	88314	his	138	“ If , as I take it , you are accepting your place at Hogwarts — ”
88334	88340	88367	88367	he	340	“ Of course I am ! ”
88341	88356	88314	88314	his	138	“ Then you will address me as ‘ Professor ’ or ‘ sir . ’ ”
88376	88396	88367	88367	he	340	“ I ’m sorry , sir . I meant — please , Professor , could you show me — ? ”
88549	88558	88543	88543	he	340	“ Where can I get one of them ? ”
88559	88565	88567	88567	Dumbledore	138	“ All in good time , ”
88569	88583	88567	88567	Dumbledore	138	“ I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe . ”
88607	88612	88614	88614	Dumbledore	138	“ Open the door , ”
88661	88666	88668	88668	Dumbledore	138	“ Take it out , ”
88681	88695	88697	88697	Dumbledore	138	“ Is there anything in that box that you ought not to have ? ”
88710	88719	88720	88720	he	340	“ Yes , I suppose so , sir , ”
88729	88733	88735	88735	Dumbledore	138	“ Open it , ”
88808	88820	88822	88822	Dumbledore	138	“ You will return them to their owners with your apologies , ”
88833	88854	88826	88826	his	138	“ I shall know whether it has been done . And be warned : Thieving is not tolerated at Hogwarts . ”
88881	88886	88874	88874	he	340	“ Yes , sir . ”
88887	88891	88892	88892	Dumbledore	138	“ At Hogwarts , ”
88896	89008	88892	88892	Dumbledore	138	“ we teach you not only to use magic , but to control it . You have — inadvertently , I am sure — been using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our school . You are not the first , nor will you be the last , to allow your magic to run away with you . But you should know that Hogwarts can expel students , and the Ministry of Magic — yes , there is a Ministry — will punish lawbreakers still more severely . All new wizards must accept that , in entering our world , they abide by our laws . ”
89009	89014	89016	89016	Riddle	340	“ Yes , sir , ”
89062	89070	89054	89054	he	340	“ I have n’t got any money . ”
89071	89077	89079	89079	Dumbledore	138	“ That is easily remedied , ”
89091	89125	89079	89079	Dumbledore	138	“ There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes . You might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand , but — ”
89126	89133	89135	89135	Riddle	340	“ Where do you buy spellbooks ? ”
89157	89162	89164	89164	Dumbledore	138	“ In Diagon Alley , ”
89166	89186	89164	89164	Dumbledore	138	“ I have your list of books and school equipment with me . I can help you find everything — ”
89187	89194	89196	89196	Riddle	340	“ You ’re coming with me ? ”
89201	89207	89164	89164	Dumbledore	138	“ Certainly , if you — ”
89208	89215	89217	89217	Riddle	340	“ I do n’t need you , ”
89219	89251	89252	89252	he	340	“ I ’m used to doing things for myself , I go round London on my own all the time . How do you get to this Diagon Alley — sir ? ”
89307	89349	89304	89304	he	138	“ You will be able to see it , although Muggles around you — non - magical people , that is — will not . Ask for Tom the barman — easy enough to remember , as he shares your name — ”
89365	89374	89304	89304	he	138	“ You dislike the name ‘ Tom ’ ? ”
89375	89383	89385	89385	Riddle	340	“ There are a lot of Toms , ”
89412	89431	89409	89409	he	340	“ Was my father a wizard ? He was called Tom Riddle too , they ’ve told me . ”
89432	89441	89443	89443	Dumbledore	138	“ I ’m afraid I do n’t know , ”
89449	89465	89467	89467	Riddle	340	“ My mother ca n’t have been magic , or she would n’t have died , ”
89475	89500	89467	89467	Riddle	340	“ It must ’ve been him . So — when I ’ve got all my stuff — when do I come to this Hogwarts ? ”
89501	89516	89518	89518	Dumbledore	138	“ All the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope , ”
89520	89544	89518	89518	Dumbledore	138	“ You will leave from King ’s Cross Station on the first of September . There is a train ticket in there too . ”
89566	89602	89563	89563	Riddle	340	“ I can speak to snakes . I found out when we ’ve been to the country on trips — they find me , they whisper to me . Is that normal for a wizard ? ”
89623	89628	89630	89630	Dumbledore	138	“ It is unusual , ”
89638	89644	89630	89630	Dumbledore	138	“ but not unheard of . ”
89686	89700	89650	89650	his	138	“ Good - bye , Tom . I shall see you at Hogwarts . ”
89701	89708	89710	89714	the white - haired Dumbledore	138	“ I think that will do , ”
89743	89747	89749	89749	Dumbledore	138	“ Sit down , ”
89769	89791	89793	89793	Harry	136	“ He believed it much quicker than I did — I mean , when you told him he was a wizard , ”
89795	89809	89793	89793	Harry	136	“ I did n’t believe Hagrid at first , when he told me . ”
89810	89832	89834	89834	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was — to use his word — ‘ special , ’ ”
89836	89843	89845	89845	Harry	136	“ Did you know — then ? ”
89847	89865	89867	89867	Dumbledore	138	“ Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time ? ”
89869	89876	89878	89878	Harry	136	“ And he was a Parselmouth , ”
89880	89950	89952	89952	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , indeed ; a rare ability , and one supposedly connected with the Dark Arts , although as we know , there are Parselmouths among the great and the good too . In fact , his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty , secrecy , and domination . Time is making fools of us again , ”
89996	90001	90003	90003	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , Harry ? ”
90013	90019	90021	90021	Harry	136	“ The ring ’s gone , ”
90026	90039	90021	90021	Harry	136	“ But I thought you might have the mouth organ or something . ”
90056	90073	90079	90079	he	138	“ Very astute , Harry , but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ . ”
90169	90183	90185	90185	Ron	201	“ Wow , scary thought , the boy You - Know - Who , ”
90215	90246	90185	90185	Ron	201	“ But I still do n’t get why Dumbledore ’s showing you all this . I mean , it ’s really interesting and everything , but what ’s the point ? ”
90247	90250	90252	90252	Harry	136	“ Dunno , ”
90259	90274	90252	90252	Harry	136	“ But he says it ’s all important and it ’ll help me survive . ”
90275	90282	90284	90284	Hermione	179	“ I think it ’s fascinating , ”
90287	90310	90284	90284	Hermione	179	“ It makes absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible . How else will you find out his weaknesses ? ”
90311	90320	90321	90321	Harry	136	“ So how was Slughorn ’s latest party ? ”
90330	90340	90342	90342	Hermione	179	“ Oh , it was quite fun , really , ”
90350	90395	90342	90342	Hermione	179	“ I mean , he drones on about famous ex - pupils a bit , and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he ’s so well - connected , but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones . ”
90396	90400	90402	90402	Ron	201	“ Gwenog Jones ? ”
90412	90423	90402	90402	Ron	201	“ The Gwenog Jones ? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies ? ”
90424	90429	90431	90431	Hermione	179	“ That ’s right , ”
90433	90448	90431	90431	Hermione	179	“ Personally , I thought she was a bit full of herself , but — ”
90449	90456	90458	90459	Professor Sprout	307	“ Quite enough chat over here ! ”
90468	90488	90458	90459	Professor Sprout	307	“ You ’re lagging behind , everybody else has started , and Neville ’s already got his first pod ! ”
90528	90538	90540	90540	Ron	201	“ Okay , Professor , we ’re starting now ! ”
90552	90560	90540	90540	Ron	201	“ should ’ve used Muffliato , Harry . ”
90561	90568	90577	90577	she	179	“ No , we should n’t ! ”
90596	90608	90577	90577	she	179	“ Well , come on ... we ’d better get going ... ”
90779	90805	90807	90807	Ron	201	“ You know , I do n’t think I ’ll be having any of these in my garden when I ’ve got my own place , ”
90823	90829	90831	90831	Hermione	179	“ Pass me a bowl , ”
90862	90880	90882	90883	Professor Sprout	307	“ Do n’t be squeamish , squeeze it out , they ’re best when they ’re fresh ! ”
90885	90888	90890	90890	Hermione	179	“ Anyway , ”
90908	90961	90890	90890	Hermione	179	“ Slughorn ’s going to have a Christmas party , Harry , and there ’s no way you ’ll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings , so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come . ”
91001	91016	90995	90995	he	201	“ And this is another party just for Slughorn ’s favorites , is it ? ”
91017	91026	91028	91028	Hermione	179	“ Just for the Slug Club , yes , ”
91079	91094	91075	91075	Hermione	179	“ Look , I did n’t make up the name ‘ Slug Club ’ — ”
91095	91101	91103	91103	Ron	201	“ ‘ Slug Club , ’ ”
91111	91145	91103	91103	Ron	201	“ It ’s pathetic . Well , I hope you enjoy your party . Why do n’t you try hooking up with McLaggen , then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug — ”
91146	91154	91156	91156	Hermione	179	“ We ’re allowed to bring guests , ”
91170	91195	91156	91156	Hermione	179	“ and I was going to ask you to come , but if you think it ’s that stupid then I wo n’t bother ! ”
91265	91273	91275	91275	Ron	201	“ You were going to ask me ? ”
91283	91286	91288	91288	Hermione	179	“ Yes , ”
91291	91304	91288	91288	Hermione	179	“ But obviously if you ’d rather I hooked up with McLaggen ... ”
91321	91328	91330	91330	Ron	201	“ No , I would n’t , ”
91351	91354	91355	91355	he	136	“ Reparo , ”
91437	91444	91446	91446	Hermione	179	“ Hand that over , Harry , ”
91449	91462	91446	91446	Hermione	179	“ It says we ’re supposed to puncture them with something sharp ... ”
91653	91656	91658	91658	Ron	201	“ Gotcha ! ”
91933	91942	91958	91958	Dean	240	“ Are you still interested in playing Chaser ? ”
91943	91952	91954	91954	Dean	240	“ Wha — ? Yeah , of course ! ”
92028	92036	92038	92038	Harry	136	“ Well then , you ’re in , ”
92040	92050	92038	92038	Harry	136	“ There ’s a practice tonight , seven o’clock . ”
92051	92054	92056	92056	Dean	240	“ Right , ”
92058	92073	92056	92056	Dean	240	“ Cheers , Harry ! Blimey , I ca n’t wait to tell Ginny ! ”
92361	92376	92377	92377	Ron	201	“ It was an accident , I ’m sorry , Demelza , really sorry ! ”
92393	92397	92377	92377	Ron	201	“ I just — ”
92398	92401	92402	92402	Ginny	218	“ Panicked , ”
92416	92429	92402	92402	Ginny	218	“ You prat , Ron , look at the state of her ! ”
92430	92436	92438	92438	Harry	136	“ I can fix that , ”
92456	92459	92447	92447	his	136	“ Episkey . ”
92460	92480	92447	92447	his	136	“ And Ginny , do n’t call Ron a prat , you ’re not the Captain of this team — ”
92481	92499	92447	92447	his	136	“ Well , you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should — ”
92507	92518	92500	92500	Harry	136	“ In the air , everyone , let ’s go ... ”
92553	92566	92567	92567	he	136	“ Good work , everyone , I think we ’ll flatten Slytherin , ”
92586	92596	92598	92598	Ron	201	“ I played like a sack of dragon dung , ”
92612	92619	92621	92621	Harry	136	“ No , you did n’t , ”
92624	92642	92621	92621	Harry	136	“ You ’re the best Keeper I tried out , Ron . Your only problem is nerves . ”
92785	92788	92774	92774	Ron	201	“ Oi ! ”
92798	92801	92803	92803	Ginny	218	“ What ? ”
92805	92820	92791	92791	Ginny	218	“ I do n’t want to find my own sister snogging people in public ! ”
92821	92833	92835	92835	Ginny	218	“ This was a deserted corridor till you came butting in ! ”
92871	92879	92881	92881	Dean	240	“ Er ... c’m on , Ginny , ”
92883	92893	92881	92881	Dean	240	“ let ’s go back to the common room ... ”
92894	92898	92900	92900	Ginny	218	“ You go ! ”
92902	92912	92900	92900	Ginny	218	“ I want a word with my dear brother ! ”
92928	92931	92933	92933	Ginny	218	“ Right , ”
92949	92980	92933	92933	Ginny	218	“ let ’s get this straight once and for all . It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them , Ron — ”
92981	92987	92989	92989	Ron	201	“ Yeah , it is ! ”
92995	93007	92989	92989	Ron	201	“ D’you think I want people saying my sister ’s a — ”
93008	93012	93014	93014	Ginny	218	“ A what ? ”
93020	93026	93014	93014	Ginny	218	“ A what , exactly ? ”
93027	93036	93038	93038	Harry	136	“ He does n’t mean anything , Ginny — ”
93053	93059	93060	93060	she	218	“ Oh yes he does ! ”
93068	93095	93060	93060	she	218	“ Just because he ’s never snogged anyone in his life , just because the best kiss he ’s ever had is from our Auntie Muriel — ”
93096	93101	93103	93103	Ron	201	“ Shut your mouth ! ”
93111	93118	93120	93120	Ginny	218	“ No , I will not ! ”
93125	93176	93120	93120	Ginny	218	“ I ’ve seen you with Phlegm , hoping she ’ll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her , it ’s pathetic ! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done yourself , you would n’t mind so much that everyone else does it ! ”
93191	93202	93203	93203	Ron	201	“ You do n’t know what you ’re talking about ! ”
93230	93242	93215	93215	Harry	136	“ Just because I do n’t do it in public — ! ”
93258	93280	93243	93243	Ginny	218	“ Been kissing Pigwidgeon , have you ? Or have you got a picture of Auntie Muriel stashed under your pillow ? ”
93281	93284	93243	93243	Ginny	218	“ You — ”
93310	93316	93302	93302	Harry	136	“ Do n’t be stupid — ”
93317	93324	93326	93326	Ginny	218	“ Harry ’s snogged Cho Chang ! ”
93335	93375	93326	93326	Ginny	218	“ And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum , it ’s only you who acts like it ’s something disgusting , Ron , and that ’s because you ’ve got about as much experience as a twelve - year - old ! ”
93425	93429	93431	93431	Harry	136	“ C’m on , ”
93458	93466	93467	93467	Ron	201	“ Oi , out of the way ! ”
93587	93591	93579	93579	his	201	“ betrayal of trust ”
93593	93599	93579	93579	his	201	“ supposed to be my friend ”
93601	93609	93610	93610	Ron	201	“ D’you think Hermione did snog Krum ? ”
93649	93652	93653	93653	he	136	“ What ? ”
93657	93662	93653	93653	he	136	“ Oh ... er ... ”
93667	93670	93672	93672	he	136	“ yes , ”
93696	93699	93700	93700	he	201	“ Dilligrout , ”
94163	94172	94174	94174	Peakes	279	“ You shut up and leave her alone ! ”
94193	94196	94198	94198	Harry	136	“ ENOUGH ! ”
94236	94260	94261	94261	he	201	“ Peakes , go and pack up the Bludgers . Demelza , pull yourself together , you played really well today . Ron ... ”
94277	94305	94261	94261	he	201	“ you ’re my best mate , but carry on treating the rest of them like this and I ’m going to kick you off the team . ”
94344	94352	94341	94341	he	201	“ I resign . I ’m pathetic . ”
94353	94364	94366	94366	Harry	136	“ You ’re not pathetic and you ’re not resigning ! ”
94378	94398	94366	94366	Harry	136	“ You can save anything when you ’re on form , it ’s a mental problem you ’ve got ! ”
94399	94405	94341	94341	he	201	“ You calling me mental ? ”
94406	94413	94366	94366	Harry	136	“ Yeah , maybe I am ! ”
94430	94467	94426	94426	his	201	“ I know you have n’t got any time to find another Keeper , so I ’ll play tomorrow , but if we lose , and we will , I ’m taking myself off the team . ”
94806	94812	94814	94814	Lavender	306	“ Cheer up , Ron ! ”
94816	94824	94814	94814	Lavender	306	“ I know you ’ll be brilliant ! ”
94829	94832	94833	94833	Harry	136	“ Tea ? ”
94837	94843	94833	94833	Harry	136	“ Coffee ? Pumpkin juice ? ”
94844	94847	94849	94849	Ron	201	“ Anything , ”
94895	94902	94903	94903	she	179	“ How are you both feeling ? ”
94917	94920	94922	94922	Harry	136	“ Fine , ”
94936	94946	94922	94922	Harry	136	“ There you go , Ron . Drink up . ”
94961	94969	94957	94957	Hermione	179	“ Do n’t drink that , Ron ! ”
94979	94983	94985	94985	Ron	201	“ Why not ? ”
95002	95011	94987	94987	Hermione	179	“ You just put something in that drink . ”
95012	95016	95018	95018	Harry	136	“ Excuse me ? ”
95020	95049	94987	94987	Hermione	179	“ You heard me . I saw you . You just tipped something into Ron ’s drink . You ’ve got the bottle in your hand right now ! ”
95050	95061	95063	95063	Harry	136	“ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about , ”
95074	95086	95087	95087	Hermione	179	“ Ron , I warn you , do n’t drink it ! ”
95109	95117	95094	95094	Ron	201	“ Stop bossing me around , Hermione . ”
95135	95154	95132	95132	she	179	“ You should be expelled for that . I ’d never have believed it of you , Harry ! ”
95155	95161	95162	95162	he	136	“ Hark who ’s talking , ”
95166	95171	95162	95162	he	136	“ Confunded anyone lately ? ”
95213	95217	95219	95219	Harry	136	“ Nearly time , ”
95235	95246	95247	95247	Harry	136	“ Pretty lucky the weather ’s this good , eh ? ”
95251	95254	95256	95256	Ron	201	“ Yeah , ”
95282	95287	95289	95289	Ginny	218	“ Conditions look ideal , ”
95294	95337	95289	95289	Ginny	218	“ And guess what ? That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey — he took a Bludger in the head yesterday during their practice , and he ’s too sore to play ! And even better than that — Malfoy ’s gone off sick too ! ”
95338	95341	95343	95343	Harry	136	“ What ? ”
95352	95363	95343	95343	Harry	136	“ He ’s ill ? What ’s wrong with him ? ”
95364	95375	95377	95377	Ginny	218	“ No idea , but it ’s great for us , ”
95380	95398	95377	95377	Ginny	218	“ They ’re playing Harper instead ; he ’s in my year and he ’s an idiot . ”
95476	95483	95484	95484	he	159	“ Fishy , is n’t it ? ”
95492	95497	95484	95484	he	159	“ Malfoy not playing ? ”
95498	95505	95507	95507	Ron	201	“ Lucky , I call it , ”
95514	95534	95535	95535	he	201	“ And Vaisey off too , he ’s their best goal scorer , I did n’t fancy — hey ! ”
95553	95556	95535	95535	he	201	“ What ? ”
95557	95562	95563	95563	Ron	201	“ I ... you ... ”
95576	95589	95569	95569	he	201	“ My drink ... my pumpkin juice ... you did n’t ... ? ”
95600	95618	95590	95590	Harry	136	“ We ’ll be starting in about five minutes , you ’d better get your boots on . ”
95705	95710	95711	95711	she	389	“ Captains shake hands , ”
95728	95743	95726	95726	Urquhart	390	“ Mount your brooms . On the whistle ... three ... two ... one ... ”
95808	95870	95801	95803	the usual commentator	1978	“ Well , there they go , and I think we ’re all surprised to see the team that Potter ’s put together this year . Many thought , given Ronald Weasley ’s patchy performance as Keeper last year , that he might be off the team , but of course , a close personal friendship with the Captain does help ... ”
95941	95963	95896	95897	the commentator	1980	“ Oh , and here comes Slytherin ’s first attempt on goal , it ’s Urquhart streaking down the pitch and — ”
95970	95989	95964	95964	Harry	136	“ — Weasley saves it , well , he ’s bound to get lucky sometimes , I suppose ... ”
95990	96000	96002	96002	Harry	136	“ That ’s right , Smith , he is , ”
96100	96115	96117	96117	Zacharias	280	“ Of course , Coote is n’t really the usual build for a Beater , ”
96120	96130	96117	96117	Zacharias	280	“ they ’ve generally got a bit more muscle — ”
96131	96138	96139	96139	Harry	136	“ Hit a Bludger at him ! ”
96250	96256	96257	96257	he	201	“ Weasley Is Our King , ”
96266	96278	96227	96227	He	201	“ Thinks he ’s something special today , does n’t he ? ”
96301	96308	96293	96293	Harper	387	“ Your blood - traitor pal ... ”
96352	96364	96366	96367	Zacharias Smith	280	“ And I think Harper of Slytherin ’s seen the Snitch ! ”
96372	96384	96366	96367	Zacharias Smith	280	“ Yes , he ’s certainly seen something Potter has n’t ! ”
96518	96523	96525	96525	Harry	136	“ Oi , Harper ! ”
96529	96543	96525	96525	Harry	136	“ How much did Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him ? ”
96595	96598	96599	96599	Harry	136	“ YES ! ”
96649	96657	96659	96659	Harry	136	“ Ginny , where ’re you going ? ”
96737	96746	96728	96728	Ginny	218	“ Forgot to brake , Professor , sorry . ”
96815	96826	96828	96828	Dean	240	“ Party up in the common room , Seamus said ! ”
96831	96839	96828	96828	Dean	240	“ C’m on , Ginny , Demelza ! ”
96877	96887	96888	96888	She	179	“ I want a word with you , Harry . ”
96894	96910	96888	96888	She	179	“ You should n’t have done it . You heard Slughorn , it ’s illegal . ”
96911	96923	96925	96925	Ron	201	“ What are you going to do , turn us in ? ”
96927	96935	96937	96937	Harry	136	“ What are you two talking about ? ”
96956	96967	96969	96969	Hermione	179	“ You know perfectly well what we ’re talking about ! ”
96972	96987	96969	96969	Hermione	179	“ You spiked Ron ’s juice with lucky potion at breakfast ! Felix Felicis ! ”
96988	96995	96997	96997	Harry	136	“ No , I did n’t , ”
97006	97031	96969	96969	Hermione	179	“ Yes you did , Harry , and that ’s why everything went right , there were Slytherin players missing and Ron saved everything ! ”
97032	97040	97042	97042	Harry	136	“ I did n’t put it in ! ”
97087	97109	97110	97110	He	136	“ I wanted Ron to think I ’d done it , so I faked it when I knew you were looking . ”
97115	97130	97110	97110	He	136	“ You saved everything because you felt lucky . You did it all yourself . ”
97137	97148	97149	97149	Ron	201	“ There really was n’t anything in my pumpkin juice ? ”
97154	97176	97149	97149	Ron	201	“ But the weather ’s good ... and Vaisey could n’t play ... I honestly have n’t been given lucky potion ? ”
97199	97229	97196	97196	her	179	“ You added Felix Felicis to Ron ’s juice this morning , that ’s why he saved everything ! See ! I can save goals without help , Hermione ! ”
97230	97249	97251	97251	Ron	201	“ I never said you could n’t — Ron , you thought you ’d been given it too ! ”
97268	97271	97273	97273	Harry	136	“ Er , ”
97290	97303	97279	97279	he	136	“ shall ... shall we go up to the party , then ? ”
97304	97308	97310	97310	Hermione	179	“ You go ! ”
97316	97338	97310	97310	Hermione	179	“ I ’m sick of Ron at the moment , I do n’t know what I ’m supposed to have done ... ”
97588	97593	97594	97594	she	218	“ Looking for Ron ? ”
97599	97609	97594	97594	she	218	“ He ’s over there , the filthy hypocrite . ”
97647	97661	97663	97663	Ginny	218	“ It looks like he ’s eating her face , does n’t it ? ”
97666	97684	97663	97663	Ginny	218	“ But I suppose he ’s got to refine his technique somehow . Good game , Harry . ”
97797	97800	97801	97801	He	136	“ Hermione ? ”
97858	97865	97866	97866	she	218	“ Oh , hello , Harry , ”
97873	97879	97866	97866	she	218	“ I was just practicing . ”
97880	97891	97893	97893	Harry	136	“ Yeah ... they ’re — er — really good ... ”
97949	97958	97938	97938	she	218	“ Ron seems to be enjoying the celebrations . ”
97959	97965	97967	97967	Harry	136	“ Er ... does he ? ”
97969	97979	97981	97981	Hermione	179	“ Do n’t pretend you did n’t see him , ”
97983	97994	97981	97981	Hermione	179	“ He was n’t exactly hiding it , was — ? ”
98019	98022	98023	98023	he	201	“ Oh , ”
98037	98040	98042	98042	Lavender	306	“ Oops ! ”
98095	98107	98075	98075	Ron	201	“ Hi , Harry ! Wondered where you ’d got to ! ”
98143	98152	98153	98153	she	179	“ You should n’t leave Lavender waiting outside , ”
98157	98166	98153	98153	she	179	“ She ’ll wonder where you ’ve gone . ”
98192	98195	98153	98153	she	179	“ Oppugno ! ”
98263	98266	98267	98267	he	136	“ Gerremoffme ! ”
98583	98589	98590	98590	he	201	“ She ca n’t complain , ”
98594	98626	98590	98590	he	201	“ She snogged Krum . So she ’s found out someone wants to snog me too . Well , it ’s a free country . I have n’t done anything wrong . ”
98683	98690	98691	98691	Ron	201	“ I never promised Hermione anything , ”
98694	98729	98691	98691	Ron	201	“ I mean , all right , I was going to go to Slughorn ’s Christmas party with her , but she never said ... just as friends ... I ’m a free agent ... ”
98769	98771	98744	98744	Ron	201	“ Krum ”
98773	98777	98744	98744	Ron	201	“ ca n’t complain ”
98853	98865	98867	98867	Hermione	179	“ He ’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes , ”
98882	98890	98870	98871	the librarian	2044	“ I really could n’t care less . ”
98960	98964	98966	98966	Hermione	179	“ And incidentally , ”
98973	98980	98966	98966	Hermione	179	“ you need to be careful . ”
98981	98987	98989	98989	Harry	136	“ For the last time , ”
99007	99035	98989	98989	Harry	136	“ I am not giving back this book , I ’ve learned more from the Half - Blood Prince than Snape or Slughorn have taught me in — ”
99036	99049	99051	99051	Hermione	179	“ I ’m not talking about your stupid so - called Prince , ”
99068	99155	99051	99051	Hermione	179	“ I ’m talking about earlier . I went into the girls ’ bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there , including that Romilda Vane , trying to decide how to slip you a love potion . They ’re all hoping they ’re going to get you to take them to Slughorn ’s party , and they all seem to have bought Fred and George ’s love potions , which I ’m afraid to say probably work — ”
99156	99165	99167	99167	Harry	136	“ Why did n’t you confiscate them then ? ”
99188	99201	99203	99203	Hermione	179	“ They did n’t have the potions with them in the bathroom , ”
99206	99223	99225	99225	she	179	“ They were just discussing tactics . As I doubt whether even the Half - Blood Prince ”
99233	99282	99225	99225	she	179	“ could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once , I ’d just invite someone to go with you , that ’ll stop all the others thinking they ’ve still got a chance . It ’s tomorrow night , they ’re getting desperate . ”
99283	99293	99295	99295	Harry	136	“ There is n’t anyone I want to invite , ”
99338	99357	99359	99359	Hermione	179	“ Well , just be careful what you drink , because Romilda Vane looked like she meant business , ”
99398	99404	99405	99405	he	136	“ Hang on a moment , ”
99409	99423	99405	99405	he	136	“ I thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes ? ”
99424	99438	99440	99440	Hermione	179	“ And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned ? ”
99448	99473	99405	99405	he	136	“ But I thought all the owls were being searched . So how come these girls are able to bring love potions into school ? ”
99474	99487	99489	99489	Hermione	179	“ Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions , ”
99491	99501	99489	99489	Hermione	179	“ It ’s part of their Owl Order Service . ”
99502	99510	99511	99511	Hermione	179	“ You know a lot about it . ”
99531	99550	99551	99551	she	179	“ It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer , ”
99555	99580	99551	99551	she	179	“ I do n’t go around putting potions in people ’s drinks ... or pretending to , either , which is just as bad ... ”
99581	99590	99592	99592	Harry	136	“ Yeah , well , never mind that , ”
99595	99636	99592	99592	Harry	136	“ The point is , Filch is being fooled , is n’t he ? These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else ! So why could n’t Malfoy have brought the necklace into the school — ? ”
99637	99646	99551	99551	she	179	“ Oh , Harry ... not that again ... ”
99647	99654	99656	99656	Harry	136	“ Come on , why not ? ”
99658	99661	99663	99663	Hermione	179	“ Look , ”
99665	99737	99663	99663	Hermione	179	“ Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes , curses , and concealment charms , do n’t they ? They ’re used to find Dark Magic and Dark objects . They ’d have picked up a powerful curse , like the one on that necklace , within seconds . But something that ’s just been put in the wrong bottle would n’t register — and anyway , love potions are n’t Dark or dangerous — ”
99738	99745	99747	99747	Harry	136	“ Easy for you to say , ”
99754	99790	99791	99791	Hermione	179	“ — so it would be down to Filch to realize it was n’t a cough potion , and he ’s not a very good wizard , I doubt he can tell one potion from — ”
99853	99860	99861	99861	she	179	“ The library is now closed , ”
99864	99889	99861	99861	she	179	“ Mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct — what have you been doing to that book , you depraved boy ? ”
99890	99902	99904	99904	Harry	136	“ It is n’t the library ’s , it ’s mine ! ”
99928	99931	99932	99932	she	179	“ Despoiled ! ”
99935	99940	99932	99932	she	179	“ Desecrated ! Befouled ! ”
99941	99953	99955	99955	Harry	136	“ It ’s just a book that ’s been written on ! ”
99995	100019	99964	99964	She	179	“ She ’ll ban you from the library if you ’re not careful . Why did you have to bring that stupid book ? ”
100020	100057	99974	99974	Hermione	179	“ It ’s not my fault she ’s barking mad , Hermione . Or d’you think she overheard you being rude about Filch ? I ’ve always thought there might be something going on between them ... ”
100058	100064	99964	99964	She	179	“ Oh , ha ha ... ”
100110	100113	100115	100115	Harry	136	“ Baubles , ”
100129	100134	100136	100138	the Fat Lady	1806	“ Same to you , ”
100152	100157	100159	100160	Romilda Vane	266	“ Hi , Harry ! ”
100172	100177	100159	100160	Romilda Vane	266	“ Fancy a gillywater ? ”
100182	100193	100196	100196	her	179	“ what - did - I - tell - you ? ”
100199	100203	100205	100205	Harry	136	“ No thanks , ”
100208	100216	100205	100205	Harry	136	“ I do n’t like it much . ”
100217	100224	100226	100226	Romilda	266	“ Well , take these anyway , ”
100235	100260	100226	100226	Romilda	266	“ Chocolate Cauldrons , they ’ve got firewhisky in them . My gran sent them to me , but I do n’t like them . ”
100261	100270	100272	100272	Harry	136	“ Oh — right — thanks a lot , ”
100283	100294	100272	100272	Harry	136	“ Er — I ’m just going over here with ... ”
100307	100311	100313	100313	Hermione	179	“ Told you , ”
100316	100333	100313	100313	Hermione	179	“ Sooner you ask someone , sooner they ’ll all leave you alone and you can — ”
100357	100365	100367	100367	Hermione	179	“ Well , good night , Harry , ”
100662	100669	100671	100671	Luna	261	“ Oh , hello , Harry , ”
100673	100685	100671	100671	Luna	261	“ Did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow ? ”
100686	100698	100699	100699	He	136	“ Hi , Luna . Hermione , you left your stuff ... ”
100705	100709	100711	100711	Hermione	179	“ Oh yes , ”
100739	100753	100729	100729	she	179	“ Thank you , Harry . Well , I ’d better get going ... ”
100779	100786	100788	100788	Luna	261	“ She ’s a bit upset , ”
100790	100818	100788	100788	Luna	261	“ I thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there , but it turned out to be Hermione . She said something about that Ron Weasley ... ”
100819	100828	100830	100830	Harry	136	“ Yeah , they ’ve had a row , ”
100832	100844	100846	100846	Luna	261	“ He says very funny things sometimes , does n’t he ? ”
100857	100872	100846	100846	Luna	261	“ But he can be a bit unkind . I noticed that last year . ”
100873	100877	100879	100879	Harry	136	“ I s’pose , ”
100901	100910	100884	100884	her	261	“ So have you had a good term ? ”
100911	100920	100922	100922	Luna	261	“ Oh , it ’s been all right , ”
100924	100955	100922	100922	Luna	261	“ A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny ’s been nice , though . She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me ‘ Loony ’ the other day — ”
100956	100971	100999	100999	Luna	261	“ How would you like to come to Slughorn ’s party with me tonight ? ”
101009	101017	100999	100999	Luna	261	“ Slughorn ’s party ? With you ? ”
101018	101021	101023	101023	Harry	136	“ Yeah , ”
101025	101043	101023	101023	Harry	136	“ We ’re supposed to bring guests , so I thought you might like ... I mean ... ”
101054	101073	101044	101044	He	136	“ I mean , just as friends , you know . But if you do n’t want to ... ”
101086	101101	101103	101103	Luna	261	“ Oh , no , I ’d love to go with you as friends ! ”
101115	101148	101103	101103	Luna	261	“ Nobody ’s ever asked me to a party before , as a friend ! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow , for the party ? Should I do mine too ? ”
101149	101152	101154	101154	Harry	136	“ No , ”
101157	101189	101154	101154	Harry	136	“ that was a mistake . I ’ll get Hermione to put it right for me . So , I ’ll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o’clock then . ”
101190	101193	101217	101217	Peeves	396	“ AHA ! ”
101233	101251	101253	101253	he	396	“ Potty asked Loony to go to the party ! Potty lurves Loony ! Potty luuuuurves Looooooony ! ”
101261	101266	101253	101253	he	396	“ Potty loves Loony ! ”
101267	101275	101277	101277	Harry	136	“ Nice to keep these things private , ”
101306	101313	101315	101315	Ron	201	“ You could ’ve taken anyone ! ”
101321	101330	101315	101315	Ron	201	“ Anyone ! And you chose Loony Lovegood ? ”
101331	101340	101342	101342	Ginny	218	“ Do n’t call her that , Ron , ”
101354	101371	101342	101342	Ginny	218	“ I ’m really glad you ’re taking her , Harry , she ’s so excited . ”
101433	101439	101441	101441	Harry	136	“ You could say sorry , ”
101444	101456	101458	101458	Ron	201	“ What , and get attacked by another flock of canaries ? ”
101460	101470	101458	101458	Ron	201	“ What did you have to imitate her for ? ”
101471	101478	101515	101515	Harry	136	“ She laughed at my mustache ! ”
101479	101494	101458	101458	Ron	201	“ So did I , it was the stupidest thing I ’ve ever seen . ”
101528	101533	101535	101535	Parvati	308	“ Hi , Harry , ”
101554	101557	101559	101559	Harry	136	“ Hi , ”
101561	101583	101559	101559	Harry	136	“ How ’re you ? You ’re staying at Hogwarts , then ? I heard your parents wanted you to leave . ”
101584	101598	101600	101600	Parvati	308	“ I managed to talk them out of it for the time being , ”
101602	101626	101600	101600	Parvati	308	“ That Katie thing really freaked them out , but as there has n’t been anything since ... Oh , hi , Hermione ! ”
101670	101675	101677	101677	Hermione	179	“ Hi , Parvati ! ”
101685	101695	101677	101677	Hermione	179	“ Are you going to Slughorn ’s party tonight ? ”
101696	101700	101702	101702	Parvati	308	“ No invite , ”
101705	101733	101702	101702	Parvati	308	“ I ’d love to go , though , it sounds like it ’s going to be really good ... You ’re going , are n’t you ? ”
101734	101748	101795	101795	Parvati	308	“ Yes , I ’m meeting Cormac at eight , and we ’re — ”
101778	101789	101702	101702	Parvati	308	“ — we ’re going up to the party together . ”
101790	101793	101795	101795	Parvati	308	“ Cormac ? ”
101797	101804	101795	101795	Parvati	308	“ Cormac McLaggen , you mean ? ”
101805	101810	101812	101812	Hermione	179	“ That ’s right , ”
101815	101820	101822	101822	she	179	“ The one who almost ”
101833	101838	101822	101822	she	179	“ became Gryffindor Keeper . ”
101839	101849	101851	101851	Parvati	308	“ Are you going out with him , then ? ”
101857	101867	101869	101869	Hermione	179	“ Oh — yes — did n’t you know ? ”
101881	101884	101886	101886	Parvati	308	“ No ! ”
101897	101916	101886	101886	Parvati	308	“ Wow , you like your Quidditch players , do n’t you ? First Krum , then McLaggen ... ”
101917	101925	101926	101926	Hermione	179	“ I like really good Quidditch players , ”
101933	101949	101926	101926	Hermione	179	“ Well , see you ... Got to go and get ready for the party ... ”
102105	102108	102109	102109	he	136	“ Hi , ”
102112	102119	102109	102109	he	136	“ Shall we get going then ? ”
102120	102124	102125	102125	she	261	“ Oh yes , ”
102129	102135	102125	102125	she	261	“ Where is the party ? ”
102136	102141	102143	102143	Harry	136	“ Slughorn ’s office , ”
102159	102173	102143	102143	Harry	136	“ Did you hear , there ’s supposed to be a vampire coming ? ”
102174	102178	102180	102180	Luna	261	“ Rufus Scrimgeour ? ”
102182	102187	102189	102189	Harry	136	“ I — what ? ”
102193	102201	102189	102189	Harry	136	“ You mean the Minister of Magic ? ”
102202	102210	102212	102212	Luna	261	“ Yes , he ’s a vampire , ”
102219	102262	102212	102212	Luna	261	“ Father wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge , but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry . Obviously , they did n’t want the truth to get out ! ”
102495	102500	102502	102502	Slughorn	199	“ Harry , m’boy ! ”
102518	102535	102502	102502	Slughorn	199	“ Come in , come in , so many people I ’d like you to meet ! ”
102585	102623	102573	102573	Harry	136	“ Harry , I ’d like you to meet Eldred Worple , an old student of mine , author of Blood Brothers : My Life Amongst the Vampires — and , of course , his friend Sanguini . ”
102684	102693	102695	102695	Worple	400	“ Harry Potter , I am simply delighted ! ”
102705	102734	102695	102695	Worple	400	“ I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day , ‘ Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been waiting ? ’ ”
102735	102738	102740	102740	Harry	136	“ Er , ”
102742	102746	102740	102740	Harry	136	“ were you ? ”
102747	102755	102757	102757	Worple	400	“ Just as modest as Horace described ! ”
102759	102762	102764	102764	his	400	“ But seriously ”
102773	102856	102858	102858	Worple	400	“ I would be delighted to write it myself — people are craving to know more about you , dear boy , craving ! If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews , say in four- or five - hour sessions , why , we could have the book finished within months . And all with very little effort on your part , I assure you — ask Sanguini here if it is n’t quite — Sanguini , stay here ! ”
102884	102891	102893	102893	Worple	400	“ Here , have a pasty , ”
102916	102932	102910	102910	his	400	“ My dear boy , the gold you could make , you have no idea — ”
102933	102940	102942	102942	Harry	136	“ I ’m definitely not interested , ”
102945	102958	102942	102942	Harry	136	“ and I ’ve just seen a friend of mine , sorry . ”
102991	102996	102959	102959	He	136	“ Hermione ! Hermione ! ”
102997	103011	102968	102968	he	136	“ Harry ! There you are , thank goodness ! Hi , Luna ! ”
103012	103019	103021	103021	Harry	136	“ What ’s happened to you ? ”
103047	103064	103065	103065	she	179	“ Oh , I ’ve just escaped — I mean , I ’ve just left Cormac , ”
103068	103073	103074	103074	she	179	“ Under the mistletoe , ”
103088	103097	103098	103098	he	136	“ Serves you right for coming with him , ”
103103	103112	103114	103114	Hermione	179	“ I thought he ’d annoy Ron most , ”
103117	103135	103114	103114	Hermione	179	“ I debated for a while about Zacharias Smith , but I thought , on the whole — ”
103136	103141	103143	103143	Harry	136	“ You considered Smith ? ”
103147	103191	103114	103114	Hermione	179	“ Yes , I did , and I ’m starting to wish I ’d chosen him , McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman . Let ’s go this way , we ’ll be able to see him coming , he ’s so tall ... ”
103228	103231	103233	103233	Luna	261	“ Hello , ”
103239	103246	103248	103249	Professor Trelawney	298	“ Good evening , my dear , ”
103265	103276	103258	103258	Harry	136	“ I have n’t seen you in my classes lately ... ”
103277	103287	103289	103289	Luna	261	“ No , I ’ve got Firenze this year , ”
103291	103297	103299	103300	Professor Trelawney	298	“ Oh , of course , ”
103308	103368	103299	103300	Professor Trelawney	298	“ Or Dobbin , as I prefer to think of him . You would have thought , would you not , that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse ? But no ... we share classes ... It ’s an insult , frankly , an insult . Do you know ... ”
103396	103416	103388	103388	Harry	136	“ Let ’s get something straight . Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts ? ”
103422	103433	103419	103419	her	179	“ Do you really think I ’d stoop that low ? ”
103440	103450	103434	103434	Harry	136	“ Hermione , if you can ask out McLaggen — ”
103451	103457	103459	103459	Hermione	179	“ There ’s a difference , ”
103463	103487	103459	103459	Hermione	179	“ I ’ve got no plans to tell Ron anything about what might , or might not , have happened at Keeper tryouts . ”
103488	103491	103493	103493	Harry	136	“ Good , ”
103496	103513	103493	103493	Harry	136	“ Because he ’ll just fall apart again , and we ’ll lose the next match — ”
103514	103517	103519	103519	Hermione	179	“ Quidditch ! ”
103522	103570	103519	103519	Hermione	179	“ Is that all boys care about ? Cormac has n’t asked me one single question about myself , no , I ’ve just been treated to ‘ A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen ’ nonstop ever since — oh no , here he comes ! ”
103602	103606	103611	103611	his	272	“ Seen Hermione ? ”
103620	103625	103627	103627	Harry	136	“ No , sorry , ”
103651	103655	103657	103658	Professor Trelawney	298	“ Harry Potter ! ”
103672	103677	103679	103679	Harry	136	“ Oh , hello , ”
103682	103687	103688	103688	she	179	“ My dear boy ! ”
103696	103753	103688	103688	she	179	“ The rumors ! The stories ! ‘ The Chosen One ’ ! Of course , I have known for a very long time ... The omens were never good , Harry ... But why have you not returned to Divination ? For you , of all people , the subject is of the utmost importance ! ”
103754	103768	103775	103775	Slughorn	199	“ Ah , Sybill , we all think our subject ’s most important ! ”
103812	103828	103830	103830	Slughorn	199	“ But I do n’t think I ’ve ever known such a natural at Potions ! ”
103843	103878	103830	103830	Slughorn	199	“ Instinctive , you know — like his mother ! I ’ve only ever taught a few with this kind of ability , I can tell you that , Sybill — why even Severus — ”
103902	103913	103915	103915	Slughorn	199	“ Stop skulking and come and join us , Severus ! ”
103918	103948	103915	103915	Slughorn	199	“ I was just talking about Harry ’s exceptional potion - making ! Some credit must go to you , of course , you taught him for five years ! ”
103973	103991	103962	103962	his	147	“ Funny , I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all . ”
103992	104002	104004	104004	Slughorn	199	“ Well , then , it ’s natural ability ! ”
104006	104044	104004	104004	Slughorn	199	“ You should have seen what he gave me , first lesson , Draught of Living Death — never had a student produce finer on a first attempt , I do n’t think even you , Severus — ”
104045	104048	104050	104050	Snape	147	“ Really ? ”
104086	104098	104100	104100	Slughorn	199	“ Remind me what other subjects you ’re taking , Harry ? ”
104102	104115	104053	104053	his	147	“ Defense Against the Dark Arts , Charms , Transfiguration , Herbology ... ”
104116	104129	104131	104131	Snape	147	“ All the subjects required , in short , for an Auror , ”
104138	104152	104154	104154	Harry	136	“ Yeah , well , that ’s what I ’d like to do , ”
104157	104167	104169	104169	Slughorn	199	“ And a great one you ’ll make too ! ”
104171	104184	104186	104186	Luna	261	“ I do n’t think you should be an Auror , Harry , ”
104194	104232	104189	104189	Everybody	3921	“ The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy , I thought everyone knew that . They ’re working to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a combination of Dark Magic and gum disease . ”
104296	104300	104302	104302	Filch	407	“ Professor Slughorn , ”
104320	104357	104316	104316	his	407	“ I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor . He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out . Did you issue him with an invitation ? ”
104370	104379	104380	104380	he	407	“ All right , I was n’t invited ! ”
104384	104395	104380	104380	he	407	“ I was trying to gate - crash , happy ? ”
104396	104403	104405	104405	Filch	407	“ No , I ’m not ! ”
104419	104451	104405	104405	Filch	407	“ You ’re in trouble , you are ! Did n’t the headmaster say that nighttime prowling ’s out , unless you ’ve got permission , did n’t he , eh ? ”
104452	104465	104467	104467	Slughorn	199	“ That ’s all right , Argus , that ’s all right , ”
104473	104508	104467	104467	Slughorn	199	“ It ’s Christmas , and it ’s not a crime to want to come to a party . Just this once , we ’ll forget any punishment ; you may stay , Draco . ”
104605	104612	104614	104614	Slughorn	199	“ It ’s nothing , nothing , ”
104622	104632	104614	104614	Slughorn	199	“ I did know your grandfather , after all ... ”
104633	104644	104646	104646	Malfoy	159	“ He always spoke very highly of you , sir , ”
104649	104663	104646	104646	Malfoy	159	“ Said you were the best potion - maker he ’d ever known ... ”
104743	104754	104756	104756	Snape	147	“ I ’d like a word with you , Draco , ”
104759	104766	104768	104768	Slughorn	199	“ Oh , now , Severus , ”
104773	104784	104768	104768	Slughorn	199	“ it ’s Christmas , do n’t be too hard — ”
104785	104806	104808	104808	Snape	147	“ I ’m his Head of House , and I shall decide how hard , or otherwise , to be , ”
104811	104817	104808	104808	Snape	147	“ Follow me , Draco . ”
104842	104857	104830	104830	Harry	136	“ I ’ll be back in a bit , Luna — er — bathroom . ”
104858	104862	104863	104863	she	2107	“ All right , ”
105032	105047	105167	105167	Snape	147	“ ... can not afford mistakes , Draco , because if you are expelled — ”
105048	105062	105167	105167	Snape	147	“ I did n’t have anything to do with it , all right ? ”
105063	105091	105167	105167	Snape	147	“ I hope you are telling the truth , because it was both clumsy and foolish . Already you are suspected of having a hand in it . ”
105092	105097	105099	105099	Malfoy	159	“ Who suspects me ? ”
105102	105160	105099	105099	Malfoy	159	“ For the last time , I did n’t do it , okay ? That Bell girl must ’ve had an enemy no one knows about — do n’t look at me like that ! I know what you ’re doing , I ’m not stupid , but it wo n’t work — I can stop you ! ”
105171	105198	105167	105167	Snape	147	“ Ah ... Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency , I see . What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master , Draco ? ”
105199	105219	105099	105099	Malfoy	159	“ I ’m not trying to conceal anything from him , I just do n’t want you butting in ! ”
105256	105300	105167	105167	Snape	147	“ So that is why you have been avoiding me this term ? You have feared my interference ? You realize that , had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there , Draco — ”
105301	105313	105315	105315	Malfoy	159	“ So put me in detention ! Report me to Dumbledore ! ”
105326	105343	105323	105323	Snape	147	“ You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things . ”
105344	105358	105368	105368	his	147	“ You ’d better stop telling me to come to your office then ! ”
105359	105364	105366	105366	Snape	147	“ Listen to me , ”
105388	105414	105366	105366	Snape	147	“ I am trying to help you . I swore to your mother I would protect you . I made the Unbreakable Vow , Draco — ”
105415	105476	105368	105368	his	147	“ Looks like you ’ll have to break it , then , because I do n’t need your protection ! It ’s my job , he gave it to me and I ’m doing it , I ’ve got a plan and it ’s going to work , it ’s just taking a bit longer than I thought it would ! ”
105477	105483	105366	105366	Snape	147	“ What is your plan ? ”
105484	105492	105368	105368	his	147	“ It ’s none of your business ! ”
105493	105510	105366	105366	Snape	147	“ If you tell me what you are trying to do , I can assist you — ”
105511	105528	105368	105368	his	147	“ I ’ve got all the assistance I need , thanks , I ’m not alone ! ”
105529	105556	105366	105366	Snape	147	“ You were certainly alone tonight , which was foolish in the extreme , wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup , these are elementary mistakes — ”
105557	105576	105368	105368	his	147	“ I would ’ve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you had n’t put them in detention ! ”
105577	105583	105585	105585	Snape	147	“ Keep your voice down ! ”
105595	105631	105588	105588	Malfoy	159	“ If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. this time around , they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres — ”
105632	105638	105640	105640	Malfoy	159	“ What does it matter ? ”
105642	105674	105640	105640	Malfoy	159	“ Defense Against the Dark Arts — it ’s all just a joke , is n’t it , an act ? Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts — ”
105675	105688	105690	105690	Snape	147	“ It is an act that is crucial to success , Draco ! ”
105692	105747	105690	105690	Snape	147	“ Where do you think I would have been all these years , if I had not known how to act ? Now listen to me ! You are being incautious , wandering around at night , getting yourself caught , and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle — ”
105748	105768	105640	105640	Malfoy	159	“ They ’re not the only ones , I ’ve got other people on my side , better people ! ”
105769	105781	105690	105690	Snape	147	“ Then why not confide in me , and I can — ”
105782	105798	105640	105640	Malfoy	159	“ I know what you ’re up to ! You want to steal my glory ! ”
105809	105833	105805	105805	Snape	147	“ You are speaking like a child . I quite understand that your father ’s capture and imprisonment has upset you , but — ”
105936	105953	105915	105915	he	147	“ So Snape was offering to help him ? He was definitely offering to help him ? ”
105954	105962	105964	105964	Harry	136	“ If you ask that once more , ”
105966	105975	105964	105964	Harry	136	“ I ’m going to stick this sprout — ”
105976	105982	105984	105984	Ron	201	“ I ’m only checking ! ”
106017	106027	106029	106029	Harry	136	“ Yes , Snape was offering to help him ! ”
106031	106054	106029	106029	Harry	136	“ He said he ’d promised Malfoy ’s mother to protect him , that he ’d made an Unbreakable Oath or something — ”
106055	106060	106062	106062	Ron	201	“ An Unbreakable Vow ? ”
106067	106079	106062	106062	Ron	201	“ Nah , he ca n’t have ... Are you sure ? ”
106080	106087	106089	106089	Harry	136	“ Yes , I ’m sure , ”
106091	106099	106089	106089	Harry	136	“ Why , what does it mean ? ”
106100	106111	106062	106062	Ron	201	“ Well , you ca n’t break an Unbreakable Vow ... ”
106112	106134	106089	106089	Harry	136	“ I ’d worked that much out for myself , funnily enough . What happens if you break it , then ? ”
106135	106139	106141	106141	Ron	201	“ You die , ”
106144	106183	106185	106185	Ron	201	“ Fred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five . I nearly did too , I was holding hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us . He went mental , ”
106195	106220	106185	106185	Ron	201	“ Only time I ’ve ever seen Dad as angry as Mum . Fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since . ”
106221	106233	106192	106192	his	201	“ Yeah , well , passing over Fred ’s left buttock — ”
106234	106240	106242	106242	Fred	215	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
106252	106271	106192	106192	his	201	“ Aaah , George , look at this . They ’re using knives and everything . Bless them . ”
106272	106286	106288	106288	Ron	201	“ I ’ll be seventeen in two and a bit months ’ time , ”
106291	106304	106288	106288	Ron	201	“ and then I ’ll be able to do it by magic ! ”
106305	106309	106311	106311	George	216	“ But meanwhile , ”
106327	106346	106311	106311	George	216	“ we can enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a — whoops - a - daisy ! ”
106347	106354	106356	106356	Ron	201	“ You made me do that ! ”
106364	106373	106356	106356	Ron	201	“ You wait , when I ’m seventeen — ”
106374	106389	106391	106391	Fred	215	“ I ’m sure you ’ll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills , ”
106393	106403	106405	106405	George	216	“ And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills , Ronald , ”
106407	106432	106405	106405	George	216	“ what is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young lady called — unless our information is faulty — Lavender Brown ? ”
106452	106458	106445	106445	he	201	“ Mind your own business . ”
106459	106465	106467	106467	Fred	215	“ What a snappy retort , ”
106469	106495	106467	106467	Fred	215	“ I really do n’t know how you think of them . No , what we wanted to know was ... how did it happen ? ”
106496	106501	106445	106445	he	201	“ What d’you mean ? ”
106502	106511	106467	106467	Fred	215	“ Did she have an accident or something ? ”
106512	106515	106445	106445	he	201	“ What ? ”
106516	106532	106467	106467	Fred	215	“ Well , how did she sustain such extensive brain damage ? Careful , now ! ”
106567	106570	106571	106571	she	202	“ Ron ! ”
106575	106588	106571	106571	she	202	“ Do n’t you ever let me see you throwing knives again ! ”
106589	106594	106596	106596	Ron	201	“ I wo n’t , ”
106598	106603	106604	106604	he	201	“ let you see , ”
106619	106647	106571	106571	she	202	“ Fred , George , I ’m sorry , dears , but Remus is arriving tonight , so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two . ”
106648	106652	106654	106654	George	216	“ No problem , ”
106656	106683	106571	106571	she	202	“ Then , as Charlie is n’t coming home , that just leaves Harry and Ron in the attic , and if Fleur shares with Ginny — ”
106684	106693	106695	106695	Fred	215	“ — that ’ll make Ginny ’s Christmas — ”
106697	106714	106716	106717	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ — everyone should be comfortable . Well , they ’ll have a bed , anyway , ”
106723	106734	106736	106736	Fred	215	“ Percy definitely not showing his ugly face , then ? ”
106746	106760	106743	106743	she	202	“ No , he ’s busy , I expect , at the Ministry . ”
106761	106771	106773	106773	Fred	215	“ Or he ’s the world ’s biggest prat , ”
106782	106799	106776	106777	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ One of the two . Well , let ’s get going , then , George . ”
106800	106808	106810	106810	Ron	201	“ What are you two up to ? ”
106812	106836	106810	106810	Ron	201	“ Ca n’t you help us with these sprouts ? You could just use your wand and then we ’ll be free too ! ”
106837	106849	106851	106851	Fred	215	“ No , I do n’t think we can do that , ”
106854	106882	106851	106851	Fred	215	“ It ’s very character - building stuff , learning to peel sprouts without magic , makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs — ”
106883	106896	106898	106898	George	216	“ — and if you want people to help you , Ron , ”
106907	106953	106898	106898	George	216	“ I would n’t chuck knives at them . Just a little hint . We ’re off to the village , there ’s a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous ... almost like real magic ... ”
106954	106957	106959	106959	Ron	201	“ Gits , ”
106973	106989	106959	106959	Ron	201	“ Would ’ve only taken them ten seconds and then we could ’ve gone too . ”
106990	106995	106997	106997	Harry	136	“ I could n’t , ”
106999	107014	106997	106997	Harry	136	“ I promised Dumbledore I would n’t wander off while I ’m staying here . ”
107015	107019	107021	107021	Ron	201	“ Oh yeah , ”
107033	107051	107023	107023	He	201	“ Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other ? ”
107052	107055	107057	107057	Harry	136	“ Yep , ”
107059	107092	107057	107057	Harry	136	“ I ’m going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it , and Dumbledore ’s top of the list . I might have another word with your dad too . ”
107093	107107	106997	106997	Harry	136	“ Pity you did n’t hear what Malfoy ’s actually doing , though . ”
107108	107131	107057	107057	Harry	136	“ I could n’t have done , could I ? That was the whole point , he was refusing to tell Snape . ”
107145	107190	107142	107142	Ron	201	“ ’ Course , you know what they ’ll all say ? Dad and Dumbledore and all of them ? They ’ll say Snape is n’t really trying to help Malfoy , he was just trying to find out what Malfoy ’s up to . ”
107191	107198	107200	107200	Harry	136	“ They did n’t hear him , ”
107203	107216	107200	107200	Harry	136	“ No one ’s that good an actor , not even Snape . ”
107217	107227	107229	107229	Ron	201	“ Yeah ... I ’m just saying , though , ”
107239	107248	107231	107231	Harry	136	“ You think I ’m right , though ? ”
107249	107255	107257	107257	Ron	201	“ Yeah , I do ! ”
107260	107281	107257	107257	Ron	201	“ Seriously , I do ! But they ’re all convinced Snape ’s in the Order , are n’t they ? ”
107504	107510	107512	107512	he	136	“ I told you so , ”
107749	107759	107726	107726	her	202	“ A Cauldron Full of Hot , Strong Love , ”
107825	107835	107837	107838	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ We danced to this when we were eighteen ! ”
107847	107854	107841	107841	her	202	“ Do you remember , Arthur ? ”
107855	107858	107860	107861	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Mphf ? ”
107875	107882	107860	107861	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Oh yes ... marvelous tune ... ”
107906	107911	107912	107912	he	204	“ Sorry about this , ”
107928	107933	107922	107922	Celestina	411	“ Be over soon . ”
107934	107938	107940	107940	Harry	136	“ No problem , ”
107944	107953	107940	107940	Harry	136	“ Has it been busy at the Ministry ? ”
107954	107957	107959	107960	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Very , ”
107962	108008	108009	108009	he	204	“ I would n’t mind if we were getting anywhere , but of the three arrests we ’ve made in the last couple of months , I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater — only do n’t repeat that , Harry , ”
108022	108034	108036	108036	Harry	136	“ They ’re not still holding Stan Shunpike , are they ? ”
108038	108044	108046	108047	Mr. Weasley	204	“ I ’m afraid so , ”
108049	108125	108046	108047	Mr. Weasley	204	“ I know Dumbledore ’s tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan ... I mean , anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he ’s about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma ... but the top levels want to look as though they ’re making some progress , and ‘ three arrests ’ sounds better than ‘ three mistaken arrests and releases ’ ... but again , this is all top secret ... ”
108126	108133	108135	108135	Harry	136	“ I wo n’t say anything , ”
108167	108177	108161	108162	Celestina Warbeck	411	“ You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me . ”
108178	108199	108046	108047	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Mr. Weasley , you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school ? ”
108200	108206	108208	108209	Mr. Weasley	204	“ I checked , Harry , ”
108213	108239	108208	108209	Mr. Weasley	204	“ I went and searched the Malfoys ’ house . There was nothing , either broken or whole , that should n’t have been there . ”
108240	108267	108269	108269	he	136	“ Yeah , I know , I saw in the Prophet that you ’d looked ... but this is something different ... Well , something more ... ”
108317	108326	108328	108329	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Has it occurred to you , Harry , ”
108331	108339	108328	108329	Mr. Weasley	204	“ that Snape was simply pretending — ? ”
108340	108358	108360	108360	Harry	136	“ Pretending to offer help , so that he could find out what Malfoy ’s up to ? ”
108363	108379	108360	108360	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I thought you ’d say that . But how do we know ? ”
108380	108389	108391	108391	Lupin	210	“ It is n’t our business to know , ”
108410	108433	108407	108408	Mr. Weasley	204	“ It ’s Dumbledore ’s business . Dumbledore trusts Severus , and that ought to be good enough for all of us . ”
108434	108437	108439	108439	Harry	136	“ But , ”
108441	108453	108439	108439	Harry	136	“ just say — just say Dumbledore ’s wrong about Snape — ”
108454	108485	108407	108408	Mr. Weasley	204	“ People have said it , many times . It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore ’s judgment . I do ; therefore , I trust Severus . ”
108486	108493	108495	108495	Harry	136	“ But Dumbledore can make mistakes , ”
108497	108505	108507	108507	he	136	“ He says it himself . And you ”
108515	108522	108507	108507	he	136	“ do you honestly like Snape ? ”
108523	108531	108533	108533	Lupin	210	“ I neither like nor dislike Severus , ”
108535	108546	108547	108547	he	210	“ No , Harry , I am speaking the truth , ”
108557	108630	108551	108551	Harry	136	“ We shall never be bosom friends , perhaps ; after all that happened between James and Sirius and Severus , there is too much bitterness there . But I do not forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts , Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month , made it perfectly , so that I did not have to suffer as I usually do at the full moon . ”
108631	108652	108654	108654	Harry	136	“ But he ‘ accidentally ’ let it slip that you ’re a werewolf , so you had to leave ! ”
108660	108703	108657	108657	Lupin	210	“ The news would have leaked out anyway . We both know he wanted my job , but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion . He kept me healthy . I must be grateful . ”
108704	108719	108721	108721	Harry	136	“ Maybe he did n’t dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore watching him ! ”
108723	108733	108735	108735	Lupin	210	“ You are determined to hate him , Harry , ”
108741	108818	108735	108735	Lupin	210	“ And I understand ; with James as your father , with Sirius as your godfather , you have inherited an old prejudice . By all means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me , but do not expect him to share your view of the matter ; do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him . It might have been on Dumbledore ’s orders that Severus questioned Draco . ”
108849	108854	108856	108856	Fleur	220	“ Eez eet over ? ”
108859	108868	108856	108856	Fleur	220	“ Thank goodness , what an ’ orrible — ”
108869	108878	108880	108881	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Shall we have a nightcap , then ? ”
108889	108894	108880	108881	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Who wants eggnog ? ”
108895	108904	108905	108905	Harry	136	“ What have you been up to lately ? ”
108928	108936	108938	108938	Lupin	210	“ Oh , I ’ve been underground , ”
108940	108969	108938	108938	Lupin	210	“ Almost literally . That ’s why I have n’t been able to write , Harry ; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway . ”
108970	108976	109032	109032	He	210	“ What do you mean ? ”
108977	108989	108991	108991	Lupin	210	“ I ’ve been living among my fellows , my equals , ”
108993	108996	108997	108997	he	210	“ Werewolves , ”
109007	109031	108997	108997	he	210	“ Nearly all of them are on Voldemort ’s side . Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was ... ready - made . ”
109053	109119	109044	109044	he	210	“ I am not complaining ; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I ? However , it has been difficult gaining their trust . I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards , you see , whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins , stealing — and sometimes killing — to eat . ”
109120	109127	109049	109049	he	210	“ How come they like Voldemort ? ”
109128	109144	109146	109146	Lupin	210	“ They think that , under his rule , they will have a better life , ”
109148	109160	109146	109146	Lupin	210	“ And it is hard to argue with Greyback out there ... ”
109161	109166	109049	109049	he	210	“ Who ’s Greyback ? ”
109167	109175	109146	109146	Lupin	210	“ You have n’t heard of him ? ”
109185	109290	109176	109176	Lupin	210	“ Fenrir Greyback is , perhaps , the most savage werewolf alive today . He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many people as possible ; he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards . Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services . Greyback specializes in children ... Bite them young , he says , and raise them away from their parents , raise them to hate normal wizards . Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people ’s sons and daughters ; it is a threat that usually produces good results . ”
109297	109305	109291	109291	Lupin	210	“ It was Greyback who bit me . ”
109306	109309	109311	109311	Harry	136	“ What ? ”
109315	109327	109311	109311	Harry	136	“ When — when you were a kid , you mean ? ”
109328	109463	109291	109291	Lupin	210	“ Yes . My father had offended him . I did not know , for a very long time , the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me ; I even felt pity for him , thinking that he had had no control , knowing by then how it felt to transform . But Greyback is not like that . At the full moon , he positions himself close to victims , ensuring that he is near enough to strike . He plans it all . And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves . I can not pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greyback ’s insistence that we werewolves deserve blood , that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people . ”
109464	109470	109472	109472	Harry	136	“ But you are normal ! ”
109475	109485	109472	109472	Harry	136	“ You ’ve just got a — a problem — ”
109491	109527	109486	109486	Lupin	210	“ Sometimes you remind me a lot of James . He called it my ‘ furry little problem ’ in company . Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit . ”
109580	109594	109627	109627	Lupin	210	“ Have you ever heard of someone called the Half - Blood Prince ? ”
109595	109602	109627	109627	Lupin	210	“ The Half - Blood what ? ”
109603	109606	109608	109608	Harry	136	“ Prince , ”
109618	109625	109627	109627	Lupin	210	“ There are no Wizarding princes , ”
109632	109657	109627	109627	Lupin	210	“ Is this a title you ’re thinking of adopting ? I should have thought being ‘ the Chosen One ’ would be enough . ”
109658	109667	109669	109669	Harry	136	“ It ’s nothing to do with me ! ”
109672	109712	109669	109669	Harry	136	“ The Half - Blood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts , I ’ve got his old Potions book . He wrote spells all over it , spells he invented . One of them was Levicorpus — ”
109713	109728	109730	109730	Lupin	210	“ Oh , that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts , ”
109733	109758	109730	109730	Lupin	210	“ There were a few months in my fifth year when you could n’t move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle . ”
109759	109765	109767	109767	Harry	136	“ My dad used it , ”
109769	109783	109767	109767	Harry	136	“ I saw him in the Pensieve , he used it on Snape . ”
109823	109826	109827	109827	he	210	“ Yes , ”
109830	109857	109827	109827	he	210	“ but he was n’t the only one . As I say , it was very popular ... You know how these spells come and go ... ”
109858	109872	109873	109873	Harry	136	“ But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school , ”
109876	109880	109882	109882	Lupin	210	“ Not necessarily , ”
109884	109896	109882	109882	Lupin	210	“ Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else . ”
109908	109932	109897	109897	He	210	“ James was a pureblood , Harry , and I promise you , he never asked us to call him ‘ Prince . ’ ”
109939	109949	109936	109936	Harry	136	“ And it was n’t Sirius ? Or you ? ”
109950	109954	109897	109897	He	210	“ Definitely not . ”
109955	109958	109959	109959	Harry	136	“ Oh . ”
109965	109987	109959	109959	Harry	136	“ I just thought — well , he ’s helped me out a lot in Potions classes , the Prince has . ”
109988	109997	109897	109897	He	210	“ How old is this book , Harry ? ”
109998	110007	109959	109959	Harry	136	“ I dunno , I ’ve never checked . ”
110008	110027	110029	110029	Lupin	210	“ Well , perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts , ”
110041	110051	109959	109959	Harry	136	“ A Cauldron Full of Hot , Strong Love , ”
110234	110242	110231	110232	bitten children	2150	“ She ’s got to be joking ... ”
110304	110309	110311	110311	Harry	136	“ What ’s that ? ”
110313	110319	110321	110321	Ron	201	“ It ’s from Lavender , ”
110326	110336	110321	110321	Ron	201	“ She ca n’t honestly think I ’d wear ... ”
110364	110367	110368	110368	he	136	“ Nice , ”
110371	110386	110368	110368	he	136	“ Classy . You should definitely wear it in front of Fred and George . ”
110387	110393	110395	110395	Ron	201	“ If you tell them , ”
110407	110415	110395	110395	Ron	201	“ I — I — I ’ll — ”
110416	110421	110423	110423	Harry	136	“ Stutter at me ? ”
110427	110434	110423	110423	Harry	136	“ Come on , would I ? ”
110435	110449	110450	110450	Ron	201	“ How could she think I ’d like something like that , though ? ”
110460	110466	110468	110468	Harry	136	“ Well , think back , ”
110470	110497	110468	110468	Harry	136	“ Have you ever let it slip that you ’d like to go out in public with the words ‘ My Sweetheart ’ round your neck ? ”
110498	110508	110510	110510	Ron	201	“ Well ... we do n’t really talk much , ”
110512	110517	110510	110510	Ron	201	“ It ’s mainly ... ”
110518	110521	110523	110523	Harry	136	“ Snogging , ”
110525	110530	110532	110532	Ron	201	“ Well , yeah , ”
110542	110551	110534	110534	He	201	“ Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen ? ”
110552	110556	110558	110558	Harry	136	“ I dunno , ”
110560	110579	110558	110558	Harry	136	“ They were at Slughorn ’s party together , but I do n’t think it went that well . ”
110655	110664	110665	110665	he	136	“ D’you reckon this is safe to open ? ”
110668	110686	110688	110688	Ron	201	“ Ca n’t be anything dangerous , all our mail ’s still being searched at the Ministry , ”
110698	110719	110721	110721	Harry	136	“ I did n’t think of giving Kreacher anything . Do people usually give their house - elves Christmas presents ? ”
110728	110732	110734	110734	Ron	201	“ Hermione would , ”
110736	110752	110734	110734	Ron	201	“ But let ’s wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty . ”
110780	110783	110785	110785	Ron	201	“ Nice , ”
110791	110795	110785	110785	Ron	201	“ Very thoughtful . ”
110796	110806	110808	110808	Harry	136	“ I ’d rather have them than that necklace , ”
110882	110896	110853	110853	herself	202	“ Fred and George gave them to me ! Are n’t they beautiful ? ”
110897	110919	110921	110921	George	216	“ Well , we find we appreciate you more and more , Mum , now we ’re washing our own socks , ”
110928	110933	110921	110921	George	216	“ Parsnips , Remus ? ”
110934	110946	110948	110948	Ginny	218	“ Harry , you ’ve got a maggot in your hair , ”
110977	110983	110985	110985	Fleur	220	“ ’ Ow ’ orrible , ”
110993	111000	111002	111002	Ron	201	“ Yes , is n’t it ? ”
111004	111009	111002	111002	Ron	201	“ Gravy , Fleur ? ”
111043	111052	111054	111054	Fleur	220	“ You are as bad as zat Tonks , ”
111067	111073	111059	111059	she	220	“ She is always knocking — ”
111074	111084	111086	111087	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I invited dear Tonks to come along today , ”
111101	111117	111086	111087	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ But she would n’t come . Have you spoken to her lately , Remus ? ”
111118	111132	111134	111134	Lupin	210	“ No , I have n’t been in contact with anybody very much , ”
111136	111152	111134	111134	Lupin	210	“ But Tonks has got her own family to go to , has n’t she ? ”
111153	111156	111158	111159	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Hmmm , ”
111161	111178	111158	111159	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Maybe . I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone , actually . ”
111273	111282	111283	111283	he	136	“ Tonks ’s Patronus has changed its form , ”
111287	111307	111283	111283	he	136	“ Snape said so anyway . I did n’t know that could happen . Why would your Patronus change ? ”
111321	111332	111308	111308	Lupin	210	“ Sometimes ... a great shock ... an emotional upheaval ... ”
111333	111344	111346	111346	Harry	136	“ It looked big , and it had four legs , ”
111358	111367	111346	111346	Harry	136	“ Hey ... it could n’t be — ? ”
111368	111371	111373	111374	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Arthur ! ”
111401	111408	111392	111392	she	202	“ Arthur — it ’s Percy ! ”
111409	111412	111377	111377	She	202	“ What ? ”
111466	111478	111458	111458	He	227	“ Arthur , he ’s — he ’s with the Minister ! ”
111560	111566	111555	111555	Percy	227	“ Merry Christmas , Mother . ”
111567	111572	111574	111575	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Oh , Percy ! ”
111606	111613	111614	111614	he	140	“ You must forgive this intrusion , ”
111631	111657	111628	111628	her	202	“ Percy and I were in the vicinity — working , you know — and he could n’t resist dropping in and seeing you all . ”
111710	111721	111727	111727	her	202	“ Please , come in , sit down , Minister ! ”
111730	111743	111723	111724	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Have a little purkey , or some tooding ... I mean — ”
111744	111753	111755	111755	Scrimgeour	140	“ No , no , my dear Molly , ”
111773	111799	111760	111760	he	136	“ I do n’t want to intrude , would n’t be here at all if Percy had n’t wanted to see you all so badly ... ”
111800	111805	111807	111808	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Oh , Perce ! ”
111817	111889	111760	111760	he	136	“ ... We ’ve only looked in for five minutes , so I ’ll have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy . No , no , I assure you I do n’t want to butt in ! Well , if anybody cared to show me your charming garden ... Ah , that young man ’s finished , why does n’t he take a stroll with me ? ”
111950	111956	111958	111958	Harry	136	“ Yeah , all right , ”
112011	112016	112017	112017	he	136	“ It ’s fine , ”
112034	112037	112038	112038	he	136	“ Fine , ”
112050	112053	112055	112055	Scrimgeour	140	“ Wonderful ! ”
112070	112094	112055	112055	Scrimgeour	140	“ We ’ll just take a turn around the garden , and Percy and I ’ll be off . Carry on , everyone ! ”
112149	112152	112154	112154	Scrimgeour	140	“ Charming , ”
112173	112176	112154	112154	Scrimgeour	140	“ Charming . ”
112190	112203	112205	112205	Scrimgeour	140	“ I ’ve wanted to meet you for a very long time , ”
112212	112218	112205	112205	Scrimgeour	140	“ Did you know that ? ”
112219	112222	112224	112224	Harry	136	“ No , ”
112227	112246	112248	112248	Scrimgeour	140	“ Oh yes , for a very long time . But Dumbledore has been very protective of you , ”
112250	112272	112248	112248	Scrimgeour	140	“ Natural , of course , natural , after what you ’ve been through ... Especially what happened at the Ministry ... ”
112292	112324	112288	112288	he	136	“ I have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office , but Dumbledore has — most understandably , as I say — prevented this . ”
112333	112341	112343	112343	Scrimgeour	140	“ The rumors that have flown around ! ”
112345	112376	112343	112343	Scrimgeour	140	“ Well , of course , we both know how these stories get distorted ... all these whispers of a prophecy ... of you being ‘ the Chosen One ’ ... ”
112393	112406	112384	112384	Harry	136	“ ... I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you ? ”
112473	112481	112461	112461	he	136	“ Yeah , we ’ve discussed it . ”
112482	112489	112491	112491	Scrimgeour	140	“ Have you , have you ... ”
112533	112543	112511	112511	he	136	“ And what has Dumbledore told you , Harry ? ”
112544	112553	112555	112555	Harry	136	“ Sorry , but that ’s between us , ”
112582	112628	112579	112579	he	140	“ Oh , of course , if it ’s a question of confidences , I would n’t want you to divulge ... no , no ... and in any case , does it really matter whether you are ‘ the Chosen One ’ or not ? ”
112643	112655	112629	112629	Harry	136	“ I do n’t really know what you mean , Minister . ”
112656	112669	112671	112671	Scrimgeour	140	“ Well , of course , to you it will matter enormously , ”
112676	112703	112671	112671	Scrimgeour	140	“ But to the Wizarding community at large ... it ’s all perception , is n’t it ? It ’s what people believe that ’s important . ”
112754	112768	112770	112770	Scrimgeour	140	“ People believe you are ‘ the Chosen One , ’ you see , ”
112772	112817	112818	112818	he	140	“ They think you quite the hero — which , of course , you are , Harry , chosen or not ! How many times have you faced He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named now ? Well , anyway , ”
112828	112924	112818	112818	he	140	“ the point is , you are a symbol of hope for many , Harry . The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able , who might even be destined , to destroy He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named — well , naturally , it gives people a lift . And I ca n’t help but feel that , once you realize this , you might consider it , well , almost a duty , to stand alongside the Ministry , and give everyone a boost . ”
112972	112988	112962	112962	Scrimgeour	140	“ Funny little chaps , are n’t they ? But what say you , Harry ? ”
112989	112999	113001	113001	Harry	136	“ I do n’t exactly understand what you want , ”
113004	113017	113001	113001	Harry	136	“ ‘ Stand alongside the Ministry ’ ... What does that mean ? ”
113018	113032	113034	113034	Scrimgeour	140	“ Oh , well , nothing at all onerous , I assure you , ”
113036	113118	113034	113034	Scrimgeour	140	“ If you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry from time to time , for instance , that would give the right impression . And of course , while you were there , you would have ample opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards , my successor as Head of the Auror office . Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an Auror . Well , that could be arranged very easily ... ”
113142	113146	113147	113147	he	140	“ So basically , ”
113161	113177	113147	113147	he	140	“ you ’d like to give the impression that I ’m working for the Ministry ? ”
113178	113194	113196	113196	Scrimgeour	140	“ It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved , Harry , ”
113208	113234	113196	113196	Scrimgeour	140	“ ‘ The Chosen One , ’ you know ... It ’s all about giving people hope , the feeling that exciting things are happening ... ”
113235	113248	113250	113250	Harry	136	“ But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry , ”
113260	113277	113250	113250	Harry	136	“ wo n’t that seem as though I approve of what the Ministry ’s up to ? ”
113278	113281	113283	113283	Scrimgeour	140	“ Well , ”
113288	113301	113283	113283	Scrimgeour	140	“ well , yes , that ’s partly why we ’d like — ”
113302	113313	113315	113315	Harry	136	“ No , I do n’t think that ’ll work , ”
113318	113343	113315	113315	Harry	136	“ You see , I do n’t like some of the things the Ministry ’s doing . Locking up Stan Shunpike , for instance . ”
113357	113366	113367	113367	he	140	“ I would not expect you to understand , ”
113388	113408	113371	113371	he	140	“ These are dangerous times , and certain measures need to be taken . You are sixteen years old — ”
113409	113430	113432	113432	Harry	136	“ Dumbledore ’s a lot older than sixteen , and he does n’t think Stan should be in Azkaban either , ”
113434	113452	113432	113432	Harry	136	“ You ’re making Stan a scapegoat , just like you want to make me a mascot . ”
113473	113493	113463	113464	Finally Scrimgeour	140	“ I see . You prefer — like your hero , Dumbledore — to disassociate yourself from the Ministry ? ”
113494	113503	113505	113505	Harry	136	“ I do n’t want to be used , ”
113507	113522	113463	113464	Finally Scrimgeour	140	“ Some would say it ’s your duty to be used by the Ministry ! ”
113523	113549	113551	113551	Harry	136	“ Yeah , and others might say it ’s your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison , ”
113558	113626	113551	113551	Harry	136	“ You ’re doing what Barty Crouch did . You never get it right , you people , do you ? Either we ’ve got Fudge , pretending everything ’s lovely while people get murdered right under his nose , or we ’ve got you , chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you ’ve got ‘ the Chosen One ’ working for you ! ”
113627	113638	113640	113640	Scrimgeour	140	“ So you ’re not ‘ the Chosen One ’ ? ”
113642	113654	113656	113656	Harry	136	“ I thought you said it did n’t matter either way ? ”
113663	113669	113656	113656	Harry	136	“ Not to you anyway . ”
113670	113678	113680	113680	Scrimgeour	140	“ I should n’t have said that , ”
113683	113688	113680	113680	Scrimgeour	140	“ It was tactless — ”
113689	113696	113698	113698	Harry	136	“ No , it was honest , ”
113700	113748	113698	113698	Harry	136	“ One of the only honest things you ’ve said to me . You do n’t care whether I live or die , but you do care that I help you convince everyone you ’re winning the war against Voldemort . I have n’t forgotten , Minister ... ”
113789	113822	113751	113751	his	136	“ I do n’t remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was back . The Ministry was n’t so keen to be pals last year . ”
113863	113870	113872	113872	Scrimgeour	140	“ What is Dumbledore up to ? ”
113875	113887	113872	113872	Scrimgeour	140	“ Where does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts ? ”
113888	113892	113894	113894	Harry	136	“ No idea , ”
113896	113907	113909	113909	Scrimgeour	140	“ And you would n’t tell me if you knew , ”
113911	113915	113909	113909	Scrimgeour	140	“ would you ? ”
113916	113923	113925	113925	Harry	136	“ No , I would n’t , ”
113927	113947	113872	113872	Scrimgeour	140	“ Well , then , I shall have to see whether I ca n’t find out by other means . ”
113948	113953	113955	113955	Harry	136	“ You can try , ”
113958	114012	113955	113955	Harry	136	“ But you seem cleverer than Fudge , so I ’d have thought you ’d have learned from his mistakes . He tried interfering at Hogwarts . You might have noticed he ’s not Minister anymore , but Dumbledore ’s still headmaster . I ’d leave Dumbledore alone , if I were you . ”
114019	114038	114040	114040	Scrimgeour	140	“ Well , it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you , ”
114054	114068	114042	114042	his	140	“ Dumbledore ’s man through and through , are n’t you , Potter ? ”
114069	114075	114077	114077	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I am , ”
114079	114086	114077	114077	Harry	136	“ Glad we straightened that out . ”
114246	114253	114255	114255	Ginny	218	“ Do n’t cry , Mum , ”
114270	114275	114263	114264	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ It ’s okay ... ”
114276	114285	114287	114287	Ron	201	“ Yeah , do n’t worry about us , ”
114302	114323	114287	114287	Ron	201	“ or about Percy . He ’s such a prat , it ’s not really a loss , is it ? ”
114338	114352	114331	114331	she	202	“ Promise me you ’ll look after yourself ... Stay out of trouble ... ”
114353	114361	114363	114363	Harry	136	“ I always do , Mrs. Weasley , ”
114365	114376	114363	114363	Harry	136	“ I like a quiet life , you know me . ”
114386	114396	114377	114377	She	202	“ Be good , then , all of you ... ”
114405	114408	114397	114397	Harry	136	“ Hogwarts ! ”
114492	114508	114477	114477	She	202	“ Evening , Potter . Try not to get too much ash on the carpet . ”
114509	114514	114477	114477	She	202	“ No , Professor . ”
114597	114600	114602	114602	Ron	201	“ Baubles , ”
114626	114629	114630	114630	she	1806	“ No , ”
114633	114642	114683	114683	Hermione	179	“ What d’you mean , ‘ no ’ ? ”
114643	114650	114651	114651	she	1806	“ There is a new password , ”
114654	114661	114651	114651	she	1806	“ And please do n’t shout . ”
114662	114676	114683	114683	Hermione	179	“ But we ’ve been away , how ’re we supposed to — ? ”
114677	114682	114651	114651	she	1806	“ Harry ! Ginny ! ”
114703	114728	114729	114729	she	179	“ I got back a couple of hours ago , I ’ve just been down to visit Hagrid and Buck — I mean Witherwings , ”
114733	114741	114729	114729	she	179	“ Did you have a good Christmas ? ”
114742	114745	114747	114747	Ron	201	“ Yeah , ”
114751	114758	114747	114747	Ron	201	“ pretty eventful , Rufus Scrim — ”
114759	114769	114771	114771	Hermione	179	“ I ’ve got something for you , Harry , ”
114787	114797	114785	114785	him	201	“ Oh , hang on — password . Abstinence . ”
114798	114801	114803	114805	the Fat Lady	1806	“ Precisely , ”
114820	114827	114829	114829	Harry	136	“ What ’s up with her ? ”
114831	114838	114846	114846	she	179	“ Overindulged over Christmas , apparently , ”
114856	114883	114846	114846	she	179	“ She and her friend Violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monks down by the Charms corridor . Anyway ... ”
114907	114910	114912	114912	Harry	136	“ Great , ”
114933	114950	114925	114925	Dumbledore	138	“ I ’ve got loads to tell him — and you . Let ’s sit down — ”
114961	114966	114968	114969	Lavender Brown	306	“ Won - Won ! ”
114995	115007	114987	114987	Hermione	179	“ There ’s a table over here ... Coming , Ginny ? ”
115008	115020	115022	115022	Ginny	218	“ No , thanks , I said I ’d meet Dean , ”
115060	115067	115051	115051	Harry	136	“ So how was your Christmas ? ”
115068	115073	115074	115074	she	179	“ Oh , fine , ”
115077	115090	115074	115074	she	179	“ Nothing special . How was it at Won - Won ’s ? ”
115091	115100	115102	115102	Harry	136	“ I ’ll tell you in a minute , ”
115104	115114	115102	115102	Harry	136	“ Look , Hermione , ca n’t you — ? ”
115115	115122	115123	115123	she	179	“ No , I ca n’t , ”
115127	115134	115123	115123	she	179	“ So do n’t even ask . ”
115135	115146	115102	115102	Harry	136	“ I thought maybe , you know , over Christmas — ”
115147	115184	115123	115123	she	179	“ It was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of five - hundred - year - old wine , Harry , not me . So what was this important news you wanted to tell me ? ”
115231	115238	115220	115220	Hermione	179	“ Do n’t you think — ? ”
115239	115261	115269	115269	Hermione	179	“ — he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he ’s doing ? ”
115262	115267	115269	115269	Hermione	179	“ Well , yes , ”
115271	115280	115281	115281	Harry	136	“ Ron ’s dad and Lupin think so , ”
115285	115301	115281	115281	Harry	136	“ But this definitely proves Malfoy ’s planning something , you ca n’t deny that . ”
115302	115309	115310	115310	she	179	“ No , I ca n’t , ”
115314	115329	115281	115281	Harry	136	“ And he ’s acting on Voldemort ’s orders , just like I said ! ”
115330	115343	115281	115281	Harry	136	“ Hmm ... did either of them actually mention Voldemort ’s name ? ”
115351	115372	115344	115344	Harry	136	“ I ’m not sure ... Snape definitely said ‘ your master , ’ and who else would that be ? ”
115373	115379	115381	115381	Hermione	179	“ I do n’t know , ”
115387	115392	115381	115381	Hermione	179	“ Maybe his father ? ”
115411	115416	115407	115407	Lavender	306	“ How ’s Lupin ? ”
115417	115421	115423	115423	Harry	136	“ Not great , ”
115444	115453	115426	115426	he	136	“ Have you heard of this Fenrir Greyback ? ”
115454	115460	115462	115462	Hermione	179	“ Yes , I have ! ”
115467	115475	115462	115462	Hermione	179	“ And so have you , Harry ! ”
115476	115491	115426	115426	he	136	“ When , History of Magic ? You know full well I never listened ... ”
115492	115508	115510	115510	Hermione	179	“ No , no , not History of Magic — Malfoy threatened Borgin with him ! ”
115512	115545	115510	115510	Hermione	179	“ Back in Knockturn Alley , do n’t you remember ? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend and that he ’d be checking up on Borgin ’s progress ! ”
115551	115580	115546	115546	Harry	136	“ I forgot ! But this proves Malfoy ’s a Death Eater , how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling him what to do ? ”
115581	115587	115589	115589	Hermione	179	“ It is pretty suspicious , ”
115591	115594	115589	115589	Hermione	179	“ Unless ... ”
115595	115601	115603	115603	Harry	136	“ Oh , come on , ”
115607	115616	115603	115603	Harry	136	“ you ca n’t get round this one ! ”
115617	115630	115546	115546	Harry	136	“ Well ... there is the possibility it was an empty threat . ”
115631	115639	115641	115641	Harry	136	“ You ’re unbelievable , you are , ”
115647	115682	115644	115644	his	136	“ We ’ll see who ’s right ... You ’ll be eating your words , Hermione , just like the Ministry . Oh yeah , I had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour as well ... ”
115816	115824	115807	115807	her	179	“ Guess who , Won - Won ? ”
115890	115895	115897	115897	Ron	201	“ So — Apparition , ”
115916	115924	115906	115906	Harry	136	“ Should be a laugh , eh ? ”
115925	115929	115931	115931	Harry	136	“ I dunno , ”
115933	115959	115931	115931	Harry	136	“ Maybe it ’s better when you do it yourself , I did n’t enjoy it much when Dumbledore took me along for the ride . ”
115960	115978	115980	115980	Ron	201	“ I forgot you ’d already done it ... I ’d better pass my test first time , ”
115985	115991	115980	115980	Ron	201	“ Fred and George did . ”
115992	116002	115931	115931	Harry	136	“ Charlie failed , though , did n’t he ? ”
116003	116012	116014	116014	Ron	201	“ Yeah , but Charlie ’s bigger than me ”
116029	116048	116014	116014	Ron	201	“ so Fred and George did n’t go on about it much ... not to his face anyway ... ”
116049	116058	115931	115931	Harry	136	“ When can we take the actual test ? ”
116059	116073	116014	116014	Ron	201	“ Soon as we ’re seventeen . That ’s only March for me ! ”
116074	116093	115931	115931	Harry	136	“ Yeah , but you would n’t be able to Apparate in here , not in the castle ... ”
116094	116112	116014	116014	Ron	201	“ Not the point , is it ? Everyone would know I could Apparate if I wanted . ”
116157	116168	116169	116169	Seamus	296	“ How cool will it be when we can just — ”
116177	116205	116169	116169	Seamus	296	“ Me cousin Fergus does it just to annoy me , you wait till I can do it back ... He ’ll never have another peaceful moment ... ”
116263	116269	116270	116270	Ron	201	“ Harry ’s already Apparated , ”
116295	116308	116288	116288	his	424	“ I am a wizard , not a baboon brandishing a stick . ”
116309	116327	116288	116288	his	424	“ Dum — er — someone took him . Side - Along - Apparition , you know . ”
116328	116331	116333	116333	Seamus	296	“ Whoa ! ”
116567	116580	116564	116564	Dumbledore	138	“ I hear that you met the Minister of Magic over Christmas ? ”
116581	116584	116586	116586	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
116588	116597	116586	116586	Harry	136	“ He ’s not very happy with me . ”
116598	116601	116603	116603	Dumbledore	138	“ No , ”
116605	116631	116603	116603	Dumbledore	138	“ He is not very happy with me either . We must try not to sink beneath our anguish , Harry , but battle on . ”
116635	116653	116632	116632	Harry	136	“ He wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that the Ministry ’s doing a wonderful job . ”
116657	116702	116654	116654	Dumbledore	138	“ It was Fudge ’s idea originally , you know . During his last days in office , when he was trying desperately to cling to his post , he sought a meeting with you , hoping that you would give him your support — ”
116703	116711	116713	116713	Harry	136	“ After everything Fudge did last year ? ”
116716	116720	116713	116713	Harry	136	“ After Umbridge ? ”
116721	116762	116654	116654	Dumbledore	138	“ I told Cornelius there was no chance of it , but the idea did not die when he left office . Within hours of Scrimgeour ’s appointment we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you — ”
116763	116771	116772	116772	Harry	136	“ So that ’s why you argued ! ”
116776	116784	116772	116772	Harry	136	“ It was in the Daily Prophet . ”
116785	116796	116798	116798	Dumbledore	138	“ The Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally , ”
116800	116828	116798	116798	Dumbledore	138	“ if only accidentally . Yes , that was why we argued . Well , it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last . ”
116829	116844	116772	116772	Harry	136	“ He accused me of being ‘ Dumbledore ’s man through and through . ’ ”
116845	116852	116798	116798	Dumbledore	138	“ How very rude of him . ”
116853	116860	116772	116772	Harry	136	“ I told him I was . ”
116928	116936	116922	116922	his	138	“ I am very touched , Harry . ”
116937	116952	116954	116954	Harry	136	“ Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you ’re not at Hogwarts , ”
116963	116973	116975	116975	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , he is very nosy about that , ”
116991	117036	116975	116975	Dumbledore	138	“ He has even attempted to have me followed . Amusing , really . He set Dawlish to tail me . It was n’t kind . I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once ; I did it again with the greatest regret . ”
117037	117048	117050	117050	Harry	136	“ So they still do n’t know where you go ? ”
117075	117110	117062	117062	Dumbledore	138	“ No , they do n’t , and the time is not quite right for you to know either . Now , I suggest we press on , unless there ’s anything else — ? ”
117111	117119	117121	117121	Harry	136	“ There is , actually , sir , ”
117123	117131	117121	117121	Harry	136	“ It ’s about Malfoy and Snape . ”
117132	117138	117062	117062	Dumbledore	138	“ Professor Snape , Harry . ”
117139	117161	117121	117121	Harry	136	“ Yes , sir . I overheard them during Professor Slughorn ’s party ... well , I followed them , actually ... ”
117189	117222	117177	117177	he	136	“ Thank you for telling me this , Harry , but I suggest that you put it out of your mind . I do not think that it is of great importance . ”
117223	117229	117231	117231	Harry	136	“ Not of great importance ? ”
117234	117242	117231	117231	Harry	136	“ Professor , did you understand — ? ”
117243	117263	117265	117265	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , Harry , blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower , I understood everything you told me , ”
117271	117317	117265	117265	Dumbledore	138	“ I think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did . Again , I am glad that you have confided in me , but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet . ”
117383	117388	117390	117390	Harry	136	“ So , sir , ”
117403	117410	117390	117390	Harry	136	“ you definitely still trust — ? ”
117411	117423	117425	117425	Dumbledore	138	“ I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already , ”
117436	117443	117428	117428	he	138	“ My answer has not changed . ”
117444	117450	117456	117457	Phineas Nigellus	370	“ I should think not , ”
117470	117496	117466	117466	Dumbledore	138	“ And now , Harry , I must insist that we press on . I have more important things to discuss with you this evening . ”
117541	117581	117538	117538	his	138	“ Ah , Harry , how often this happens , even between the best of friends ! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute ! ”
117582	117598	117600	117600	Harry	136	“ I do n’t think what you ’ve got to say is unimportant , sir , ”
117603	117616	117618	117618	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , you are quite right , because it is not , ”
117621	117656	117618	117618	Dumbledore	138	“ I have two more memories to show you this evening , both obtained with enormous difficulty , and the second of them is , I think , the most important I have collected . ”
117690	117693	117695	117695	Dumbledore	138	“ So , ”
117702	117828	117830	117830	Dumbledore	138	“ we meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle , whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts . You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard , that he refused my company on a trip to Diagon Alley , and that I , in turn , warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school . Well , the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom Riddle , a quiet boy in his secondhand robes , who lined up with the other first years to be sorted . He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head , ”
117852	117874	117876	117876	Harry	136	“ Did n’t you tell them , sir , what he ’d been like when you met him at the orphanage ? ”
117878	117925	117926	117926	Dumbledore	138	“ No , I did not . Though he had shown no hint of remorse , it was possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf . I chose to give him that chance . ”
117971	118015	118044	118044	he	138	“ But you did n’t really trust him , sir , did you ? He told me ... the Riddle who came out of that diary said , ‘ Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did . ’ ”
118016	118033	118035	118035	Dumbledore	138	“ Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy , ”
118059	118068	118069	118069	he	138	“ I was very lucky to collect this , ”
118082	118096	118069	118069	he	138	“ As you will understand when we have experienced it . Shall we ? ”
118372	118375	118376	118376	he	764	“ YOU ! ”
118379	118382	118376	118376	he	764	“ YOU ! ”
118396	118399	118384	118384	he	764	“ Stop . ”
118441	118446	118436	118437	The man	764	“ You speak it ? ”
118447	118454	118456	118456	Riddle	340	“ Yes , I speak it , ”
118502	118507	118508	118508	he	764	“ Where is Marvolo ? ”
118511	118514	118516	118517	the other	733	“ Dead , ”
118519	118528	118516	118517	the other	733	“ Died years ago , did n’t he ? ”
118532	118539	118565	118565	Morfin	191	“ Who are you , then ? ”
118540	118549	118565	118565	Morfin	191	“ I ’m Morfin , ai n’t I ? ”
118550	118555	118565	118565	Morfin	191	“ Marvolo ’s son ? ”
118556	118564	118565	118565	Morfin	191	“ ’ Course I am , then ... ”
118598	118606	118608	118608	Morfin	191	“ I thought you was that Muggle , ”
118610	118618	118608	118608	Morfin	191	“ You look mighty like that Muggle . ”
118619	118623	118625	118625	Riddle	340	“ What Muggle ? ”
118628	118651	118653	118653	Morfin	191	“ That Muggle what my sister took a fancy to , that Muggle what lives in the big house over the way , ”
118665	118695	118656	118656	he	191	“ You look right like him . Riddle . But he ’s older now , in ’ e ? He ’s older’n you , now I think on it ... ”
118715	118722	118723	118723	he	191	“ He come back , see , ”
118747	118752	118739	118739	he	178	“ Riddle came back ? ”
118753	118768	118770	118770	Morfin	191	“ Ar , he left her , and serve her right , marrying filth ! ”
118778	118802	118770	118770	Morfin	191	“ Robbed us , mind , before she ran off ! Where ’s the locket , eh , where ’s Slytherin ’s locket ? ”
118824	118859	118817	118817	he	191	“ Dishonored us , she did , that little slut ! And who ’re you , coming here and asking questions about all that ? It ’s over , innit ... It ’s over ... ”
118932	118937	118939	118939	Harry	136	“ Is that all ? ”
118943	118953	118939	118939	Harry	136	“ Why did it go dark , what happened ? ”
118954	118966	118968	118968	Dumbledore	138	“ Because Morfin could not remember anything from that point onward , ”
118977	119088	119089	119089	Dumbledore	138	“ When he awoke next morning , he was lying on the floor , quite alone . Marvolo ’s ring had gone . Meanwhile , in the village of Little Hangleton , a maid was running along the High Street , screaming that there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of the big house : Tom Riddle Senior and his mother and father . The Muggle authorities were perplexed . As far as I am aware , they do not know to this day how the Riddles died , for the Avada Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage ... The exception sits before me , ”
119100	119111	119113	119113	Harry	136	“ So Voldemort stole Morfin ’s wand and used it ? ”
119119	119124	119126	119126	Dumbledore	138	“ That ’s right , ”
119128	119139	119126	119126	Dumbledore	138	“ And Morfin never realized he had n’t done it ? ”
119140	119143	119145	119145	Dumbledore	138	“ Never , ”
119147	119161	119145	119145	Dumbledore	138	“ He gave , as I say , a full and boastful confession . ”
119162	119175	119126	119126	Dumbledore	138	“ But he had this real memory in him all the time ! ”
119176	119195	119197	119197	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him , ”
119199	119296	119197	119197	Dumbledore	138	“ and why should anybody delve further into Morfin ’s mind when he had already confessed to the crime ? However , I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life , by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I could about Voldemort ’s past . I extracted this memory with difficulty . When I saw what it contained , I attempted to use it to secure Morfin ’s release from Azkaban . Before the Ministry reached their decision , however , Morfin had died . ”
119297	119315	119316	119316	Harry	136	“ But how come the Ministry did n’t realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin ? ”
119320	119340	119316	119316	Harry	136	“ He was underage at the time , was n’t he ? I thought they could detect underage magic ! ”
119341	119380	119197	119197	Dumbledore	138	“ You are quite right — they can detect magic , but not the perpetrator : You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was , in fact , cast by — ”
119381	119384	119386	119386	Harry	136	“ Dobby , ”
119393	119418	119386	119386	Harry	136	“ So if you ’re underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard ’s house , the Ministry wo n’t know ? ”
119419	119432	119434	119434	Dumbledore	138	“ They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic , ”
119449	119468	119434	119434	Dumbledore	138	“ They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring ’s obedience while within their walls . ”
119469	119476	119478	119478	Harry	136	“ Well , that ’s rubbish , ”
119480	119492	119478	119478	Harry	136	“ Look what happened here , look what happened to Morfin ! ”
119493	119497	119499	119499	Dumbledore	138	“ I agree , ”
119501	119543	119499	119499	Dumbledore	138	“ Whatever Morfin was , he did not deserve to die as he did , blamed for murders he had not committed . But it is getting late , and I want you to see this other memory before we part ... ”
119600	119607	119612	119612	he	138	“ This will not take long , ”
119619	119637	119612	119612	he	138	“ We shall be back before you know it . Once more into the Pensieve , then ... ”
119911	119923	119924	119924	he	136	“ Sir , is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring ? ”
119927	119941	119943	119943	Slughorn	183	“ Tom , Tom , if I knew I could n’t tell you , ”
119964	119992	119943	119943	Slughorn	183	“ I must say , I ’d like to know where you get your information , boy , more knowledgeable than half the staff , you are . ”
120006	120049	120093	120093	Slughorn	183	“ What with your uncanny ability to know things you should n’t , and your careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for the pineapple , by the way , you ’re quite right , it is my favorite — ”
120105	120117	120093	120093	Slughorn	183	“ You ’ll go wrong , boy , mark my words . ”
120167	120177	120179	120179	Slughorn	183	“ Good gracious , is it that time already ? ”
120181	120218	120179	120179	Slughorn	183	“ You ’d better get going , boys , or we ’ll all be in trouble . Lestrange , I want your essay by tomorrow or it ’s detention . Same goes for you , Avery . ”
120266	120272	120274	120274	Slughorn	183	“ Look sharp , Tom , ”
120284	120304	120274	120274	Slughorn	183	“ You do n’t want to be caught out of bed out of hours , and you a prefect ... ”
120305	120315	120251	120251	he	178	“ Sir , I wanted to ask you something . ”
120316	120327	120274	120274	Slughorn	183	“ Ask away , then , m’boy , ask away ... ”
120328	120341	120251	120251	he	178	“ Sir , I wondered what you know about ... about Horcruxes ? ”
120390	120426	120376	120376	Slughorn	183	“ I do n’t know anything about Horcruxes and I would n’t tell you if I did ! Now get out of here at once and do n’t let me catch you mentioning them again ! ”
120427	120434	120436	120436	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , that ’s that , ”
120441	120446	120436	120436	Dumbledore	138	“ Time to go . ”
120471	120478	120480	120480	Harry	136	“ That ’s all there is ? ”
120549	120556	120558	120558	Dumbledore	138	“ As you might have noticed , ”
120566	120574	120558	120558	Dumbledore	138	“ that memory has been tampered with . ”
120575	120579	120581	120581	Harry	136	“ Tampered with ? ”
120588	120591	120593	120593	Dumbledore	138	“ Certainly , ”
120595	120605	120593	120593	Dumbledore	138	“ Professor Slughorn has meddled with his own recollections . ”
120606	120614	120558	120558	Dumbledore	138	“ But why would he do that ? ”
120615	120629	120631	120631	Dumbledore	138	“ Because , I think , he is ashamed of what he remembers , ”
120633	120740	120631	120631	Dumbledore	138	“ He has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light , obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see . It is , as you will have noticed , very crudely done , and that is all to the good , for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations . And so , for the first time , I am giving you homework , Harry . It will be your job to persuade Professor Slughorn to divulge the real memory , which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all . ”
120746	120752	120753	120753	he	138	“ But surely , sir , ”
120764	120779	120753	120753	he	138	“ you do n’t need me — you could use Legilimency ... or Veritaserum ... ”
120780	120794	120796	120796	Dumbledore	138	“ Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both , ”
120798	120946	120796	120796	Dumbledore	138	“ He is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt , and I would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection . No , I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from Professor Slughorn by force , and might do much more harm than good ; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts . However , he has his weaknesses like the rest of us , and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses . It is most important that we secure the true memory , Harry ... How important , we will only know when we have seen the real thing . So , good luck ... and good night . ”
120963	120969	120956	120956	Harry	136	“ Good night , sir . ”
120986	121006	120982	120983	Phineas Nigellus	370	“ I ca n’t see why the boy should be able to do it better than you , Dumbledore . ”
121007	121017	121019	121019	Dumbledore	138	“ I would n’t expect you to , Phineas , ”
121087	121092	121093	121093	he	136	“ He loves you , ”
121106	121133	121093	121093	he	136	“ Wo n’t refuse you anything , will he ? Not his little Potions Prince . Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him . ”
121143	121163	121164	121164	she	179	“ He must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore could n’t get it out of him , ”
121183	121196	121164	121164	she	179	“ Horcruxes ... Horcruxes ... I ’ve never even heard of them ... ”
121197	121202	121203	121203	Harry	136	“ You have n’t ? ”
121227	121280	121164	121164	she	179	“ They must be really advanced Dark Magic , or why would Voldemort have wanted to know about them ? I think it ’s going to be difficult to get the information , Harry , you ’ll have to be very careful about how you approach Slughorn , think out a strategy ... ”
121281	121294	121164	121164	she	179	“ Ron reckons I should just hang back after Potions this afternoon ... ”
121295	121313	121314	121314	she	179	“ Oh , well , if Won - Won thinks that , you ’d better do it , ”
121322	121337	121314	121314	she	179	“ After all , when has Won - Won ’s judgment ever been faulty ? ”
121338	121346	121164	121164	she	179	“ Hermione , ca n’t you — ? ”
121347	121350	121351	121351	she	179	“ No ! ”
121415	121421	121422	121422	Ron	201	“ What ’ve you done ? ”
121452	121493	121440	121440	Slughorn	199	“ Settle down , settle down , please ! Quickly , now , lots of work to get through this afternoon ! Golpalott ’s Third Law ... who can tell me — ? But Miss Granger can , of course ! ”
121500	121557	121494	121494	Hermione	179	“ Golpalott’s - Third - Law - states - that - the - antidote - for - a - blended - poison - will - be - equal - to - more - than - the - sum - of - the - antidotes - for - each - of - the - separate - components . ”
121558	121561	121563	121563	Slughorn	199	“ Precisely ! ”
121565	121583	121563	121563	Slughorn	199	“ Ten points for Gryffindor ! Now , if we accept Golpalott ’s Third Law as true ... ”
121627	121692	121693	121693	Ron	201	“ ... which means , of course , that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion ’s ingredients by Scarpin ’s Revelaspell , our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in and of themselves , but to find that added component that will , by an almost alchemical process , transform these disparate elements — ”
121743	121748	121750	121750	Slughorn	199	“ ... and so , ”
121752	121799	121750	121750	Slughorn	199	“ I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk . You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson . Good luck , and do n’t forget your protective gloves ! ”
121861	121882	121883	121883	she	179	“ It ’s a shame that the Prince wo n’t be able to help you much with this , Harry , ”
121891	121907	121883	121883	she	179	“ You have to understand the principles involved this time . No shortcuts or cheats ! ”
121980	121991	121992	121992	Ron	201	“ You sure the Prince has n’t got any tips ? ”
122064	122067	122069	122069	Harry	136	“ Nothing , ”
122122	122126	122114	122115	Ernie Macmillan	317	“ Specialis Revelio ! ”
122337	122355	122326	122326	Snape	205	“ A stone taken from the stomach of a goat , which will protect from most poisons . ”
122442	122449	122439	122439	Slughorn	199	“ Two minutes left , everyone ! ”
122489	122495	122497	122497	Slughorn	199	“ Time ’s ... UP ! ”
122500	122520	122497	122497	Slughorn	199	“ Well , let ’s see how you ’ve done ! Blaise ... what have you got for me ? ”
122632	122638	122639	122639	he	199	“ And you , Harry , ”
122642	122651	122639	122639	he	199	“ What have you got to show me ? ”
122703	122711	122712	122712	he	136	“ You ’ve got nerve , boy ! ”
122730	122760	122712	122712	he	136	“ Oh , you ’re like your mother ... Well , I ca n’t fault you ... A bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions ! ”
122811	122827	122828	122828	she	179	“ And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself , did you , Harry ? ”
122834	122847	122849	122849	Slughorn	199	“ That ’s the individual spirit a real potion - maker needs ! ”
122857	122930	122849	122849	Slughorn	199	“ Just like his mother , she had the same intuitive grasp of potion - making , it ’s undoubtedly from Lily he gets it ... Yes , Harry , yes , if you ’ve got a bezoar to hand , of course that would do the trick ... although as they do n’t work on everything , and are pretty rare , it ’s still worth knowing how to mix antidotes ... ”
122992	122998	123000	123000	Slughorn	199	“ Time to pack up ! ”
123002	123014	123000	123000	Slughorn	199	“ And an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek ! ”
123077	123094	123096	123096	Slughorn	199	“ Come on , now , Harry , you ’ll be late for your next lesson , ”
123111	123114	123116	123116	Harry	136	“ Sir , ”
123124	123132	123116	123116	Harry	136	“ I wanted to ask you something . ”
123133	123146	123161	123161	Slughorn	199	“ Ask away , then , my dear boy , ask away ... ”
123147	123160	123116	123116	Harry	136	“ Sir , I wondered what you know about ... about Horcruxes ? ”
123182	123188	123174	123174	He	199	“ What did you say ? ”
123189	123204	123161	123161	Slughorn	199	“ I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes , sir . You see — ”
123205	123213	123215	123215	Slughorn	199	“ Dumbledore put you up to this , ”
123251	123267	123234	123234	He	199	“ Dumbledore ’s shown you that — that memory . Well ? Has n’t he ? ”
123268	123271	123273	123273	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
123287	123293	123295	123295	Slughorn	199	“ Yes , of course , ”
123305	123331	123333	123333	he	199	“ Of course ... well , if you ’ve seen that memory , Harry , you ’ll know that I do n’t know anything — anything ”
123339	123343	123333	123333	he	199	“ about Horcruxes . ”
123367	123370	123372	123372	Harry	136	“ Sir , ”
123375	123389	123372	123372	Harry	136	“ I just thought there might be a bit more to the memory — ”
123390	123394	123396	123396	Slughorn	199	“ Did you ? ”
123398	123410	123396	123396	Slughorn	199	“ Then you were wrong , were n’t you ? WRONG ! ”
123478	123492	123494	123494	Harry	136	“ It would ’ve just looked stupid if we ’d both done it ! ”
123497	123528	123529	123529	he	136	“ Look , I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort , did n’t I ? Oh , will you get a grip ! ”
123775	123788	123789	123789	she	179	“ I have n’t found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do ! ”
123793	123873	123874	123874	she	179	“ Not a single one ! I ’ve been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books , where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions — nothing ! All I could find was this , in the introduction to Magick Moste Evile — listen — ‘ Of the Horcrux , wickedest of magical inventions , we shall not speak nor give direction ... ’ I mean , why mention it then ? ”
123891	123897	123898	123898	she	179	“ Oh , shut up , ”
124123	124127	124129	124131	the Ministry wizard	2303	“ Good morning , ”
124149	124185	124129	124131	the Ministry wizard	2303	“ My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry Apparition instructor for the next twelve weeks . I hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition Tests in this time — ”
124186	124195	124197	124198	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Malfoy , be quiet and pay attention ! ”
124269	124286	124287	124287	Twycross	438	“ — by which time , many of you may be ready to take your tests , ”
124298	124392	124417	124420	The Heads of Houses	2298	“ As you may know , it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts . The headmaster has lifted this enchantment , purely within the Great Hall , for one hour , so as to enable you to practice . May I emphasize that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall , and that you would be unwise to try . I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you . ”
124435	124443	124445	124445	Hermione	179	“ Harry , where are you going ? ”
124547	124559	124560	124560	Malfoy	159	“ I do n’t know how much longer , all right ? ”
124573	124584	124567	124567	Harry	136	“ It ’s taking longer than I thought it would . ”
124604	124634	124591	124591	Malfoy	159	“ Look , it ’s none of your business what I ’m doing , Crabbe , you and Goyle just do as you ’re told and keep a lookout ! ”
124635	124657	124658	124658	Harry	136	“ I tell my friends what I ’m up to , if I want them to keep a lookout for me , ”
124696	124699	124689	124693	the four Heads of House	2316	“ Quiet ! ”
124714	124718	124720	124720	Twycross	438	“ Thank you , ”
124722	124726	124720	124720	Twycross	438	“ Now then ... ”
124748	124762	124764	124764	Twycross	438	“ The important things to remember when Apparating are the three D ’s ! ”
124766	124785	124787	124787	Twycross	438	“ Destination , Determination , Deliberation ! Step one : Fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination , ”
124789	124807	124787	124787	Twycross	438	“ In this case , the interior of your hoop . Kindly concentrate upon that destination now . ”
124872	124876	124878	124878	Twycross	438	“ Step two , ”
124880	124907	124878	124878	Twycross	438	“ focus your determination to occupy the visualized space ! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body ! ”
124965	124969	124971	124971	Twycross	438	“ Step three , ”
124973	125005	124971	124971	Twycross	438	“ and only when I give the command ... Turn on the spot , feeling your way into nothingness , moving with deliberation ! On my command , now ... one — ”
125026	125030	125031	125031	Harry	136	“ — two — ”
125054	125058	125076	125078	the only one	4706	“ — THREE ! ”
125133	125140	125142	125142	Twycross	438	“ Never mind , never mind , ”
125155	125169	125142	125142	Twycross	438	“ Adjust your hoops , please , and back to your original positions ... ”
125269	125280	125282	125283	Wilkie Twycross	438	“ Splinching , or the separation of random body parts , ”
125286	125315	125282	125283	Wilkie Twycross	438	“ occurs when the mind is insufficiently determined . You must concentrate continuously upon your destination , and move , without haste , but with deliberation ... thus . ”
125346	125353	125354	125354	he	438	“ Remember the three D ’s , ”
125357	125368	125354	125354	he	438	“ and try again ... one — two — three — ”
125404	125422	125400	125400	he	438	“ Until next Saturday , everybody , and do not forget : Destination . Determination . Deliberation . ”
125460	125466	125468	125468	Ron	201	“ How did you do ? ”
125474	125494	125468	125468	Ron	201	“ I think I felt something the last time I tried — a kind of tingling in my feet . ”
125495	125508	125516	125516	Hermione	179	“ I expect your trainers are too small , Won - Won , ”
125522	125529	125531	125531	Harry	136	“ I did n’t feel anything , ”
125537	125547	125531	125531	Harry	136	“ But I do n’t care about that now — ”
125548	125567	125569	125569	Ron	201	“ What d’you mean , you do n’t care ? Do n’t you want to learn to Apparate ? ”
125572	125584	125586	125586	Harry	136	“ I ’m not fussed , really , I prefer flying , ”
125609	125626	125586	125586	Harry	136	“ Look , hurry up , will you , there ’s something I want to do ... ”
125701	125715	125717	125717	Ron	201	“ Are you going to tell me what we ’re doing , then ? ”
125722	125726	125731	125731	he	136	“ Up here , ”
125777	125780	125773	125773	Ron	201	“ Harry ... ”
125781	125806	125807	125807	He	136	“ Malfoy ’s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts . He was arguing with Crabbe just now . I want to know — aha . ”
125834	125851	125821	125821	he	136	“ I solemnly swear that I am up to no good ... or Malfoy is anyway . ”
125900	125906	125908	125908	Harry	136	“ Help me find Malfoy , ”
125929	125932	125934	125934	Ron	201	“ There ! ”
125942	125962	125934	125934	Ron	201	“ He ’s in the Slytherin common room , look ... with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle ... ”
125978	125992	125993	125993	he	136	“ Well , I ’m keeping an eye on him from now on , ”
125997	126032	125993	125993	he	136	“ And the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside , it ’ll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he ’s — ”
126322	126329	126330	126330	he	201	“ It was on my birthday ! ”
126333	126341	126330	126330	he	201	“ I was looking forward to that ! ”
126342	126353	126355	126355	Harry	136	“ Not a big surprise , though , is it ? ”
126357	126365	126355	126355	Harry	136	“ Not after what happened to Katie . ”
126398	126413	126415	126415	Ron	201	“ But now all I ’ve got to look forward to is stupid Apparition ! ”
126418	126423	126415	126415	Ron	201	“ Big birthday treat ... ”
126489	126495	126497	126497	Harry	136	“ Happy birthday , Ron , ”
126517	126522	126511	126511	Dean	240	“ Have a present . ”
126558	126561	126563	126563	Ron	201	“ Cheers , ”
126638	126641	126642	126642	he	136	“ Right , ”
126659	126671	126642	126642	he	136	“ I solemnly swear that I am up to no good , ”
126692	126698	126700	126700	Ron	201	“ Nice one , Harry ! ”
126717	126721	126723	126723	Harry	136	“ No problem , ”
126736	126749	126727	126727	he	136	“ Hey ... I do n’t think he ’s in his bed ... ”
126773	126780	126781	126781	he	201	“ Seriously good haul this year ! ”
126804	126826	126781	126781	he	201	“ See what Mum and Dad got me ? Blimey , I think I ’ll come of age next year too ... ”
126827	126830	126832	126832	Harry	136	“ Cool , ”
126896	126900	126902	126902	Ron	201	“ Want one ? ”
126913	126917	126919	126919	Harry	136	“ No thanks , ”
126924	126930	126919	126919	Harry	136	“ Malfoy ’s gone again ! ”
126931	126937	126939	126939	Ron	201	“ Ca n’t have done , ”
126958	126987	126988	126988	Ron	201	“ Come on , if you do n’t hurry up , you ’ll have to Apparate on an empty stomach ... Might make it easier , I suppose ... ”
127017	127021	127007	127007	Harry	136	“ Mischief managed , ”
127110	127113	127114	127114	he	201	“ Ready ? ”
127159	127164	127114	127114	he	201	“ Ron ? Breakfast . ”
127165	127171	127175	127175	him	201	“ I ’m not hungry . ”
127177	127185	127114	127114	he	201	“ I thought you just said — ? ”
127186	127199	127201	127201	Ron	201	“ Well , all right , I ’ll come down with you , ”
127203	127212	127201	127201	Ron	201	“ but I do n’t want to eat . ”
127218	127234	127213	127213	Harry	136	“ You ’ve just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons , have n’t you ? ”
127235	127241	127242	127242	Ron	201	“ It ’s not that , ”
127246	127254	127242	127242	Ron	201	“ You ... you would n’t understand . ”
127255	127259	127261	127261	Harry	136	“ Fair enough , ”
127274	127277	127279	127279	Ron	201	“ Harry ! ”
127282	127285	127242	127242	Ron	201	“ What ? ”
127286	127295	127242	127242	Ron	201	“ Harry , I ca n’t stand it ! ”
127296	127303	127305	127305	Harry	136	“ You ca n’t stand what ? ”
127329	127338	127340	127340	Ron	201	“ I ca n’t stop thinking about her ! ”
127374	127379	127370	127370	Ron	201	“ Lav - Lav , ”
127389	127398	127399	127399	Harry	136	“ Why does that stop you having breakfast ? ”
127414	127424	127426	127426	Ron	201	“ I do n’t think she knows I exist , ”
127432	127439	127441	127441	Harry	136	“ She definitely knows you exist , ”
127445	127455	127441	127441	Harry	136	“ She keeps snogging you , does n’t she ? ”
127459	127466	127456	127456	Ron	201	“ Who are you talking about ? ”
127467	127474	127476	127476	Harry	136	“ Who are you talking about ? ”
127492	127496	127498	127498	Ron	201	“ Romilda Vane , ”
127538	127550	127535	127535	Harry	136	“ This is a joke , right ? You ’re joking . ”
127551	127563	127565	127565	Ron	201	“ I think ... Harry , I think I love her , ”
127571	127574	127576	127576	Harry	136	“ Okay , ”
127596	127607	127576	127576	Harry	136	“ okay ... Say that again with a straight face . ”
127608	127613	127615	127615	Ron	201	“ I love her , ”
127618	127646	127615	127615	Ron	201	“ Have you seen her hair , it ’s all black and shiny and silky ... and her eyes ? Her big dark eyes ? And her — ”
127647	127655	127657	127657	Harry	136	“ This is really funny and everything , ”
127660	127672	127657	127657	Harry	136	“ but joke ’s over , all right ? Drop it . ”
127772	127778	127779	127779	Harry	136	“ What was that for ? ”
127782	127796	127798	127798	Ron	201	“ You insulted her , Harry ! You said it was a joke ! ”
127817	127822	127824	127824	Harry	136	“ This is insane ! ”
127826	127833	127824	127824	Harry	136	“ What ’s got into — ? ”
127860	127869	127856	127858	a stampeding troll	2370	“ Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons ? ”
127870	127877	127879	127879	Ron	201	“ They were a birthday present ! ”
127892	127902	127879	127879	Ron	201	“ I offered you one , did n’t I ? ”
127903	127917	127856	127858	a stampeding troll	2370	“ You just picked them up off the floor , did n’t you ? ”
127918	127933	127879	127879	Ron	201	“ They ’d fallen off my bed , all right ? Let me go ! ”
127934	127990	127856	127858	a stampeding troll	2370	“ They did n’t fall off your bed , you prat , do n’t you understand ? They were mine , I chucked them out of my trunk when I was looking for the map , they ’re the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas , and they ’re all spiked with love potion ! ”
128004	128007	128008	128008	he	201	“ Romilda ? ”
128011	128029	128008	128008	he	201	“ Did you say Romilda ? Harry — do you know her ? Can you introduce me ? ”
128134	128142	128144	128144	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I ’ll introduce you , ”
128149	128161	128144	128144	Harry	136	“ I ’m going to let you down now , okay ? ”
128191	128200	128202	128202	Harry	136	“ She ’ll be in Slughorn ’s office , ”
128212	128220	128222	128222	Ron	201	“ Why will she be in there ? ”
128230	128241	128243	128243	Harry	136	“ Oh , she has extra Potions lessons with him , ”
128248	128261	128263	128263	Ron	201	“ Maybe I could ask if I can have them with her ? ”
128266	128270	128272	128272	Harry	136	“ Great idea , ”
128289	128298	128299	128299	she	2374	“ You ’re late , Won - Won ! ”
128302	128310	128299	128299	she	2374	“ I ’ve got you a birthday — ”
128311	128316	128318	128318	Ron	201	“ Leave me alone , ”
128321	128332	128318	128318	Ron	201	“ Harry ’s going to introduce me to Romilda Vane . ”
128424	128427	128428	128428	he	136	“ Harry , ”
128431	128448	128428	128428	he	136	“ This is very early for a call ... I generally sleep late on a Saturday ... ”
128449	128460	128462	128462	Harry	136	“ Professor , I ’m really sorry to disturb you , ”
128483	128536	128469	128469	Ron	201	“ but my friend Ron ’s swallowed a love potion by mistake . You could n’t make him an antidote , could you ? I ’d take him to Madam Pomfrey , but we ’re not supposed to have anything from Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes and , you know ... awkward questions ... ”
128537	128559	128561	128561	Slughorn	199	“ I ’d have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy , Harry , an expert potioneer like you ? ”
128563	128566	128568	128568	Harry	136	“ Er , ”
128595	128627	128576	128576	Ron	201	“ well , I ’ve never mixed an antidote for a love potion , sir , and by the time I get it right , Ron might ’ve done something serious — ”
128637	128651	128630	128630	Ron	201	“ I ca n’t see her , Harry — is he hiding her ? ”
128652	128659	128661	128661	Slughorn	199	“ Was this potion within date ? ”
128670	128684	128661	128661	Slughorn	199	“ They can strengthen , you know , the longer they ’re kept . ”
128685	128692	128694	128694	Harry	136	“ That would explain a lot , ”
128709	128717	128718	128718	he	136	“ It ’s his birthday , Professor , ”
128722	128736	128738	128738	Slughorn	199	“ Oh , all right , come in , then , come in , ”
128742	128760	128738	128738	Slughorn	199	“ I ’ve got the necessary here in my bag , it ’s not a difficult antidote ... ”
128793	128803	128785	128785	Harry	136	“ She did n’t see that , did she ? ”
128804	128811	128813	128813	Harry	136	“ She ’s not here yet , ”
128836	128841	128843	128843	Ron	201	“ That ’s good , ”
128846	128852	128843	128843	Ron	201	“ How do I look ? ”
128853	128857	128859	128859	Slughorn	199	“ Very handsome , ”
128870	128894	128859	128859	Slughorn	199	“ Now drink that up , it ’s a tonic for the nerves , keep you calm when she arrives , you know . ”
128895	128898	128900	128900	Ron	201	“ Brilliant , ”
128947	128954	128956	128956	Harry	136	“ Back to normal , then ? ”
128963	128970	128960	128960	Slughorn	199	“ Thanks a lot , Professor . ”
128971	128984	128986	128986	Slughorn	199	“ Do n’t mention it , m’boy , do n’t mention it , ”
128999	129012	129013	129013	Slughorn	199	“ Pick - me - up , that ’s what he needs , ”
129026	129065	129066	129066	He	199	“ I ’ve got butterbeer , I ’ve got wine , I ’ve got one last bottle of this oak - matured mead ... hmm ... meant to give that to Dumbledore for Christmas ... ah , well ... ”
129069	129108	129066	129066	He	199	“ He ca n’t miss what he ’s never had ! Why do n’t we open it now and celebrate Mr. Weasley ’s birthday ? Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love ... ”
129170	129176	129178	129178	Slughorn	199	“ There you are then , ”
129194	129204	129178	129178	Slughorn	199	“ Well , a very happy birthday , Ralph — ”
129205	129208	129210	129210	Harry	136	“ Ron — ”
129267	129276	129259	129259	Slughorn	199	“ — and may you have many more — ”
129277	129280	129281	129281	Ron	201	“ Ron ! ”
129319	129322	129323	129323	Harry	136	“ Professor ! ”
129326	129330	129323	129323	Harry	136	“ Do something ! ”
129349	129354	129356	129356	Slughorn	199	“ What — but — ”
129448	129463	129465	129465	Fred	215	“ So , all in all , not one of Ron ’s better birthdays ? ”
129546	129558	129560	129560	George	216	“ This is n’t how we imagined handing over our present , ”
129579	129592	129594	129594	Fred	215	“ Yeah , when we pictured the scene , he was conscious , ”
129596	129608	129610	129610	George	216	“ There we were in Hogsmeade , waiting to surprise him — ”
129612	129618	129620	129620	Ginny	218	“ You were in Hogsmeade ? ”
129625	129634	129636	129636	Fred	215	“ We were thinking of buying Zonko ’s , ”
129639	129678	129636	129636	Fred	215	“ A Hogsmeade branch , you know , but a fat lot of good it ’ll do us if you lot are n’t allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymore ... But never mind that now . ”
129694	129703	129679	129679	He	201	“ How exactly did it happen , Harry ? ”
129736	129802	129704	129704	Harry	136	“ ... and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit , Slughorn ran for help , McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey turned up , and they brought Ron up here . They reckon he ’ll be all right . Madam Pomfrey says he ’ll have to stay here a week or so ... keep taking essence of rue ... ”
129803	129815	129817	129817	George	216	“ Blimey , it was lucky you thought of a bezoar , ”
129823	129832	129834	129834	Harry	136	“ Lucky there was one in the room , ”
129945	129952	129953	129953	Fred	215	“ Do Mum and Dad know ? ”
129957	129985	129955	129955	Ginny	218	“ They ’ve already seen him , they arrived an hour ago — they ’re in Dumbledore ’s office now , but they ’ll be back soon ... ”
130002	130011	130013	130013	Fred	215	“ So the poison was in the drink ? ”
130016	130019	130021	130021	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
130043	130049	130021	130021	Harry	136	“ Slughorn poured it out — ”
130050	130067	130021	130021	Harry	136	“ Would he have been able to slip something into Ron ’s glass without you seeing ? ”
130068	130071	130073	130073	Harry	136	“ Probably , ”
130075	130085	130073	130073	Harry	136	“ but why would Slughorn want to poison Ron ? ”
130086	130090	130092	130092	Fred	215	“ No idea , ”
130096	130116	130092	130092	Fred	215	“ You do n’t think he could have mixed up the glasses by mistake ? Meaning to get you ? ”
130117	130126	130128	130128	Ginny	218	“ Why would Slughorn want to poison Harry ? ”
130130	130134	130136	130136	Fred	215	“ I dunno , ”
130138	130166	130136	130136	Fred	215	“ but there must be loads of people who ’d like to poison Harry , must n’t there ? ‘ The Chosen One ’ and all that ? ”
130167	130177	130179	130179	Ginny	218	“ So you think Slughorn ’s a Death Eater ? ”
130181	130186	130188	130188	Fred	215	“ Anything ’s possible , ”
130191	130200	130202	130202	George	216	“ He could be under the Imperius Curse , ”
130204	130211	130213	130213	Ginny	218	“ Or he could be innocent , ”
130215	130236	130213	130213	Ginny	218	“ The poison could have been in the bottle , in which case it was probably meant for Slughorn himself . ”
130237	130245	130213	130213	Ginny	218	“ Who ’d want to kill Slughorn ? ”
130246	130256	130258	130258	Harry	136	“ Dumbledore reckons Voldemort wanted Slughorn on his side , ”
130260	130276	130258	130258	Harry	136	“ Slughorn was in hiding for a year before he came to Hogwarts . And ... ”
130293	130314	130291	130291	Slughorn	199	“ And maybe Voldemort wants him out of the way , maybe he thinks he could be valuable to Dumbledore . ”
130315	130332	130333	130333	Ginny	218	“ But you said Slughorn had been planning to give that bottle to Dumbledore for Christmas , ”
130337	130350	130333	130333	Ginny	218	“ So the poisoner could just as easily have been after Dumbledore . ”
130351	130362	130364	130364	Hermione	179	“ Then the poisoner did n’t know Slughorn very well , ”
130384	130406	130377	130377	she	179	“ Anyone who knew Slughorn would have known there was a good chance he ’d keep something that tasty for himself . ”
130407	130414	130416	130416	Ron	201	“ Er - my - nee , ”
130493	130501	130502	130502	he	176	“ Bin in the forest all day ! ”
130505	130542	130502	130502	he	176	“ Aragog ’s worse , I bin readin ’ to him — didn ’ get up ter dinner till jus ’ now an ’ then Professor Sprout told me abou ’ Ron ! How is he ? ”
130543	130547	130549	130549	Harry	136	“ Not bad , ”
130551	130559	130549	130549	Harry	136	“ They say he ’ll be okay . ”
130560	130570	130572	130573	Madam Pomfrey	287	“ No more than six visitors at a time ! ”
130581	130586	130587	130587	George	216	“ Hagrid makes six , ”
130591	130596	130598	130599	Madam Pomfrey	287	“ Oh ... yes ... ”
130634	130641	130643	130643	Hagrid	176	“ I don ’ believe this , ”
130658	130682	130652	130652	he	176	“ Jus ’ don ’ believe it ... Look at him lyin ’ there ... Who ’d want ter hurt him , eh ? ”
130683	130692	130694	130694	Harry	136	“ That ’s just what we were discussing , ”
130696	130702	130694	130694	Harry	136	“ We do n’t know . ”
130703	130719	130721	130721	Hagrid	176	“ Someone couldn ’ have a grudge against the Gryffindor Quidditch team , could they ? ”
130724	130732	130721	130721	Hagrid	176	“ Firs ’ Katie , now Ron ... ”
130733	130747	130749	130749	George	216	“ I ca n’t see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch team , ”
130751	130767	130769	130769	Fred	215	“ Wood might ’ve done the Slytherins if he could ’ve got away with it , ”
130772	130794	130796	130796	Hermione	179	“ Well , I do n’t think it ’s Quidditch , but I think there ’s a connection between the attacks , ”
130799	130806	130808	130808	Fred	215	“ How d’you work that out ? ”
130810	130860	130861	130861	she	179	“ Well , for one thing , they both ought to have been fatal and were n’t , although that was pure luck . And for another , neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was supposed to be killed . Of course , ”
130865	130899	130861	130861	she	179	“ that makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way , because they do n’t seem to care how many people they finish off before they actually reach their victim . ”
130960	130973	130974	130974	she	202	“ Dumbledore ’s told us how you saved him with the bezoar , ”
130977	131001	130974	130974	she	202	“ Oh , Harry , what can we say ? You saved Ginny ... you saved Arthur ... now you ’ve saved Ron ... ”
131002	131011	131013	131013	Harry	136	“ Do n’t be ... I did n’t ... ”
131016	131036	131037	131038	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Half our family does seem to owe you their lives , now I stop and think about it , ”
131045	131077	131037	131038	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Well , all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express , Harry . ”
131132	131137	131139	131139	Hagrid	176	“ It ’s terrible , ”
131159	131190	131139	131139	Hagrid	176	“ All this new security , an ’ kids are still gettin ’ hurt ... Dumbledore ’s worried sick ... He don ’ say much , but I can tell ... ”
131191	131201	131203	131203	Hermione	179	“ Has n’t he got any ideas , Hagrid ? ”
131206	131221	131223	131223	Hagrid	176	“ I ’ spect he ’s got hundreds of ideas , brain like his , ”
131225	131258	131260	131260	Hagrid	176	“ But he doesn ’ know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine , or they ’d ’ve bin caught , wouldn ’ they ? Wha ’ worries me , ”
131284	131338	131263	131263	his	176	“ is how long Hogwarts can stay open if kids are bein ’ attacked . Chamber o ’ Secrets all over again , isn ’ it ? There ’ll be panic , more parents takin ’ their kids outta school , an ’ nex ’ thing yeh know the board o ’ governors ... ”
131362	131380	131346	131350	a long - haired woman	2406	“ ... the board o ’ governors’ll be talkin ’ about shuttin ’ us up fer good . ”
131381	131385	131387	131387	Hermione	179	“ Surely not ? ”
131392	131404	131406	131406	Hagrid	176	“ Got ta see it from their point o ’ view , ”
131409	131468	131406	131406	Hagrid	176	“ I mean , it ’s always bin a bit of a risk sendin ’ a kid ter Hogwarts , hasn ’ it ? Yer expect accidents , don ’ yeh , with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up tergether , but attempted murder , tha ’s diff’rent . ’ S’no wonder Dumbledore ’s angry with Sn — ”
131493	131496	131498	131498	Harry	136	“ What ? ”
131501	131508	131498	131498	Harry	136	“ Dumbledore ’s angry with Snape ? ”
131509	131516	131518	131518	Hagrid	176	“ I never said tha ’ , ”
131533	131551	131518	131518	Hagrid	176	“ Look at the time , it ’s gettin ’ on fer midnight , I need ter — ”
131552	131562	131563	131563	Harry	136	“ Hagrid , why is Dumbledore angry with Snape ? ”
131567	131570	131572	131572	Hagrid	176	“ Shhhh ! ”
131580	131620	131572	131572	Hagrid	176	“ Don ’ shout stuff like that , Harry , d’yeh wan ’ me ter lose me job ? Mind , I don ’ suppose yeh’d care , would yeh , not now yeh’ve given up Care of Mag — ”
131621	131636	131638	131638	Harry	136	“ Do n’t try and make me feel guilty , it wo n’t work ! ”
131641	131647	131638	131638	Harry	136	“ What ’s Snape done ? ”
131648	131729	131572	131572	Hagrid	176	“ I dunno , Harry , I shouldn’ta heard it at all ! I — well , I was comin ’ outta the forest the other evenin ’ an ’ I overheard ’em talking — well , arguin ’ . Did n’t like ter draw attention to meself , so I sorta skulked an ’ tried not ter listen , but it was a — well , a heated discussion an ’ it wasn ’ easy ter block it out . ”
131730	131733	131734	131734	Harry	136	“ Well ? ”
131746	131778	131572	131572	Hagrid	176	“ Well — I jus ’ heard Snape sayin ’ Dumbledore took too much fer granted an ’ maybe he — Snape — didn ’ wan ’ ter do it anymore — ”
131779	131783	131572	131572	Hagrid	176	“ Do what ? ”
131784	131862	131863	131863	Hagrid	176	“ I dunno , Harry , it sounded like Snape was feelin ’ a bit overworked , tha ’s all — anyway , Dumbledore told him flat out he ’d agreed ter do it an ’ that was all there was to it . Pretty firm with him . An ’ then he said summat abou ’ Snape makin ’ investigations in his House , in Slytherin . Well , there ’s nothin’ strange abou ’ that ! ”
131877	131893	131870	131870	Hermione	179	“ All the Heads o ’ Houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business — ”
131894	131912	131914	131914	Harry	136	“ Yeah , but Dumbledore ’s not having rows with the rest of them , is he ? ”
131916	131919	131920	131920	Hagrid	176	“ Look , ”
131941	131971	131920	131920	Hagrid	176	“ I know what yeh’re like abou ’ Snape , Harry , an ’ I don ’ want yeh ter go readin ’ more inter this than there is . ”
131972	131976	131978	131978	Hermione	179	“ Look out , ”
132013	132016	132017	132017	he	764	“ Oho ! ”
132020	132032	132017	132017	he	764	“ Out of bed so late , this ’ll mean detention ! ”
132033	132041	132043	132043	Hagrid	176	“ No it won ’ , Filch , ”
132046	132056	132043	132043	Hagrid	176	“ They ’re with me , aren ’ they ? ”
132057	132065	132067	132067	Filch	407	“ And what difference does that make ? ”
132070	132086	132088	132088	Hagrid	176	“ I ’m a ruddy teacher , aren ’ I , yeh sneakin ’ Squib ! ”
132125	132129	132131	132131	Hagrid	176	“ Get goin’ , ”
132445	132452	132426	132426	Dumbledore	138	“ There you are , Potter ! ”
132510	132521	132523	132523	McLaggen	272	“ I ’ve been waiting for you to come back , ”
132531	132565	132523	132523	McLaggen	272	“ Must ’ve fallen asleep . Look , I saw them taking Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier . Did n’t look like he ’ll be fit for next week ’s match . ”
132580	132587	132588	132588	he	136	“ Oh ... right ... Quidditch , ”
132610	132619	132588	132588	he	136	“ Yeah ... he might not make it . ”
132620	132635	132637	132637	McLaggen	272	“ Well , then , I ’ll be playing Keeper , wo n’t I ? ”
132639	132642	132644	132644	Harry	136	“ Yeah , ”
132646	132653	132644	132644	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I suppose so ... ”
132678	132681	132683	132683	McLaggen	272	“ Excellent , ”
132689	132695	132683	132683	McLaggen	272	“ So when ’s practice ? ”
132696	132707	132654	132654	He	136	“ What ? Oh ... there ’s one tomorrow evening . ”
132708	132734	132683	132683	McLaggen	272	“ Good . Listen , Potter , we should have a talk beforehand . I ’ve got some ideas on strategy you might find useful . ”
132735	132738	132740	132740	Harry	136	“ Right , ”
132743	132763	132740	132740	Harry	136	“ Well , I ’ll hear them tomorrow , then . I ’m pretty tired now ... see you ... ”
133128	133137	133121	133121	Ron	201	“ I mean , I am his girlfriend ! ”
133181	133195	133196	133196	Harry	136	“ Look , why do n’t you talk to Ron about all this ? ”
133236	133239	133228	133228	Ron	201	“ serious . ”
133240	133258	133260	133260	Lavender	306	“ Well , I would , but he ’s always asleep when I go and see him ! ”
133263	133267	133269	133269	Harry	136	“ Is he ? ”
133313	133321	133322	133322	Lavender	306	“ Is Hermione Granger still visiting him ? ”
133326	133343	133345	133345	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I think so . Well , they ’re friends , are n’t they ? ”
133348	133357	133359	133359	Lavender	306	“ Friends , do n’t make me laugh , ”
133362	133395	133359	133359	Lavender	306	“ She did n’t talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me ! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now he ’s all interesting ... ”
133396	133405	133407	133407	Harry	136	“ Would you call getting poisoned being interesting ? ”
133409	133428	133430	133430	Harry	136	“ Anyway — sorry , got to go — there ’s McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch , ”
133517	133525	133526	133526	he	201	“ So how ’s McLaggen shaping up ? ”
133543	133549	133551	133551	Harry	136	“ I ’ve told you , ”
133554	133612	133613	133613	Harry	136	“ he could be world - class and I would n’t want to keep him . He keeps trying to tell everyone what to do , he thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us . I ca n’t wait to be shot of him . And speaking of getting shot of people , ”
133626	133649	133613	133613	Harry	136	“ will you stop pretending to be asleep when Lavender comes to see you ? She ’s driving me mad as well . ”
133650	133653	133655	133655	Ron	201	“ Oh , ”
133660	133666	133655	133655	Ron	201	“ Yeah . All right . ”
133667	133684	133686	133686	Harry	136	“ If you do n’t want to go out with her anymore , just tell her , ”
133688	133702	133704	133704	Ron	201	“ Yeah ... well ... it ’s not that easy , is it ? ”
133709	133719	133720	133720	he	201	“ Hermione going to look in before the match ? ”
133724	133738	133686	133686	Harry	136	“ No , she ’s already gone down to the pitch with Ginny . ”
133739	133742	133744	133744	Ron	201	“ Oh , ”
133750	133768	133744	133744	Ron	201	“ Right . Well , good luck . Hope you hammer McLag — I mean , Smith . ”
133769	133774	133776	133776	Harry	136	“ I ’ll try , ”
133782	133789	133776	133776	Harry	136	“ See you after the match . ”
133885	133891	133892	133892	Harry	136	“ Where ’re you going ? ”
133895	133914	133916	133916	Malfoy	159	“ Yeah , I ’m really going to tell you , because it ’s your business , Potter , ”
133918	133950	133916	133916	Malfoy	159	“ You ’d better hurry up , they ’ll be waiting for ‘ the Chosen Captain ’ — ‘ the Boy Who Scored ’ — whatever they call you these days . ”
134072	134078	134080	134080	Ginny	218	“ Where have you been ? ”
134115	134120	134121	134121	Harry	136	“ I met Malfoy , ”
134136	134139	134127	134127	he	136	“ So ? ”
134140	134166	134123	134123	her	218	“ So I wanted to know how come he ’s up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is down here ... ”
134167	134174	134127	134127	he	136	“ Does it matter right now ? ”
134175	134189	134191	134191	Harry	136	“ Well , I ’m not likely to find out , am I ? ”
134202	134207	134191	134191	Harry	136	“ Come on then ! ”
134247	134251	134252	134252	McLaggen	272	“ Tricky conditions ! ”
134259	134282	134252	134252	McLaggen	272	“ Coote , Peakes , you ’ll want to fly out of the sun , so they do n’t see you coming — ”
134283	134297	134299	134299	Harry	136	“ I ’m the Captain , McLaggen , shut up giving them instructions , ”
134302	134310	134299	134299	Harry	136	“ Just get up by the goalposts ! ”
134324	134335	134336	134336	he	136	“ Make sure you do fly out of the sun , ”
134421	134432	134522	134523	the commentator	1980	“ And that ’s Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle , ”
134443	134517	134522	134523	the commentator	1980	“ He did the commentary last time , of course , and Ginny Weasley flew into him , I think probably on purpose , it looked like it . Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor , I expect he regrets that now he ’s playing them — oh , look , he ’s lost the Quaffle , Ginny took it from him , I do like her , she ’s very nice ... ”
134585	134617	134575	134575	she	232	“ ... but now that big Hufflepuff player ’s got the Quaffle from her , I ca n’t remember his name , it ’s something like Bibble — no , Buggins — ”
134618	134623	134625	134626	Professor McGonagall	232	“ It ’s Cadwallader ! ”
134690	134711	134713	134713	Harry	136	“ McLaggen , will you pay attention to what you ’re supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone ! ”
134722	134731	134732	134732	McLaggen	272	“ You ’re not setting a great example ! ”
134742	134755	134757	134757	Luna	261	“ And Harry Potter ’s now having an argument with his Keeper , ”
134773	134794	134764	134768	Slytherins below in the crowd	2464	“ I do n’t think that ’ll help him find the Snitch , but maybe it ’s a clever ruse ... ”
134922	134927	134984	134984	McLaggen	272	“ Loser ’s Lurgy . ”
134928	134935	134937	134938	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Seventy - forty to Hufflepuff ! ”
134944	134950	134952	134952	Luna	261	“ Is it , already ? ”
134955	134974	134952	134952	Luna	261	“ Oh , look ! The Gryffindor Keeper ’s got hold of one of the Beater ’s bats . ”
135015	135030	135032	135032	Harry	136	“ Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goalposts ! ”
135134	135142	135144	135144	Ron	201	“ Nice of you to drop in , ”
135208	135212	135314	135315	Madam Pomfrey	287	“ What happened ? ”
135213	135217	135219	135220	Madam Pomfrey	287	“ Cracked skull , ”
135232	135262	135219	135220	Madam Pomfrey	287	“ Nothing to worry about , I mended it at once , but I ’m keeping you in overnight . You should n’t overexert yourself for a few hours . ”
135263	135273	135275	135275	Harry	136	“ I do n’t want to stay here overnight , ”
135286	135296	135275	135275	Harry	136	“ I want to find McLaggen and kill him . ”
135297	135312	135314	135315	Madam Pomfrey	287	“ I ’m afraid that would come under the heading of ‘ overexertion , ’ ”
135333	135352	135326	135326	her	287	“ You will stay here until I discharge you , Potter , or I shall call the headmaster . ”
135370	135379	135380	135380	he	136	“ D’you know how much we lost by ? ”
135387	135394	135396	135396	Ron	201	“ Well , yeah I do , ”
135399	135410	135396	135396	Ron	201	“ Final score was three hundred and twenty to sixty . ”
135411	135414	135416	135416	Harry	136	“ Brilliant , ”
135419	135430	135416	135416	Harry	136	“ Really brilliant ! When I get hold of McLaggen — ”
135431	135450	135452	135452	Ron	201	“ You do n’t want to get hold of him , he ’s the size of a troll , ”
135455	135503	135452	135452	Ron	201	“ Personally , I think there ’s a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the Prince ’s . Anyway , the rest of the team might ’ve dealt with him before you get out of here , they ’re not happy ... ”
135567	135577	135579	135579	Ron	201	“ I could hear the match commentary from here , ”
135588	135602	135581	135581	his	201	“ I hope Luna always commentates from now on ... Loser ’s Lurgy ... ”
135626	135637	135638	135638	he	201	“ Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious , ”
135683	135705	135677	135677	Ron	201	“ She reckons you only just arrived on time for the match . How come ? You left here early enough . ”
135706	135709	135711	135711	Harry	136	“ Oh ... ”
135723	135784	135785	135785	Harry	136	“ Yeah ... well , I saw Malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who did n’t look like they wanted to be with him , and that ’s the second time he ’s made sure he is n’t down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school ; he skipped the last match too , remember ? ”
135788	135803	135785	135785	Harry	136	“ Wish I ’d followed him now , the match was such a fiasco ... ”
135804	135810	135812	135812	Ron	201	“ Do n’t be stupid , ”
135815	135834	135812	135812	Ron	201	“ You could n’t have missed a Quidditch match just to follow Malfoy , you ’re the Captain ! ”
135835	135846	135848	135848	Harry	136	“ I want to know what he ’s up to , ”
135850	135873	135848	135848	Harry	136	“ And do n’t tell me it ’s all in my head , not after what I overheard between him and Snape — ”
135874	135885	135887	135887	Ron	201	“ I never said it was all in your head , ”
135902	135947	135887	135887	Ron	201	“ but there ’s no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place ! You ’re getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy , Harry . I mean , thinking about missing a match just to follow him ... ”
135948	135957	135959	135959	Harry	136	“ I want to catch him at it ! ”
135963	135978	135959	135959	Harry	136	“ I mean , where ’s he going when he disappears off the map ? ”
135979	135985	135987	135987	Ron	201	“ I dunno ... Hogsmeade ? ”
135991	136017	135959	135959	Harry	136	“ I ’ve never seen him going along any of the secret passageways on the map . I thought they were being watched now anyway ? ”
136018	136025	136027	136027	Ron	201	“ Well then , I dunno , ”
136386	136389	136380	136380	Harry	136	“ Kreacher ? ”
136415	136421	136409	136409	Ron	201	“ What ’s going — ? ”
136438	136441	136422	136422	Harry	136	“ Muffliato ! ”
136531	136539	136540	136540	he	396	“ I was watching that , Potty ! ”
136558	136572	136540	136540	he	396	“ Look at the ickle creatures squabbling , bitey bitey , punchy punchy — ”
136573	136600	136602	136602	Dobby	428	“ Kreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of Dobby , no he wo n’t , or Dobby will shut Kreacher ’s mouth for him ! ”
136610	136616	136618	136618	Peeves	396	“ — kicky , scratchy ! ”
136634	136639	136618	136618	Peeves	396	“ Tweaky , pokey ! ”
136640	136677	136696	136696	Dobby	428	“ Kreacher will say what he likes about his master , oh yes , and what a master he is , filthy friend of Mudbloods , oh , what would poor Kreacher ’s mistress say — ? ”
136754	136770	136745	136745	Peeves	396	“ Stick your fingers up his nosey , draw his cork and pull his earsies — ”
136780	136783	136771	136771	Harry	136	“ Langlock ! ”
136823	136827	136829	136829	Ron	201	“ Nice one , ”
136849	136860	136829	136829	Ron	201	“ That was another Prince hex , was n’t it ? ”
136861	136864	136866	136866	Harry	136	“ Yeah , ”
136878	136914	136866	136866	Harry	136	“ Right — I ’m forbidding you to fight each other ! Well , Kreacher , you ’re forbidden to fight Dobby . Dobby , I know I ’m not allowed to give you orders — ”
136915	136942	136944	136944	Dobby	428	“ Dobby is a free house - elf and he can obey anyone he likes and Dobby will do whatever Harry Potter wants him to do ! ”
136958	136962	136964	136964	Harry	136	“ Okay then , ”
136986	136991	137001	137001	he	172	“ Master called me ? ”
137014	137020	137022	137022	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I did , ”
137054	137063	137046	137046	she	287	“ I ’ve got a job for you . ”
137064	137072	137074	137074	Kreacher	172	“ Kreacher will do whatever Master wants , ”
137088	137107	137074	137074	Kreacher	172	“ because Kreacher has no choice , but Kreacher is ashamed to have such a master , yes — ”
137108	137117	137119	137119	Dobby	428	“ Dobby will do it , Harry Potter ! ”
137133	137143	137119	137119	Dobby	428	“ Dobby would be honored to help Harry Potter ! ”
137144	137161	137163	137163	Harry	136	“ Come to think of it , it would be good to have both of you , ”
137165	137177	137163	137163	Harry	136	“ Okay then ... I want you to tail Draco Malfoy . ”
137195	137226	137191	137191	Harry	136	“ I want to know where he ’s going , who he ’s meeting , and what he ’s doing . I want you to follow him around the clock . ”
137227	137233	137235	137235	Dobby	428	“ Yes , Harry Potter ! ”
137246	137266	137235	137235	Dobby	428	“ And if Dobby does it wrong , Dobby will throw himself off the topmost tower , Harry Potter ! ”
137267	137277	137279	137279	Harry	136	“ There wo n’t be any need for that , ”
137282	137294	137296	137296	Kreacher	172	“ Master wants me to follow the youngest of the Malfoys ? ”
137298	137317	137296	137296	Kreacher	172	“ Master wants me to spy upon the pure - blood great - nephew of my old mistress ? ”
137318	137324	137326	137326	Harry	136	“ That ’s the one , ”
137339	137387	137326	137326	Harry	136	“ And you ’re forbidden to tip him off , Kreacher , or to show him what you ’re up to , or to talk to him at all , or to write him messages or ... or to contact him in any way . Got it ? ”
137434	137462	137423	137423	Kreacher	172	“ Master thinks of everything , and Kreacher must obey him even though Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the Malfoy boy , oh yes ... ”
137463	137470	137472	137472	Harry	136	“ That ’s settled , then , ”
137474	137522	137472	137472	Harry	136	“ I ’ll want regular reports , but make sure I ’m not surrounded by people when you turn up . Ron and Hermione are okay . And do n’t tell anyone what you ’re doing . Just stick to Malfoy like a couple of wart plasters . ”
137611	137618	137619	137619	he	136	“ What did they row about ? ”
137676	137682	137684	137684	Hermione	179	“ It ’s all right ! ”
137693	137696	137684	137684	Hermione	179	“ Here ... ”
137708	137711	137697	137697	She	179	“ Reparo . ”
137742	137750	137751	137751	he	201	“ I swear they ’re getting smaller , ”
137754	137759	137761	137761	Harry	136	“ Never mind her , ”
137767	137778	137761	137761	Harry	136	“ What did Ginny and Dean row about , Hermione ? ”
137779	137793	137795	137795	Hermione	179	“ Oh , Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludger at you , ”
137797	137804	137806	137806	Ron	201	“ It must ’ve looked funny , ”
137809	137818	137820	137820	Hermione	179	“ It did n’t look funny at all ! ”
137823	137844	137820	137820	Hermione	179	“ It looked terrible and if Coote and Peakes had n’t caught Harry he could have been very badly hurt ! ”
137845	137864	137866	137866	Harry	136	“ Yeah , well , there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up over it , ”
137874	137881	137866	137866	Harry	136	“ Or are they still together ? ”
137882	137895	137897	137897	Hermione	179	“ Yes , they are — but why are you so interested ? ”
137905	137918	137919	137919	he	136	“ I just do n’t want my Quidditch team messed up again ! ”
137942	137945	137924	137924	Hermione	179	“ Harry ! ”
137957	137964	137994	137994	She	261	“ Oh , hi , Luna . ”
137965	137976	137978	137978	Luna	261	“ I went to the hospital wing to find you , ”
137985	137993	137978	137978	Luna	261	“ But they said you ’d left ... ”
138039	138050	138034	138034	she	261	“ ... I ’ve been told to give you this . ”
138073	138076	138077	138077	he	136	“ Tonight , ”
138089	138095	138097	138097	Ron	201	“ Nice commentary last match ! ”
138120	138132	138133	138133	she	261	“ You ’re making fun of me , are n’t you ? ”
138136	138143	138133	138133	she	261	“ Everyone says I was dreadful . ”
138144	138151	138153	138153	Ron	201	“ No , I ’m serious ! ”
138156	138173	138174	138174	he	201	“ I ca n’t remember enjoying commentary more ! What is this , by the way ? ”
138186	138194	138195	138195	she	261	“ Oh , it ’s a Gurdyroot , ”
138210	138237	138195	138195	she	261	“ You can keep it if you like , I ’ve got a few of them . They ’re really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies . ”
138252	138264	138265	138265	he	201	“ You know , she ’s grown on me , Luna , ”
138278	138292	138265	138265	he	201	“ I know she ’s insane , but it ’s in a good — ”
138313	138316	138318	138318	Ron	201	“ Hi , ”
138321	138325	138326	138326	Harry	136	“ C’m on , ”
138345	138365	138342	138342	Lavender	306	“ Why did n’t you tell me you were getting out today ? And why was she with you ? ”
138497	138504	138506	138506	Harry	136	“ Thanks a lot , Hermione , ”
138530	138546	138517	138517	he	136	“ Listen , I ’ve got to hurry or I ’ll be late for Dumbledore ... ”
138621	138624	138626	138626	Dumbledore	138	“ Enter , ”
138652	138655	138656	138656	she	298	“ Aha ! ”
138673	138691	138656	138656	she	298	“ So this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office , Dumbledore ! ”
138692	138697	138699	138699	Dumbledore	138	“ My dear Sybill , ”
138706	138739	138699	138699	Dumbledore	138	“ there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere , but Harry does have an appointment , and I really do n’t think there is any more to be said — ”
138740	138744	138746	138747	Professor Trelawney	298	“ Very well , ”
138755	138782	138746	138747	Professor Trelawney	298	“ If you will not banish the usurping nag , so be it ... Perhaps I shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated ... ”
138815	138826	138828	138828	Dumbledore	138	“ Please close the door and sit down , Harry , ”
138871	138884	138885	138885	Harry	136	“ Professor Trelawney still is n’t happy Firenze is teaching , then ? ”
138888	138891	138893	138893	Dumbledore	138	“ No , ”
138895	138992	138893	138893	Dumbledore	138	“ Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen , never having studied the subject myself . I can not ask Firenze to return to the forest , where he is now an outcast , nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave . Between ourselves , she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle . She does not know — and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her — that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort , you see . ”
139002	139037	138993	138993	Dumbledore	138	“ But never mind my staffing problems . We have much more important matters to discuss . Firstly — have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson ? ”
139038	139041	139043	139043	Harry	136	“ Ah , ”
139094	139123	139091	139092	Professor Slughorn	199	“ Well , I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions , sir , but , er , he would n’t give it to me . ”
139130	139134	139136	139136	Dumbledore	138	“ I see , ”
139165	139211	139136	139136	Dumbledore	138	“ And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter , do you ? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity ? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory ? ”
139212	139215	139216	139216	Harry	136	“ Well , ”
139242	139274	139228	139228	His	136	“ Well ... the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn . I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood — ”
139275	139281	139283	139283	Dumbledore	138	“ And did that work ? ”
139285	139297	139228	139228	His	136	“ Well , no , sir , because Ron got poisoned — ”
139298	139406	139433	139433	his	138	“ — which , naturally , made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory ; I would have expected nothing else , while your best friend was in danger . Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full recovery , however , I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you . I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is . Indeed , I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it . ”
139460	139463	139464	139464	he	136	“ Sir , ”
139471	139492	139464	139464	he	136	“ it is n’t that I was n’t bothered or anything , I ’ve just had other — other things ... ”
139493	139500	139501	139501	Dumbledore	138	“ Other things on your mind , ”
139508	139512	139501	139501	Dumbledore	138	“ I see . ”
139585	139620	139582	139582	he	136	“ Professor Dumbledore , I ’m really sorry . I should have done more ... I should have realized you would n’t have asked me to do it if it was n’t really important . ”
139621	139630	139632	139632	Dumbledore	138	“ Thank you for saying that , Harry , ”
139635	139670	139632	139632	Dumbledore	138	“ May I hope , then , that you will give this matter higher priority from now on ? There will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory . ”
139671	139686	139687	139687	he	136	“ I ’ll do it , sir , I ’ll get it from him , ”
139691	139703	139705	139705	Dumbledore	138	“ Then we shall say no more about it just now , ”
139709	139726	139705	139705	Dumbledore	138	“ but continue with our story where we left off . You remember where that was ? ”
139727	139732	139734	139734	Harry	136	“ Yes , sir , ”
139737	139774	139775	139775	he	136	“ Voldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his Uncle Morfin did it . Then he went back to Hogwarts and he asked ... he asked Professor Slughorn about Horcruxes , ”
139779	139783	139785	139785	Dumbledore	138	“ Very good , ”
139787	139822	139785	139785	Dumbledore	138	“ Now , you will remember , I hope , that I told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation ? ”
139823	139828	139705	139705	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , sir . ”
139829	139862	139785	139785	Dumbledore	138	“ Thus far , as I hope you agree , I have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what Voldemort did until the age of seventeen ? ”
139866	139872	139874	139874	Dumbledore	138	“ But now , Harry , ”
139876	139959	139874	139874	Dumbledore	138	“ now things become murkier and stranger . If it was difficult to find evidence about the boy Riddle , it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man Voldemort . In fact , I doubt whether there is a soul alive , apart from himself , who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts . However , I have two last memories that I would like to share with you . ”
139972	139994	139960	139960	Dumbledore	138	“ I shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely . ”
140047	140071	140072	140072	he	138	“ I hope you are not tired of diving into other people ’s memories , for they are curious recollections , these two , ”
140075	140081	140082	140082	Harry	136	“ At Borgin and Burkes ? ”
140087	140093	140095	140095	Dumbledore	138	“ At Borgin and Burkes , ”
140098	140170	140095	140095	Dumbledore	138	“ I think you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered Hokey ’s memory . But this was not Voldemort ’s first choice of job . Hardly anyone knew of it at the time — I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster confided — but Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet and asked whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a teacher . ”
140171	140180	140182	140182	Harry	136	“ He wanted to stay here ? Why ? ”
140188	140206	140208	140208	Dumbledore	138	“ I believe he had several reasons , though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet , ”
140210	140256	140208	140208	Dumbledore	138	“ Firstly , and very importantly , Voldemort was , I believe , more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person . Hogwarts was where he had been happiest ; the first and only place he had felt at home . ”
140276	140288	140257	140257	Harry	136	“ Secondly , the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic . ”
140289	140300	140257	140257	Harry	136	“ But he did n’t get the job , sir ? ”
140301	140337	140257	140257	Harry	136	“ No , he did not . Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen , but invited him to reapply in a few years , if he still wished to teach . ”
140338	140348	140350	140350	Harry	136	“ How did you feel about that , sir ? ”
140353	140357	140359	140359	Dumbledore	138	“ Deeply uneasy , ”
140361	140416	140359	140359	Dumbledore	138	“ I had advised Armando against the appointment — I did not give the reasons I have given you , for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty . But I did not want Lord Voldemort back at this school , and especially not in a position of power . ”
140417	140434	140257	140257	Harry	136	“ Which job did he want , sir ? What subject did he want to teach ? ”
140447	140600	140678	140678	he	138	“ Defense Against the Dark Arts . It was being taught at the time by an old professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought , who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years . So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes , and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was , a brilliant young wizard like that , working in a shop . However , Voldemort was no mere assistant . Polite and handsome and clever , he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes , which specializes , as you know , Harry , in objects with unusual and powerful properties . Voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners , and he was , by all accounts , unusually gifted at doing this . ”
140601	140608	140610	140610	Harry	136	“ I ’ll bet he was , ”
140617	140622	140624	140624	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , quite , ”
140631	140663	140624	140624	Dumbledore	138	“ And now it is time to hear from Hokey the house - elf , who worked for a very old , very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith . ”
140693	140699	140678	140678	he	138	“ After you , Harry . ”
140814	140820	140822	140822	Hepzibah	462	“ Hurry up , Hokey ! ”
140825	140850	140822	140822	Hepzibah	462	“ He said he ’d come at four , it ’s only a couple of minutes to and he ’s never been late yet ! ”
140902	140908	140910	140910	Hepzibah	462	“ How do I look ? ”
140927	140932	140934	140934	Hokey	459	“ Lovely , madam , ”
140984	140995	140997	140997	Hepzibah	462	“ Quick , quick , he ’s here , Hokey ! ”
141187	141193	141194	141194	he	2532	“ I brought you flowers , ”
141206	141216	141225	141225	she	2532	“ You naughty boy , you should n’t have ! ”
141238	141260	141225	141225	she	2532	“ You do spoil this old lady , Tom ... Sit down , sit down ... Where ’s Hokey ? Ah ... ”
141288	141294	141296	141296	Hepzibah	462	“ Help yourself , Tom , ”
141298	141332	141296	141296	Hepzibah	462	“ I know how you love my cakes . Now , how are you ? You look pale . They overwork you at that shop , I ’ve said it a hundred times ... ”
141340	141352	141353	141353	she	873	“ Well , what ’s your excuse for visiting this time ? ”
141360	141377	141379	141379	Voldemort	178	“ Mr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblin - made armor , ”
141381	141395	141379	141379	Voldemort	178	“ Five hundred Galleons , he feels it is a more than fair — ”
141396	141417	141419	141419	Hepzibah	462	“ Now , now , not so fast , or I ’ll think you ’re only here for my trinkets ! ”
141421	141430	141432	141432	Voldemort	178	“ I am ordered here because of them , ”
141435	141460	141432	141432	Voldemort	178	“ I am only a poor assistant , madam , who must do as he is told . Mr. Burke wishes me to inquire — ”
141461	141469	141471	141471	Hepzibah	462	“ Oh , Mr. Burke , phooey ! ”
141478	141568	141471	141471	Hepzibah	462	“ I ’ve something to show you that I ’ve never shown Mr. Burke ! Can you keep a secret , Tom ? Will you promise you wo n’t tell Mr. Burke I ’ve got it ? He ’d never let me rest if he knew I ’d shown it to you , and I ’m not selling , not to Burke , not to anyone ! But you , Tom , you ’ll appreciate it for its history , not how many Galleons you can get for it . ”
141569	141582	141584	141584	Voldemort	178	“ I ’d be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me , ”
141594	141632	141471	141471	Hepzibah	462	“ I had Hokey bring it out for me ... Hokey , where are you ? I want to show Mr. Riddle our finest treasure ... In fact , bring both , while you ’re at it ... ”
141633	141638	141640	141643	the house - elf	873	“ Here , madam , ”
141695	141698	141700	141700	Hepzibah	464	“ Now , ”
141724	141756	141757	141757	She	464	“ I think you ’ll like this , Tom ... Oh , if my family knew I was showing you ... They ca n’t wait to get their hands on this ! ”
141787	141808	141810	141810	Hepzibah	464	“ I wonder whether you know what it is , Tom ? Pick it up , have a good look ! ”
141871	141875	141877	141877	Voldemort	178	“ A badger , ”
141886	141892	141877	141877	Voldemort	178	“ Then this was ... ? ”
141893	141908	141910	141910	Hepzibah	464	“ Helga Hufflepuff ’s , as you very well know , you clever boy ! ”
141927	141987	141910	141910	Hepzibah	464	“ Did n’t I tell you I was distantly descended ? This has been handed down in the family for years and years . Lovely , is n’t it ? And all sorts of powers it ’s supposed to possess too , but I have n’t tested them thoroughly , I just keep it nice and safe in here ... ”
142031	142035	142037	142037	Hepzibah	464	“ Now then , ”
142040	142059	142037	142037	Hepzibah	464	“ where ’s Hokey ? Oh yes , there you are — take that away now , Hokey . ”
142082	142094	142095	142095	she	464	“ I think you ’ll like this even more , Tom , ”
142098	142144	142095	142095	she	464	“ Lean in a little , dear boy , so you can see ... Of course , Burke knows I ’ve got this one , I bought it from him , and I daresay he ’d love to get it back when I ’m gone ... ”
142193	142198	142199	142199	he	178	“ Slytherin ’s mark , ”
142213	142218	142220	142220	Hepzibah	464	“ That ’s right ! ”
142238	142302	142230	142230	Voldemort	178	“ I had to pay an arm and a leg for it , but I could n’t let it pass , not a real treasure like that , had to have it for my collection . Burke bought it , apparently , from a ragged - looking woman who seemed to have stolen it , but had no idea of its true value — ”
142332	142372	142373	142373	She	464	“ — I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you are ... Pretty , is n’t it ? And again , all kinds of powers attributed to it , though I just keep it nice and safe ... ”
142415	142432	142433	142433	She	464	“ So there you are , Tom , dear , and I hope you enjoyed that ! ”
142453	142461	142433	142433	She	464	“ Are you all right , dear ? ”
142462	142466	142468	142468	Voldemort	178	“ Oh yes , ”
142471	142479	142468	142468	Voldemort	178	“ Yes , I ’m very well ... ”
142480	142494	142496	142496	Hepzibah	464	“ I thought — but a trick of the light , I suppose — ”
142518	142536	142505	142505	she	464	“ Here , Hokey , take these away and lock them up again ... The usual enchantments ... ”
142537	142544	142546	142546	Dumbledore	138	“ Time to leave , Harry , ”
142582	142593	142595	142595	Dumbledore	138	“ Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene , ”
142609	142630	142595	142595	Dumbledore	138	“ Hokey the house - elf was convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her mistress ’s evening cocoa by accident . ”
142631	142635	142637	142637	Harry	136	“ No way ! ”
142640	142649	142651	142651	Dumbledore	138	“ I see we are of one mind , ”
142653	142691	142651	142651	Dumbledore	138	“ Certainly , there are many similarities between this death and that of the Riddles . In both cases , somebody else took the blame , someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death — ”
142692	142696	142595	142595	Dumbledore	138	“ Hokey confessed ? ”
142697	142724	142726	142726	Dumbledore	138	“ She remembered putting something in her mistress ’s cocoa that turned out not to be sugar , but a lethal and little - known poison , ”
142728	142747	142726	142726	Dumbledore	138	“ It was concluded that she had not meant to do it , but being old and confused — ”
142748	142761	142595	142595	Dumbledore	138	“ Voldemort modified her memory , just like he did with Morfin ! ”
142762	142771	142773	142773	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , that is my conclusion too , ”
142775	142791	142773	142773	Dumbledore	138	“ And , just as with Morfin , the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey — ”
142792	142802	142804	142804	Harry	136	“ — because she was a house - elf , ”
142822	142825	142827	142827	Dumbledore	138	“ Precisely , ”
142829	142832	142834	142834	Harry	136	“ But , ”
142838	142855	142834	142834	Harry	136	“ it seems mad ... Risking everything , throwing away his job , just for those ... ”
142856	142868	142870	142870	Dumbledore	138	“ Mad to you , perhaps , but not to Voldemort , ”
142872	142915	142870	142870	Dumbledore	138	“ I hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him , Harry , but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket , at least , as rightfully his . ”
142916	142921	142923	142923	Harry	136	“ The locket maybe , ”
142925	142934	142923	142923	Harry	136	“ but why take the cup as well ? ”
142935	142946	142948	142948	Dumbledore	138	“ It had belonged to another of Hogwarts ’s founders , ”
142950	143050	142948	142948	Dumbledore	138	“ I think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts history . There were other reasons , I think ... I hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course . And now for the very last recollection I have to show you , at least until you manage to retrieve Professor Slughorn ’s memory for us . Ten years separate Hokey ’s memory and this one , ten years during which we can only guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing ... ”
143068	143074	143075	143075	he	138	“ Whose memory is it ? ”
143078	143081	143083	143083	Dumbledore	138	“ Mine , ”
143222	143225	143219	143219	he	138	“ Enter . ”
143377	143383	143385	143385	Dumbledore	138	“ Good evening , Tom , ”
143388	143395	143385	143385	Dumbledore	138	“ Wo n’t you sit down ? ”
143396	143400	143405	143405	he	178	“ Thank you , ”
143434	143443	143444	143444	he	178	“ I heard that you had become headmaster , ”
143460	143465	143444	143444	he	178	“ A worthy choice . ”
143466	143473	143475	143475	Dumbledore	138	“ I am glad you approve , ”
143479	143487	143475	143475	Dumbledore	138	“ May I offer you a drink ? ”
143488	143494	143496	143496	Voldemort	178	“ That would be welcome , ”
143498	143506	143496	143496	Voldemort	178	“ I have come a long way . ”
143552	143565	143543	143543	he	138	“ So , Tom ... to what do I owe the pleasure ? ”
143579	143590	143591	143591	he	178	“ They do not call me ‘ Tom ’ anymore , ”
143594	143603	143591	143591	he	178	“ These days , I am known as — ”
143604	143613	143615	143615	Dumbledore	138	“ I know what you are known as , ”
143620	143661	143615	143615	Dumbledore	138	“ But to me , I ’m afraid , you will always be Tom Riddle . It is one of the irritating things about old teachers . I am afraid that they never quite forget their charges ’ youthful beginnings . ”
143722	143733	143735	143735	Voldemort	178	“ I am surprised you have remained here so long , ”
143741	143757	143735	143735	Voldemort	178	“ I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school . ”
143758	143761	143763	143763	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , ”
143768	143807	143763	143763	Dumbledore	138	“ to a wizard such as myself , there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills , helping hone young minds . If I remember correctly , you once saw the attraction of teaching too . ”
143808	143814	143816	143816	Voldemort	178	“ I see it still , ”
143818	143851	143816	143816	Voldemort	178	“ I merely wondered why you — who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry , and who have twice , I think , been offered the post of Minister — ”
143852	143862	143864	143864	Dumbledore	138	“ Three times at the last count , actually , ”
143866	143888	143864	143864	Dumbledore	138	“ But the Ministry never attracted me as a career . Again , something we have in common , I think . ”
143931	143936	143937	143937	he	178	“ I have returned , ”
143945	144031	143937	143937	he	178	“ later , perhaps , than Professor Dippet expected ... but I have returned , nevertheless , to request again what he once told me I was too young to have . I have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle , to teach . I think you must know that I have seen and done much since I left this place . I could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard . ”
144048	144066	144067	144067	he	178	“ Yes , I certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us , ”
144071	144094	144067	144067	he	178	“ Rumors of your doings have reached your old school , Tom . I should be sorry to believe half of them . ”
144104	144124	144101	144101	he	178	“ Greatness inspires envy , envy engenders spite , spite spawns lies . You must know this , Dumbledore . ”
144125	144142	144144	144144	Dumbledore	138	“ You call it ‘ greatness , ’ what you have been doing , do you ? ”
144147	144150	144152	144152	Voldemort	178	“ Certainly , ”
144162	144185	144155	144155	his	178	“ I have experimented ; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further , perhaps , than they have ever been pushed — ”
144186	144193	144194	144194	Dumbledore	138	“ Of some kinds of magic , ”
144199	144215	144194	144194	Dumbledore	138	“ Of some . Of others , you remain ... forgive me ... woefully ignorant . ”
144242	144247	144248	144248	he	178	“ The old argument , ”
144252	144279	144248	144248	he	178	“ But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic , Dumbledore . ”
144280	144291	144293	144293	Dumbledore	138	“ Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places , ”
144295	144314	144316	144316	Voldemort	178	“ Well , then , what better place to start my fresh researches than here , at Hogwarts ? ”
144318	144352	144316	144316	Voldemort	178	“ Will you let me return ? Will you let me share my knowledge with your students ? I place myself and my talents at your disposal . I am yours to command . ”
144358	144388	144355	144355	his	138	“ And what will become of those whom you command ? What will happen to those who call themselves — or so rumor has it — the Death Eaters ? ”
144417	144421	144422	144422	he	178	“ My friends , ”
144431	144442	144422	144422	he	178	“ will carry on without me , I am sure . ”
144443	144455	144457	144457	Dumbledore	138	“ I am glad to hear that you consider them friends , ”
144459	144475	144457	144457	Dumbledore	138	“ I was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants . ”
144476	144481	144483	144483	Voldemort	178	“ You are mistaken , ”
144485	144549	144483	144483	Voldemort	178	“ Then if I were to go to the Hog ’s Head tonight , I would not find a group of them — Nott , Rosier , Mulciber , Dolohov — awaiting your return ? Devoted friends indeed , to travel this far with you on a snowy night , merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post . ”
144582	144591	144576	144576	he	138	“ You are omniscient as ever , Dumbledore . ”
144592	144603	144605	144605	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh no , merely friendly with the local barmen , ”
144608	144613	144605	144605	Dumbledore	138	“ Now , Tom ... ”
144640	144669	144576	144576	he	138	“ Let us speak openly . Why have you come here tonight , surrounded by henchmen , to request a job we both know you do not want ? ”
144675	144695	144670	144670	Voldemort	178	“ A job I do not want ? On the contrary , Dumbledore , I want it very much . ”
144696	144743	144744	144744	Voldemort	178	“ Oh , you want to come back to Hogwarts , but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen . What is it you ’re after , Tom ? Why not try an open request for once ? ”
144747	144759	144744	144744	Voldemort	178	“ If you do not want to give me a job — ”
144760	144767	144769	144769	Dumbledore	138	“ Of course I do n’t , ”
144771	144801	144769	144769	Dumbledore	138	“ And I do n’t think for a moment you expected me to . Nevertheless , you came here , you asked , you must have had a purpose . ”
144821	144828	144815	144815	his	178	“ This is your final word ? ”
144829	144833	144835	144835	Dumbledore	138	“ It is , ”
144840	144852	144835	144835	Dumbledore	138	“ Then we have nothing more to say to each other . ”
144853	144858	144860	144860	Dumbledore	138	“ No , nothing , ”
144870	144908	144867	144867	his	138	“ The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes . But I wish I could , Tom ... I wish I could ... ”
145010	145013	145015	145015	Harry	136	“ Why ? ”
145026	145039	145015	145015	Harry	136	“ Why did he come back ? Did you ever find out ? ”
145040	145045	145047	145047	Dumbledore	138	“ I have ideas , ”
145049	145056	145047	145047	Dumbledore	138	“ but no more than that . ”
145057	145063	145015	145015	Harry	136	“ What ideas , sir ? ”
145064	145082	145084	145084	Dumbledore	138	“ I shall tell you , Harry , when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn , ”
145086	145111	145084	145084	Dumbledore	138	“ When you have that last piece of the jigsaw , everything will , I hope , be clear ... to both of us . ”
145142	145162	145121	145121	Dumbledore	138	“ Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again , sir ? He did n’t say ... ”
145163	145177	145179	145179	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh , he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job , ”
145181	145222	145179	145179	Dumbledore	138	“ The aftermath of our little meeting proved that . You see , we have never been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort . ”
145301	145310	145312	145312	Hermione	179	“ You wo n’t find anything in there , ”
145320	145327	145329	145329	Harry	136	“ Do n’t start , Hermione , ”
145331	145349	145329	145329	Harry	136	“ If it had n’t been for the Prince , Ron would n’t be sitting here now . ”
145350	145365	145367	145367	Hermione	179	“ He would if you ’d just listened to Snape in our first year , ”
145381	145384	145370	145370	Harry	136	“ Sectumsempra ! ”
145394	145398	145374	145374	He	136	“ For Enemies , ”
145591	145600	145602	145602	Ron	201	“ At least you can Apparate , though ! ”
145605	145614	145602	145602	Ron	201	“ You ’ll have no trouble come July ! ”
145615	145623	145624	145624	Harry	136	“ I ’ve only done it once , ”
145717	145740	145742	145742	Hermione	179	“ I ’m telling you , the stupid Prince is n’t going to be able to help you with this , Harry ! ”
145747	145773	145742	145742	Hermione	179	“ There ’s only one way to force someone to do what you want , and that ’s the Imperius Curse , which is illegal — ”
145774	145783	145785	145785	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I know that , thanks , ”
145794	145826	145785	145785	Harry	136	“ That ’s why I ’m looking for something different . Dumbledore says Veritaserum wo n’t do it , but there might be something else , a potion or a spell ... ”
145827	145837	145839	145839	Hermione	179	“ You ’re going about it the wrong way , ”
145841	145881	145839	145839	Hermione	179	“ Only you can get the memory , Dumbledore says . That must mean you can persuade Slughorn where other people ca n’t . It ’s not a question of slipping him a potion , anyone could do that — ”
145882	145890	145892	145892	Ron	201	“ How d’you spell ‘ belligerent ’ ? ”
145905	145916	145892	145892	Ron	201	“ It ca n’t be B — U — M — ”
145917	145924	145926	145926	Hermione	179	“ No , it is n’t , ”
145935	145958	145926	145926	Hermione	179	“ And ‘ augury ’ does n’t begin O — R — G either . What kind of quill are you using ? ”
145959	145983	145892	145892	Ron	201	“ It ’s one of Fred and George ’s Spell - Check ones ... but I think the charm must be wearing off ... ”
145984	145990	145992	145992	Hermione	179	“ Yes , it must , ”
146002	146035	145992	145992	Hermione	179	“ because we were asked how we ’d deal with dementors , not ‘ Dugbogs , ’ and I do n’t remember you changing your name to ‘ Roonil Wazlib ’ either . ”
146036	146040	146042	146042	Ron	201	“ Ah no ! ”
146052	146067	146042	146042	Ron	201	“ Do n’t say I ’ll have to write the whole thing out again ! ”
146068	146078	146080	146080	Hermione	179	“ It ’s okay , we can fix it , ”
146093	146100	146102	146102	Ron	201	“ I love you , Hermione , ”
146124	146134	146115	146115	Hermione	179	“ Do n’t let Lavender hear you saying that . ”
146135	146140	146142	146142	Ron	201	“ I wo n’t , ”
146147	146159	146142	146142	Ron	201	“ Or maybe I will ... then she ’ll ditch me ... ”
146160	146174	146176	146176	Harry	136	“ Why do n’t you ditch her if you want to finish it ? ”
146178	146189	146191	146191	Ron	201	“ You have n’t ever chucked anyone , have you ? ”
146193	146199	146191	146191	Ron	201	“ You and Cho just — ”
146200	146208	146210	146210	Harry	136	“ Sort of fell apart , yeah , ”
146212	146222	146224	146224	Ron	201	“ Wish that would happen with me and Lavender , ”
146252	146280	146240	146240	her	179	“ But the more I hint I want to finish it , the tighter she holds on . It ’s like going out with the giant squid . ”
146281	146284	146286	146286	Hermione	179	“ There , ”
146299	146304	146306	146306	Ron	201	“ Thanks a million , ”
146308	146318	146306	146306	Ron	201	“ Can I borrow your quill for the conclusion ? ”
146430	146433	146427	146427	Harry	136	“ Kreacher ! ”
146447	146469	146434	146437	The house - elf	873	“ Master said he wanted regular reports on what the Malfoy boy is doing , so Kreacher has come to give — ”
146484	146494	146495	146495	he	428	“ Dobby has been helping too , Harry Potter ! ”
146504	146527	146495	146495	he	428	“ And Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is coming to see Harry Potter so they can make their reports together ! ”
146528	146533	146535	146535	Hermione	179	“ What is this ? ”
146545	146553	146535	146535	Hermione	179	“ What ’s going on , Harry ? ”
146586	146597	146598	146598	he	136	“ Well ... they ’ve been following Malfoy for me , ”
146601	146606	146608	146608	Kreacher	172	“ Night and day , ”
146610	146622	146624	146624	Dobby	428	“ Dobby has not slept for a week , Harry Potter ! ”
146636	146657	146632	146632	Hermione	179	“ You have n’t slept , Dobby ? But surely , Harry , you did n’t tell him not to — ”
146658	146667	146669	146669	Harry	136	“ No , of course I did n’t , ”
146672	146691	146692	146692	he	136	“ Dobby , you can sleep , all right ? But has either of you found out anything ? ”
146703	146716	146718	146718	Kreacher	172	“ Master Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood , ”
146722	146739	146718	146718	Kreacher	172	“ His features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those of — ”
146740	146748	146750	146750	Dobby	428	“ Draco Malfoy is a bad boy ! ”
146753	146761	146750	146750	Dobby	428	“ A bad boy who — who — ”
146823	146830	146831	146831	he	428	“ Thank you , Harry Potter , ”
146834	146848	146831	146831	he	428	“ Dobby still finds it difficult to speak ill of his old masters ... ”
146864	146883	146853	146853	Dobby	428	“ But Kreacher should know that Draco Malfoy is not a good master to a house - elf ! ”
146884	146901	146902	146902	Harry	136	“ Yeah , we do n’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy , ”
146906	146919	146902	146902	Harry	136	“ Let ’s fast forward to where he ’s actually been going . ”
146931	146958	146920	146920	Kreacher	172	“ Master Malfoy eats in the Great Hall , he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons , he attends his classes in a variety of — ”
146959	146966	146968	146968	Harry	136	“ Dobby , you tell me , ”
146974	146985	146968	146968	Harry	136	“ Has he been going anywhere he should n’t have ? ”
146986	146992	146994	146994	Dobby	428	“ Harry Potter , sir , ”
147005	147053	146994	146994	Dobby	428	“ the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover , but he is still keen to avoid detection . He has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students , who keep watch for him while he enters — ”
147054	147060	147062	147062	Harry	136	“ The Room of Requirement ! ”
147083	147137	147078	147078	Ron	201	“ That ’s where he ’s been sneaking off to ! That ’s where he ’s doing ... whatever he ’s doing ! And I bet that ’s why he ’s been disappearing off the map — come to think of it , I ’ve never seen the Room of Requirement on there ! ”
147138	147149	147151	147151	Ron	201	“ Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there , ”
147153	147167	147169	147169	Hermione	179	“ I think it ’ll be part of the magic of the room , ”
147171	147184	147169	147169	Hermione	179	“ If you need it to be Unplottable , it will be . ”
147185	147204	147206	147206	Harry	136	“ Dobby , have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoy ’s doing ? ”
147209	147219	147221	147221	Dobby	428	“ No , Harry Potter , that is impossible , ”
147223	147230	147232	147232	Harry	136	“ No , it ’s not , ”
147236	147262	147232	147232	Harry	136	“ Malfoy got into our headquarters there last year , so I ’ll be able to get in and spy on him , no problem . ”
147263	147274	147276	147276	Hermione	179	“ But I do n’t think you will , Harry , ”
147279	147346	147276	147276	Hermione	179	“ Malfoy already knew exactly how we were using the room , did n’t he , because that stupid Marietta had blabbed . He needed the room to become the headquarters of the D.A. , so it did . But you do n’t know what the room becomes when Malfoy goes in there , so you do n’t know what to ask it to transform into . ”
147347	147356	147358	147358	Harry	136	“ There ’ll be a way around that , ”
147361	147369	147358	147358	Harry	136	“ You ’ve done brilliantly , Dobby . ”
147370	147377	147379	147379	Hermione	179	“ Kreacher ’s done well too , ”
147401	147417	147390	147390	his	172	“ The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher , Kreacher will pretend he can not hear — ”
147418	147424	147425	147425	Harry	136	“ Get out of it , ”
147440	147453	147431	147431	Kreacher	172	“ You ’d better go and get some sleep too , Dobby . ”
147454	147463	147465	147465	Dobby	428	“ Thank you , Harry Potter , sir ! ”
147473	147479	147481	147481	Harry	136	“ How good ’s this ? ”
147499	147514	147488	147488	Hermione	179	“ We know where Malfoy ’s going ! We ’ve got him cornered now ! ”
147515	147522	147524	147524	Ron	201	“ Yeah , it ’s great , ”
147562	147581	147583	147583	Hermione	179	“ But what ’s all this about him going up there with a ‘ variety of students ’ ? ”
147585	147611	147583	147583	Hermione	179	“ How many people are in on it ? You would n’t think he ’d trust lots of them to know what he ’s doing ... ”
147612	147619	147621	147621	Harry	136	“ Yeah , that is weird , ”
147625	147653	147621	147621	Harry	136	“ I heard him telling Crabbe it was n’t Crabbe ’s business what he was doing ... so what ’s he telling all these ... all these ... ”
147667	147675	147676	147676	he	136	“ God , I ’ve been stupid , ”
147680	147712	147676	147676	he	136	“ It ’s obvious , is n’t it ? There was a great vat of it down in the dungeon ... He could ’ve nicked some any time during that lesson ... ”
147713	147717	147719	147719	Ron	201	“ Nicked what ? ”
147721	147769	147771	147771	Harry	136	“ Polyjuice Potion . He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slughorn showed us in our first Potions lesson ... There are n’t a whole variety of students standing guard for Malfoy ... it ’s just Crabbe and Goyle as usual ... Yeah , it all fits ! ”
147785	147859	147771	147771	Harry	136	“ They ’re stupid enough to do what they ’re told even if he wo n’t tell them what he ’s up to ... but he does n’t want them to be seen lurking around outside the Room of Requirement , so he ’s got them taking Polyjuice to make them look like other people ... Those two girls I saw him with when he missed Quidditch — ha ! Crabbe and Goyle ! ”
147860	147867	147869	147869	Hermione	179	“ Do you mean to say , ”
147875	147886	147869	147869	Hermione	179	“ that that little girl whose scales I repaired — ? ”
147887	147893	147895	147895	Harry	136	“ Yeah , of course ! ”
147902	147970	147895	147895	Harry	136	“ Of course ! Malfoy must ’ve been inside the room at the time , so she — what am I talking about ? — he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to come out , because there was someone there ! And there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too ! We ’ve been walking past him all the time and not realizing it ! ”
147971	147982	147984	147984	Ron	201	“ He ’s got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls ? ”
147986	148012	147984	147984	Ron	201	“ Blimey ... No wonder they do n’t look too happy these days ... I ’m surprised they do n’t tell him to stuff it ... ”
148013	148032	148034	148034	Harry	136	“ Well , they would n’t , would they , if he ’s shown them his Dark Mark ? ”
148036	148048	148050	148050	Hermione	179	“ Hmmm ... the Dark Mark we do n’t know exists , ”
148073	148078	148080	148080	Harry	136	“ We ’ll see , ”
148083	148089	148090	148090	Hermione	179	“ Yes , we will , ”
148100	148142	148144	148144	she	179	“ But , Harry , before you get all excited , I still do n’t think you ’ll be able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing what ’s there first . And I do n’t think you should forget ”
148159	148179	148144	148144	she	179	“ that what you ’re supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from Slughorn . Good night . ”
148206	148211	148201	148201	he	136	“ What d’you think ? ”
148212	148223	148225	148225	Ron	201	“ Wish I could Disapparate like a house - elf , ”
148236	148247	148225	148225	Ron	201	“ I ’d have that Apparition Test in the bag . ”
148451	148454	148455	148455	he	136	“ Look , ”
148491	148532	148482	148482	her	179	“ I have n’t forgotten about Slughorn , but I have n’t got a clue how to get that memory off him , and until I get a brain wave why should n’t I find out what Malfoy ’s doing ? ”
148533	148546	148548	148548	Hermione	179	“ I ’ve already told you , you need to persuade Slughorn , ”
148550	148582	148584	148584	she	179	“ It ’s not a question of tricking him or bewitching him , or Dumbledore could have done it in a second . Instead of messing around outside the Room of Requirement ”
148604	148619	148584	148584	she	179	“ you should go and find Slughorn and start appealing to his better nature . ”
148620	148626	148628	148628	Ron	201	“ Anyone we know — ? ”
148636	148639	148641	148641	Hermione	179	“ Yes ! ”
148654	148731	148641	148641	Hermione	179	“ But it ’s all right , he ’s not dead — it ’s Mundungus , he ’s been arrested and sent to Azkaban ! Something to do with impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary ... and someone called Octavius Pepper has vanished ... Oh , and how horrible , a nine - year - old boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents , they think he was under the Imperius Curse ... ”
149009	149012	149014	149014	Harry	136	“ Okay , ”
149017	149026	149014	149014	Harry	136	“ Okay ... I thought the wrong thing ... ”
149087	149094	149095	149095	he	136	“ Oh , come off it , ”
149101	149110	149095	149095	he	136	“ That was a clear instruction ... Fine ... ”
149232	149244	149227	149227	Harry	136	“ I need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing inside you ”
149313	149319	149321	149321	Snape	205	“ Late again , Potter , ”
149332	149338	149321	149321	Snape	205	“ Ten points from Gryffindor . ”
149381	149392	149394	149394	Snape	205	“ Before we start , I want your dementor essays , ”
149423	149465	149397	149397	his	205	“ And I hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse . Now , if you will all open your books to page — what is it , Mr. Finnigan ? ”
149466	149469	149471	149471	Seamus	296	“ Sir , ”
149473	149503	149471	149471	Seamus	296	“ I ’ve been wondering , how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost ? Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius — ”
149504	149511	149513	149513	Snape	205	“ No , there was n’t , ”
149519	149528	149397	149397	his	205	“ But sir , I heard people talking — ”
149529	149567	149471	149471	Seamus	296	“ If you had actually read the article in question , Mr. Finnigan , you would have known that the so - called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher . ”
149568	149580	149582	149582	Harry	136	“ I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side , ”
149588	149599	149584	149584	Ron	201	“ Should n’t he be upset Mundungus has been arrest — ”
149600	149614	149616	149616	Snape	205	“ But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject , ”
149634	149652	149627	149627	his	205	“ Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost . ”
149681	149690	149691	149691	he	136	“ Er — well — ghosts are transparent — ”
149694	149700	149702	149702	Snape	205	“ Oh , very good , ”
149708	149738	149704	149704	his	205	“ Yes , it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you , Potter . ‘ Ghosts are transparent . ’ ”
149770	149793	149755	149755	Harry	136	“ Yeah , ghosts are transparent , but Inferi are dead bodies , are n’t they ? So they ’d be solid — ”
149794	149808	149810	149810	Snape	205	“ A five - year - old could have told us as much , ”
149812	149887	149810	149810	Snape	205	“ The Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wizard ’s spells . It is not alive , it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard ’s bidding . A ghost , as I trust that you are all aware by now , is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth ... and of course , as Potter so wisely tells us , transparent . ”
149888	149907	149909	149909	Ron	201	“ Well , what Harry said is the most useful if we ’re trying to tell them apart ! ”
149911	149968	149909	149909	Ron	201	“ When we come face - to - face with one down a dark alley , we ’re going to be having a shufti to see if it ’s solid , are n’t we , we ’re not going to be asking , ‘ Excuse me , are you the imprint of a departed soul ? ’ ”
149986	149993	149995	149995	Snape	205	“ Another ten points from Gryffindor , ”
149997	150025	149995	149995	Snape	205	“ I would expect nothing more sophisticated from you , Ronald Weasley , the boy so solid he can not Apparate half an inch across a room . ”
150026	150029	150031	150031	Hermione	179	“ No ! ”
150044	150062	150031	150031	Hermione	179	“ There ’s no point , you ’ll just end up in detention again , leave it ! ”
150063	150075	150077	150077	Snape	205	“ Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen , ”
150083	150095	150077	150077	Snape	205	“ and read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse ... ”
150171	150182	150184	150184	Ron	201	“ Snape ’s right , though , is n’t he ? ”
150198	150220	150184	150184	Ron	201	“ I dunno whether it ’s worth me taking the test . I just ca n’t get the hang of Apparition . ”
150221	150240	150242	150242	Harry	136	“ You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you , ”
150245	150304	150242	150242	Harry	136	“ It ’ll be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway . Then , if you ’re still not — you know — as good as you ’d like to be , you can postpone the test , do it with me over the summ — Myrtle , this is the boys ’ bathroom ! ”
150339	150342	150343	150343	she	982	“ Oh , ”
150347	150353	150343	150343	she	982	“ It ’s you two . ”
150354	150360	150362	150362	Ron	201	“ Who were you expecting ? ”
150371	150374	150376	150376	Myrtle	224	“ Nobody , ”
150387	150410	150412	150412	she	224	“ He said he ’d come back and see me , but then you said you ’d pop in and visit me too ”
150419	150442	150412	150412	she	224	“ and I have n’t seen you for months and months . I ’ve learned not to expect too much from boys . ”
150443	150454	150456	150456	Harry	136	“ I thought you lived in that girls ’ bathroom ? ”
150474	150478	150479	150479	she	224	“ I do , ”
150488	150513	150479	150479	she	224	“ but that does n’t mean I ca n’t visit other places . I came and saw you in your bath once , remember ? ”
150514	150517	150519	150519	Harry	136	“ Vividly , ”
150521	150529	150530	150530	she	224	“ But I thought he liked me , ”
150534	150560	150530	150530	she	224	“ Maybe if you two left , he ’d come back again ... We had lots in common ... I ’m sure he felt it ... ”
150569	150579	150581	150581	Ron	201	“ When you say you had lots in common , ”
150588	150600	150581	150581	Ron	201	“ d’you mean he lives in an S - bend too ? ”
150601	150604	150606	150606	Myrtle	224	“ No , ”
150619	150656	150609	150609	her	224	“ I mean he ’s sensitive , people bully him too , and he feels lonely and has n’t got anybody to talk to , and he ’s not afraid to show his feelings and cry ! ”
150657	150667	150669	150669	Harry	136	“ There ’s been a boy in here crying ? ”
150672	150677	150669	150669	Harry	136	“ A young boy ? ”
150678	150683	150685	150685	Myrtle	224	“ Never you mind ! ”
150702	150720	150694	150694	Ron	201	“ I promised I would n’t tell anyone , and I ’ll take his secret to the — ”
150721	150729	150731	150731	Ron	201	“ — not the grave , surely ? ”
150736	150742	150731	150731	Ron	201	“ The sewers , maybe ... ”
150779	150784	150785	150785	he	201	“ You ’re right , ”
150796	150813	150785	150785	he	201	“ I ’ll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I decide about taking the test . ”
150907	150913	150915	150915	Hermione	179	“ You ’d do better , ”
150931	150948	150925	150925	her	179	“ to go straight to Slughorn ’s office and try and get that memory from him . ”
150949	150955	150957	150957	Harry	136	“ I ’ve been trying ! ”
151038	151075	151107	151107	his	407	“ He does n’t want to talk to me , Hermione ! He can tell I ’ve been trying to get him on his own again , and he ’s not going to let it happen ! ”
151076	151092	151132	151133	the caretaker	2626	“ Well , you ’ve just got to keep at it , have n’t you ? ”
151204	151216	151197	151197	he	136	“ I solemnly swear that I am up to no good , ”
151413	151425	151398	151398	He	136	“ Hello ... you ’re very pretty , are n’t you ? ”
151616	151619	151607	151607	Harry	136	“ OUCH ! ”
151646	151649	151670	151670	Tonks	209	“ Harry ? ”
151684	151691	151692	151692	he	136	“ What ’re you doing here ? ”
151714	151721	151723	151723	Tonks	209	“ I came to see Dumbledore , ”
151742	151749	151751	151751	Harry	136	“ His office is n’t here , ”
151753	151768	151751	151751	Harry	136	“ it ’s round the other side of the castle , behind the gargoyle — ”
151769	151773	151775	151775	Tonks	209	“ I know , ”
151777	151790	151775	151775	Tonks	209	“ He ’s not there . Apparently he ’s gone away again . ”
151791	151795	151797	151797	Harry	136	“ Has he ? ”
151809	151823	151797	151797	Harry	136	“ Hey — you do n’t know where he goes , I suppose ? ”
151824	151827	151829	151829	Tonks	209	“ No , ”
151831	151841	151797	151797	Harry	136	“ What did you want to see him about ? ”
151842	151847	151849	151849	Tonks	209	“ Nothing in particular , ”
151863	151884	151849	151849	Tonks	209	“ I just thought he might know what ’s going on ... I ’ve heard rumors ... people getting hurt ... ”
151885	151899	151901	151901	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I know , it ’s all been in the papers , ”
151903	151912	151901	151901	Harry	136	“ That little kid trying to kill his — ”
151913	151922	151924	151924	Tonks	209	“ The Prophet ’s often behind the times , ”
151936	151950	151924	151924	Tonks	209	“ You have n’t had any letters from anyone in the Order recently ? ”
151951	151962	151964	151964	Harry	136	“ No one from the Order writes to me anymore , ”
151966	151971	151964	151964	Harry	136	“ not since Sirius — ”
151982	151987	151988	151988	he	136	“ I ’m sorry , ”
151992	152003	151988	151988	he	136	“ I mean ... I miss him , as well ... ”
152004	152007	152009	152009	Tonks	209	“ What ? ”
152020	152031	152014	152014	she	209	“ Well ... I ’ll see you around , Harry ... ”
152148	152158	152159	152159	Ron	201	“ I did it — well , kind of ! ”
152170	152203	152159	152159	Ron	201	“ I was supposed to be Apparating to outside Madam Puddifoot ’s Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit , ended up near Scrivenshaft ’s , but at least I moved ! ”
152204	152208	152210	152210	Harry	136	“ Good one , ”
152212	152220	152210	152210	Harry	136	“ How ’d you do , Hermione ? ”
152221	152230	152232	152232	Ron	201	“ Oh , she was perfect , obviously , ”
152239	152290	152232	152232	Ron	201	“ Perfect deliberation , divination , and desperation or whatever the hell it is — we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and you should ’ve heard Twycross going on about her — I ’ll be surprised if he does n’t pop the question soon — ”
152291	152297	152299	152299	Hermione	179	“ And what about you ? ”
152304	152318	152302	152302	Ron	201	“ Have you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time ? ”
152319	152322	152324	152324	Harry	136	“ Yep , ”
152326	152338	152324	152324	Harry	136	“ And guess who I ran into up there ? Tonks ! ”
152339	152342	152344	152344	Ron	201	“ Tonks ? ”
152352	152364	152324	152324	Harry	136	“ Yeah , she said she ’d come to visit Dumbledore ... ”
152365	152371	152373	152373	Ron	201	“ If you ask me , ”
152384	152402	152382	152382	Tonks	209	“ she ’s cracking up a bit . Losing her nerve after what happened at the Ministry . ”
152403	152410	152412	152412	Hermione	179	“ It ’s a bit odd , ”
152422	152451	152412	152412	Hermione	179	“ She ’s supposed to be guarding the school , why ’s she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when he ’s not even here ? ”
152452	152458	152460	152460	Harry	136	“ I had a thought , ”
152480	152498	152474	152474	Hermione	179	“ You do n’t think she can have been ... you know ... in love with Sirius ? ”
152504	152513	152499	152499	Hermione	179	“ What on earth makes you say that ? ”
152514	152518	152520	152520	Harry	136	“ I dunno , ”
152524	152561	152520	152520	Harry	136	“ but she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name ... and her Patronus is a big four - legged thing now ... I wondered whether it had n’t become ... you know ... him . ”
152562	152568	152570	152570	Hermione	179	“ It ’s a thought , ”
152573	152601	152570	152570	Hermione	179	“ But I still do n’t know why she ’d be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore , if that ’s really why she was here ... ”
152602	152614	152616	152616	Ron	201	“ Goes back to what I said , does n’t it ? ”
152628	152642	152643	152643	he	201	“ She ’s gone a bit funny . Lost her nerve . Women , ”
152649	152655	152643	152643	he	201	“ they ’re easily upset . ”
152656	152660	152662	152662	Hermione	179	“ And yet , ”
152670	152705	152662	152662	Hermione	179	“ I doubt you ’d find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta did n’t laugh at their joke about the hag , the Healer , and the Mimbulus mimbletonia . ”
152782	152793	152794	152794	Hermione	179	“ For the last time , just forget about Malfoy , ”
152877	152883	152885	152885	Hermione	179	“ It is n’t Lavender , ”
152888	152893	152895	152895	Ron	201	“ Oh , good , ”
152899	152903	152905	152906	the girl	4164	“ Harry Potter ? ”
152908	152917	152905	152906	the girl	4164	“ I was asked to give you this . ”
152918	152921	152942	152942	he	136	“ Thanks ... ”
152945	152962	152942	152942	he	136	“ Dumbledore said we would n’t be having any more lessons until I got the memory ! ”
152963	152975	152977	152977	Hermione	179	“ Maybe he wants to check on how you ’re doing ? ”
153023	153028	153030	153030	Harry	136	“ Look at this , ”
153038	153046	153047	153047	she	179	“ Oh , for heaven ’s sake , ”
153067	153072	153073	153073	he	201	“ He ’s mental ! ”
153077	153112	153073	153073	he	201	“ That thing told its mates to eat Harry and me ! Told them to help themselves ! And now Hagrid expects us to go down there and cry over its horrible hairy body ! ”
153113	153120	153122	153122	Hermione	179	“ It ’s not just that , ”
153124	153157	153122	153122	Hermione	179	“ He ’s asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows security ’s a million times tighter and how much trouble we ’d be in if we were caught . ”
153158	153170	153172	153172	Harry	136	“ We ’ve been down to see him by night before , ”
153174	153183	153185	153185	Hermione	179	“ Yes , but for something like this ? ”
153187	153215	153185	153185	Hermione	179	“ We ’ve risked a lot to help Hagrid out , but after all — Aragog ’s dead . If it were a question of saving him — ”
153216	153226	153228	153228	Ron	201	“ — I ’d want to go even less , ”
153231	153252	153228	153228	Ron	201	“ You did n’t meet him , Hermione . Believe me , being dead will have improved him a lot . ”
153281	153292	153294	153294	Hermione	179	“ Harry , you ca n’t be thinking of going , ”
153296	153308	153294	153294	Hermione	179	“ It ’s such a pointless thing to get detention for . ”
153312	153318	153319	153319	he	136	“ Yeah , I know , ”
153322	153333	153319	153319	he	136	“ I s’pose Hagrid’ll have to bury Aragog without us . ”
153334	153340	153342	153342	Hermione	179	“ Yes , he will , ”
153347	153375	153342	153342	Hermione	179	“ Look , Potions will be almost empty this afternoon , with us all off doing our tests ... Try and soften Slughorn up a bit then ! ”
153376	153386	153388	153388	Harry	136	“ Fifty - seventh time lucky , you think ? ”
153391	153394	153396	153396	Ron	201	“ Lucky , ”
153399	153409	153396	153396	Ron	201	“ Harry , that ’s it — get lucky ! ”
153410	153415	153342	153342	Hermione	179	“ What d’you mean ? ”
153416	153422	153396	153396	Ron	201	“ Use your lucky potion ! ”
153423	153433	153435	153435	Hermione	179	“ Ron , that ’s — that ’s it ! ”
153440	153452	153435	153435	Hermione	179	“ Of course ! Why did n’t I think of it ? ”
153459	153463	153464	153464	he	136	“ Felix Felicis ? ”
153467	153478	153464	153464	he	136	“ I dunno ... I was sort of saving it ... ”
153479	153483	153485	153485	Ron	201	“ What for ? ”
153488	153501	153503	153503	Hermione	179	“ What on earth is more important than this memory , Harry ? ”
153577	153586	153588	153588	Hermione	179	“ Harry ? Are you still with us ? ”
153590	153599	153600	153600	he	136	“ Wha — ? Yeah , of course , ”
153607	153635	153600	153600	he	136	“ Well ... okay . If I ca n’t get Slughorn to talk this afternoon , I ’ll take some Felix and have another go this evening . ”
153636	153643	153645	153645	Hermione	179	“ That ’s decided , then , ”
153658	153665	153666	153666	she	179	“ Destination ... determination ... deliberation ... ”
153669	153675	153676	153676	Ron	201	“ Oh , stop that , ”
153680	153694	153676	153676	Ron	201	“ I feel sick enough as it is — quick , hide me ! ”
153695	153701	153703	153703	Hermione	179	“ It is n’t Lavender ! ”
153721	153724	153726	153726	Ron	201	“ Cool , ”
153736	153748	153726	153726	Ron	201	“ Blimey , they do n’t look happy , do they ? ”
153749	153775	153777	153777	Hermione	179	“ They ’re the Montgomery sisters and of course they do n’t look happy , did n’t you hear what happened to their little brother ? ”
153779	153797	153799	153799	Ron	201	“ I ’m losing track of what ’s happening to everyone ’s relatives , to be honest , ”
153801	153846	153726	153726	Ron	201	“ Well , their brother was attacked by a werewolf . The rumor is that their mother refused to help the Death Eaters . Anyway , the boy was only five and he died in St. Mungo ’s , they could n’t save him . ”
153847	153851	153853	153853	Harry	136	“ He died ? ”
153857	153874	153853	153853	Harry	136	“ But surely werewolves do n’t kill , they just turn you into one of them ? ”
153875	153880	153882	153882	Ron	201	“ They sometimes kill , ”
153890	153904	153882	153882	Ron	201	“ I ’ve heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away . ”
153905	153913	153915	153915	Harry	136	“ What was the werewolf ’s name ? ”
153918	153931	153933	153933	Hermione	179	“ Well , the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback , ”
153935	153954	153956	153956	Harry	136	“ I knew it — the maniac who likes attacking kids , the one Lupin told me about ! ”
153965	153976	153977	153977	she	179	“ Harry , you ’ve got to get that memory , ”
153980	154004	153977	153977	she	179	“ It ’s all about stopping Voldemort , is n’t it ? These dreadful things that are happening are all down to him ... ”
154025	154031	154032	154032	Harry	136	“ You ’ll do fine , ”
154056	154060	154032	154032	Harry	136	“ Good luck . ”
154061	154066	154068	154068	Hermione	179	“ And you too ! ”
154101	154110	154112	154112	Slughorn	199	“ All too young to Apparate just yet ? ”
154115	154121	154112	154112	Slughorn	199	“ Not turned seventeen yet ? ”
154127	154131	154133	154133	Slughorn	199	“ Ah well , ”
154136	154160	154133	154133	Slughorn	199	“ as we ’re so few , we ’ll do something fun . I want you all to brew me up something amusing ! ”
154161	154168	154170	154170	Ernie	317	“ That sounds good , sir , ”
154191	154202	154203	154203	he	159	“ What do you mean , ‘ something amusing ’ ? ”
154207	154213	154215	154215	Slughorn	199	“ Oh , surprise me , ”
154409	154416	154423	154423	Slughorn	199	“ An Elixir to Induce Euphoria , ”
154467	154477	154479	154479	Slughorn	199	“ Well , now , this looks absolutely wonderful , ”
154505	154582	154492	154492	he	199	“ Euphoria , I take it ? And what ’s that I smell ? Mmmm ... you ’ve added just a sprig of peppermint , have n’t you ? Unorthodox , but what a stroke of inspiration , Harry , of course , that would tend to counterbalance the occasional side effects of excessive singing and nose - tweaking ... I really do n’t know where you get these brain waves , my boy ... unless — ”
154600	154614	154492	154492	he	199	“ — it ’s just your mother ’s genes coming out in you ! ”
154615	154622	154624	154624	Harry	136	“ Oh ... yeah , maybe , ”
154684	154687	154677	154677	Slughorn	199	“ passable . ”
154700	154703	154704	154704	Harry	136	“ Sir , ”
154738	154753	154755	154755	Harry	136	“ Professor — Professor , do n’t you want to taste my po — ? ”
154798	154801	154803	154803	Hermione	179	“ Harry ! ”
154812	154818	154803	154803	Hermione	179	“ Harry , I passed ! ”
154819	154823	154824	154824	he	201	“ Well done ! ”
154827	154831	154824	154824	he	201	“ And Ron ? ”
154832	154839	154841	154841	Hermione	179	“ He — he just failed , ”
154854	154884	154844	154844	Ron	201	“ It was really unlucky , a tiny thing , the examiner just spotted that he ’d left half an eyebrow behind ... How did it go with Slughorn ? ”
154885	154889	154891	154891	Harry	136	“ No joy , ”
154898	154917	154891	154891	Harry	136	“ Bad luck , mate , but you ’ll pass next time — we can take it together . ”
154918	154924	154926	154926	Ron	201	“ Yeah , I s’pose , ”
154929	154939	154926	154926	Ron	201	“ But half an eyebrow ! Like that matters ! ”
154940	154944	154946	154946	Hermione	179	“ I know , ”
154949	154956	154946	154946	Hermione	179	“ it does seem really harsh ... ”
154998	155013	155014	155014	Ron	201	“ So , Harry — you going to use the Felix Felicis or what ? ”
155017	155026	155028	155028	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I s’pose I ’d better , ”
155030	155070	155028	155028	Harry	136	“ I do n’t reckon I ’ll need all of it , not twelve hours ’ worth , it ca n’t take all night ... I ’ll just take a mouthful . Two or three hours should do it . ”
155071	155082	155084	155084	Ron	201	“ It ’s a great feeling when you take it , ”
155087	155096	155084	155084	Ron	201	“ Like you ca n’t do anything wrong . ”
155097	155104	155106	155106	Hermione	179	“ What are you talking about ? ”
155110	155117	155106	155106	Hermione	179	“ You ’ve never taken any ! ”
155118	155131	155133	155133	Ron	201	“ Yeah , but I thought I had , did n’t I ? ”
155141	155146	155133	155133	Ron	201	“ Same difference really ... ”
155272	155278	155280	155280	Harry	136	“ Well , here goes , ”
155295	155302	155304	155304	Hermione	179	“ What does it feel like ? ”
155372	155375	155376	155376	he	136	“ Excellent , ”
155379	155393	155376	155376	he	136	“ Really excellent . Right ... I ’m going down to Hagrid ’s . ”
155394	155397	155399	155399	Ron	201	“ What ? ”
155407	155423	155425	155425	Hermione	179	“ No , Harry — you ’ve got to go and see Slughorn , remember ? ”
155427	155430	155432	155432	Harry	136	“ No , ”
155435	155455	155432	155432	Harry	136	“ I ’m going to Hagrid ’s , I ’ve got a good feeling about going to Hagrid ’s . ”
155456	155469	155471	155471	Ron	201	“ You ’ve got a good feeling about burying a giant spider ? ”
155476	155479	155481	155481	Harry	136	“ Yeah , ”
155492	155510	155481	155481	Harry	136	“ I feel like it ’s the place to be tonight , you know what I mean ? ”
155511	155514	155516	155516	Ron	201	“ No , ”
155527	155536	155538	155538	Hermione	179	“ This is Felix Felicis , I suppose ? ”
155549	155565	155538	155538	Hermione	179	“ You have n’t got another little bottle full of — I do n’t know — ”
155566	155571	155573	155573	Ron	201	“ Essence of Insanity ? ”
155596	155600	155601	155601	he	136	“ Trust me , ”
155604	155615	155617	155617	he	136	“ I know what I ’m doing ... or at least ”
155624	155628	155617	155617	he	136	“ Felix does . ”
155666	155676	155678	155679	Lavender Brown	306	“ What were you doing up there with her ? ”
155753	155763	155764	155764	she	218	“ Do n’t push me , please , Dean , ”
155770	155787	155764	155764	she	218	“ You ’re always doing that , I can get through perfectly well on my own ... ”
156080	156092	156093	156093	Slughorn	199	“ I do thank you for taking the time , Pomona , ”
156098	156114	156093	156093	Slughorn	199	“ most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight . ”
156115	156122	156124	156125	Professor Sprout	307	“ Oh , I quite agree , ”
156128	156134	156124	156125	Professor Sprout	307	“ That enough for you ? ”
156135	156140	156142	156142	Slughorn	199	“ Plenty , plenty , ”
156157	156195	156142	156142	Slughorn	199	“ This should allow for a few leaves for each of my third years , and some to spare if anybody over - stews them ... Well , good evening to you , and many thanks again ! ”
156243	156249	156212	156212	Slughorn	199	“ Good evening , Professor . ”
156250	156262	156264	156264	Slughorn	199	“ Merlin ’s beard , Harry , you made me jump , ”
156275	156285	156264	156264	Slughorn	199	“ How did you get out of the castle ? ”
156286	156298	156300	156300	Harry	136	“ I think Filch must ’ve forgotten to lock the doors , ”
156311	156342	156264	156264	Slughorn	199	“ I ’ll be reporting that man , he ’s more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me ... But why are you out here , Harry ? ”
156343	156352	156354	156354	Harry	136	“ Well , sir , it ’s Hagrid , ”
156372	156395	156354	156354	Harry	136	“ He ’s pretty upset ... But you wo n’t tell anyone , Professor ? I do n’t want trouble for him ... ”
156403	156412	156413	156413	he	199	“ Well , I ca n’t promise that , ”
156417	156443	156413	156413	he	199	“ But I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt , so I ’m sure he ca n’t be up to anything very dreadful ... ”
156444	156472	156561	156561	his	199	“ Well , it ’s this giant spider , he ’s had it for years ... It lived in the forest ... It could talk and everything — ”
156473	156484	156486	156486	Slughorn	199	“ I heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest , ”
156498	156505	156486	156486	Slughorn	199	“ It ’s true , then ? ”
156506	156509	156511	156511	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
156513	156550	156511	156511	Harry	136	“ But this one , Aragog , the first one Hagrid ever got , it died last night . He ’s devastated . He wants company while he buries it and I said I ’d go . ”
156551	156556	156558	156558	Slughorn	199	“ Touching , touching , ”
156575	156641	156561	156561	his	199	“ But acromantula venom is very valuable ... If the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out ... Of course , I would n’t want to do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset ... but if there was any way to procure some ... I mean , it ’s almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while it ’s alive ... ”
156654	156683	156649	156649	himself	199	“ ... seems an awful waste not to collect it ... might get a hundred Galleons a pint ... To be frank , my salary is not large ... ”
156695	156698	156699	156699	he	136	“ Well , ”
156708	156737	156699	156699	he	136	“ well , if you wanted to come , Professor , Hagrid would probably be really pleased ... Give Aragog a better send - off , you know ... ”
156738	156744	156746	156746	Slughorn	199	“ Yes , of course , ”
156755	156821	156748	156748	his	199	“ I tell you what , Harry , I ’ll meet you down there with a bottle or two ... We ’ll drink the poor beast ’s — well — not health — but we ’ll send it off in style , anyway , once it ’s buried . And I ’ll change my tie , this one is a little exuberant for the occasion ... ”
156841	156845	156847	156847	Hagrid	176	“ Yeh came , ”
156867	156878	156880	156880	Harry	136	“ Yeah — Ron and Hermione could n’t , though , ”
156882	156888	156880	156880	Harry	136	“ They ’re really sorry . ”
156889	156909	156946	156946	Harry	136	“ Don ’ — don ’ matter ... He ’d ’ve bin touched yeh’re here , though , Harry ... ”
156966	156973	156974	156974	he	136	“ Where are we burying him ? ”
156977	156981	156974	156974	he	136	“ The forest ? ”
156982	156987	156989	156989	Hagrid	176	“ Blimey , no , ”
157002	157040	156989	156989	Hagrid	176	“ The other spiders won ’ let me anywhere near their webs now Aragog ’s gone . Turns out it was on’y on his orders they didn ’ eat me ! Can yeh believe that , Harry ? ”
157045	157047	157049	157049	Harry	136	“ yes ”
157089	157104	157106	157106	Hagrid	176	“ Never bin an area o ’ the forest I couldn ’ go before ! ”
157112	157159	157109	157109	his	176	“ It wasn ’ easy , gettin ’ Aragog ’s body out o ’ there , I can tell yeh — they usually eat their dead , see ... But I wanted ter give ’ i m a nice burial ... a proper send - off ... ”
157196	157207	157176	157176	he	136	“ Professor Slughorn met me coming down here , Hagrid . ”
157208	157216	157218	157218	Hagrid	176	“ Not in trouble , are yeh ? ”
157225	157247	157218	157218	Hagrid	176	“ Yeh shouldn ’ be outta the castle in the evenin ’ , I know it , it ’s my fault — ”
157248	157276	157278	157278	Harry	136	“ No , no , when he heard what I was doing he said he ’d like to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too , ”
157280	157311	157278	157278	Harry	136	“ He ’s gone to change into something more suitable , I think ... and he said he ’d bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragog ’s memory ... ”

157326	157387	157318	157318	Hagrid	176	“ Tha ’s — tha ’s righ ’ nice of him , that is , an ’ not turnin ’ yeh in either . I ’ve never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before ... Comin ’ ter see old Aragog off , though , eh ? Well ... he ’d ’ve liked that , Aragog would ... ”
157447	157462	157514	157514	His	176	“ Are we going to bury him here , Hagrid , in your garden ? ”
157463	157474	157476	157476	Hagrid	176	“ Jus ’ beyond the pumpkin patch , I thought , ”
157482	157513	157476	157476	Hagrid	176	“ I ’ve already dug the — yeh know — grave . Jus ’ thought we ’d say a few nice things over him — happy memories , yeh know — ”
157567	157570	157571	157571	he	183	“ Hagrid , ”
157581	157591	157571	157571	he	183	“ So very sorry to hear of your loss . ”

157621	157629	157631	157631	Slughorn	183	“ Would n’t have dreamed of it , ”
157633	157646	157631	157631	Slughorn	183	“ Sad night , sad night ... Where is the poor creature ? ”
157647	157651	157653	157653	Hagrid	176	“ Out here , ”
157659	157670	157653	157653	Hagrid	176	“ Shall we — shall we do it , then ? ”
157730	157733	157735	157735	Slughorn	183	“ Magnificent , ”
157788	157799	157801	157801	Hagrid	176	“ It ’s not ev’ryone appreciates how beau’iful they are , ”
157817	157832	157801	157801	Hagrid	176	“ I didn ’ know yeh were int’rested in creatures like Aragog , Horace . ”
157833	157844	157846	157846	Slughorn	183	“ Interested ? My dear Hagrid , I revere them , ”
157878	157888	157867	157867	Hagrid	176	“ Now ... shall we proceed to the burial ? ”
157935	157950	157952	157952	Slughorn	183	“ Of course , it ’s difficult for you , who knew him best , ”
157973	157983	157952	157952	Slughorn	183	“ Why do n’t I say a few words ? ”
158026	158092	158007	158007	he	183	“ Farewell , Aragog , king of arachnids , whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you wo n’t forget ! Though your body will decay , your spirit lingers on in the quiet , web - spun places of your forest home . May your many - eyed descendants ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained . ”
158093	158104	158106	158106	Hagrid	176	“ Tha ’ was ... tha ’ was ... beau’iful ! ”
158121	158126	158128	158128	Slughorn	183	“ There , there , ”
158163	158194	158131	158131	his	183	“ Let ’s get inside and have a drink . Get on his other side , Harry ... That ’s it ... Up you come , Hagrid ... Well done ... ”
158249	158259	158260	158260	he	183	“ I have had it all tested for poison , ”
158285	158303	158260	158260	he	183	“ Had a house - elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert . ”
158340	158345	158347	158347	Slughorn	183	“ One for Harry ... ”
158357	158365	158367	158367	he	183	“ ... and one for me . Well ”
158373	158377	158367	158367	he	183	“ to Aragog . ”
158378	158381	158383	158383	Harry	136	“ Aragog , ”
158437	158448	158450	158450	Hagrid	176	“ I had him from an egg , yeh know , ”
158453	158471	158450	158450	Hagrid	176	“ Tiny little thing he was when he hatched . ’ Bout the size of a Pekingese . ”
158472	158475	158477	158477	Slughorn	183	“ Sweet , ”
158479	158495	158450	158450	Hagrid	176	“ Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until ... well ... ”
158565	158574	158536	158536	he	183	“ That ’s never unicorn hair , Hagrid ? ”
158575	158580	158582	158582	Hagrid	176	“ Oh , yeah , ”
158585	158608	158582	158582	Hagrid	176	“ Gets pulled out of their tails , they catch it on branches an ’ stuff in the forest , yeh know ... ”
158609	158624	158536	158536	he	183	“ But my dear chap , do you know how much that ’s worth ? ”
158625	158643	158645	158645	Hagrid	176	“ I use it fer bindin ’ on bandages an ’ stuff if a creature gets injured , ”
158649	158660	158645	158645	Hagrid	176	“ It ’s dead useful ... very strong , see . ”
158911	158915	158917	158917	Hagrid	176	“ Harry Potter ! ”
158935	158940	158942	158942	Slughorn	183	“ Yes , indeed , ”
158947	158963	158964	158964	he	183	“ Parry Otter , the Chosen Boy Who — well — something of that sort , ”
158998	159011	158989	158989	Slughorn	183	“ To friendship ! To generosity ! To ten Galleons a hair ! ”
159045	159053	159055	159055	Hagrid	176	“ Aaargh , the good die young , ”
159077	159096	159070	159070	Slughorn	183	“ Me dad was no age ter go ... nor were yer mum an ’ dad , Harry ... ”
159121	159141	159112	159112	he	176	“ Bes ’ wiz and witchard o ’ their age I never knew ... terrible thing ... terrible thing ... ”
159188	159192	159193	159193	Hagrid	176	“ ... terrible , ”
159214	159217	159219	159219	Slughorn	183	“ Sorry , ”
159224	159235	159219	159219	Slughorn	183	“ Ca n’t carry a tune to save my life . ”
159236	159245	159247	159247	Harry	136	“ Hagrid was n’t talking about your singing , ”
159250	159261	159247	159247	Harry	136	“ He was talking about my mum and dad dying . ”
159262	159265	159267	159267	Slughorn	183	“ Oh , ”
159274	159291	159267	159267	Slughorn	183	“ Oh dear . Yes , that was — was terrible indeed . Terrible ... terrible ... ”
159310	159324	159325	159325	he	495	“ I do n’t — do n’t suppose you remember it , Harry ? ”
159329	159342	159344	159344	Harry	136	“ No — well , I was only one when they died , ”
159361	159383	159346	159346	his	136	“ But I ’ve found out pretty much what happened since . My dad died first . Did you know that ? ”
159384	159391	159393	159393	Slughorn	183	“ I — I did n’t , ”
159399	159415	159417	159417	Harry	136	“ Yeah ... Voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his body toward my mum , ”
159442	159453	159455	159455	Harry	136	“ He told her to get out of the way , ”
159458	159478	159455	159455	Harry	136	“ He told me she need n’t have died . He only wanted me . She could have run . ”
159479	159483	159485	159485	Slughorn	183	“ Oh dear , ”
159487	159500	159485	159485	Slughorn	183	“ She could have ... she need n’t ... That ’s awful ... ”
159501	159509	159511	159511	Harry	136	“ It is , is n’t it ? ”
159522	159556	159511	159511	Harry	136	“ But she did n’t move . Dad was already dead , but she did n’t want me to go too . She tried to plead with Voldemort ... but he just laughed ... ”
159557	159562	159564	159564	Slughorn	183	“ That ’s enough ! ”
159572	159601	159564	159564	Slughorn	183	“ Really , my dear boy , enough ... I ’m an old man ... I do n’t need to hear ... I do n’t want to hear ... ”
159602	159606	159608	159608	Harry	136	“ I forgot , ”
159616	159625	159610	159611	Felix Felicis	322	“ You liked her , did n’t you ? ”
159626	159630	159632	159632	Slughorn	183	“ Liked her ? ”
159642	159670	159632	159632	Slughorn	183	“ I do n’t imagine anyone who met her would n’t have liked her ... Very brave ... Very funny ... It was the most horrible thing ... ”
159671	159680	159682	159682	Harry	136	“ But you wo n’t help her son , ”
159684	159700	159682	159682	Harry	136	“ She gave me her life , but you wo n’t give me a memory . ”
159729	159735	159736	159736	he	2288	“ Do n’t say that , ”
159739	159763	159736	159736	he	2288	“ It is n’t a question ... If it were to help you , of course ... but no purpose can be served ... ”
159764	159768	159770	159770	Harry	136	“ It can , ”
159773	159782	159770	159770	Harry	136	“ Dumbledore needs information . I need information . ”
159817	159835	159811	159811	Harry	136	“ I am the Chosen One . I have to kill him . I need that memory . ”
159849	159856	159811	159811	Harry	136	“ You are the Chosen One ? ”
159857	159863	159865	159865	Harry	136	“ Of course I am , ”
159868	159900	159811	159811	Harry	136	“ But then ... my dear boy ... you ’re asking a great deal ... you ’re asking me , in fact , to aid you in your attempt to destroy — ”
159901	159917	159811	159811	Harry	136	“ You do n’t want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily Evans ? ”
159918	159930	159811	159811	Harry	136	“ Harry , Harry , of course I do , but — ”
159931	159943	159811	159811	Harry	136	“ You ’re scared he ’ll find out you helped me ? ”
159952	159961	159948	159948	he	183	“ Be brave like my mother , Professor ... ”
159987	159993	159994	159994	he	183	“ I am not proud ... ”
160000	160024	159994	159994	he	183	“ I am ashamed of what — of what that memory shows ... I think I may have done great damage that day ... ”
160025	160039	160041	160041	Harry	136	“ You ’d cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory , ”
160043	160056	160041	160041	Harry	136	“ It would be a very brave and noble thing to do . ”
160229	160237	160211	160211	He	183	“ Thank you very much , Professor . ”
160238	160245	160247	160248	Professor Slughorn	199	“ You ’re a good boy , ”
160261	160283	160247	160248	Professor Slughorn	199	“ And you ’ve got her eyes ... Just do n’t think too badly of me once you ’ve seen it ... ”
160383	160393	160465	160467	the Fat Lady	1806	“ What sort of time do you call this ? ”
160394	160409	160465	160467	the Fat Lady	1806	“ I ’m really sorry — I had to go out for something important — ”
160410	160434	160465	160467	the Fat Lady	1806	“ Well , the password changed at midnight , so you ’ll just have to sleep in the corridor , wo n’t you ? ”
160435	160440	160442	160442	Harry	136	“ You ’re joking ! ”
160444	160454	160442	160442	Harry	136	“ Why did it have to change at midnight ? ”
160455	160463	160465	160467	the Fat Lady	1806	“ That ’s the way it is , ”
160469	160493	160465	160467	the Fat Lady	1806	“ If you ’re angry , go and take it up with the headmaster , he ’s the one who ’s tightened security . ”
160494	160497	160499	160499	Harry	136	“ Fantastic , ”
160509	160539	160499	160499	Harry	136	“ Really brilliant . Yeah , I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here , because he ’s the one who wanted me to — ”
160540	160545	160550	160550	Harry	136	“ He is here , ”
160552	160563	160550	160550	Harry	136	“ Professor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago . ”
160581	160595	160597	160597	Nick	297	“ I had it from the Bloody Baron , who saw him arrive , ”
160599	160622	160597	160597	Nick	297	“ He appeared , according to the Baron , to be in good spirits , though a little tired , of course . ”
160623	160628	160630	160630	Harry	136	“ Where is he ? ”
160636	160656	160597	160597	Nick	297	“ Oh , groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower , it ’s a favorite pastime of his — ”
160657	160665	160597	160597	Nick	297	“ Not the Bloody Baron — Dumbledore ! ”
160666	160673	160675	160675	Nick	297	“ Oh — in his office , ”
160677	160698	160675	160675	Nick	297	“ I believe , from what the Baron said , that he had business to attend to before turning in — ”
160699	160705	160707	160707	Harry	136	“ Yeah , he has , ”
160744	160770	160735	160742	the Fat Lady who was calling after him	2740	“ Come back ! All right , I lied ! I was annoyed you woke me up ! The password ’s still ‘ tapeworm ’ ! ”
160787	160790	160784	160784	he	136	“ toffee éclairs ”
160808	160811	160813	160813	Dumbledore	138	“ Enter , ”
160852	160858	160860	160860	Dumbledore	138	“ Good gracious , Harry , ”
160864	160875	160860	160860	Dumbledore	138	“ To what do I owe this very late pleasure ? ”
160876	160892	160893	160893	Harry	136	“ Sir — I ’ve got it . I ’ve got the memory from Slughorn . ”
160926	160946	160918	160918	his	883	“ Harry , this is spectacular news ! Very well done indeed ! I knew you could do it ! ”
160988	160992	160994	160994	Dumbledore	138	“ And now , ”
161013	161027	160994	160994	Dumbledore	138	“ Now , at last , we shall see . Harry , quickly ... ”
161165	161177	161162	161162	Riddle	340	“ Sir , is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring ? ”
161178	161192	161194	161194	Slughorn	199	“ Tom , Tom , if I knew I could n’t tell you , ”
161210	161238	161194	161194	Slughorn	199	“ I must say , I ’d like to know where you get your information , boy , more knowledgeable than half the staff , you are . ”
161252	161295	161194	161194	Slughorn	199	“ What with your uncanny ability to know things you should n’t , and your careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for the pineapple , by the way , you ’re quite right , it is my favorite — ”
161303	161336	161296	161299	Several of the boys	2246	“ — I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years . Fifteen , if you keep sending me pineapple , I have excellent contacts at the Ministry . ”
161376	161389	161390	161390	he	136	“ I do n’t know that politics would suit me , sir , ”
161399	161414	161390	161390	he	136	“ I do n’t have the right kind of background , for one thing . ”
161454	161457	161459	161459	Slughorn	199	“ Nonsense , ”
161462	161497	161459	161459	Slughorn	199	“ could n’t be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock , abilities like yours . No , you ’ll go far , Tom , I ’ve never been wrong about a student yet . ”
161517	161563	161504	161504	Slughorn	199	“ Good gracious , is it that time already ? You ’d better get going , boys , or we ’ll all be in trouble . Lestrange , I want your essay by tomorrow or it ’s detention . Same goes for you , Avery . ”
161608	161633	161602	161602	Riddle	340	“ Look sharp , Tom , you do n’t want to be caught out of bed out of hours , and you a prefect ... ”
161634	161644	161671	161671	Slughorn	199	“ Sir , I wanted to ask you something . ”
161645	161656	161602	161602	Riddle	340	“ Ask away , then , m’boy , ask away ... ”
161657	161670	161671	161671	Slughorn	199	“ Sir , I wondered what you know about ... about Horcruxes ? ”
161688	161700	161671	161671	Slughorn	199	“ Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts , is it ? ”
161716	161722	161724	161724	Riddle	340	“ Not exactly , sir , ”
161726	161742	161724	161724	Riddle	340	“ I came across the term while reading and I did n’t fully understand it . ”
161743	161780	161782	161782	Slughorn	199	“ No ... well ... you ’d be hard - pushed to find a book at Hogwarts that ’ll give you details on Horcruxes , Tom , that ’s very Dark stuff , very Dark indeed , ”
161784	161837	161724	161724	Riddle	340	“ But you obviously know all about them , sir ? I mean , a wizard like you — sorry , I mean , if you ca n’t tell me , obviously — I just knew if anyone could tell me , you could — so I just thought I ’d ask — ”
161912	161915	161917	161917	Slughorn	199	“ Well , ”
161938	161982	161917	161917	Slughorn	199	“ well , it ca n’t hurt to give you an overview , of course . Just so that you understand the term . A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul . ”
161983	161997	161999	161999	Riddle	340	“ I do n’t quite understand how that works , though , sir , ”
162014	162025	162027	162027	Slughorn	199	“ Well , you split your soul , you see , ”
162029	162079	162027	162027	Slughorn	199	“ and hide part of it in an object outside the body . Then , even if one ’s body is attacked or destroyed , one can not die , for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged . But of course , existence in such a form ... ”
162098	162125	162080	162080	Slughorn	199	“ I was ripped from my body , I was less than spirit , less than the meanest ghost ... but still , I was alive . ”
162126	162143	162087	162087	himself	136	“ ... few would want it , Tom , very few . Death would be preferable . ”
162165	162173	162080	162080	Slughorn	199	“ How do you split your soul ? ”
162174	162177	162179	162179	Slughorn	199	“ Well , ”
162182	162210	162179	162179	Slughorn	199	“ you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole . Splitting it is an act of violation , it is against nature . ”
162211	162219	162080	162080	Slughorn	199	“ But how do you do it ? ”
162220	162265	162179	162179	Slughorn	199	“ By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil . By committing murder . Killing rips the soul apart . The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage : He would encase the torn portion — ”
162266	162273	162080	162080	Slughorn	199	“ Encase ? But how — ? ”
162274	162290	162292	162292	Slughorn	199	“ There is a spell , do not ask me , I do n’t know ! ”
162305	162323	162295	162295	his	199	“ Do I look as though I have tried it — do I look like a killer ? ”
162324	162333	162335	162335	Riddle	340	“ No , sir , of course not , ”
162338	162350	162335	162335	Riddle	340	“ I ’m sorry ... I did n’t mean to offend ... ”
162351	162363	162365	162365	Slughorn	199	“ Not at all , not at all , not offended , ”
162368	162395	162365	162365	Slughorn	199	“ It ’s natural to feel some curiosity about these things ... Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic ... ”
162396	162401	162403	162403	Riddle	340	“ Yes , sir , ”
162405	162475	162403	162403	Riddle	340	“ What I do n’t understand , though — just out of curiosity — I mean , would one Horcrux be much use ? Can you only split your soul once ? Would n’t it be better , make you stronger , to have your soul in more pieces , I mean , for instance , is n’t seven the most powerfully magical number , would n’t seven — ? ”
162476	162483	162485	162485	Slughorn	199	“ Merlin ’s beard , Tom ! ”
162487	162522	162485	162485	Slughorn	199	“ Seven ! Is n’t it bad enough to think of killing one person ? And in any case ... bad enough to divide the soul ... but to rip it into seven pieces ... ”
162559	162563	162564	162564	he	199	“ Of course , ”
162567	162585	162564	162564	he	199	“ this is all hypothetical , what we ’re discussing , is n’t it ? All academic ... ”
162586	162594	162596	162596	Riddle	340	“ Yes , sir , of course , ”
162599	162657	162564	162564	he	199	“ But all the same , Tom ... keep it quiet , what I ’ve told — that ’s to say , what we ’ve discussed . People would n’t like to think we ’ve been chatting about Horcruxes . It ’s a banned subject at Hogwarts , you know ... Dumbledore ’s particularly fierce about it ... ”
162658	162668	162670	162670	Riddle	340	“ I wo n’t say a word , sir , ”
162729	162735	162737	162737	Dumbledore	138	“ Thank you , Harry , ”
162740	162745	162737	162737	Dumbledore	138	“ Let us go ... ”
162773	162789	162791	162791	Dumbledore	138	“ I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time , ”
162795	162826	162791	162791	Dumbledore	138	“ It confirms the theory on which I have been working , it tells me that I am right , and also how very far there is still to go ... ”
162870	162875	162877	162877	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , Harry , ”
162879	162925	162877	162877	Dumbledore	138	“ I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard . At the same age as you are now , give or take a few months , Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal . ”
162926	162935	162937	162937	Harry	136	“ You think he succeeded then , sir ? ”
162939	162973	162937	162937	Harry	136	“ He made a Horcrux ? And that ’s why he did n’t die when he attacked me ? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere ? A bit of his soul was safe ? ”
162974	162981	162983	162983	Dumbledore	138	“ A bit ... or more , ”
162985	163090	162983	162983	Dumbledore	138	“ You heard Voldemort : What he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux , what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times , rip his soul repeatedly , so as to store it in many , separately concealed Horcruxes . No book would have given him that information . As far as I know — as far , I am sure , as Voldemort knew — no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two . ”
163105	163124	163091	163091	Dumbledore	138	“ Four years ago , I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul . ”
163125	163128	163130	163130	Harry	136	“ So , ”
163132	163173	163130	163130	Harry	136	“ the diary ’s gone , the ring ’s gone . The cup , the locket , and the snake are still intact , and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw ’s or Gryffindor ’s ? ”
163174	163184	163186	163186	Dumbledore	138	“ An admirably succinct and accurate summary , yes , ”
163192	163219	163130	163130	Harry	136	“ So ... are you still looking for them , sir ? Is that where you ’ve been going when you ’ve been leaving the school ? ”
163220	163223	163225	163225	Dumbledore	138	“ Correct , ”
163227	163257	163225	163225	Dumbledore	138	“ I have been looking for a very long time . I think ... perhaps ... I may be close to finding another one . There are hopeful signs . ”
163258	163264	163266	163266	Harry	136	“ And if you do , ”
163269	163282	163266	163266	Harry	136	“ can I come with you and help get rid of it ? ”
163295	163302	163283	163283	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , I think so . ”
163303	163307	163309	163309	Harry	136	“ I can ? ”
163315	163319	163321	163321	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh yes , ”
163326	163335	163321	163321	Dumbledore	138	“ I think you have earned that right . ”
163387	163396	163398	163398	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , Harry , you can love , ”
163416	163448	163404	163404	he	138	“ Which , given everything that has happened to you , is a great and remarkable thing . You are still too young to understand how unusual you are , Harry . ”
163449	163456	163458	163458	Dumbledore	138	“ No , it does n’t ! ”
163477	163488	163474	163474	he	138	“ You are setting too much store by the prophecy ! ”
163489	163492	163494	163494	Harry	136	“ But , ”
163496	163504	163494	163494	Harry	136	“ but you said the prophecy means — ”
163505	163545	163474	163474	he	138	“ If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy , would it have been fulfilled ? Would it have meant anything ? Of course not ! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled ? ”
163546	163549	163551	163551	Harry	136	“ But , ”
163555	163572	163551	163551	Harry	136	“ but last year , you said one of us would have to kill the other — ”
163573	163582	163584	163584	Dumbledore	138	“ It is essential that you understand this ! ”
163610	163617	163619	163619	Harry	136	“ Of course I have n’t ! ”
163622	163630	163619	163619	Harry	136	“ He killed my mum and dad ! ”
163631	163645	163647	163647	Dumbledore	138	“ You are protected , in short , by your ability to love ! ”
163650	163655	163657	163657	Harry	136	“ But , sir , ”
163667	163691	163657	163657	Harry	136	“ it all comes to the same thing , does n’t it ? I ’ve got to try and kill him , or — ”
163692	163696	163698	163698	Dumbledore	138	“ Got to ? ”
163700	163760	163698	163698	Dumbledore	138	“ Of course you ’ve got to ! But not because of the prophecy ! Because you , yourself , will never rest until you ’ve tried ! We both know it ! Imagine , please , just for a moment , that you had never heard that prophecy ! How would you feel about Voldemort now ? Think ! ”
163821	163828	163830	163830	Harry	136	“ I ’d want him finished , ”
163833	163842	163830	163830	Harry	136	“ And I ’d want to do it . ”
163843	163849	163851	163851	Dumbledore	138	“ Of course you would ! ”
163853	163929	163851	163851	Dumbledore	138	“ You see , the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything ! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal ... In other words , you are free to choose your way , quite free to turn your back on the prophecy ! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy . He will continue to hunt you ... which makes it certain , really , that — ”
163930	163944	163946	163946	Harry	136	“ That one of us is going to end up killing the other , ”
163948	163951	163946	163946	Harry	136	“ Yes . ”
164130	164133	164135	164135	Ron	201	“ Wow , ”
164172	164191	164149	164149	his	201	“ Wow . You ’re actually going to go with Dumbledore ... and try and destroy ... wow . ”
164192	164201	164203	164203	Hermione	179	“ Ron , you ’re making it snow , ”
164259	164263	164265	164265	Ron	201	“ Oh yeah , ”
164276	164289	164265	164265	Ron	201	“ Sorry ... looks like we ’ve all got horrible dandruff now ... ”
164318	164323	164324	164324	he	201	“ We split up , ”
164335	164370	164324	164324	he	201	“ Last night . When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione . Obviously she could n’t see you , so she thought it had just been the two of us . ”
164371	164374	164376	164376	Harry	136	“ Ah , ”
164378	164392	164376	164376	Harry	136	“ Well — you do n’t mind it ’s over , do you ? ”
164393	164396	164397	164397	Ron	201	“ No , ”
164400	164421	164397	164397	Ron	201	“ It was pretty bad while she was yelling , but at least I did n’t have to finish it . ”
164422	164425	164430	164430	she	179	“ Coward , ”
164434	164456	164430	164430	she	179	“ Well , it was a bad night for romance all around . Ginny and Dean split up too , Harry . ”
164506	164510	164503	164503	he	136	“ How come ? ”
164511	164550	164503	164503	he	136	“ Oh , something really silly ... She said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole , like she could n’t climb in herself ... but they ’ve been a bit rocky for ages . ”
164569	164587	164589	164589	Hermione	179	“ Of course , this puts you in a bit of a dilemma , does n’t it ? ”
164591	164596	164598	164598	Harry	136	“ What d’you mean ? ”
164601	164606	164608	164608	Hermione	179	“ The Quidditch team , ”
164610	164619	164608	164608	Hermione	179	“ If Ginny and Dean are n’t speaking ... ”
164620	164626	164628	164628	Harry	136	“ Oh — oh yeah , ”
164630	164633	164635	164635	Ron	201	“ Flitwick , ”
164692	164699	164701	164702	Professor Flitwick	424	“ Now , now , boys , ”
164705	164722	164701	164702	Professor Flitwick	424	“ A little less talk , a little more action ... Let me see you try ... ”
164754	164760	164762	164763	Professor Flitwick	424	“ Yes ... for homework , ”
164783	164786	164762	164763	Professor Flitwick	424	“ practice . ”
164840	164847	164836	164836	she	179	“ It ’s a nice day . ”
164957	164968	164954	164954	Hermione	179	“ Katie ! You ’re back ! Are you okay ? ”
164988	164994	164995	164995	she	179	“ I ’m really well ! ”
164999	165045	164995	164995	she	179	“ They let me out of St. Mungo ’s on Monday , I had a couple of days at home with Mum and Dad and then came back here this morning . Leanne was just telling me about McLaggen and the last match , Harry ... ”
165046	165049	165051	165051	Harry	136	“ Yeah , ”
165053	165092	165051	165051	Harry	136	“ well , now you ’re back and Ron ’s fit , we ’ll have a decent chance of thrashing Ravenclaw , which means we could still be in the running for the Cup . Listen , Katie ... ”
165135	165150	165114	165114	He	136	“ ... that necklace ... can you remember who gave it to you now ? ”
165151	165154	165156	165156	Katie	310	“ No , ”
165163	165194	165159	165159	her	310	“ Everyone ’s been asking me , but I have n’t got a clue . The last thing I remember was walking into the ladies ’ in the Three Broomsticks . ”
165195	165205	165207	165207	Hermione	179	“ You definitely went into the bathroom , then ? ”
165209	165220	165222	165222	Katie	310	“ Well , I know I pushed open the door , ”
165224	165282	165222	165222	Katie	310	“ so I suppose whoever Imperiused me was standing just behind it . After that , my memory ’s a blank until about two weeks ago in St. Mungo ’s . Listen , I ’d better go , I would n’t put it past McGonagall to give me lines even if it is my first day back ... ”
165318	165335	165337	165337	Hermione	179	“ So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace , ”
165339	165348	165337	165337	Hermione	179	“ to be in the ladies ’ bathroom . ”
165349	165361	165363	165363	Harry	136	“ Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman , ”
165365	165389	165363	165363	Harry	136	“ Do n’t forget , there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts . We know some of it got stolen ... ”
165412	165425	165427	165427	Harry	136	“ I think I ’m going to take another swig of Felix , ”
165429	165441	165427	165427	Harry	136	“ and have a go at the Room of Requirement again . ”
165442	165452	165454	165454	Hermione	179	“ That would be a complete waste of potion , ”
165474	165552	165553	165553	She	179	“ Luck can only get you so far , Harry . The situation with Slughorn was different ; you always had the ability to persuade him , you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit . Luck is n’t enough to get you through a powerful enchantment , though . Do n’t go wasting the rest of that potion ! You ’ll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him ... ”
165561	165569	165570	165570	Ron	201	“ Could n’t we make some more ? ”
165577	165596	165572	165572	Harry	136	“ It ’d be great to have a stock of it ... Have a look in the book ... ”
165616	165624	165625	165625	he	136	“ Blimey , it ’s seriously complicated , ”
165637	165652	165625	165625	he	136	“ And it takes six months ... You ’ve got to let it stew ... ”
165653	165656	165658	165658	Ron	201	“ Typical , ”
165691	165695	165697	165697	he	136	“ For Enemies , ”
166229	166233	166225	166225	Hermione	179	“ tweaking the circumstances ”
166970	166974	166976	166977	Moaning Myrtle	224	“ Do n’t , ”
166986	167001	166976	166977	Moaning Myrtle	224	“ Do n’t ... tell me what ’s wrong ... I can help you ... ”
167002	167009	167011	167011	Malfoy	159	“ No one can help me , ”
167019	167049	167013	167013	His	159	“ I ca n’t do it ... I ca n’t ... It wo n’t work ... and unless I do it soon ... he says he ’ll kill me ... ”
167173	167181	167183	167184	Moaning Myrtle	224	“ No ! No ! Stop it ! ”
167195	167200	167186	167186	her	224	“ Stop ! STOP ! ”
167256	167259	167250	167250	his	159	“ Cruci — ”
167260	167263	167265	167265	Harry	136	“ SECTUMSEMPRA ! ”
167317	167320	167322	167322	Harry	136	“ No — ”
167356	167363	167345	167345	his	159	“ No — I did n’t — ”
167401	167411	167393	167394	Moaning Myrtle	224	“ MURDER ! MURDER IN THE BATHROOM ! MURDER ! ”
167555	167585	167545	167545	he	205	“ You need the hospital wing . There may be a certain amount of scarring , but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that ... Come ... ”
167606	167618	167586	167586	He	205	“ And you , Potter ... You wait here for me . ”
167703	167706	167707	167707	he	205	“ Go , ”
167729	167738	167740	167740	Harry	136	“ I did n’t mean it to happen , ”
167754	167764	167744	167744	His	136	“ I did n’t know what that spell did . ”
167770	167778	167779	167779	he	205	“ Apparently I underestimated you , Potter , ”
167783	167800	167779	167779	he	205	“ Who would have thought you knew such Dark Magic ? Who taught you that spell ? ”
167801	167809	167854	167854	Snape	205	“ I — read about it somewhere . ”
167810	167813	167779	167779	he	205	“ Where ? ”
167814	167822	167823	167823	Harry	136	“ It was — a library book , ”
167827	167837	167823	167823	Harry	136	“ I ca n’t remember what it was call — ”
167838	167841	167843	167843	Snape	205	“ Liar , ”
167954	167960	167962	167962	Snape	205	“ Bring me your schoolbag , ”
167965	167984	167962	167962	Snape	205	“ and all of your schoolbooks . All of them . Bring them to me here . Now ! ”
168150	168166	168146	168146	He	136	“ Where ’ve you — ? Why are you soaking — ? Is that blood ? ”
168185	168191	168192	168192	Harry	136	“ I need your book , ”
168195	168207	168192	168192	Harry	136	“ Your Potions book . Quick ... give it to me ... ”
168208	168217	168225	168225	Ron	201	“ But what about the Half - Blood — ”
168218	168224	168192	168192	Harry	136	“ I ’ll explain later ! ”
168947	168963	168939	168939	he	205	“ This is your copy of Advanced Potion - Making , is it , Potter ? ”
168964	168967	168969	168969	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
168975	168988	168939	168939	he	205	“ You ’re quite sure of that , are you , Potter ? ”
168989	168992	168994	168994	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
169002	169020	168939	168939	he	205	“ This is the copy of Advanced Potion - Making that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts ? ”
169021	169024	169026	169026	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
169029	169033	169035	169035	Snape	205	“ Then why , ”
169037	169053	169035	169035	Snape	205	“ does it have the name ‘ Roonil Wazlib ’ written inside the front cover ? ”
169061	169067	169068	169068	he	136	“ That ’s my nickname , ”
169071	169075	169077	169077	Snape	205	“ Your nickname , ”
169079	169090	169092	169092	Harry	136	“ Yeah ... that ’s what my friends call me , ”
169094	169102	169104	169104	Snape	205	“ I understand what a nickname is , ”
169146	169156	169158	169158	Snape	205	“ Do you know what I think , Potter ? ”
169163	169196	169158	169158	Snape	205	“ I think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of term . What do you think , Potter ? ”
169197	169207	169209	169209	Harry	136	“ I — I do n’t agree , sir , ”
169220	169233	169235	169235	Snape	205	“ Well , we shall see how you feel after your detentions , ”
169237	169248	169235	169235	Snape	205	“ Ten o’clock Saturday morning , Potter . My office . ”
169249	169253	169255	169255	Harry	136	“ But sir ... ”
169261	169270	169255	169255	Harry	136	“ Quidditch ... the last match of the ... ”
169271	169275	169277	169277	Snape	205	“ Ten o’clock , ”
169288	169300	169284	169284	his	205	“ Poor Gryffindor ... fourth place this year , I fear ... ”
169335	169347	169349	169349	Hermione	179	“ I wo n’t say ‘ I told you so , ’ ”
169359	169365	169367	169367	Ron	201	“ Leave it , Hermione , ”
169528	169541	169549	169549	herself	179	“ I told you there was something wrong with that Prince person , ”
169551	169561	169549	169549	herself	179	“ And I was right , was n’t I ? ”
169562	169572	169574	169574	Harry	136	“ No , I do n’t think you were , ”
169701	169704	169706	169706	Hermione	179	“ Harry , ”
169708	169722	169706	169706	Hermione	179	“ how can you still stick up for that book when that spell — ”
169723	169733	169735	169735	Harry	136	“ Will you stop harping on about the book ! ”
169737	169776	169735	169735	Harry	136	“ The Prince only copied it out ! It ’s not like he was advising anyone to use it ! For all we know , he was making a note of something that had been used against him ! ”
169777	169784	169786	169786	Hermione	179	“ I do n’t believe this , ”
169788	169794	169786	169786	Hermione	179	“ You ’re actually defending — ”
169795	169804	169806	169806	Harry	136	“ I ’m not defending what I did ! ”
169809	169887	169806	169806	Harry	136	“ I wish I had n’t done it , and not just because I ’ve got about a dozen detentions . You know I would n’t ’ve used a spell like that , not even on Malfoy , but you ca n’t blame the Prince , he had n’t written ‘ try this out , it ’s really good ’ — he was just making notes for himself , was n’t he , not for anyone else ... ”
169888	169894	169896	169896	Hermione	179	“ Are you telling me , ”
169898	169908	169896	169896	Hermione	179	“ that you ’re going to go back — ? ”
169909	169920	169922	169922	Harry	136	“ And get the book ? Yeah , I am , ”
169925	169957	169922	169922	Harry	136	“ Listen , without the Prince I ’d never have won the Felix Felicis . I ’d never have known how to save Ron from poisoning , I ’d never have — ”
169958	169971	169973	169973	Hermione	179	“ — got a reputation for Potions brilliance you do n’t deserve , ”
169976	169984	169986	169986	Ginny	218	“ Give it a rest , Hermione ! ”
170001	170029	169997	169997	he	136	“ By the sound of it , Malfoy was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse , you should be glad Harry had something good up his sleeve ! ”
170030	170043	170045	170045	Hermione	179	“ Well , of course I ’m glad Harry was n’t cursed ! ”
170050	170088	170045	170045	Hermione	179	“ But you ca n’t call that Sectumsempra spell good , Ginny , look where it ’s landed him ! And I ’d have thought , seeing what this has done to your chances in the match — ”
170089	170102	170104	170104	Ginny	218	“ Oh , do n’t start acting as though you understand Quidditch , ”
170106	170113	170104	170104	Ginny	218	“ you ’ll only embarrass yourself . ”
170353	170358	170360	170360	Snape	205	“ Ah , Potter , ”
170445	170460	170462	170462	Snape	205	“ Mr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files , ”
170465	170529	170462	170462	Snape	205	“ They are the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments . Where the ink has grown faint , or the cards have suffered damage from mice , we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and , making sure that they are in alphabetical order , replace them in the boxes . You will not use magic . ”
170530	170535	170537	170537	Harry	136	“ Right , Professor , ”
170553	170560	170562	170562	Snape	205	“ I thought you could start , ”
170571	170608	170562	170562	Snape	205	“ with boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and fifty - six . You will find some familiar names in there , which should add interest to the task . Here , you see ... ”
170626	170654	170609	170609	He	205	“ ‘ James Potter and Sirius Black . Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey . Aubrey ’s head twice normal size . Double detention . ’ ”
170658	170682	170655	170655	Snape	205	“ It must be such a comfort to think that , though they are gone , a record of their great achievements remains ... ”
170905	170912	170913	170913	he	205	“ I think that will do , ”
170917	170934	170913	170913	he	205	“ Mark the place you have reached . You will continue at ten o’clock next Saturday . ”
170935	170940	170913	170913	he	205	“ Yes , sir . ”
171027	171031	171032	171032	he	136	“ Quid agis ? ”
171055	171060	171052	171052	she	1806	“ You ’ll see . ”
171098	171102	171104	171104	Ron	201	“ We won ! ”
171117	171134	171104	171104	Ron	201	“ We won ! Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty ! We won ! ”
171465	171477	171479	171479	Ginny	218	“ You ’d think people had better things to gossip about , ”
171501	171531	171482	171482	she	218	“ Three dementor attacks in a week , and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it ’s true you ’ve got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest . ”
171544	171551	171540	171540	Harry	136	“ What did you tell her ? ”
171552	171562	171564	171564	Ginny	218	“ I told her it ’s a Hungarian Horntail , ”
171574	171579	171564	171564	Ginny	218	“ Much more macho . ”
171580	171583	171585	171585	Harry	136	“ Thanks , ”
171589	171600	171585	171585	Harry	136	“ And what did you tell her Ron ’s got ? ”
171601	171613	171564	171564	Ginny	218	“ A Pygmy Puff , but I did n’t say where . ”
171622	171626	171627	171627	he	201	“ Watch it , ”
171637	171654	171627	171627	he	201	“ Just because I ’ve given my permission does n’t mean I ca n’t withdraw it — ”
171655	171661	171663	171663	Ginny	218	“ ‘ Your permission , ’ ”
171665	171693	171663	171663	Ginny	218	“ Since when did you give me permission to do anything ? Anyway , you said yourself you ’d rather it was Harry than Michael or Dean . ”
171694	171700	171702	171702	Ron	201	“ Yeah , I would , ”
171705	171721	171702	171702	Ron	201	“ And just as long as you do n’t start snogging each other in public — ”
171722	171745	171747	171747	Ginny	218	“ You filthy hypocrite ! What about you and Lavender , thrashing around like a pair of eels all over the place ? ”
171863	171873	171860	171860	her	179	“ I want to talk to you , Harry . ”
171874	171878	171880	171880	Harry	136	“ What about ? ”
171907	171917	171888	171888	Hermione	179	“ The so - called Half - Blood Prince . ”
171918	171924	171925	171925	he	136	“ Oh , not again , ”
171928	171935	171925	171925	he	136	“ Will you please drop it ? ”
172016	172023	172025	172025	Hermione	179	“ I ’m not dropping it , ”
172028	172058	172025	172025	Hermione	179	“ until you ’ve heard me out . Now , I ’ve been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing Dark spells — ”
172059	172069	172117	172117	she	179	“ He did n’t make a hobby of it — ”
172070	172082	172025	172025	Hermione	179	“ He , he — who says it ’s a he ? ”
172083	172090	172092	172092	Harry	136	“ We ’ve been through this , ”
172095	172102	172092	172092	Harry	136	“ Prince , Hermione , Prince ! ”
172103	172106	172117	172117	she	179	“ Right ! ”
172141	172151	172117	172117	she	179	“ Look at that ! Look at the picture ! ”
172228	172231	172233	172233	Harry	136	“ So ? ”
172256	172267	172268	172268	They	2917	“ Her name was Eileen Prince . Prince , Harry . ”
172289	172293	172284	172284	He	136	“ No way . ”
172294	172297	172284	172284	He	136	“ What ? ”
172298	172314	172284	172284	He	136	“ You think she was the Half - Blood ... ? Oh , come on . ”
172315	172400	172284	172284	He	136	“ Well , why not ? Harry , there are n’t any real princes in the Wizarding world ! It ’s either a nickname , a made - up title somebody ’s given themselves , or it could be their actual name , could n’t it ? No , listen ! If , say , her father was a wizard whose surname was Prince , and her mother was a Muggle , then that would make her a ‘ half - blood Prince ’ ! ”
172401	172409	172284	172284	He	136	“ Yeah , very ingenious , Hermione ... ”
172410	172425	172284	172284	He	136	“ But it would ! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince ! ”
172426	172445	172284	172284	He	136	“ Listen , Hermione , I can tell it ’s not a girl . I can just tell . ”
172446	172463	172465	172465	Hermione	179	“ The truth is that you do n’t think a girl would have been clever enough , ”
172468	172487	172489	172489	Harry	136	“ How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever ? ”
172495	172534	172489	172489	Harry	136	“ It ’s the way he writes , I just know the Prince was a bloke , I can tell . This girl has n’t got anything to do with it . Where did you get this anyway ? ”
172535	172539	172541	172541	Hermione	179	“ The library , ”
172544	172572	172541	172541	Hermione	179	“ There ’s a whole collection of old Prophets up there . Well , I ’m going to find out more about Eileen Prince if I can . ”
172573	172577	172579	172579	Harry	136	“ Enjoy yourself , ”
172582	172586	172588	172588	Hermione	179	“ I will , ”
172590	172599	172600	172600	she	179	“ And the first place I ’ll look , ”
172612	172620	172600	172600	she	179	“ is records of old Potions awards ! ”
172638	172651	172653	172653	Ron	201	“ She ’s just never got over you outperforming her in Potions , ”
172667	172684	172653	172653	Ron	201	“ You do n’t think I ’m mad , wanting that book back , do you ? ”
172685	172690	172692	172692	Ron	201	“ ’ Course not , ”
172695	172711	172712	172712	He	201	“ He was a genius , the Prince . Anyway ... without his bezoar tip ... ”
172722	172751	172712	172712	He	201	“ I would n’t be here to discuss it , would I ? I mean , I ’m not saying that spell you used on Malfoy was great — ”
172752	172757	172759	172759	Harry	136	“ Nor am I , ”
172762	172781	172712	172712	He	201	“ But he healed all right , did n’t he ? Back on his feet in no time . ”
172782	172785	172787	172787	Harry	136	“ Yeah , ”
172803	172808	172787	172787	Harry	136	“ Thanks to Snape ... ”
172809	172819	172820	172820	Ron	201	“ You still got detention with Snape this Saturday ? ”
172823	172838	172840	172840	Harry	136	“ Yeah , and the Saturday after that , and the Saturday after that , ”
172842	172871	172840	172840	Harry	136	“ And he ’s hinting now that if I do n’t get all the boxes done by the end of term , we ’ll carry on next year . ”
172965	172977	172979	172979	Harry	136	“ Thanks , Jimmy ... Hey , it ’s from Dumbledore ! ”
172989	173004	172979	172979	Harry	136	“ He wants me to go to his office as quick as I can ! ”
173011	173014	173016	173016	Ron	201	“ Blimey , ”
173018	173030	173016	173016	Ron	201	“ You do n’t reckon ... he has n’t found ... ? ”
173031	173041	173043	173043	Harry	136	“ Better go and see , had n’t I ? ”
173152	173161	173144	173144	He	136	“ How — dare — you — aaaaargh ! ”
173216	173219	173220	173220	Harry	136	“ Professor — ”
173261	173267	173243	173243	She	298	“ What happened , Professor ? ”
173268	173274	173275	173275	she	298	“ You may well ask ! ”
173279	173296	173275	173275	she	298	“ I was strolling along , brooding upon certain dark portents I happen to have glimpsed ... ”
173340	173354	173366	173366	She	298	“ Professor , were you trying to get into the Room of Requirement ? ”
173355	173365	173366	173366	She	298	“ ... omens I have been vouchsafed — what ? ”
173371	173377	173379	173379	Harry	136	“ The Room of Requirement , ”
173381	173390	173379	173379	Harry	136	“ Were you trying to get in there ? ”
173391	173404	173366	173366	She	298	“ I — well — I did n’t know students knew about — ”
173405	173412	173414	173414	Harry	136	“ Not all of them do , ”
173416	173432	173414	173414	Harry	136	“ But what happened ? You screamed ... It sounded as though you were hurt ... ”
173433	173438	173444	173444	her	298	“ I — well , ”
173460	173478	173455	173455	her	298	“ I wished to — ah — deposit certain — um — personal items in the room ... ”
173484	173488	173480	173480	she	298	“ nasty accusations . ”
173489	173492	173494	173494	Harry	136	“ Right , ”
173503	173514	173494	173494	Harry	136	“ But you could n’t get in and hide them ? ”
173545	173554	173556	173557	Professor Trelawney	298	“ Oh , I got in all right , ”
173564	173573	173556	173557	Professor Trelawney	298	“ But there was somebody already in there . ”
173574	173581	173583	173583	Harry	136	“ Somebody in — ? Who ? ”
173585	173591	173583	173583	Harry	136	“ Who was in there ? ”
173592	173598	173600	173601	Professor Trelawney	298	“ I have no idea , ”
173615	173647	173600	173601	Professor Trelawney	298	“ I walked into the room and I heard a voice , which has never happened before in all my years of hiding — of using the room , I mean . ”
173648	173655	173583	173583	Harry	136	“ A voice ? Saying what ? ”
173656	173667	173669	173670	Professor Trelawney	298	“ I do n’t know that it was saying anything , ”
173672	173678	173669	173670	Professor Trelawney	298	“ It was ... whooping . ”
173679	173682	173583	173583	Harry	136	“ Whooping ? ”
173683	173686	173687	173687	she	298	“ Gleefully , ”
173697	173704	173692	173692	Harry	136	“ Was it male or female ? ”
173705	173714	173716	173717	Professor Trelawney	298	“ I would hazard a guess at male , ”
173719	173725	173692	173692	Harry	136	“ And it sounded happy ? ”
173726	173730	173732	173733	Professor Trelawney	298	“ Very happy , ”
173736	173743	173692	173692	Harry	136	“ As though it was celebrating ? ”
173744	173748	173692	173692	Harry	136	“ Most definitely . ”
173749	173754	173692	173692	Harry	136	“ And then — ? ”
173755	173767	173692	173692	Harry	136	“ And then I called out ‘ Who ’s there ? ’ ”
173768	173781	173782	173782	Harry	136	“ You could n’t have found out who it was without asking ? ”
173789	173794	173796	173797	Professor Trelawney	298	“ The Inner Eye , ”
173811	173825	173796	173797	Professor Trelawney	298	“ was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices . ”
173826	173829	173831	173831	Harry	136	“ Right , ”
173848	173858	173838	173839	Professor Trelawney	298	“ And did the voice say who was there ? ”
173859	173866	173867	173867	she	298	“ No , it did not , ”
173870	173893	173867	173867	she	298	“ Everything went pitch - black and the next thing I knew , I was being hurled headfirst out of the room ! ”
173894	173903	173905	173905	Harry	136	“ And you did n’t see that coming ? ”
173912	173927	173928	173928	She	298	“ No , I did not , as I say , it was pitch — ”
173936	173946	173948	173948	Harry	136	“ I think you ’d better tell Professor Dumbledore , ”
173950	173971	173948	173948	Harry	136	“ He ought to know Malfoy ’s celebrating — I mean , that someone threw you out of the room . ”
173988	174002	174003	174003	she	298	“ The headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me , ”
174007	174035	174003	174003	she	298	“ I am not one to press my company upon those who do not value it . If Dumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards show — ”
174046	174059	174061	174061	she	298	“ Again and again , no matter how I lay them out — ”
174071	174079	174080	174080	she	298	“ — the lightning - struck tower , ”
174083	174094	174080	174080	she	298	“ Calamity . Disaster . Coming nearer all the time ... ”
174095	174098	174100	174100	Harry	136	“ Right , ”
174103	174129	174100	174100	Harry	136	“ Well ... I still think you should tell Dumbledore about this voice , and everything going dark and being thrown out of the room ... ”
174130	174135	174136	174137	Professor Trelawney	298	“ You think so ? ”
174162	174172	174174	174174	Harry	136	“ I ’m going to see him right now , ”
174176	174190	174174	174174	Harry	136	“ I ’ve got a meeting with him . We could go together . ”
174191	174200	174202	174203	Professor Trelawney	298	“ Oh , well , in that case , ”
174237	174248	174249	174249	she	298	“ I miss having you in my classes , Harry , ”
174258	174274	174249	174249	she	298	“ You were never much of a Seer ... but you were a wonderful Object ... ”
174295	174300	174301	174301	she	298	“ I am afraid , ”
174305	174358	174301	174301	she	298	“ that the nag — I ’m sorry , the centaur — knows nothing of cartomancy . I asked him — one Seer to another — had he not , too , sensed the distant vibrations of coming catastrophe ? But he seemed to find me almost comical . Yes , comical ! ”
174382	174456	174359	174359	Her	298	“ Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited my great - great - grandmother ’s gift . Those rumors have been bandied about by the jealous for years . You know what I say to such people , Harry ? Would Dumbledore have let me teach at this great school , put so much trust in me all these years , had I not proved myself to him ? ”
174462	174472	174475	174476	Professor Trelawney	298	“ I well remember my first interview with Dumbledore , ”
174482	174579	174475	174476	Professor Trelawney	298	“ He was deeply impressed , of course , deeply impressed ... I was staying at the Hog ’s Head , which I do not advise , incidentally — bedbugs , dear boy — but funds were low . Dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room . He questioned me ... I must confess that , at first , I thought he seemed ill - disposed toward Divination ... and I remember I was starting to feel a little odd , I had not eaten much that day ... but then ... ”
174623	174635	174475	174476	Professor Trelawney	298	“ ... but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus Snape ! ”
174636	174639	174600	174601	Professor Trelawney	298	“ What ? ”
174640	174787	174475	174476	Professor Trelawney	298	“ Yes , there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open , and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with Snape , who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs , although I ’m afraid that I myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with Dumbledore — you see , he himself was seeking a job at the time , and no doubt hoped to pick up tips ! Well , after that , you know , Dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give me a job , and I could not help thinking , Harry , that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent , compared to the pushing , thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes — Harry , dear ? ”
174821	174824	174825	174825	she	2933	“ Harry ? ”
174924	174927	174929	174930	Professor Trelawney	298	“ Harry ? ”
174933	174947	174929	174930	Professor Trelawney	298	“ Harry — I thought we were going to see the headmaster together ? ”
174948	174953	174955	174955	Harry	136	“ You stay here , ”
174960	174979	174929	174930	Professor Trelawney	298	“ But dear ... I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the Room of — ”
174980	174985	174986	174986	Harry	136	“ You stay here ! ”
175052	175054	175043	175043	he	136	“ Enter ”
175108	175122	175105	175105	his	138	“ Well , Harry , I promised that you could come with me . ”
175156	175163	175192	175192	Dumbledore	138	“ Come ... with you ... ? ”
175164	175174	175192	175192	Dumbledore	138	“ Only if you wish it , of course . ”
175175	175179	175192	175192	Dumbledore	138	“ If I ... ”
175200	175212	175185	175185	he	136	“ You ’ve found one ? You ’ve found a Horcrux ? ”
175213	175218	175192	175192	Dumbledore	138	“ I believe so . ”
175236	175244	175246	175246	Dumbledore	138	“ It is natural to be afraid , ”
175248	175254	175256	175256	Harry	136	“ I ’m not scared ! ”
175277	175287	175256	175256	Harry	136	“ Which Horcrux is it ? Where is it ? ”
175288	175360	175246	175246	Dumbledore	138	“ I am not sure which it is — though I think we can rule out the snake — but I believe it to be hidden in a cave on the coast many miles from here , a cave I have been trying to locate for a very long time : the cave in which Tom Riddle once terrorized two children from his orphanage on their annual trip ; you remember ? ”
175361	175364	175366	175366	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
175368	175374	175366	175366	Harry	136	“ How is it protected ? ”
175375	175390	175391	175391	Dumbledore	138	“ I do not know ; I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong . ”
175397	175436	175391	175391	Dumbledore	138	“ Harry , I promised you that you could come with me , and I stand by that promise , but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous . ”
175437	175442	175444	175444	Harry	136	“ I ’m coming , ”
175507	175514	175503	175503	his	138	“ What has happened to you ? ”
175515	175518	175520	175520	Harry	136	“ Nothing , ”
175523	175529	175503	175503	his	138	“ What has upset you ? ”
175530	175536	175503	175503	his	138	“ I ’m not upset . ”
175537	175547	175503	175503	his	138	“ Harry , you were never a good Occlumens — ”
175559	175562	175563	175563	he	138	“ Snape ! ”
175578	175606	175570	175570	Fawkes	328	“ Snape ’s what ’s happened ! He told Voldemort about the prophecy , it was him , he listened outside the door , Trelawney told me ! ”
175639	175648	175649	175649	he	138	“ When did you find out about this ? ”
175654	175658	175660	175660	Harry	136	“ Just now ! ”
175682	175701	175676	175676	he	136	“ AND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDEMORT TO GO AFTER MY MUM AND DAD ! ”
175809	175812	175814	175814	Dumbledore	138	“ Harry , ”
175817	175823	175814	175814	Dumbledore	138	“ Please listen to me . ”
175854	175861	175889	175889	Dumbledore	138	“ Professor Snape made a terrible — ”
175862	175881	175889	175889	Dumbledore	138	“ Do n’t tell me it was a mistake , sir , he was listening at the door ! ”
175882	175888	175889	175889	Dumbledore	138	“ Please let me finish . ”
175901	176001	175892	175892	Harry	136	“ Professor Snape made a terrible mistake . He was still in Lord Voldemort ’s employ on the night he heard the first half of Professor Trelawney ’s prophecy . Naturally , he hastened to tell his master what he had heard , for it concerned his master most deeply . But he did not know — he had no possible way of knowing — which boy Voldemort would hunt from then onward , or that the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest were people that Professor Snape knew , that they were your mother and father — ”
176011	176039	176002	176002	Harry	136	“ He hated my dad like he hated Sirius ! Have n’t you noticed , Professor , how the people Snape hates tend to end up dead ? ”
176040	176082	176169	176169	he	138	“ You have no idea of the remorse Professor Snape felt when he realized how Lord Voldemort had interpreted the prophecy , Harry . I believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he returned — ”
176083	176098	176100	176100	Harry	136	“ But he ’s a very good Occlumens , is n’t he , sir ? ”
176114	176143	176100	176100	Harry	136	“ And is n’t Voldemort convinced that Snape ’s on his side , even now ? Professor ... how can you be sure Snape ’s on our side ? ”
176172	176183	176169	176169	he	138	“ I am sure . I trust Severus Snape completely . ”
176203	176210	176211	176211	he	138	“ Well , I do n’t ! ”
176219	176240	176211	176211	he	138	“ He ’s up to something with Draco Malfoy right now , right under your nose , and you still — ”
176241	176249	176251	176251	Dumbledore	138	“ We have discussed this , Harry , ”
176260	176268	176255	176255	he	138	“ I have told you my views . ”
176269	176294	176211	176211	he	138	“ You ’re leaving the school tonight , and I ’ll bet you have n’t even considered that Snape and Malfoy might decide to — ”
176295	176299	176301	176301	Dumbledore	138	“ To what ? ”
176307	176320	176303	176303	his	138	“ What is it that you suspect them of doing , precisely ? ”
176321	176330	176332	176332	Harry	136	“ I ... they ’re up to something ! ”
176345	176404	176341	176341	he	136	“ Professor Trelawney was just in the Room of Requirement , trying to hide her sherry bottles , and she heard Malfoy whooping , celebrating ! He ’s trying to mend something dangerous in there and if you ask me , he ’s fixed it at last and you ’re about to just walk out of school without — ”
176405	176408	176410	176410	Dumbledore	138	“ Enough , ”
176437	176492	176429	176429	he	136	“ Do you think that I have once left the school unprotected during my absences this year ? I have not . Tonight , when I leave , there will again be additional protection in place . Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously , Harry . ”
176493	176498	176500	176500	Harry	136	“ I did n’t — ”
176512	176524	176507	176507	Dumbledore	138	“ I do not wish to discuss the matter any further . ”
176554	176564	176550	176550	Dumbledore	138	“ Do you wish to come with me tonight ? ”
176565	176568	176570	176570	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
176574	176582	176583	176583	Dumbledore	138	“ Very well , then : Listen . ”
176592	176618	176585	176585	himself	138	“ I take you with me on one condition : that you obey any command I might give you at once , and without question . ”
176619	176623	176550	176550	Dumbledore	138	“ Of course . ”
176624	176663	176585	176585	himself	138	“ Be sure to understand me , Harry . I mean that you must follow even such orders as ‘ run , ’ ‘ hide , ’ or ‘ go back . ’ Do I have your word ? ”
176664	176672	176550	176550	Dumbledore	138	“ I — yes , of course . ”
176673	176686	176585	176585	himself	138	“ If I tell you to hide , you will do so ? ”
176687	176690	176550	176550	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes . ”
176691	176703	176585	176585	himself	138	“ If I tell you to flee , you will obey ? ”
176704	176707	176550	176550	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes . ”
176708	176728	176585	176585	himself	138	“ If I tell you to leave me and save yourself , you will do as I tell you ? ”
176729	176732	176550	176550	Dumbledore	138	“ I — ”
176733	176736	176585	176585	himself	138	“ Harry ? ”
176746	176751	176737	176737	They	2949	“ Yes , sir . ”
176752	176780	176550	176550	Dumbledore	138	“ Very good . Then I wish you to go and fetch your Invisibility Cloak and meet me in the entrance hall in five minutes ’ time . ”
176847	176853	176854	176854	Hermione	179	“ What does he want ? ”
176859	176866	176867	176867	she	179	“ Harry , are you okay ? ”
176871	176876	176878	176878	Harry	136	“ I ’m fine , ”
176943	176951	176952	176952	Harry	136	“ I ’ve got to be quick , ”
176955	176967	176952	176952	Harry	136	“ Dumbledore thinks I ’m getting my Invisibility Cloak . Listen ... ”
177008	177017	177018	177018	Harry	136	“ ... so you see what this means ? ”
177024	177054	177055	177055	he	136	“ Dumbledore wo n’t be here tonight , so Malfoy ’s going to have another clear shot at whatever he ’s up to . No , listen to me ! ”
177070	177085	177086	177086	He	136	“ I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Requirement . Here — ”
177097	177185	177086	177086	He	136	“ You ’ve got to watch him and you ’ve got to watch Snape too . Use anyone else who you can rustle up from the D.A. , Hermione , those contact Galleons will still work , right ? Dumbledore says he ’s put extra protection in the school , but if Snape ’s involved , he ’ll know what Dumbledore ’s protection is , and how to avoid it — but he wo n’t be expecting you lot to be on the watch , will he ? ”
177186	177189	177191	177191	Hermione	179	“ Harry — ”
177199	177208	177210	177210	Harry	136	“ I have n’t got time to argue , ”
177213	177219	177210	177210	Harry	136	“ Take this as well — ”
177229	177232	177234	177234	Ron	201	“ Thanks , ”
177236	177245	177234	177234	Ron	201	“ Er — why do I need socks ? ”
177246	177287	177220	177220	He	136	“ You need what ’s wrapped in them , it ’s the Felix Felicis . Share it between yourselves and Ginny too . Say good - bye to her for me . I ’d better go , Dumbledore ’s waiting — ”
177288	177291	177293	177293	Hermione	179	“ No ! ”
177309	177330	177296	177296	Ron	201	“ We do n’t want it , you take it , who knows what you ’re going to be facing ? ”
177331	177343	177345	177345	Harry	136	“ I ’ll be fine , I ’ll be with Dumbledore , ”
177347	177371	177345	177345	Harry	136	“ I want to know you lot are okay ... Do n’t look like that , Hermione , I ’ll see you later ... ”
177421	177433	177435	177435	Dumbledore	138	“ I would like you to wear your Cloak , please , ”
177449	177457	177438	177438	he	138	“ Very good . Shall we go ? ”
177497	177511	177512	177512	Harry	136	“ But what will people think when they see you leaving , Professor ? ”
177522	177533	177535	177535	Dumbledore	138	“ That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink , ”
177538	177574	177535	177535	Dumbledore	138	“ I sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom , or else visit the Hog ’s Head ... or I appear to . It is as good a way as any of disguising one ’s true destination . ”
177624	177627	177629	177629	Harry	136	“ Professor , ”
177645	177651	177629	177629	Harry	136	“ will we be Apparating ? ”
177652	177655	177657	177657	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , ”
177659	177668	177657	177657	Dumbledore	138	“ You can Apparate now , I believe ? ”
177669	177672	177674	177674	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
177676	177685	177674	177674	Harry	136	“ but I have n’t got a license . ”
177713	177717	177719	177719	Dumbledore	138	“ No matter , ”
177721	177728	177719	177719	Dumbledore	138	“ I can assist you again . ”
177784	177790	177792	177793	Madam Rosmerta	170	“ — and stay out ! ”
177803	177815	177792	177793	Madam Rosmerta	170	“ Oh , hello , Albus ... You ’re out late ... ”
177816	177849	177906	177906	Dumbledore	138	“ Good evening , Rosmerta , good evening ... forgive me , I ’m off to the Hog ’s Head ... No offense , but I feel like a quieter atmosphere tonight ... ”
177893	177904	177906	177906	Dumbledore	138	“ It will not be necessary for us to enter , ”
177911	177957	177906	177906	Dumbledore	138	“ As long as nobody sees us go ... now place your hand upon my arm , Harry . There is no need to grip too hard , I am merely guiding you . On the count of three ... One ... two ... three ... ”
178162	178168	178170	178170	Dumbledore	138	“ What do you think ? ”
178191	178201	178203	178203	Harry	136	“ They brought the kids from the orphanage here ? ”
178218	178224	178226	178226	Dumbledore	138	“ Not here , precisely , ”
178228	178356	178226	178226	Dumbledore	138	“ There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us . I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves . No , I think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot . No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers , and boats can not approach the cliffs , the waters around them are too dangerous . I imagine that Riddle climbed down ; magic would have served better than ropes . And he brought two small children with him , probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them . I think the journey alone would have done it , do n’t you ? ”
178369	178386	178357	178357	Harry	136	“ But his final destination — and ours — lies a little farther on . Come . ”
178460	178463	178465	178465	Dumbledore	138	“ Lumos , ”
178511	178515	178517	178517	Dumbledore	138	“ You see ? ”
178541	178552	178527	178527	Harry	136	“ You will not object to getting a little wet ? ”
178553	178556	178558	178558	Harry	136	“ No , ”
178560	178583	178527	178527	Harry	136	“ Then take off your Invisibility Cloak — there is no need for it now — and let us take the plunge . ”
178871	178879	178881	178881	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , this is the place , ”
178883	178889	178890	178890	Harry	136	“ How can you tell ? ”
178896	178902	178904	178904	Dumbledore	138	“ It has known magic , ”
178953	178964	178966	178966	Dumbledore	138	“ This is merely the antechamber , the entrance hall , ”
178973	179001	178966	178966	Dumbledore	138	“ We need to penetrate the inner place ... Now it is Lord Voldemort ’s obstacles that stand in our way , rather than those nature made ... ”
179075	179078	179079	179079	he	138	“ Here , ”
179082	179094	179079	179079	he	138	“ We go on through here . The entrance is concealed . ”
179179	179187	179189	179189	Harry	136	“ You ’ve d - done it ! ”
179221	179232	179233	179233	he	138	“ Harry , I ’m so sorry , I forgot , ”
179268	179272	179274	179274	Harry	136	“ Thank you , ”
179344	179353	179340	179340	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh , surely not . So crude . ”
179354	179361	179340	179340	Dumbledore	138	“ What is it , Professor ? ”
179362	179367	179369	179369	Dumbledore	138	“ I rather think , ”
179395	179406	179388	179388	Harry	136	“ that we are required to make payment to pass . ”
179407	179410	179412	179412	Harry	136	“ Payment ? ”
179414	179424	179412	179412	Harry	136	“ You ’ve got to give the door something ? ”
179425	179428	179430	179430	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , ”
179432	179442	179430	179430	Dumbledore	138	“ Blood , if I am not much mistaken . ”
179443	179446	179412	179412	Harry	136	“ Blood ? ”
179447	179454	179456	179456	Dumbledore	138	“ I said it was crude , ”
179477	179521	179456	179456	Dumbledore	138	“ The idea , as I am sure you will have gathered , is that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to enter . Once again , Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury . ”
179522	179534	179536	179536	Harry	136	“ Yeah , but still , if you can avoid it ... ”
179550	179559	179561	179561	Dumbledore	138	“ Sometimes , however , it is unavoidable , ”
179579	179582	179584	179584	Harry	136	“ Professor ! ”
179594	179603	179591	179591	his	138	“ I ’ll do it , I ’m — ”
179648	179656	179658	179658	Dumbledore	138	“ You are very kind , Harry , ”
179694	179718	179687	179687	Snape	205	“ But your blood is worth more than mine . Ah , that seems to have done the trick , does n’t it ? ”
179762	179769	179774	179774	he	138	“ After me , I think , ”
179910	179915	179917	179917	Dumbledore	138	“ Let us walk , ”
179920	179936	179917	179917	Dumbledore	138	“ Be very careful not to step into the water . Stay close to me . ”
180032	180035	180036	180036	he	136	“ Professor ? ”
180040	180049	180036	180036	he	136	“ Do you think the Horcrux is here ? ”
180050	180054	180056	180056	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh yes , ”
180058	180078	180056	180056	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , I ’m sure it is . The question is , how do we get to it ? ”
180079	180093	180094	180094	Harry	136	“ We could n’t ... we could n’t just try a Summoning Charm ? ”
180127	180132	180134	180134	Dumbledore	138	“ Certainly we could , ”
180146	180154	180134	180134	Dumbledore	138	“ Why do n’t you do it ? ”
180155	180162	180134	180134	Dumbledore	138	“ Me ? Oh ... okay ... ”
180180	180184	180171	180171	his	136	“ Accio Horcrux ! ”
180256	180261	180251	180251	he	136	“ What was that ? ”
180262	180281	180404	180404	Dumbledore	138	“ Something , I think , that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux . ”
180318	180328	180251	180251	he	136	“ Did you think that would happen , sir ? ”
180329	180370	180251	180251	he	136	“ I thought something would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get our hands on the Horcrux . That was a very good idea , Harry ; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing . ”
180371	180382	180384	180384	Harry	136	“ But we do n’t know what the thing was , ”
180393	180402	180404	180404	Dumbledore	138	“ What the things are , you mean , ”
180406	180424	180404	180404	Dumbledore	138	“ I doubt very much that there is only one of them . Shall we walk on ? ”
180425	180428	180251	180251	he	136	“ Professor ? ”
180429	180434	180404	180404	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , Harry ? ”
180435	180450	180251	180251	he	136	“ Do you think we ’re going to have to go into the lake ? ”
180451	180462	180404	180404	Dumbledore	138	“ Into it ? Only if we are very unfortunate . ”
180463	180475	180251	180251	he	136	“ You do n’t think the Horcrux is at the bottom ? ”
180476	180489	180404	180404	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh no ... I think the Horcrux is in the middle . ”
180505	180521	180564	180564	he	138	“ So we ’re going to have to cross the lake to get to it ? ”
180522	180529	180564	180564	he	138	“ Yes , I think so . ”
180556	180559	180561	180561	Dumbledore	138	“ Aha , ”
180607	180635	180592	180592	Dumbledore	138	“ So sorry , Harry , I should have given warning . Stand back against the wall , please ; I think I have found the place . ”
180703	180706	180708	180708	Dumbledore	138	“ Oho , ”
180885	180894	180895	180895	Harry	136	“ How did you know that was there ? ”
180900	180906	180908	180908	Dumbledore	138	“ Magic always leaves traces , ”
180921	180937	180908	180908	Dumbledore	138	“ sometimes very distinctive traces . I taught Tom Riddle . I know his style . ”
180938	180946	181120	181120	Dumbledore	138	“ Is ... is this boat safe ? ”
180947	180989	180908	180908	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh yes , I think so . Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux . ”
180990	181011	181120	181120	Dumbledore	138	“ So the things in the water wo n’t do anything to us if we cross in Voldemort ’s boat ? ”
181012	181056	180908	180908	Dumbledore	138	“ I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will , at some point , realize we are not Lord Voldemort . Thus far , however , we have done well . They have allowed us to raise the boat . ”
181057	181065	181067	181067	Harry	136	“ But why have they let us ? ”
181095	181118	181120	181120	Dumbledore	138	“ Voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat , ”
181122	181175	181120	181120	Dumbledore	138	“ I think he would have been prepared to risk what was , to his mind , the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it , knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate . We shall see whether he is right . ”
181189	181216	181176	181176	Harry	136	“ It does n’t look like it was built for two people . Will it hold both of us ? Will we be too heavy together ? ”
181220	181270	181217	181217	Dumbledore	138	“ Voldemort will not have cared about the weight , but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake . I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it . ”
181271	181276	181340	181340	he	138	“ But then — ? ”
181277	181323	181217	181217	Dumbledore	138	“ I do not think you will count , Harry : You are underage and unqualified . Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen - year - old to reach this place : I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine . ”
181343	181380	181340	181340	he	138	“ Voldemort ’s mistake , Harry , Voldemort ’s mistake ... Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth ... Now , you first this time , and be careful not to touch the water . ”
181555	181558	181559	181559	he	136	“ Professor ! ”
181573	181576	181563	181563	his	136	“ Harry ? ”
181577	181592	181563	181563	his	136	“ I think I saw a hand in the water — a human hand ! ”
181593	181602	181604	181604	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , I am sure you did , ”
181629	181641	181563	181563	his	136	“ So that thing that jumped out of the water — ? ”
181699	181706	181708	181708	Harry	136	“ There are bodies in here ! ”
181724	181727	181729	181729	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , ”
181732	181746	181729	181729	Dumbledore	138	“ but we do not need to worry about them at the moment . ”
181747	181752	181753	181753	Harry	136	“ At the moment ? ”
181767	181778	181780	181780	Dumbledore	138	“ Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us , ”
181782	181848	181780	181780	Dumbledore	138	“ There is nothing to be feared from a body , Harry , any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness . Lord Voldemort , who of course secretly fears both , disagrees . But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom . It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness , nothing more . ”
181892	181899	181900	181900	he	136	“ But one of them jumped , ”
181916	181933	181900	181900	he	136	“ When I tried to Summon the Horcrux , a body leapt out of the lake . ”
181934	181937	181939	181939	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , ”
181941	181994	181995	181995	Dumbledore	138	“ I am sure that once we take the Horcrux , we shall find them less peaceable . However , like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness , they fear light and warmth , which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise . Fire , Harry , ”
182009	182014	182016	182016	Harry	136	“ Oh ... right ... ”
182106	182110	182112	182112	Dumbledore	138	“ Nearly there , ”
182179	182187	182189	182189	Dumbledore	138	“ Careful not to touch the water , ”
182312	182317	182319	182319	Harry	136	“ What is it ? ”
182322	182328	182330	182330	Dumbledore	138	“ I am not sure , ”
182332	182343	182330	182330	Dumbledore	138	“ Something more worrisome than blood and bodies , however . ”
182373	182383	182344	182344	Dumbledore	138	“ Sir , no , do n’t touch — ! ”
182384	182390	182392	182392	Dumbledore	138	“ I can not touch , ”
182397	182412	182392	182392	Dumbledore	138	“ See ? I can not approach any nearer than this . You try . ”
182465	182475	182477	182477	Dumbledore	138	“ Out of the way , please , Harry , ”
182536	182547	182523	182523	his	138	“ You think the Horcrux is in there , sir ? ”
182548	182552	182553	182553	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh yes . ”
182579	182622	182563	182563	his	138	“ But how to reach it ? This potion can not be penetrated by hand , Vanished , parted , scooped up , or siphoned away , nor can it be Transfigured , Charmed , or otherwise made to change its nature . ”
182652	182666	182628	182628	his	138	“ I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk . ”
182667	182670	182672	182672	Harry	136	“ What ? ”
182674	182677	182672	182672	Harry	136	“ No ! ”
182678	182702	182628	182628	his	138	“ Yes , I think so : Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what lies in its depths . ”
182703	182714	182672	182672	Harry	136	“ But what if — what if it kills you ? ”
182715	182727	182729	182729	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh , I doubt that it would work like that , ”
182732	182747	182729	182729	Dumbledore	138	“ Lord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island . ”
182768	182771	182773	182773	Harry	136	“ Sir , ”
182782	182791	182773	182773	Harry	136	“ sir , this is Voldemort we ’re — ”
182792	182818	182821	182821	himself	138	“ I ’m sorry , Harry ; I should have said , he would not want to immediately kill the person who reached this island , ”
182823	182878	182821	182821	himself	138	“ He would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his defenses and , most importantly of all , why they were so intent upon emptying the basin . Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes . ”
182906	182909	182910	182910	he	138	“ Undoubtedly , ”
182915	182998	182910	182910	he	138	“ this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux . It might paralyze me , cause me to forget what I am here for , create so much pain I am distracted , or render me incapable in some other way . This being the case , Harry , it will be your job to make sure I keep drinking , even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth . You understand ? ”
183048	183052	183054	183054	Dumbledore	138	“ You remember , ”
183056	183067	183054	183054	Dumbledore	138	“ the condition on which I brought you with me ? ”
183088	183094	183054	183054	Dumbledore	138	“ But what if — ? ”
183095	183111	183054	183054	Dumbledore	138	“ You swore , did you not , to follow any command I gave you ? ”
183112	183117	183054	183054	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , but — ”
183118	183133	183054	183054	Dumbledore	138	“ I warned you , did I not , that there might be danger ? ”
183134	183137	183139	183139	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
183141	183144	183139	183139	Harry	136	“ but — ”
183145	183150	183152	183152	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , then , ”
183166	183172	183152	183152	Dumbledore	138	“ you have my orders . ”
183173	183183	183185	183185	Harry	136	“ Why ca n’t I drink the potion instead ? ”
183188	183203	183205	183205	Dumbledore	138	“ Because I am much older , much cleverer , and much less valuable , ”
183207	183234	183205	183205	Dumbledore	138	“ Once and for all , Harry , do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking ? ”
183235	183240	183152	183152	Dumbledore	138	“ Could n’t — ? ”
183241	183247	183205	183205	Dumbledore	138	“ Do I have it ? ”
183248	183251	183152	183152	Dumbledore	138	“ But — ”
183252	183258	183205	183205	Dumbledore	138	“ Your word , Harry . ”
183259	183267	183152	183152	Dumbledore	138	“ I — all right , but — ”
183334	183341	183343	183343	he	138	“ Your good health , Harry . ”
183369	183372	183373	183373	he	136	“ Professor ? ”
183384	183390	183378	183378	Dumbledore	138	“ How do you feel ? ”
183464	183468	183470	183470	Harry	136	“ Professor Dumbledore ? ”
183476	183482	183472	183472	his	136	“ Can you hear me ? ”
183535	183543	183544	183544	he	136	“ Professor , can you hear me ? ”
183578	183589	183555	183555	Dumbledore	138	“ I do n’t want ... Do n’t make me ... ”
183619	183629	183631	183631	Dumbledore	138	“ ... do n’t like ... want to stop ... ”
183633	183643	183645	183645	Harry	136	“ You ... you ca n’t stop , Professor , ”
183647	183668	183645	183645	Harry	136	“ You ’ve got to keep drinking , remember ? You told me you had to keep drinking . Here ... ”
183703	183706	183707	183707	he	138	“ No ... ”
183725	183742	183711	183711	Harry	136	“ I do n’t want to ... I do n’t want to ... Let me go ... ”
183743	183751	183753	183753	Harry	136	“ It ’s all right , Professor , ”

183899	183930	183873	183873	Harry	136	“ Nothing ’s happening to you , you ’re safe , it is n’t real , I swear it is n’t real — take this , now , take this ... ”
183962	183973	183974	183974	he	138	“ It ’s all my fault , all my fault , ”
183977	184002	183974	183974	he	138	“ Please make it stop , I know I did wrong , oh please make it stop and I ’ll never , never again ... ”
184003	184012	184013	184013	Harry	136	“ This will make it stop , Professor , ”
184060	184084	184057	184057	he	138	“ Do n’t hurt them , do n’t hurt them , please , please , it ’s my fault , hurt me instead ... ”
184085	184100	184102	184102	Harry	136	“ Here , drink this , drink this , you ’ll be all right , ”

184239	184253	184254	184254	He	136	“ We ’re nearly there , Professor . Drink this , drink it ... ”
184290	184314	184280	184280	Dumbledore	138	“ I want to die ! I want to die ! Make it stop , make it stop , I want to die ! ”
184315	184324	184335	184335	he	138	“ Drink this , Professor . Drink this ... ”

184544	184547	184542	184542	Harry	136	“ Yes — ”

184628	184638	184640	184640	Harry	136	“ But I had some — wait — Aguamenti ! ”
184676	184687	184689	184689	Harry	136	“ Sir , I ’m trying , I ’m trying ! ”
184720	184727	184703	184703	he	138	“ Aguamenti — Aguamenti — AGUAMENTI ! ”

185586	185604	185584	185584	Harry	136	“ sir , I forgot — about fire — they were coming at me and I panicked — ”
185605	185609	185611	185611	Dumbledore	138	“ Quite understandable , ”
185710	185715	185716	185716	he	138	“ I am weak ... ”
185719	185726	185728	185728	Harry	136	“ Do n’t worry , sir , ”
185745	185762	185728	185728	Harry	136	“ Do n’t worry , I ’ll get us back ... Lean on me , sir ... ”
185788	185800	185802	185802	Dumbledore	138	“ The protection was ... after all ... well - designed , ”
185805	185823	185802	185802	Dumbledore	138	“ One alone could not have done it ... You did well , very well , Harry ... ”
185824	185830	185832	185832	Harry	136	“ Do n’t talk now , ”
185849	185864	185832	185832	Harry	136	“ Save your energy , sir ... We ’ll soon be out of here ... ”
185865	185876	185802	185802	Dumbledore	138	“ The archway will have sealed again ... My knife ... ”
185877	185890	185892	185892	Harry	136	“ There ’s no need , I got cut on the rock , ”
185895	185901	185892	185892	Harry	136	“ Just tell me where ... ”
185902	185905	185802	185802	Dumbledore	138	“ Here ... ”
185950	185961	185962	185962	Harry	136	“ It ’s going to be all right , sir , ”
185984	186001	185976	185976	he	136	“ We ’re nearly there ... I can Apparate us both back ... Do n’t worry ... ”
186002	186010	186012	186012	Dumbledore	138	“ I am not worried , Harry , ”
186024	186030	186014	186014	his	138	“ I am with you . ”
186190	186197	186198	186198	Harry	136	“ We did it , Professor ! ”
186216	186226	186198	186198	Harry	136	“ We did it ! We got the Horcrux ! ”
186267	186275	186251	186251	his	138	“ Sir , are you all right ? ”
186276	186282	186284	186284	Dumbledore	138	“ I ’ve been better , ”
186295	186304	186284	186284	Dumbledore	138	“ That potion ... was no health drink ... ”
186317	186338	186339	186339	He	136	“ Sir — it ’s okay , sir , you ’re going to be all right , do n’t worry — ”
186371	186387	186360	186360	he	136	“ We need to get you up to the school , sir ... Madam Pomfrey ... ”
186388	186391	186393	186393	Dumbledore	138	“ No , ”
186395	186419	186393	186393	Dumbledore	138	“ It is ... Professor Snape whom I need ... But I do not think ... I can walk very far just yet ... ”
186420	186451	186360	186360	he	136	“ Right — sir , listen — I ’m going to knock on a door , find a place you can stay — then I can run and get Madam — ”
186452	186455	186457	186457	Dumbledore	138	“ Severus , ”
186460	186465	186457	186457	Dumbledore	138	“ I need Severus ... ”
186466	186489	186360	186360	he	136	“ All right then , Snape — but I ’m going to have to leave you for a moment so I can — ”
186549	186582	186583	186583	She	170	“ I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains ! Thank goodness , thank goodness , I could n’t think what to — but what ’s wrong with Albus ? ”
186602	186607	186609	186609	Harry	136	“ He ’s hurt , ”
186611	186635	186609	186609	Harry	136	“ Madam Rosmerta , can he come into the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the school and get help for him ? ”
186636	186656	186712	186712	she	170	“ You ca n’t go up there alone ! Do n’t you realize — have n’t you seen — ? ”
186657	186665	186667	186667	Harry	136	“ If you help me support him , ”
186674	186683	186667	186667	Harry	136	“ I think we can get him inside — ”
186684	186689	186691	186691	Dumbledore	138	“ What has happened ? ”
186693	186700	186691	186691	Dumbledore	138	“ Rosmerta , what ’s wrong ? ”
186701	186710	186712	186712	she	170	“ The — the Dark Mark , Albus . ”
186778	186784	186786	186786	Dumbledore	138	“ When did it appear ? ”
186804	186828	186789	186789	his	138	“ Must have been minutes ago , it was n’t there when I put the cat out , but when I got upstairs — ”
186829	186840	186842	186842	Dumbledore	138	“ We need to return to the castle at once , ”
186844	186846	186842	186842	Dumbledore	138	“ Rosmerta ”
186864	186871	186842	186842	Dumbledore	138	“ we need transport — brooms — ”
186872	186882	186883	186883	she	3119	“ I ’ve got a couple behind the bar , ”
186890	186898	186883	186883	she	3119	“ Shall I run and fetch — ? ”
186899	186907	186842	186842	Dumbledore	138	“ No , Harry can do it . ”
186915	186921	186908	186908	Harry	136	“ Accio Rosmerta ’s Brooms ! ”
186969	186980	186985	186985	he	138	“ Rosmerta , please send a message to the Ministry , ”
186992	187015	186985	186985	he	138	“ It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realized anything is wrong ... Harry , put on your Invisibility Cloak . ”
187421	187427	187428	187428	Harry	136	“ What does it mean ? ”
187448	187462	187430	187430	Dumbledore	138	“ Is it the real Mark ? Has someone definitely been — Professor ? ”
187484	187490	187492	187492	Dumbledore	138	“ Go and wake Severus , ”
187497	187530	187492	187492	Dumbledore	138	“ Tell him what has happened and bring him to me . Do nothing else , speak to nobody else , and do not remove your Cloak . I shall wait here . ”
187531	187534	187587	187587	Dumbledore	138	“ But — ”
187535	187546	187492	187492	Dumbledore	138	“ You swore to obey me , Harry — go ! ”
187619	187622	187612	187612	somebody	1283	“ Expelliarmus ! ”
187754	187760	187744	187744	He	138	“ Good evening , Draco . ”
187785	187791	187777	187777	His	159	“ Who else is here ? ”
187792	187806	187809	187809	Malfoy	159	“ A question I might ask you . Or are you acting alone ? ”
187825	187828	187829	187829	he	138	“ No , ”
187832	187848	187829	187829	he	138	“ I ’ve got backup . There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight . ”
187849	187854	187856	187856	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , well , ”
187869	187886	187860	187860	Malfoy	159	“ Very good indeed . You found a way to let them in , did you ? ”
187887	187890	187892	187892	Malfoy	159	“ Yeah , ”
187898	187908	187892	187892	Malfoy	159	“ Right under your nose and you never realized ! ”
187909	187912	187914	187914	Dumbledore	138	“ Ingenious , ”
187916	187931	187914	187914	Dumbledore	138	“ Yet ... forgive me ... where are they now ? You seem unsupported . ”
187932	187969	187892	187892	Malfoy	159	“ They met some of your guards . They ’re having a fight down below . They wo n’t be long ... I came on ahead . I — I ’ve got a job to do . ”
187970	187987	187989	187989	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , then , you must get on and do it , my dear boy , ”
188050	188061	188074	188074	He	159	“ Draco , Draco , you are not a killer . ”
188062	188068	188070	188070	Malfoy	159	“ How do you know ? ”
188096	188107	188109	188109	Malfoy	159	“ You do n’t know what I ’m capable of , ”
188113	188123	188109	188109	Malfoy	159	“ You do n’t know what I ’ve done ! ”
188124	188131	188133	188133	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh yes , I do , ”
188136	188192	188133	188133	Dumbledore	138	“ You almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley . You have been trying , with increasing desperation , to kill me all year . Forgive me , Draco , but they have been feeble attempts ... So feeble , to be honest , that I wonder whether your heart has been really in it . ”
188193	188200	188202	188202	Malfoy	159	“ It has been in it ! ”
188205	188218	188202	188202	Malfoy	159	“ I ’ve been working on it all year , and tonight — ”
188241	188250	188252	188252	Dumbledore	138	“ Somebody is putting up a good fight , ”
188255	188289	188252	188252	Dumbledore	138	“ But you were saying ... yes , you have managed to introduce Death Eaters into my school , which , I admit , I thought impossible ... How did you do it ? ”
188313	188325	188327	188327	Dumbledore	138	“ Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone , ”
188329	188385	188327	188327	Dumbledore	138	“ What if your backup has been thwarted by my guard ? As you have perhaps realized , there are members of the Order of the Phoenix here tonight too . And after all , you do n’t really need help ... I have no wand at the moment ... I can not defend myself . ”
188392	188396	188398	188398	Dumbledore	138	“ I see , ”
188408	188419	188402	188402	Malfoy	159	“ You are afraid to act until they join you . ”
188420	188426	188428	188428	Malfoy	159	“ I ’m not afraid ! ”
188440	188449	188431	188431	he	159	“ It ’s you who should be scared ! ”
188450	188512	188431	188431	he	159	“ But why ? I do n’t think you will kill me , Draco . Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe ... So tell me , while we wait for your friends ... how did you smuggle them in here ? It seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it . ”
188565	188591	188562	188562	he	159	“ I had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no one ’s used for years . The one Montague got lost in last year . ”
188592	188595	188596	188596	Dumbledore	138	“ Aaaah . ”
188612	188626	188604	188604	He	138	“ That was clever ... There is a pair , I take it ? ”
188627	188633	188635	188635	Malfoy	159	“ In Borgin and Burkes , ”
188637	188781	188635	188635	Malfoy	159	“ and they make a kind of passage between them . Montague told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one , he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school , and sometimes what was going on in the shop , as if the cabinet was traveling between them , but he could n’t make anyone hear him ... In the end , he managed to Apparate out , even though he ’d never passed his test . He nearly died doing it . Everyone thought it was a really good story , but I was the only one who realized what it meant — even Borgin did n’t know — I was the one who realized there could be a way into Hogwarts through the cabinets if I fixed the broken one . ”
188782	188786	188788	188788	Dumbledore	138	“ Very good , ”
188790	188830	188788	188788	Dumbledore	138	“ So the Death Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help you ... A clever plan , a very clever plan ... and , as you say , right under my nose . ”
188831	188834	188836	188836	Malfoy	159	“ Yeah , ”
188851	188857	188836	188836	Malfoy	159	“ Yeah , it was ! ”
188858	188864	188865	188865	Dumbledore	138	“ But there were times , ”
188869	188924	188865	188865	Dumbledore	138	“ were n’t there , when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the cabinet ? And you resorted to crude and badly judged measures such as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands ... poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I might drink ... ”
188925	188944	188946	188946	Malfoy	159	“ Yeah , well , you still did n’t realize who was behind that stuff , did you ? ”
188978	188988	188990	188990	Dumbledore	138	“ As a matter of fact , I did , ”
188992	189000	188990	188990	Dumbledore	138	“ I was sure it was you . ”
189001	189011	189012	189012	Malfoy	159	“ Why did n’t you stop me , then ? ”
189015	189033	189012	189012	Malfoy	159	“ I tried , Draco . Professor Snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders — ”
189034	189048	188990	188990	Dumbledore	138	“ He has n’t been doing your orders , he promised my mother — ”
189049	189064	189012	189012	Malfoy	159	“ Of course that is what he would tell you , Draco , but — ”
189065	189090	188990	188990	Dumbledore	138	“ He ’s a double agent , you stupid old man , he is n’t working for you , you just think he is ! ”
189091	189111	189012	189012	Malfoy	159	“ We must agree to differ on that , Draco . It so happens that I trust Professor Snape — ”
189112	189123	189125	189125	Malfoy	159	“ Well , you ’re losing your grip , then ! ”
189127	189228	189125	189125	Malfoy	159	“ He ’s been offering me plenty of help — wanting all the glory for himself — wanting a bit of the action — ‘ What are you doing ? ’ ‘ Did you do the necklace , that was stupid , it could have blown everything — ’ But I have n’t told him what I ’ve been doing in the Room of Requirement , he ’s going to wake up tomorrow and it ’ll all be over and he wo n’t be the Dark Lord ’s favorite anymore , he ’ll be nothing compared to me , nothing ! ”
189229	189233	189235	189235	Dumbledore	138	“ Very gratifying , ”
189238	189281	189235	189235	Dumbledore	138	“ We all like appreciation for our own hard work , of course . But you must have had an accomplice , all the same ... someone in Hogsmeade , someone who was able to slip Katie the — the — aaaah ... ”
189299	189316	189292	189292	he	138	“ ... of course ... Rosmerta . How long has she been under the Imperius Curse ? ”
189317	189326	189327	189327	Malfoy	159	“ Got there at last , have you ? ”
189360	189474	189354	189354	Dumbledore	138	“ So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied ? And the poisoned mead ... well , naturally , Rosmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to Slughorn , believing that it was to be my Christmas present ... Yes , very neat ... very neat ... Poor Mr. Filch would not , of course , think to check a bottle of Rosmerta ’s . Tell me , how have you been communicating with Rosmerta ? I thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored . ”
189475	189479	189481	189481	Malfoy	159	“ Enchanted coins , ”
189500	189516	189485	189485	he	159	“ I had one and she had the other and I could send her messages — ”
189517	189538	189540	189540	Dumbledore	138	“ Is n’t that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves Dumbledore ’s Army used last year ? ”
189565	189575	189577	189577	Malfoy	159	“ Yeah , I got the idea from them , ”
189584	189613	189577	189577	Malfoy	159	“ I got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood Granger as well , I heard her talking in the library about Filch not recognizing potions . ”
189614	189627	189629	189629	Dumbledore	138	“ Please do not use that offensive word in front of me , ”
189637	189654	189631	189631	Malfoy	159	“ You care about me saying ‘ Mudblood ’ when I ’m about to kill you ? ”
189655	189661	189663	189663	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , I do , ”
189683	189728	189666	189666	Harry	136	“ But as for being about to kill me , Draco , you have had several long minutes now , we are quite alone , I am more defenseless than you can have dreamed of finding me , and still you have not acted ... ”
189744	189750	189751	189751	Dumbledore	138	“ Now , about tonight , ”
189755	189779	189780	189780	he	138	“ I am a little puzzled about how it happened ... You knew that I had left the school ? But of course , ”
189786	189805	189780	189780	he	138	“ Rosmerta saw me leaving , she tipped you off using your ingenious coins , I ’m sure . ”
189806	189811	189813	189813	Malfoy	159	“ That ’s right , ”
189815	189832	189813	189813	Malfoy	159	“ But she said you were just going for a drink , you ’d be back ... ”
189833	189852	189854	189854	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , I certainly did have a drink ... and I came back ... after a fashion , ”
189856	189867	189854	189854	Dumbledore	138	“ So you decided to spring a trap for me ? ”
189868	189894	189896	189896	Malfoy	159	“ We decided to put the Dark Mark over the tower and get you to hurry up here , to see who ’d been killed , ”
189898	189903	189896	189896	Malfoy	159	“ And it worked ! ”
189904	189911	189913	189913	Dumbledore	138	“ Well ... yes and no ... ”
189915	189931	189913	189913	Dumbledore	138	“ But am I to take it , then , that nobody has been murdered ? ”
189932	189937	189939	189939	Malfoy	159	“ Someone ’s dead , ”
189955	189999	189942	189942	his	159	“ One of your people ... I do n’t know who , it was dark ... I stepped over the body ... I was supposed to be waiting up here when you got back , only your Phoenix lot got in the way ... ”
190000	190007	190009	190009	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , they do that , ”
190075	190086	190088	190088	Dumbledore	138	“ There is little time , one way or another , ”
190090	190100	190088	190088	Dumbledore	138	“ So let us discuss your options , Draco . ”
190101	190105	190107	190107	Malfoy	159	“ My options ! ”
190110	190126	190107	190107	Malfoy	159	“ I ’m standing here with a wand — I ’m about to kill you — ”
190127	190174	190088	190088	Dumbledore	138	“ My dear boy , let us have no more pretense about that . If you were going to kill me , you would have done it when you first disarmed me , you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means . ”
190175	190183	190185	190185	Malfoy	159	“ I have n’t got any options ! ”
190195	190215	190193	190193	Dumbledore	138	“ I ’ve got to do it ! He ’ll kill me ! He ’ll kill my whole family ! ”
190216	190225	190227	190227	Dumbledore	138	“ I appreciate the difficulty of your position , ”
190229	190261	190227	190227	Dumbledore	138	“ Why else do you think I have not confronted you before now ? Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realized that I suspected you . ”
190271	190299	190301	190301	Dumbledore	138	“ I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted , in case he used Legilimency against you , ”
190303	190345	190301	190301	Dumbledore	138	“ But now at last we can speak plainly to each other ... No harm has been done , you have hurt nobody , though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived ... I can help you , Draco . ”
190346	190353	190355	190355	Malfoy	159	“ No , you ca n’t , ”
190365	190387	190355	190355	Malfoy	159	“ Nobody can . He told me to do it or he ’ll kill me . I ’ve got no choice . ”
190388	190467	190301	190301	Dumbledore	138	“ Come over to the right side , Draco , and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine . What is more , I can send members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise . Your father is safe at the moment in Azkaban ... When the time comes , we can protect him too ... Come over to the right side , Draco ... you are not a killer ... ”
190473	190484	190485	190485	he	159	“ But I got this far , did n’t I ? ”
190489	190525	190485	190485	he	159	“ They thought I ’d die in the attempt , but I ’m here ... and you ’re in my power ... I ’m the one with the wand ... You ’re at my mercy ... ”
190526	190531	190533	190533	Dumbledore	138	“ No , Draco , ”
190536	190550	190533	190533	Dumbledore	138	“ It is my mercy , and not yours , that matters now . ”
190653	190657	190658	190658	he	3156	“ Dumbledore cornered ! ”
190684	190699	190673	190673	she	3157	“ Dumbledore wandless , Dumbledore alone ! Well done , Draco , well done ! ”
190700	190706	190708	190708	Dumbledore	138	“ Good evening , Amycus , ”
190721	190731	190708	190708	Dumbledore	138	“ And you ’ve brought Alecto too ... Charming ... ”
190740	190752	190753	190753	she	3160	“ Think your little jokes’ll help you on your deathbed then ? ”
190756	190767	190769	190769	Dumbledore	138	“ Jokes ? No , no , these are manners , ”
190771	190775	190777	190782	the stranger standing nearest to Harry	3161	“ Do it , ”
190853	190860	190862	190862	Dumbledore	138	“ Is that you , Fenrir ? ”
190864	190869	190871	190872	the other	733	“ That ’s right , ”
190874	190882	190871	190872	the other	733	“ Pleased to see me , Dumbledore ? ”
190883	190894	190862	190862	Dumbledore	138	“ No , I can not say that I am . ”
190916	190928	190871	190872	the other	733	“ But you know how much I like kids , Dumbledore . ”
190929	190968	190871	190872	the other	733	“ Am I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now ? This is most unusual ... You have developed a taste for human flesh that can not be satisfied once a month ? ”
190969	190974	190976	190977	Fenrir Greyback	255	“ That ’s right , ”
190979	190992	190976	190977	Fenrir Greyback	255	“ Shocks you that , does it , Dumbledore ? Frightens you ? ”
190993	191008	191010	191010	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , I can not pretend it does not disgust me a little , ”
191012	191040	191010	191010	Dumbledore	138	“ And , yes , I am a little shocked that Draco here invited you , of all people , into the school where his friends live ... ”
191041	191046	191048	191048	Malfoy	159	“ I did n’t , ”
191069	191080	191057	191057	he	159	“ I did n’t know he was going to come — ”
191081	191095	191097	191097	Greyback	255	“ I would n’t want to miss a trip to Hogwarts , Dumbledore , ”
191099	191114	191097	191097	Greyback	255	“ Not when there are throats to be ripped out ... Delicious , delicious ... ”
191132	191142	191116	191116	he	255	“ I could do you for afters , Dumbledore . ”
191143	191146	191148	191151	the fourth Death Eater	3164	“ No , ”
191164	191184	191154	191154	He	3164	“ We ’ve got orders . Draco ’s got to do it . Now , Draco , and quickly . ”
191226	191241	191243	191245	the lopsided man	3165	“ He ’s not long for this world anyway , if you ask me ! ”
191257	191272	191243	191245	the lopsided man	3165	“ Look at him — what ’s happened to you , then , Dumby ? ”
191273	191284	191286	191286	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh , weaker resistance , slower reflexes , Amycus , ”
191288	191311	191286	191286	Dumbledore	138	“ Old age , in short ... One day , perhaps , it will happen to you ... if you are lucky ... ”
191312	191325	191327	191329	the Death Eater	3167	“ What ’s that mean , then , what ’s that mean ? ”
191334	191375	191327	191329	the Death Eater	3167	“ Always the same , were n’t yeh , Dumby , talking and doing nothing , nothing . I do n’t even know why the Dark Lord ’s bothering to kill yer ! Come on , Draco , do it ! ”
191393	191404	191286	191286	Dumbledore	138	“ They ’ve blocked the stairs — Reducto ! REDUCTO ! ”
191446	191453	191455	191459	the brutal - faced man	3170	“ Now , Draco , quickly ! ”
191476	191482	191484	191484	Fenrir	255	“ I ’ll do it , ”
191498	191503	191505	191509	the brutal - faced man	3170	“ I said no ! ”
191577	191590	191592	191593	the woman	3160	“ Draco , do it or stand aside so one of us — ”
191650	191659	191661	191671	the lumpy Amycus , whose eyes and wand were fixed alike	3179	“ We ’ve got a problem , Snape , ”
191675	191683	191661	191671	the lumpy Amycus , whose eyes and wand were fixed alike	3179	“ the boy does n’t seem able — ”

192169	192178	192164	192166	the hated voice	3193	“ It ’s over , time to go ! ”
192279	192283	192248	192248	Harry	136	“ Petrificus Totalus ! ”

193073	193090	193092	193093	Ernie Macmillan	317	“ Harry ! We heard a noise , and someone said something about the Dark Mark — ”

195130	195133	195135	195135	Hagrid	176	“ Killed ? ”
195143	195156	195135	195135	Hagrid	176	“ Snape killed ? What ’re yeh on abou ’ , Harry ? ”
195157	195160	195162	195162	Harry	136	“ Dumbledore , ”
195164	195170	195162	195162	Harry	136	“ Snape killed ... Dumbledore . ”
195191	195198	195135	195135	Hagrid	176	“ Dumbledore wha ’ , Harry ? ”
195199	195208	195135	195135	Hagrid	176	“ He ’s dead . Snape killed him ... ”
195209	195215	195217	195217	Hagrid	176	“ Don ’ say that , ”
195220	195240	195217	195217	Hagrid	176	“ Snape kill Dumbledore — don ’ be stupid , Harry . Wha ’s made yeh say tha ’ ? ”
195241	195247	195135	195135	Hagrid	176	“ I saw it happen . ”
195248	195254	195217	195217	Hagrid	176	“ Yeh couldn ’ have . ”
195255	195262	195135	195135	Hagrid	176	“ I saw it , Hagrid . ”
195303	195320	195321	195321	Hagrid	176	“ What musta happened was , Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with them Death Eaters , ”
195325	195353	195321	195321	Hagrid	176	“ I suppose he ’s got ta keep his cover . Look , let ’s get yeh back up ter the school . Come on , Harry ... ”
195571	195580	195582	195582	Hagrid	176	“ What ’re they all lookin ’ at ? ”
195604	195616	195617	195617	Hagrid	176	“ Wha ’s tha ’ , lyin ’ on the grass ? ”
195638	195670	195632	195634	a small crowd	3274	“ See it , Harry ? Righ ’ at the foot o ’ the tower ? Under where the Mark ... Blimey ... yeh don ’ think someone got thrown — ? ”
196163	196167	196135	196135	Harry	136	“ To the Dark Lord
196232	196232	196233	196233	Harry	136	”
196288	196293	196283	196283	Fang	355	“ C’mere , Harry ... ”
196294	196297	196283	196283	Fang	355	“ No . ”
196298	196312	196283	196283	Fang	355	“ Yeh can ’ stay here , Harry ... Come on , now ... ”
196313	196316	196283	196283	Fang	355	“ No . ”
196349	196355	196335	196335	Hagrid	176	“ Harry , come on . ”
196488	196497	196499	196499	Ginny	218	“ We ’re going to the hospital wing , ”
196501	196507	196509	196509	Harry	136	“ I ’m not hurt , ”
196511	196518	196520	196520	Ginny	218	“ It ’s McGonagall ’s orders , ”
196522	196536	196520	196520	Ginny	218	“ Everyone ’s up there , Ron and Hermione and Lupin and everyone — ”
196556	196564	196611	196611	her	218	“ Ginny , who else is dead ? ”
196565	196574	196611	196611	her	218	“ Do n’t worry , none of us . ”
196575	196589	196611	196611	her	218	“ But the Dark Mark — Malfoy said he stepped over a body — ”
196590	196606	196611	196611	her	218	“ He stepped over Bill , but it ’s all right , he ’s alive . ”
196622	196627	196611	196611	her	218	“ Are you sure ? ”
196628	196667	196611	196611	her	218	“ Of course I ’m sure ... he ’s a — a bit of a mess , that ’s all . Greyback attacked him . Madam Pomfrey says he wo n’t — wo n’t look the same anymore ... ”
196675	196702	196668	196668	Ginny	218	“ We do n’t really know what the aftereffects will be — I mean , Greyback being a werewolf , but not transformed at the time . ”
196703	196716	196611	196611	her	218	“ But the others ... There were other bodies on the ground ... ”
196717	196787	196668	196668	Ginny	218	“ Neville and Professor Flitwick are both hurt , but Madam Pomfrey says they ’ll be all right . And a Death Eater ’s dead , he got hit by a Killing Curse that huge blond one was firing off everywhere — Harry , if we had n’t had your Felix potion , I think we ’d all have been killed , but everything seemed to just miss us — ”
196867	196875	196851	196851	Hermione	179	“ Are you all right , Harry ? ”
196876	196885	196851	196851	Hermione	179	“ I ’m fine ... How ’s Bill ? ”
196947	196959	196960	196960	he	136	“ Ca n’t you fix them with a charm or something ? ”
196965	196973	196975	196976	Madam Pomfrey	287	“ No charm will work on these , ”
196978	196995	196975	196976	Madam Pomfrey	287	“ I ’ve tried everything I know , but there is no cure for werewolf bites . ”
196996	197007	197009	197009	Ron	201	“ But he was n’t bitten at the full moon , ”
197033	197051	197009	197009	Ron	201	“ Greyback had n’t transformed , so surely Bill wo n’t be a — a real — ? ”
197058	197073	197075	197075	Lupin	210	“ No , I do n’t think that Bill will be a true werewolf , ”
197077	197117	197075	197075	Lupin	210	“ but that does not mean that there wo n’t be some contamination . Those are cursed wounds . They are unlikely ever to heal fully , and — and Bill might have some wolfish characteristics from now on . ”
197118	197129	197130	197130	Ron	201	“ Dumbledore might know something that ’d work , though , ”
197133	197160	197130	197130	Ron	201	“ Where is he ? Bill fought those maniacs on Dumbledore ’s orders , Dumbledore owes him , he ca n’t leave him in this state — ”
197161	197168	197170	197170	Ginny	218	“ Ron — Dumbledore ’s dead , ”
197172	197175	197176	197176	Lupin	210	“ No ! ”
197259	197265	197267	197267	Tonks	209	“ How did he die ? ”
197269	197275	197267	197267	Tonks	209	“ How did it happen ? ”
197276	197281	197283	197283	Harry	136	“ Snape killed him , ”
197285	197363	197283	197283	Harry	136	“ I was there , I saw it . We arrived back on the Astronomy Tower because that ’s where the Mark was ... Dumbledore was ill , he was weak , but I think he realized it was a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs . He immobilized me , I could n’t do anything , I was under the Invisibility Cloak — and then Malfoy came through the door and disarmed him — ”
197380	197400	197401	197401	Harry	136	“ — more Death Eaters arrived — and then Snape — and Snape did it . The Avada Kedavra . ”
197424	197429	197419	197419	Ginny	218	“ Shh ! Listen ! ”
197593	197602	197603	197603	she	232	“ Molly and Arthur are on their way , ”
197644	197674	197641	197641	their	3949	“ Harry , what happened ? According to Hagrid you were with Professor Dumbledore when he — when it happened . He says Professor Snape was involved in some — ”
197675	197680	197682	197682	Harry	136	“ Snape killed Dumbledore , ”
197723	197726	197728	197728	McGonagall	232	“ Snape , ”
197736	197755	197728	197728	McGonagall	232	“ We all wondered ... but he trusted ... always ... Snape ... I ca n’t believe it ... ”
197756	197764	197768	197768	his	210	“ Snape was a highly accomplished Occlumens , ”
197773	197779	197768	197768	his	210	“ We always knew that . ”
197780	197790	197792	197792	Tonks	209	“ But Dumbledore swore he was on our side ! ”
197794	197809	197792	197792	Tonks	209	“ I always thought Dumbledore must know something about Snape that we did n’t ... ”
197810	197824	197826	197827	Professor McGonagall	232	“ He always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting Snape , ”
197845	197883	197826	197827	Professor McGonagall	232	“ I mean ... with Snape ’s history ... of course people were bound to wonder ... but Dumbledore told me explicitly that Snape ’s repentance was absolutely genuine ... Would n’t hear a word against him ! ”
197884	197898	197900	197900	Tonks	209	“ I ’d love to know what Snape told him to convince him , ”
197902	197906	197908	197908	Harry	136	“ I know , ”
197919	197963	197911	197911	they	3303	“ Snape passed Voldemort the information that made Voldemort hunt down my mum and dad . Then Snape told Dumbledore he had n’t realized what he was doing , he was really sorry he ’d done it , sorry that they were dead . ”
197970	197976	197978	197978	Lupin	210	“ And Dumbledore believed that ? ”
197981	197995	197978	197978	Lupin	210	“ Dumbledore believed Snape was sorry James was dead ? Snape hated James ... ”
197996	198010	198012	198012	Harry	136	“ And he did n’t think my mother was worth a damn either , ”
198014	198030	198012	198012	Harry	136	“ because she was Muggle - born ... ‘ Mudblood , ’ he called her ... ”
198060	198067	198069	198070	Professor McGonagall	232	“ This is all my fault , ”
198085	198155	198073	198073	She	232	“ My fault . I sent Filius to fetch Snape tonight , I actually sent for him to come and help us ! If I had n’t alerted Snape to what was going on , he might never have joined forces with the Death Eaters . I do n’t think he knew they were there before Filius told him , I do n’t think he knew they were coming . ”
198156	198165	198167	198167	Lupin	210	“ It is n’t your fault , Minerva , ”
198170	198188	198167	198167	Lupin	210	“ We all wanted more help , we were glad to think Snape was on his way ... ”
198189	198208	198210	198210	Harry	136	“ So when he arrived at the fight , he joined in on the Death Eaters ’ side ? ”
198235	198245	198247	198248	Professor McGonagall	232	“ I do n’t know exactly how it happened , ”
198251	198347	198247	198248	Professor McGonagall	232	“ It ’s all so confusing ... Dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case ... Remus , Bill , and Nymphadora were to join us ... and so we patrolled . All seemed quiet . Every secret passageway out of the school was covered . We knew nobody could fly in . There were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle . I still do n’t know how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered ... ”
198348	198352	198354	198354	Harry	136	“ I do , ”
198375	198386	198357	198357	he	136	“ So they got in through the Room of Requirement . ”
198404	198411	198413	198413	Ron	201	“ I messed up , Harry , ”
198416	198471	198413	198413	Ron	201	“ We did like you told us : We checked the Marauder ’s Map and we could n’t see Malfoy on it , so we thought he must be in the Room of Requirement , so me , Ginny , and Neville went to keep watch on it ... but Malfoy got past us . ”
198472	198488	198490	198490	Ginny	218	“ He came out of the room about an hour after we started keeping watch , ”
198492	198505	198490	198490	Ginny	218	“ He was on his own , clutching that awful shriveled arm — ”
198506	198512	198514	198514	Ron	201	“ His Hand of Glory , ”
198516	198526	198514	198514	Ron	201	“ Gives light only to the holder , remember ? ”
198527	198530	198531	198531	Ginny	218	“ Anyway , ”
198535	198573	198531	198531	Ginny	218	“ he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out , because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitch - black — ”
198574	198581	198583	198583	Ron	201	“ — Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder , ”
198586	198610	198583	198583	Ron	201	“ Fred and George ’s . I ’m going to be having a word with them about who they let buy their products . ”
198611	198620	198622	198622	Ginny	218	“ We tried everything , Lumos , Incendio , ”
198624	198703	198622	198622	Ginny	218	“ Nothing would penetrate the darkness ; all we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again , and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us . Obviously Malfoy could see because of that hand thing and was guiding them , but we did n’t dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each other , and by the time we ’d reached a corridor that was light , they ’d gone . ”
198704	198707	198709	198709	Lupin	210	“ Luckily , ”
198712	198803	198709	198709	Lupin	210	“ Ron , Ginny , and Neville ran into us almost immediately and told us what had happened . We found the Death Eaters minutes later , heading in the direction of the Astronomy Tower . Malfoy obviously had n’t expected more people to be on the watch ; he seemed to have exhausted his supply of Darkness Powder , at any rate . A fight broke out , they scattered and we gave chase . One of them , Gibbon , broke away and headed up the tower stairs — ”
198804	198811	198813	198813	Harry	136	“ To set off the Mark ? ”
198815	198836	198838	198838	Lupin	210	“ He must have done , yes , they must have arranged that before they left the Room of Requirement , ”
198840	198880	198838	198838	Lupin	210	“ But I do n’t think Gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for Dumbledore , because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me . ”
198881	198896	198898	198898	Harry	136	“ So if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ginny and Neville , ”
198904	198909	198898	198898	Harry	136	“ were you — ? ”
198910	198918	198920	198920	Hermione	179	“ Outside Snape ’s office , yes , ”
198928	199046	198920	198920	Hermione	179	“ with Luna . We hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened ... We did n’t know what was going on upstairs , Ron had taken the map ... It was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons . He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle , I do n’t think he really registered that Luna and I were there at all , he just burst his way into Snape ’s office and we heard him saying that Snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and — and — ”
199047	199050	199051	199051	Harry	136	“ What ? ”
199055	199063	199065	199065	Hermione	179	“ I was so stupid , Harry ! ”
199073	199103	199065	199065	Hermione	179	“ He said Professor Flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he — while he went to help fight the Death Eaters — ”
199125	199181	199104	199104	She	3308	“ We went into his office to see if we could help Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor ... and oh , it ’s so obvious now , Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick , but we did n’t realize , Harry , we did n’t realize , we just let Snape go ! ”
199182	199189	199191	199191	Lupin	210	“ It ’s not your fault , ”
199194	199218	199191	199191	Lupin	210	“ Hermione , had you not obeyed Snape and got out of the way , he probably would have killed you and Luna . ”
199219	199226	199228	199228	Harry	136	“ So then he came upstairs , ”
199265	199277	199255	199255	his	205	“ and he found the place where you were all fighting ... ”
199278	199288	199290	199290	Tonks	209	“ We were in trouble , we were losing , ”
199296	199388	199290	199290	Tonks	209	“ Gibbon was down , but the rest of the Death Eaters seemed ready to fight to the death . Neville had been hurt , Bill had been savaged by Greyback ... It was all dark ... curses flying everywhere ... The Malfoy boy had vanished , he must have slipped past , up the stairs ... then more of them ran after him , but one of them blocked the stair behind them with some kind of curse ... Neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air — ”
199389	199397	199399	199399	Ron	201	“ None of us could break through , ”
199401	199428	199399	199399	Ron	201	“ and that massive Death Eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place , they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us ... ”
199429	199436	199438	199438	Tonks	209	“ And then Snape was there , ”
199440	199447	199438	199438	Tonks	209	“ and then he was n’t — ”
199448	199477	199479	199479	Ginny	218	“ I saw him running toward us , but that huge Death Eater ’s jinx just missed me right afterward and I ducked and lost track of things , ”
199481	199498	199500	199500	Lupin	210	“ I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it was n’t there , ”
199502	199517	199500	199500	Lupin	210	“ I tried to follow him , but was thrown back just like Neville ... ”
199518	199529	199531	199531	McGonagall	232	“ He must have known a spell we did n’t , ”
199533	199570	199531	199531	McGonagall	232	“ After all — he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ... I just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters who ’d escaped up to the tower ... ”
199571	199575	199577	199577	Harry	136	“ He was , ”
199580	199617	199577	199577	Harry	136	“ but to help them , not to stop them ... and I ’ll bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier — so what happened when he came back down ? ”
199618	199649	199651	199651	Lupin	210	“ Well , the big Death Eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the ceiling to fall in , and also broke the curse blocking the stairs , ”
199653	199688	199651	199651	Lupin	210	“ We all ran forward — those of us who were still standing anyway — and then Snape and the boy emerged out of the dust — obviously , none of us attacked them — ”
199689	199696	199698	199698	Tonks	209	“ We just let them pass , ”
199704	199749	199698	199698	Tonks	209	“ We thought they were being chased by the Death Eaters — and next thing , the other Death Eaters and Greyback were back and we were fighting again — I thought I heard Snape shout something , but I do n’t know what — ”
199750	199760	199762	199762	Harry	136	“ He shouted , ‘ It ’s over , ’ ”
199764	199775	199762	199762	Harry	136	“ He ’d done what he ’d meant to do . ”
199899	199904	199906	199907	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Molly — Arthur — ”
199917	199923	199906	199907	Professor McGonagall	232	“ I am so sorry — ”
199924	199927	199929	199930	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Bill , ”
199946	199951	199937	199937	she	202	“ Oh , Bill ! ”
199989	199996	199997	199998	Mr. Weasley	204	“ You said Greyback attacked him ? ”
200004	200023	200000	200001	Professor McGonagall	232	“ But he had n’t transformed ? So what does that mean ? What will happen to Bill ? ”
200024	200031	200033	200034	Professor McGonagall	232	“ We do n’t yet know , ”
200041	200051	200053	200053	Lupin	210	“ There will probably be some contamination , Arthur , ”
200055	200079	200053	200053	Lupin	210	“ It is an odd case , possibly unique ... We do n’t know what his behavior might be like when he awakens ... ”
200099	200103	200105	200106	Mr. Weasley	204	“ And Dumbledore ... ”
200108	200120	200105	200106	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Minerva , is it true ... Is he really ... ? ”
200160	200164	200166	200167	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Dumbledore gone , ”
200193	200238	200180	200180	she	202	“ Of course , it does n’t matter how he looks ... It ’s not r - really important ... but he was a very handsome little b - boy ... always very handsome ... and he was g - going to be married ! ”
200239	200248	200250	200250	Fleur	220	“ And what do you mean by zat ? ”
200255	200271	200250	200250	Fleur	220	“ What do you mean , ‘ ’ e was going to be married ? ’ ”
200284	200290	200272	200273	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Well — only that — ”
200291	200303	200305	200305	Fleur	220	“ You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me anymore ? ”
200307	200322	200305	200305	Fleur	220	“ You theenk , because of these bites , he will not love me ? ”
200323	200332	200272	200273	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ No , that ’s not what I — ”
200333	200339	200341	200341	Fleur	220	“ Because ’ e will ! ”
200360	200374	200341	200341	Fleur	220	“ It would take more zan a werewolf to stop Bill loving me ! ”
200375	200384	200386	200387	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Well , yes , I ’m sure , ”
200389	200401	200386	200387	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ but I thought perhaps — given how — how he — ”
200402	200419	200421	200421	Fleur	220	“ You thought I would not weesh to marry him ? Or per’aps , you hoped ? ”
200427	200467	200468	200468	she	220	“ What do I care how he looks ? I am good - looking enough for both of us , I theenk ! All these scars show is zat my husband is brave ! And I shall do zat ! ”
200528	200535	200537	200538	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Our Great - Auntie Muriel , ”
200544	200589	200537	200538	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ has a very beautiful tiara — goblin - made — which I am sure I could persuade her to lend you for the wedding . She is very fond of Bill , you know , and it would look lovely with your hair . ”
200590	200594	200596	200596	Fleur	220	“ Thank you , ”
200599	200608	200596	200596	Fleur	220	“ I am sure zat will be lovely . ”
200661	200665	200671	200671	Tonks	209	“ You see ! ”
200677	200697	200671	200671	Tonks	209	“ She still wants to marry him , even though he ’s been bitten ! She does n’t care ! ”
200698	200703	200705	200705	Lupin	210	“ It ’s different , ”
200716	200730	200709	200709	his	210	“ Bill will not be a full werewolf . The cases are completely — ”
200731	200744	200746	200746	Tonks	209	“ But I do n’t care either , I do n’t care ! ”
200759	200768	200746	200746	Tonks	209	“ I ’ve told you a million times ... ”
200828	200838	200840	200840	Lupin	210	“ And I ’ve told you a million times , ”
200853	200868	200840	200840	Lupin	210	“ that I am too old for you , too poor ... too dangerous ... ”
200869	200886	200888	200889	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I ’ve said all along you ’re taking a ridiculous line on this , Remus , ”
200902	200909	200911	200911	Lupin	210	“ I am not being ridiculous , ”
200914	200922	200911	200911	Lupin	210	“ Tonks deserves somebody young and whole . ”
200923	200929	200931	200932	Mr. Weasley	204	“ But she wants you , ”
200939	200956	200931	200932	Mr. Weasley	204	“ And after all , Remus , young and whole men do not necessarily remain so . ”
200968	200979	200981	200981	Lupin	210	“ This is ... not the moment to discuss it , ”
200993	200998	200988	200988	he	210	“ Dumbledore is dead ... ”
200999	201020	201022	201023	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world , ”
201071	201082	201083	201083	he	176	“ I ’ve ... I ’ve done it , Professor , ”
201086	201133	201083	201083	he	176	“ M - moved him . Professor Sprout ’s got the kids back in bed . Professor Flitwick ’s lyin ’ down , but he says he ’ll be all righ ’ in a jiffy , an ’ Professor Slughorn says the Ministry ’s bin informed . ”
201134	201140	201142	201143	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Thank you , Hagrid , ”
201161	201208	201142	201143	Professor McGonagall	232	“ I shall have to see the Ministry when they get here . Hagrid , please tell the Heads of Houses — Slughorn can represent Slytherin — that I want to see them in my office forthwith . I would like you to join us too . ”
201229	201252	201223	201223	she	232	“ Before I meet them I would like a quick word with you , Harry . If you ’ll come with me ... ”
201258	201264	201253	201253	Harry	136	“ See you in a bit ”
201550	201553	201554	201554	she	232	“ Harry , ”
201557	201578	201554	201554	she	232	“ I would like to know what you and Professor Dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school . ”
201579	201589	201591	201591	Harry	136	“ I ca n’t tell you that , Professor , ”
201636	201644	201646	201647	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Harry , it might be important , ”
201649	201653	201655	201655	Harry	136	“ It is , ”
201657	201670	201655	201655	Harry	136	“ very , but he did n’t want me to tell anyone . ”
201677	201679	201671	201672	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Potter ”
201690	201712	201671	201672	Professor McGonagall	232	“ in the light of Professor Dumbledore ’s death , I think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat — ”
201713	201720	201722	201722	Harry	136	“ I do n’t think so , ”
201726	201741	201722	201722	Harry	136	“ Professor Dumbledore never told me to stop following his orders if he died . ”
201742	201745	201671	201672	Professor McGonagall	232	“ But — ”
201746	201789	201722	201722	Harry	136	“ There ’s one thing you should know before the Ministry gets here , though . Madam Rosmerta ’s under the Imperius Curse , she was helping Malfoy and the Death Eaters , that ’s how the necklace and the poisoned mead — ”
201790	201793	201795	201796	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Rosmerta ? ”
201845	201848	201850	201850	Slughorn	199	“ Snape ! ”
201862	201875	201850	201850	Slughorn	199	“ Snape ! I taught him ! I thought I knew him ! ”
201915	201934	201896	201905	A sallow - faced wizard with a short black fringe	3350	“ Minerva , the Minister will be here within seconds , he has just Disapparated from the Ministry . ”
201935	201941	201947	201947	she	232	“ Thank you , Everard , ”
201954	201969	201970	201970	she	232	“ I want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts before he gets here , ”
201974	202015	201970	201970	she	232	“ Personally , I am not convinced that the school should reopen next year . The death of the headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon Hogwarts ’s history . It is horrible . ”
202016	202030	202032	202033	Professor Sprout	307	“ I am sure Dumbledore would have wanted the school to remain open , ”
202035	202058	202032	202033	Professor Sprout	307	“ I feel that if a single pupil wants to come , then the school ought to remain open for that pupil . ”
202059	202070	202072	202072	Slughorn	199	“ But will we have a single pupil after this ? ”
202084	202147	202072	202072	Slughorn	199	“ Parents will want to keep their children at home and I ca n’t say I blame them . Personally , I do n’t think we ’re in more danger at Hogwarts than we are anywhere else , but you ca n’t expect mothers to think like that . They ’ll want to keep their families together , it ’s only natural . ”
202148	202152	202154	202155	Professor McGonagall	232	“ I agree , ”
202157	202225	202154	202155	Professor McGonagall	232	“ And in any case , it is not true to say that Dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which Hogwarts might close . When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he considered the closure of the school — and I must say that Professor Dumbledore ’s murder is more disturbing to me than the idea of Slytherin ’s monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle ... ”
202226	202233	202238	202238	his	424	“ We must consult the governors , ”
202263	202279	202238	202238	his	424	“ We must follow the established procedures . A decision should not be made hastily . ”
202280	202289	202291	202292	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Hagrid , you have n’t said anything , ”
202294	202306	202291	202292	Professor McGonagall	232	“ What are your views , ought Hogwarts to remain open ? ”
202332	202352	202307	202307	Hagrid	176	“ I dunno , Professor ... that ’s fer the Heads of House an ’ the headmistress ter decide ... ”
202353	202361	202363	202364	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Professor Dumbledore always valued your views , ”
202367	202372	202363	202364	Professor McGonagall	232	“ and so do I. ”
202373	202381	202383	202383	Hagrid	176	“ Well , I ’m stayin ’ , ”
202404	202448	202449	202449	He	176	“ It ’s me home , it ’s bin me home since I was thirteen . An ’ if there ’s kids who wan ’ me ter teach ’em , I ’ll do it . But ... I dunno ... Hogwarts without Dumbledore ... ”
202464	202468	202470	202471	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Very well , ”
202492	202551	202470	202471	Professor McGonagall	232	“ then I must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors , who will make the final decision . Now , as to getting students home ... there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than later . We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come tomorrow if necessary — ”
202552	202559	202561	202561	Harry	136	“ What about Dumbledore ’s funeral ? ”
202567	202570	202572	202573	Professor McGonagall	232	“ Well ... ”
202586	202607	202572	202573	Professor McGonagall	232	“ I — I know that it was Dumbledore ’s wish to be laid to rest here , at Hogwarts — ”
202608	202620	202622	202622	Harry	136	“ Then that ’s what ’ll happen , is n’t it ? ”
202625	202633	202635	202636	Professor McGonagall	232	“ If the Ministry thinks it appropriate , ”
202638	202648	202635	202636	Professor McGonagall	232	“ No other headmaster or headmistress has ever been — ”
202649	202662	202664	202664	Hagrid	176	“ No other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school , ”
202666	202676	202678	202679	Professor Flitwick	424	“ Hogwarts should be Dumbledore ’s final resting place , ”
202681	202684	202686	202687	Professor Sprout	307	“ Absolutely , ”
202689	202695	202697	202697	Harry	136	“ And in that case , ”
202699	202719	202697	202697	Harry	136	“ you should n’t send the students home until the funeral ’s over . They ’ll want to say — ”
202737	202742	202729	202730	Professor Sprout	307	“ Good - bye . ”
202743	202747	202749	202750	Professor Flitwick	424	“ Well said , ”
202752	202774	202749	202750	Professor Flitwick	424	“ Well said indeed ! Our students should pay tribute , it is fitting . We can arrange transport home afterward . ”
202775	202778	202780	202781	Professor Sprout	307	“ Seconded , ”
202783	202789	202791	202791	Slughorn	199	“ I suppose ... yes ... ”
202808	202813	202815	202816	Professor McGonagall	232	“ He ’s coming , ”
202825	202842	202815	202816	Professor McGonagall	232	“ The Minister ... and by the looks of it , he ’s brought a delegation ... ”
202843	202850	202852	202852	Harry	136	“ Can I leave , Professor ? ”
202874	202878	202880	202881	Professor McGonagall	232	“ You may , ”
202883	202887	202880	202881	Professor McGonagall	232	“ And quickly . ”
202973	202978	202980	202982	the Fat Lady	1806	“ Is it true ? ”
202988	202998	202980	202982	the Fat Lady	1806	“ It is really true ? Dumbledore — dead ? ”
202999	203002	203004	203004	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
203146	203155	203157	203157	Harry	136	“ They ’re talking about closing the school , ”
203159	203165	203167	203167	Ron	201	“ Lupin said they would , ”
203174	203177	203179	203179	Ron	201	“ So ? ”
203197	203213	203188	203188	he	201	“ Did you find one ? Did you get it ? A — a Horcrux ? ”
203245	203252	203254	203254	Ron	201	“ You did n’t get it ? ”
203259	203265	203254	203254	Ron	201	“ It was n’t there ? ”
203266	203269	203271	203271	Harry	136	“ No , ”
203273	203287	203271	203271	Harry	136	“ Someone had already taken it and left a fake in its place . ”
203288	203293	203254	203254	Ron	201	“ Already taken — ? ”
203346	203349	203351	203351	Ron	201	“ R.A.B. , ”
203353	203359	203351	203351	Ron	201	“ but who was that ? ”
203360	203363	203365	203365	Harry	136	“ Dunno , ”
203924	203936	203938	203938	Fleur	220	“ ... so eet ees lucky ’ e is marrying me , ”
203947	203962	203938	203938	Fleur	220	“ because ze British overcook their meat , I ’ ave always said this . ”
203963	203983	203985	203985	Ginny	218	“ I suppose I ’m just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her , ”
204017	204024	204026	204026	Harry	136	“ She ’s not that bad , ”
204028	204033	204034	204034	he	136	“ Ugly , though , ”
204052	204066	204045	204045	she	218	“ Well , I suppose if Mum can stand it , I can . ”
204067	204074	204075	204075	Ron	201	“ Anyone else we know died ? ”
204096	204099	204100	204100	she	179	“ No , ”
204109	204120	204100	204100	she	179	“ They ’re still looking for Snape but no sign ... ”
204121	204128	204130	204130	Harry	136	“ Of course there is n’t , ”
204142	204168	204130	204130	Harry	136	“ They wo n’t find Snape till they find Voldemort , and seeing as they ’ve never managed to do that in all this time ... ”
204169	204178	204180	204180	Ginny	218	“ I ’m going to go to bed , ”
204182	204201	204180	204180	Ginny	218	“ I have n’t been sleeping that well since ... well ... I could do with some sleep . ”
204251	204265	204248	204248	her	179	“ Harry , I found something out this morning , in the library . ”
204266	204269	204271	204271	Harry	136	“ R.A.B. ? ”
204571	204574	204575	204575	she	179	“ No , ”
204579	204675	204575	204575	she	179	“ I ’ve been trying , Harry , but I have n’t found anything ... There are a couple of reasonably well - known wizards with those initials — Rosalind Antigone Bungs ... Rupert ‘ Axebanger ’ Brookstanton ... but they do n’t seem to fit at all . Judging by that note , the person who stole the Horcrux knew Voldemort , and I ca n’t find a shred of evidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything to do with him ... No , actually , it ’s about ... well , Snape . ”
204685	204690	204692	204692	Harry	136	“ What about him ? ”
204701	204721	204722	204722	she	179	“ Well , it ’s just that I was sort of right about the Half - Blood Prince business , ”
204726	204745	204722	204722	she	179	“ D’you have to rub it in , Hermione ? How d’you think I feel about that now ? ”
204746	204759	204760	204760	she	179	“ No — no — Harry , I did n’t mean that ! ”
204775	204800	204760	204760	she	179	“ It ’s just that I was right about Eileen Prince once owning the book . You see ... she was Snape ’s mother ! ”
204801	204812	204814	204814	Ron	201	“ I thought she was n’t much of a looker , ”
204820	204861	204816	204816	Hermione	179	“ I was going through the rest of the old Prophets and there was a tiny announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape , and then later an announcement saying that she ’d given birth to a — ”
204862	204866	204868	204868	Harry	136	“ — murderer , ”
204870	204875	204877	204877	Hermione	179	“ Well ... yes , ”
204879	204917	204877	204877	Hermione	179	“ So ... I was sort of right . Snape must have been proud of being ‘ half a Prince , ’ you see ? Tobias Snape was a Muggle from what it said in the Prophet . ”
204918	204924	204926	204926	Harry	136	“ Yeah , that fits , ”
204928	205004	204926	204926	Harry	136	“ He ’d play up the pure - blood side so he could get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them ... He ’s just like Voldemort . Pure - blood mother , Muggle father ... ashamed of his parentage , trying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts , gave himself an impressive new name — Lord Voldemort — the Half - Blood Prince — how could Dumbledore have missed — ? ”
205093	205111	205113	205113	Ron	201	“ I still do n’t get why he did n’t turn you in for using that book , ”
205115	205128	205113	205113	Ron	201	“ He must ’ve known where you were getting it all from . ”
205129	205133	205135	205135	Harry	136	“ He knew , ”
205138	205189	205135	205135	Harry	136	“ He knew when I used Sectumsempra . He did n’t really need Legilimency ... He might even have known before then , with Slughorn talking about how brilliant I was at Potions ... Should n’t have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard , should he ? ”
205190	205200	205113	205113	Ron	201	“ But why did n’t he turn you in ? ”
205201	205215	205217	205217	Hermione	179	“ I do n’t think he wanted to associate himself with that book , ”
205219	205282	205217	205217	Hermione	179	“ I do n’t think Dumbledore would have liked it very much if he ’d known . And even if Snape pretended it had n’t been his , Slughorn would have recognized his writing at once . Anyway , the book was left in Snape ’s old classroom , and I ’ll bet Dumbledore knew his mother was called ‘ Prince . ’ ”
205283	205293	205295	205295	Harry	136	“ I should ’ve shown the book to Dumbledore , ”
205297	205324	205295	205295	Harry	136	“ All that time he was showing me how Voldemort was evil even when he was at school , and I had proof Snape was too — ”
205325	205334	205336	205336	Hermione	179	“ ‘ Evil ’ is a strong word , ”
205339	205353	205295	205295	Harry	136	“ You were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous ! ”
205354	205398	205295	205295	Harry	136	“ I ’m trying to say , Harry , that you ’re putting too much blame on yourself . I thought the Prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humor , but I would never have guessed he was a potential killer ... ”
205399	205412	205414	205414	Ron	201	“ None of us could ’ve guessed Snape would ... you know , ”
205973	205979	205980	205980	she	232	“ It is nearly time , ”
205983	206000	205980	205980	she	232	“ Please follow your Heads of Houses out into the grounds . Gryffindors , after me . ”
206743	206747	206749	206749	Ginny	218	“ In there , ”
207225	207229	207209	207209	he	3470	“ Nobility of spirit ”
207231	207234	207209	207209	he	3470	“ intellectual contribution ”
207236	207240	207209	207209	he	3470	“ greatness of heart ”
207273	207276	207265	207265	Dumbledore	138	“ nitwit , ”
207277	207280	207265	207265	Dumbledore	138	“ oddment , ”
207281	207284	207265	207265	Dumbledore	138	“ blubber , ”
207286	207289	207265	207265	Dumbledore	138	“ tweak , ”
208046	208050	208041	208041	she	218	“ Be careful , ”
208052	208058	208041	208041	she	218	“ Do n’t do it , ”
208095	208100	208101	208101	he	136	“ Ginny , listen ... ”
208124	208149	208101	208101	he	136	“ I ca n’t be involved with you anymore . We ’ve got to stop seeing each other . We ca n’t be together . ”
208159	208173	208150	208150	She	218	“ It ’s for some stupid , noble reason , is n’t it ? ”
208174	208196	208198	208198	Harry	136	“ It ’s been like ... like something out of someone else ’s life , these last few weeks with you , ”
208200	208219	208150	208150	She	218	“ But I ca n’t ... we ca n’t ... I ’ve got things to do alone now . ”
208231	208296	208339	208339	She	218	“ Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to . He ’s already used you as bait once , and that was just because you ’re my best friend ’s sister . Think how much danger you ’ll be in if we keep this up . He ’ll know , he ’ll find out . He ’ll try and get to me through you . ”
208297	208305	208307	208307	Ginny	218	“ What if I do n’t care ? ”
208310	208314	208316	208316	Harry	136	“ I care , ”
208318	208338	208316	208316	Harry	136	“ How do you think I ’d feel if this was your funeral ... and it was my fault ... ”
208349	208358	208359	208359	she	218	“ I never really gave up on you , ”
208362	208430	208359	208359	she	218	“ Not really . I always hoped ... Hermione told me to get on with life , maybe go out with some other people , relax a bit around you , because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room , remember ? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more — myself . ”
208431	208438	208440	208440	Harry	136	“ Smart girl , that Hermione , ”
208446	208467	208440	208440	Harry	136	“ I just wish I ’d asked you sooner . We could ’ve had ages ... months ... years maybe ... ”
208468	208480	208482	208482	Ginny	218	“ But you ’ve been too busy saving the Wizarding world , ”
208487	208530	208482	208482	Ginny	218	“ Well ... I ca n’t say I ’m surprised . I knew this would happen in the end . I knew you would n’t be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort . Maybe that ’s why I like you so much . ”
208647	208650	208651	208651	He	136	“ Harry ! ”
208671	208693	208667	208667	his	140	“ I ’ve been hoping to have a word ... do you mind if I walk a little way with you ? ”
208694	208697	208699	208699	Harry	136	“ No , ”
208707	208716	208718	208718	Scrimgeour	140	“ Harry , this was a dreadful tragedy , ”
208721	208760	208718	208718	Scrimgeour	140	“ I can not tell you how appalled I was to hear of it . Dumbledore was a very great wizard . We had our disagreements , as you know , but no one knows better than I — ”
208761	208767	208769	208769	Harry	136	“ What do you want ? ”
208790	208799	208800	208800	he	140	“ You are , of course , devastated , ”
208803	208833	208800	208800	he	140	“ I know that you were very close to Dumbledore . I think you may have been his favorite pupil ever . The bond between the two of you — ”
208834	208840	208841	208841	Harry	136	“ What do you want ? ”
208868	208888	208855	208855	his	140	“ The word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died . ”
208889	208893	208895	208895	Harry	136	“ Whose word ? ”
208897	208930	208855	208855	his	140	“ Somebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the tower after Dumbledore died . There were also two broomsticks up there . The Ministry can add two and two , Harry . ”
208931	208937	208939	208939	Harry	136	“ Glad to hear it , ”
208941	208965	208939	208939	Harry	136	“ Well , where I went with Dumbledore and what we did is my business . He did n’t want people to know . ”
208966	208975	208977	208977	Scrimgeour	140	“ Such loyalty is admirable , of course , ”
208989	209001	208977	208977	Scrimgeour	140	“ but Dumbledore is gone , Harry . He ’s gone . ”
209002	209019	209021	209021	Harry	136	“ He will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him , ”
209029	209042	208977	208977	Scrimgeour	140	“ My dear boy ... even Dumbledore can not return from the — ”
209043	209065	208977	208977	Scrimgeour	140	“ I am not saying he can . You would n’t understand . But I ’ve got nothing to tell you . ”
209084	209115	209066	209066	Scrimgeour	140	“ The Ministry can offer you all sorts of protection , you know , Harry . I would be delighted to place a couple of my Aurors at your service — ”
209119	209144	209116	209116	Harry	136	“ Voldemort wants to kill me himself , and Aurors wo n’t stop him . So thanks for the offer , but no thanks . ”
209145	209148	209150	209150	Scrimgeour	140	“ So , ”
209157	209167	209152	209152	his	140	“ the request I made of you at Christmas — ”
209168	209193	209152	209152	his	140	“ What request ? Oh yeah ... the one where I tell the world what a great job you ’re doing in exchange for — ”
209194	209202	209204	209204	Scrimgeour	140	“ — for raising everyone ’s morale ! ”
209213	209219	209206	209206	Harry	136	“ Released Stan Shunpike yet ? ”
209232	209238	209220	209220	Scrimgeour	140	“ I see you are — ”
209239	209247	209249	209249	Harry	136	“ Dumbledore ’s man through and through , ”
209251	209256	209249	209249	Harry	136	“ That ’s right . ”
209356	209362	209363	209363	Hermione	179	“ What did Scrimgeour want ? ”
209366	209374	209376	209376	Harry	136	“ Same as he wanted at Christmas , ”
209378	209397	209376	209376	Harry	136	“ Wanted me to give him inside information on Dumbledore and be the Ministry ’s new poster boy . ”
209415	209426	209409	209409	he	201	“ Look , let me go back and hit Percy ! ”
209427	209430	209431	209431	she	179	“ No , ”
209439	209447	209409	209409	he	201	“ It ’ll make me feel better ! ”
209469	209483	209484	209484	she	179	“ I ca n’t bear the idea that we might never come back , ”
209488	209494	209484	209484	she	179	“ How can Hogwarts close ? ”
209495	209501	209503	209503	Ron	201	“ Maybe it wo n’t , ”
209505	209553	209503	209503	Ron	201	“ We ’re not in any more danger here than we are at home , are we ? Everywhere ’s the same now . I ’d even say Hogwarts is safer , there are more wizards inside to defend the place . What d’you reckon , Harry ? ”
209554	209566	209568	209568	Harry	136	“ I ’m not coming back even if it does reopen , ”
209580	209597	209576	209576	Hermione	179	“ I knew you were going to say that . But then what will you do ? ”
209598	209616	209618	209618	Harry	136	“ I ’m going back to the Dursleys ’ once more , because Dumbledore wanted me to , ”
209620	209638	209618	209618	Harry	136	“ But it ’ll be a short visit , and then I ’ll be gone for good . ”
209639	209654	209576	209576	Hermione	179	“ But where will you go if you do n’t come back to school ? ”
209655	209667	209668	209668	Harry	136	“ I thought I might go back to Godric ’s Hollow , ”
209688	209726	209576	209576	Hermione	179	“ For me , it started there , all of it . I ’ve just got a feeling I need to go there . And I can visit my parents ’ graves , I ’d like that . ”
209727	209732	209734	209734	Ron	201	“ And then what ? ”
209736	209754	209756	209756	Harry	136	“ Then I ’ve got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes , have n’t I ? ”
209778	209876	209877	209877	he	3511	“ That ’s what he wanted me to do , that ’s why he told me all about them . If Dumbledore was right — and I ’m sure he was — there are still four of them out there . I ’ve got to find them and destroy them , and then I ’ve got to go after the seventh bit of Voldemort ’s soul , the bit that ’s still in his body , and I ’m the one who ’s going to kill him . And if I meet Severus Snape along the way , ”
209880	209895	209877	209877	he	3511	“ so much the better for me , so much the worse for him . ”
209936	209944	209946	209946	Ron	201	“ We ’ll be there , Harry , ”
209948	209951	209916	209916	Grawp	302	“ What ? ”
209952	209961	209963	209963	Ron	201	“ At your aunt and uncle ’s house , ”
209965	209978	209963	209963	Ron	201	“ And then we ’ll go with you wherever you ’re going . ”
209979	209982	209984	209984	Harry	136	“ No — ”
210010	210018	210020	210020	Hermione	179	“ You said to us once before , ”
210023	210045	210020	210020	Hermione	179	“ that there was time to turn back if we wanted to . We ’ve had time , have n’t we ? ”
210046	210054	210056	210056	Ron	201	“ We ’re with you whatever happens , ”
210058	210087	210056	210056	Ron	201	“ But mate , you ’re going to have to come round my mum and dad ’s house before we do anything else , even Godric ’s Hollow . ”
210088	210091	210020	210020	Hermione	179	“ Why ? ”
210092	210101	210056	210056	Ron	201	“ Bill and Fleur ’s wedding , remember ? ”
210127	210136	210137	210137	he	136	“ Yeah , we should n’t miss that , ”
