718	721	723	725	the Prime Minister	559	“ Er , ”
727	756	723	725	the Prime Minister	559	“ listen ... It ’s not a very good time for me ... I ’m waiting for a telephone call , you see ... from the President of — ”
757	763	770	772	The Prime Minister	559	“ That can be rearranged , ”
784	794	777	777	He	559	“ But I really was rather hoping to speak — ”

820	828	816	818	the little man	604	“ Kindly respond immediately to Mr. Fudge . ”
829	837	839	841	the Prime Minister	559	“ I ... oh ... very well , ”

1092	1099	1100	1100	he	559	“ How can I help you ? ”
1123	1131	1133	1133	Fudge	129	“ Difficult to know where to begin , ”
1152	1161	1133	1133	Fudge	129	“ What a week , what a week ... ”
1162	1172	1174	1176	the Prime Minister	559	“ Had a bad one too , have you ? ”
1200	1206	1208	1208	Fudge	129	“ Yes , of course , ”
1222	1256	1208	1208	Fudge	129	“ I ’ve been having the same week you have , Prime Minister . The Brockdale Bridge ... the Bones and Vance murders ... not to mention the ruckus in the West Country ... ”
1257	1286	1287	1287	Fudge	129	“ You — er — your — I mean to say , some of your people were — were involved in those — those things , were they ? ”
1298	1304	1305	1305	he	129	“ Of course they were , ”
1308	1318	1305	1305	he	129	“ Surely you ’ve realized what ’s going on ? ”
1319	1322	1324	1326	the Prime Minister	559	“ I ... ”
1658	1663	1664	1664	he	129	“ Not to worry , ”
1668	1760	1664	1664	he	129	“ it ’s odds - on you ’ll never see me again . I ’ll only bother you if there ’s something really serious going on our end , something that ’s likely to affect the Muggles — the non - magical population , I should say . Otherwise , it ’s live and let live . And I must say , you ’re taking it a lot better than your predecessor . He tried to throw me out the window , thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition . ”
1774	1786	1769	1769	his	559	“ You ’re — you ’re not a hoax , then ? ”
1796	1799	1801	1801	Fudge	129	“ No , ”
1804	1816	1818	1818	he	129	“ No , I ’m afraid I ’m not . Look . ”
1830	1833	1835	1837	the Prime Minister	559	“ But , ”
1852	1863	1835	1837	the Prime Minister	559	“ but why — why has nobody told me — ? ”
1864	1883	1885	1885	Fudge	129	“ The Minister of Magic only reveals him- or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day , ”
1895	1906	1888	1888	his	129	“ We find it the best way to maintain secrecy . ”
1907	1911	1913	1915	the Prime Minister	559	“ But then , ”
1917	1929	1913	1915	the Prime Minister	559	“ why has n’t a former Prime Minister warned me — ? ”
1938	1952	1933	1933	Fudge	129	“ My dear Prime Minister , are you ever going to tell anybody ? ”
2354	2356	2351	2357	a man named “ Serious ” Black	651	“ Serious ”
2363	2366	2351	2357	a man named “ Serious ” Black	651	“ Hogwarts , ”
2386	2397	2398	2398	Fudge	129	“ . . . I ’ve just come from Azkaban , ”
2420	2438	2440	2440	he	129	“ Middle of the North Sea , you know , nasty flight ... the dementors are in uproar ”
2443	2499	2440	2440	he	129	“ they ’ve never had a breakout before . Anyway , I had to come to you , Prime Minister . Black ’s a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin You - Know - Who ... But of course , you do n’t even know who You - Know - Who is ! ”
2515	2535	2500	2500	He	129	“ Well , sit down , sit down , I ’d better fill you in ... Have a whiskey ... ”
2663	2669	2670	2670	He	129	“ So you think that ... ”
2682	2686	2670	2670	He	129	“ Lord Vol — ”
2687	2700	2702	2702	Fudge	129	“ He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named ! ”
2704	2729	2702	2702	Fudge	129	“ I ’m sorry ... You think that He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named is still alive , then ? ”
2730	2738	2740	2740	Fudge	129	“ Well , Dumbledore says he is , ”
2755	2818	2743	2743	he	129	“ but we ’ve never found him . If you ask me , he ’s not dangerous unless he ’s got support , so it ’s Black we ought to be worrying about . You ’ll put out that warning , then ? Excellent . Well , I hope we do n’t see each other again , Prime Minister ! Good night . ”
2881	2884	2832	2836	a harassed - looking Fudge	662	“ involved , ”
2936	2944	2945	2945	Fudge	129	“ Oh , and I almost forgot , ”
2949	3005	2945	2945	Fudge	129	“ We ’re importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament , quite routine , but the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures tells me that it ’s down in the rule book that we have to notify you if we ’re bringing highly dangerous creatures into the country . ”
3006	3013	3015	3017	the Prime Minister	559	“ I — what — dragons ? ”
3019	3024	3026	3026	Fudge	129	“ Yes , three , ”
3028	3040	3026	3026	Fudge	129	“ And a sphinx . Well , good day to you . ”
3093	3098	3100	3102	the Prime Minister	559	“ A mass breakout ? ”
3105	3116	3118	3118	Fudge	129	“ No need to worry , no need to worry ! ”
3128	3146	3118	3118	Fudge	129	“ We ’ll have them rounded up in no time — just thought you ought to know ! ”
3155	3163	3164	3164	Fudge	129	“ Now , wait just one moment ! ”
3333	3350	3352	3354	the Prime Minister	559	“ How should I know what ’s going on in the — er — Wizarding community ? ”
3357	3373	3352	3354	the Prime Minister	559	“ I have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without — ”
3374	3381	3382	3382	Fudge	129	“ We have the same concerns , ”
3385	3448	3382	3382	Fudge	129	“ The Brockdale Bridge did n’t wear out . That was n’t really a hurricane . Those murders were not the work of Muggles . And Herbert Chorley ’s family would be safer without him . We are currently making arrangements to have him transferred to St. Mungo ’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries . The move should be effected tonight . ”
3449	3461	3463	3465	the Prime Minister	559	“ What do you ... I ’m afraid I ... What ? ”
3477	3509	3467	3467	Fudge	129	“ Prime Minister , I am very sorry to have to tell you that he ’s back . He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named is back . ”
3510	3527	3467	3467	Fudge	129	“ Back ? When you say ‘ back ’ ... he ’s alive ? I mean — ”
3579	3584	3586	3586	Fudge	129	“ Yes , alive , ”
3588	3656	3586	3586	Fudge	129	“ That is — I do n’t know — is a man alive if he ca n’t be killed ? I do n’t really understand it , and Dumbledore wo n’t explain properly — but anyway , he ’s certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing , so I suppose , for the purposes of our discussion , yes , he ’s alive . ”
3701	3721	3729	3729	Fudge	129	“ Is Serious Black with — er — He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named ? ”
3722	3727	3729	3729	Fudge	129	“ Black ? Black ? ”
3740	3797	3798	3798	he	129	“ Sirius Black , you mean ? Merlin ’s beard , no . Black ’s dead . Turns out we were — er — mistaken about Black . He was innocent after all . And he was n’t in league with He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named either . I mean , ”
3809	3857	3798	3798	he	129	“ all the evidence pointed — we had more than fifty eyewitnesses — but anyway , as I say , he ’s dead . Murdered , as a matter of fact . On Ministry of Magic premises . There ’s going to be an inquiry , actually ... ”
3947	3976	3944	3944	Fudge	129	“ But Black ’s by - the - by now . The point is , we ’re at war , Prime Minister , and steps must be taken . ”
3977	3981	3983	3985	the Prime Minister	559	“ At war ? ”
3988	3999	3983	3985	the Prime Minister	559	“ Surely that ’s a little bit of an overstatement ? ”
4000	4029	4031	4031	Fudge	129	“ He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in January , ”
4053	4093	4031	4031	Fudge	129	“ Since they have moved into the open , they have been wreaking havoc . The Brockdale Bridge — he did it , Prime Minister , he threatened a mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him and — ”
4094	4129	4131	4133	the Prime Minister	559	“ Good grief , so it ’s your fault those people were killed and I ’m having to answer questions about rusted rigging and corroded expansion joints and I do n’t know what else ! ”
4136	4140	4142	4142	Fudge	129	“ My fault ! ”
4147	4161	4142	4142	Fudge	129	“ Are you saying you would have caved in to blackmail like that ? ”
4162	4166	4168	4170	the Prime Minister	559	“ Maybe not , ”
4180	4200	4168	4170	the Prime Minister	559	“ but I would have put all my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity ! ”
4201	4214	4216	4216	Fudge	129	“ Do you really think I was n’t already making every effort ? ”
4219	4268	4216	4216	Fudge	129	“ Every Auror in the Ministry was — and is — trying to find him and round up his followers , but we happen to be talking about one of the most powerful wizards of all time , a wizard who has eluded capture for almost three decades ! ”
4269	4289	4291	4293	the Prime Minister	559	“ So I suppose you ’re going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the West Country too ? ”
4338	4344	4346	4346	Fudge	129	“ That was no hurricane , ”
4349	4353	4346	4346	Fudge	129	“ Excuse me ! ”
4366	4380	4346	4346	Fudge	129	“ Trees uprooted , roofs ripped off , lampposts bent , horrible injuries — ”
4381	4388	4390	4390	Fudge	129	“ It was the Death Eaters , ”
4392	4415	4390	4390	Fudge	129	“ He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named ’s followers . And ... and we suspect giant involvement . ”
4432	4436	4437	4437	Fudge	129	“ What involvement ? ”
4440	4457	4458	4458	he	129	“ He used giants last time , when he wanted to go for the grand effect , ”
4461	4528	4458	4458	he	129	“ The Office of Misinformation has been working around the clock , we ’ve had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened , we ’ve got most of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around Somerset , but we ca n’t find the giant — it ’s been a disaster . ”
4529	4535	4537	4539	the Prime Minister	559	“ You do n’t say ! ”
4542	4556	4558	4558	Fudge	129	“ I wo n’t deny that morale is pretty low at the Ministry , ”
4560	4572	4558	4558	Fudge	129	“ What with all that , and then losing Amelia Bones . ”
4573	4577	4458	4458	he	129	“ Losing who ? ”
4578	4633	4634	4634	Fudge	129	“ Amelia Bones . Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement . We think He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named may have murdered her in person , because she was a very gifted witch and — and all the evidence was that she put up a real fight . ”
4653	4662	4664	4666	the Prime Minister	559	“ But that murder was in the newspapers , ”
4674	4724	4725	4725	Fudge	129	“ Our newspapers . Amelia Bones ... it just said she was a middle - aged woman who lived alone . It was a — a nasty killing , was n’t it ? It ’s had rather a lot of publicity . The police are baffled , you see . ”
4728	4736	4737	4737	he	129	“ Well , of course they are , ”
4740	4796	4737	4737	he	129	“ Killed in a room that was locked from the inside , was n’t she ? We , on the other hand , know exactly who did it , not that that gets us any further toward catching him . And then there was Emmeline Vance , maybe you did n’t hear about that one — ”
4797	4803	4805	4807	the Prime Minister	559	“ Oh yes I did ! ”
4809	4848	4805	4807	the Prime Minister	559	“ It happened just around the corner from here , as a matter of fact . The papers had a field day with it , ‘ breakdown of law and order in the Prime Minister ’s backyard — ’ ”
4849	4859	4861	4861	Fudge	129	“ And as if all that was n’t enough , ”
4870	4890	4861	4861	Fudge	129	“ we ’ve got dementors swarming all over the place , attacking people left , right , and center ... ”
4913	4923	4924	4924	he	129	“ I thought dementors guard the prisoners in Azkaban , ”
4928	4932	4934	4934	Fudge	129	“ They did , ”
4937	4971	4934	4934	Fudge	129	“ But not anymore . They ’ve deserted the prison and joined He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named . I wo n’t pretend that was n’t a blow . ”
4972	4975	4977	4979	the Prime Minister	559	“ But , ”
4988	5007	4977	4979	the Prime Minister	559	“ did n’t you tell me they ’re the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people ? ”
5008	5027	5028	5030	The Prime Minister	559	“ That ’s right . And they ’re breeding . That ’s what ’s causing all this mist . ”
5068	5091	4977	4979	the Prime Minister	559	“ Now see here , Fudge — you ’ve got to do something ! It ’s your responsibility as Minister of Magic ! ”
5092	5148	5150	5150	Fudge	129	“ My dear Prime Minister , you ca n’t honestly think I ’m still Minister of Magic after all this ? I was sacked three days ago ! The whole Wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight . I ’ve never known them so united in my whole term of office ! ”
5196	5202	5203	5203	he	559	“ I ’m very sorry , ”
5207	5216	5203	5203	he	559	“ If there ’s anything I can do ? ”
5217	5283	5284	5284	Fudge	129	“ It ’s very kind of you , Prime Minister , but there is nothing . I was sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to introduce you to my successor . I rather thought he ’d be here by now , but of course , he ’s very busy at the moment , with so much going on . ”
5324	5342	5203	5203	he	559	“ He ’ll be here in a moment , he ’s just finishing a letter to Dumbledore . ”
5343	5349	5351	5351	Fudge	129	“ I wish him luck , ”
5360	5406	5351	5351	Fudge	129	“ I ’ve been writing to Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight , but he wo n’t budge . If he ’d just been prepared to persuade the boy , I might still be ... Well , maybe Scrimgeour will have more success . ”
5437	5462	5472	5474	the Prime Minister	559	“ To the Prime Minister of Muggles . Requesting a meeting . Urgent . Kindly respond immediately . Rufus Scrimgeour , Minister of Magic . ”
5463	5470	5472	5474	the Prime Minister	559	“ Yes , yes , fine , ”
5648	5654	5656	5658	the Prime Minister	559	“ How do you do ? ”
5687	5693	5694	5694	he	140	“ Fudge told you everything ? ”
5718	5723	5725	5727	the Prime Minister	559	“ Er — yes , ”
5729	5745	5725	5727	the Prime Minister	559	“ And if you do n’t mind , I ’d rather that door remained unlocked . ”
5746	5754	5756	5756	Scrimgeour	140	“ I ’d rather not be interrupted , ”
5759	5763	5764	5764	he	140	“ or watched , ”
5782	5812	5764	5764	he	140	“ Right , well , I ’m a busy man , so let ’s get down to business . First of all , we need to discuss your security . ”
5826	5843	5817	5817	himself	559	“ I am perfectly happy with the security I ’ve already got , thank you very — ”
5844	5851	5852	5852	Scrimgeour	140	“ Well , we ’re not , ”
5856	5885	5852	5852	Scrimgeour	140	“ It ’ll be a poor lookout for the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse . The new secretary in your outer office — ”
5886	5904	5906	5908	the Prime Minister	559	“ I ’m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt , if that ’s what you ’re suggesting ! ”
5911	5927	5906	5908	the Prime Minister	559	“ He ’s highly efficient , gets through twice the work the rest of them — ”
5928	5937	5939	5939	Scrimgeour	140	“ That ’s because he ’s a wizard , ”
5948	5964	5939	5939	Scrimgeour	140	“ A highly trained Auror , who has been assigned to you for your protection . ”
5965	5972	5974	5976	the Prime Minister	559	“ Now , wait a moment ! ”
5978	5997	5974	5976	the Prime Minister	559	“ You ca n’t just put your people into my office , I decide who works for me — ”
5998	6007	6009	6009	Scrimgeour	140	“ I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt ? ”
6012	6024	6009	6009	Scrimgeour	140	“ I am — that ’s to say , I was — ”
6025	6035	6037	6037	Scrimgeour	140	“ Then there ’s no problem , is there ? ”
6039	6058	6060	6062	the Prime Minister	559	“ I ... well , as long as Shacklebolt ’s work continues to be ... er ... excellent , ”
6073	6084	6085	6085	he	559	“ Now , about Herbert Chorley , your Junior Minister , ”
6088	6102	6085	6085	he	559	“ The one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck . ”
6103	6108	6110	6112	the Prime Minister	559	“ What about him ? ”
6114	6126	6128	6128	Scrimgeour	140	“ He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperius Curse , ”
6130	6144	6128	6128	Scrimgeour	140	“ It ’s addled his brains , but he could still be dangerous . ”
6145	6151	6153	6155	the Prime Minister	559	“ He ’s only quacking ! ”
6158	6173	6153	6155	the Prime Minister	559	“ Surely a bit of a rest ... Maybe go easy on the drink ... ”
6174	6207	6209	6209	Scrimgeour	140	“ A team of Healers from St. Mungo ’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as we speak . So far he has attempted to strangle three of them , ”
6211	6227	6209	6209	Scrimgeour	140	“ I think it best that we remove him from Muggle society for a while . ”
6228	6243	6245	6247	the Prime Minister	559	“ I ... well ... He ’ll be all right , wo n’t he ? ”
6261	6319	6250	6250	Scrimgeour	140	“ Well , that ’s really all I had to say . I will keep you posted of developments , Prime Minister — or , at least , I shall probably be too busy to come personally , in which case I shall send Fudge here . He has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity . ”
6386	6412	6382	6382	him	559	“ But for heaven ’s sake — you ’re wizards ! You can do magic ! Surely you can sort out — well — anything ! ”
6440	6456	6436	6436	he	129	“ The trouble is , the other side can do magic too , Prime Minister . ”
6650	6653	6645	6647	another hooded figure	743	“ Wait ! ”
6713	6718	6720	6721	a woman	746	“ Just a fox , ”
6730	6741	6720	6721	a woman	746	“ I thought perhaps an Auror — Cissy , wait ! ”
6771	6780	6781	6783	The second woman	748	“ Cissy — Narcissa — listen to me — ”
6799	6805	6793	6794	the other	750	“ Go back , Bellatrix ! ”
6806	6813	6793	6794	the other	750	“ You must listen to me ! ”
6814	6830	6831	6834	The woman named Narcissa	751	“ I ’ve listened already . I ’ve made my decision . Leave me alone ! ”
6896	6901	6903	6903	Bellatrix	145	“ He lives here ? ”
6910	6931	6903	6903	Bellatrix	145	“ Here ? In this Muggle dunghill ? We must be the first of our kind ever to set foot — ”
6956	6961	6938	6938	she	144	“ Cissy , wait ! ”
7042	7057	7017	7017	she	766	“ Cissy , you must not do this , you ca n’t trust him — ”
7058	7069	7094	7094	she	145	“ The Dark Lord trusts him , does n’t he ? ”
7070	7081	7082	7082	Bellatrix	145	“ The Dark Lord is ... I believe ... mistaken , ”
7105	7132	7094	7094	she	145	“ In any case , we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone . This is a betrayal of the Dark Lord ’s — ”
7133	7139	7141	7141	Narcissa	144	“ Let go , Bellatrix ! ”
7166	7177	7162	7162	Bellatrix	145	“ Cissy , your own sister ? You would n’t — ”
7178	7188	7197	7197	her	144	“ There is nothing I would n’t do anymore ! ”
7230	7233	7218	7218	Bellatrix	145	“ Narcissa ! ”
7456	7459	7461	7462	the man	781	“ Narcissa ! ”
7483	7489	7461	7462	the man	781	“ What a pleasant surprise ! ”
7490	7493	7494	7494	she	144	“ Severus , ”
7501	7512	7494	7494	she	144	“ May I speak to you ? It ’s urgent . ”
7513	7518	7519	7519	He	781	“ But of course . ”
7541	7544	7545	7545	she	144	“ Snape , ”
7553	7556	7557	7557	he	781	“ Bellatrix , ”
7741	7751	7752	7752	Snape	147	“ So , what can I do for you ? ”
7765	7776	7777	7777	Narcissa	144	“ We ... we are alone , are n’t we ? ”
7781	7803	7804	7804	He	147	“ Yes , of course . Well , Wormtail ’s here , but we ’re not counting vermin , are we ? ”
7838	7851	7853	7853	Snape	147	“ As you have clearly realized , Wormtail , we have guests , ”
7911	7914	7915	7915	he	781	“ Narcissa ! ”
7923	7930	7915	7915	he	781	“ And Bellatrix ! How charming — ”
7931	7944	7946	7946	Snape	147	“ Wormtail will get us drinks , if you ’d like them , ”
7948	7958	7946	7946	Snape	147	“ And then he will return to his bedroom . ”
7970	7977	7978	7978	he	148	“ I am not your servant ! ”
7986	8005	7978	7978	he	148	“ Really ? I was under the impression that the Dark Lord placed you here to assist me . ”
8006	8025	7959	7959	Wormtail	148	“ To assist , yes — but not to make you drinks and — and clean your house ! ”
8026	8042	8044	8044	Snape	147	“ I had no idea , Wormtail , that you were craving more dangerous assignments , ”
8047	8062	8044	8044	Snape	147	“ This can be easily arranged : I shall speak to the Dark Lord — ”
8063	8075	7959	7959	Wormtail	148	“ I can speak to him myself if I want to ! ”
8076	8082	8084	8084	Snape	147	“ Of course you can , ”
8088	8108	8084	8084	Snape	147	“ But in the meantime , bring us drinks . Some of the elf - made wine will do . ”
8234	8239	8240	8240	he	148	“ The Dark Lord , ”
8272	8303	8266	8266	she	144	“ Severus , I ’m sorry to come here like this , but I had to see you . I think you are the only one who can help me — ”
8345	8349	8351	8351	Snape	147	“ My apologies , ”
8353	8379	8351	8351	Snape	147	“ He has lately taken to listening at doors , I do n’t know what he means by it ... You were saying , Narcissa ? ”
8391	8415	8380	8380	She	144	“ Severus , I know I ought not to be here , I have been told to say nothing to anyone , but — ”
8416	8425	8427	8427	Bellatrix	145	“ Then you ought to hold your tongue ! ”
8429	8435	8427	8427	Bellatrix	145	“ Particularly in present company ! ”
8436	8442	8444	8444	Snape	147	“ ‘ Present company ’ ? ”
8447	8459	8444	8444	Snape	147	“ And what am I to understand by that , Bellatrix ? ”
8460	8476	8477	8477	Narcissa	144	“ That I do n’t trust you , Snape , as you very well know ! ”
8526	8554	8556	8556	Snape	147	“ Narcissa , I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is bursting to say ; it will save tedious interruptions . Well , continue , Bellatrix , ”
8558	8569	8556	8556	Snape	147	“ Why is it that you do not trust me ? ”
8570	8575	8576	8576	she	145	“ A hundred reasons ! ”
8594	8708	8709	8709	She	799	“ Where to start ! Where were you when the Dark Lord fell ? Why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished ? What have you been doing all these years that you ’ve lived in Dumbledore ’s pocket ? Why did you stop the Dark Lord procuring the Sorcerer ’s Stone ? Why did you not return at once when the Dark Lord was reborn ? Where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the Dark Lord ? And why , Snape , is Harry Potter still alive , when you have had him at your mercy for five years ? ”
8744	8850	8741	8741	Snape	147	“ Before I answer you — oh yes , Bellatrix , I am going to answer ! You can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back , and carry false tales of my treachery to the Dark Lord ! Before I answer you , I say , let me ask a question in turn . Do you really think that the Dark Lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions ? And do you really think that , had I not been able to give satisfactory answers , I would be sitting here talking to you ? ”
8854	8863	8741	8741	Snape	147	“ I know he believes you , but ... ”
8864	8898	8899	8899	Bellatrix	145	“ You think he is mistaken ? Or that I have somehow hoodwinked him ? Fooled the Dark Lord , the greatest wizard , the most accomplished Legilimens the world has ever seen ? ”
8935	8997	8922	8922	He	147	“ You ask where I was when the Dark Lord fell . I was where he had ordered me to be , at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , because he wished me to spy upon Albus Dumbledore . You know , I presume , that it was on the Dark Lord ’s orders that I took up the post ? ”
9013	9043	9045	9045	he	147	“ You ask why I did not attempt to find him when he vanished . For the same reason that Avery , Yaxley , the Carrows , Greyback , Lucius ”
9053	9106	9045	9045	he	147	“ and many others did not attempt to find him . I believed him finished . I am not proud of it , I was wrong , but there it is ... If he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time , he would have very few followers left . ”
9107	9113	9115	9115	Bellatrix	145	“ He ’d have me ! ”
9118	9130	9115	9115	Bellatrix	145	“ I , who spent many years in Azkaban for him ! ”
9131	9139	9141	9141	Snape	147	“ Yes , indeed , most admirable , ”
9147	9170	9141	9141	Snape	147	“ Of course , you were n’t a lot of use to him in prison , but the gesture was undoubtedly fine — ”
9171	9174	9175	9175	she	145	“ Gesture ! ”
9186	9204	9179	9179	her	145	“ While I endured the dementors , you remained at Hogwarts , comfortably playing Dumbledore ’s pet ! ”
9205	9209	9211	9211	Snape	147	“ Not quite , ”
9214	9251	9211	9211	Snape	147	“ He would n’t give me the Defense Against the Dark Arts job , you know . Seemed to think it might , ah , bring about a relapse ... tempt me into my old ways . ”
9252	9269	9270	9270	she	145	“ This was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord , not to teach your favorite subject ? ”
9273	9296	9270	9270	she	145	“ Why did you stay there all that time , Snape ? Still spying on Dumbledore for a master you believed dead ? ”
9297	9300	9302	9302	Snape	147	“ Hardly , ”
9304	9350	9302	9302	Snape	147	“ although the Dark Lord is pleased that I never deserted my post : I had sixteen years of information on Dumbledore to give him when he returned , a rather more useful welcome - back present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant Azkaban is ... ”
9351	9356	9367	9367	Snape	147	“ But you stayed — ”
9357	9365	9367	9367	Snape	147	“ Yes , Bellatrix , I stayed , ”
9379	9445	9367	9367	Snape	147	“ I had a comfortable job that I preferred to a stint in Azkaban . They were rounding up the Death Eaters , you know . Dumbledore ’s protection kept me out of jail ; it was most convenient and I used it . I repeat : The Dark Lord does not complain that I stayed , so I do not see why you do . “
9454	9472	9448	9448	you	801	” he pressed on , a little more loudly , for Bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting , “
9611	9627	9602	9602	I	0	” Bellatrix ’s mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine . “
9655	9656	9638	9638	you	0	” “
9672	9673	9665	9665	I	0	” “
9679	9688	9675	9675	Dumbledore	138	” she began , in tones of outrage . “
9691	9698	9675	9675	Dumbledore	138	” said Snape , impatient again . “
9820	9871	9882	9882	Bellatrix	145	“ The Dark Lord ’s initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely , I assure you , when I explained that I remained faithful , although Dumbledore thought I was his man . Yes , the Dark Lord thought that I had left him forever , but he was wrong . ”
9872	9880	9882	9882	Bellatrix	145	“ But what use have you been ? ”
9884	9894	9882	9882	Bellatrix	145	“ What useful information have we had from you ? ”
9895	9907	9909	9909	Snape	147	“ My information has been conveyed directly to the Dark Lord , ”
9911	9922	9909	9909	Snape	147	“ If he chooses not to share it with you — ”
9923	9930	9932	9932	Bellatrix	145	“ He shares everything with me ! ”
9939	9951	9932	9932	Bellatrix	145	“ He calls me his most loyal , his most faithful — ”
9952	9956	9958	9958	Snape	147	“ Does he ? ”
9969	9981	9960	9960	his	147	“ Does he still , after the fiasco at the Ministry ? ”
9982	9989	9991	9991	Bellatrix	145	“ That was not my fault ! ”
9995	10017	9991	9991	Bellatrix	145	“ The Dark Lord has , in the past , entrusted me with his most precious — if Lucius had n’t — ”
10018	10032	10034	10034	Narcissa	144	“ Do n’t you dare — do n’t you dare blame my husband ! ”
10049	10057	10059	10059	Snape	147	“ There is no point apportioning blame , ”
10062	10070	10059	10059	Snape	147	“ What is done , is done . ”
10071	10077	10079	10079	Bellatrix	145	“ But not by you ! ”
10082	10104	10079	10079	Bellatrix	145	“ No , you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers , were you not , Snape ? ”
10105	10113	10115	10115	Snape	147	“ My orders were to remain behind , ”
10117	10172	10115	10115	Snape	147	“ Perhaps you disagree with the Dark Lord , perhaps you think that Dumbledore would not have noticed if I had joined forces with the Death Eaters to fight the Order of the Phoenix ? And — forgive me — you speak of dangers ... you were facing six teenagers , were you not ? ”
10173	10192	10194	10194	Bellatrix	145	“ They were joined , as you very well know , by half of the Order before long ! ”
10196	10226	10194	10194	Bellatrix	145	“ And , while we are on the subject of the Order , you still claim you can not reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters , do n’t you ? ”
10227	10311	10312	10312	He	813	“ I am not the Secret - Keeper ; I can not speak the name of the place . You understand how the enchantment works , I think ? The Dark Lord is satisfied with the information I have passed him on the Order . It led , as perhaps you have guessed , to the recent capture and murder of Emmeline Vance , and it certainly helped dispose of Sirius Black , though I give you full credit for finishing him off . ”
10326	10361	10320	10320	Her	814	“ You are avoiding my last question , Snape . Harry Potter . You could have killed him at any point in the past five years . You have not done it . Why ? ”
10362	10373	10375	10375	Snape	147	“ Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord ? ”
10377	10391	10375	10375	Snape	147	“ He ... lately , we ... I am asking you , Snape ! ”
10392	10416	10320	10320	Her	814	“ If I had murdered Harry Potter , the Dark Lord could not have used his blood to regenerate , making him invincible — ”
10417	10428	10429	10429	she	815	“ You claim you foresaw his use of the boy ! ”
10432	10483	10429	10429	she	815	“ I do not claim it ; I had no idea of his plans ; I have already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead . I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Potter survived , at least until a year ago ... ”
10484	10493	10320	10320	Her	814	“ But why did you keep him alive ? ”
10494	10631	10429	10429	she	815	“ Have you not understood me ? It was only Dumbledore ’s protection that was keeping me out of Azkaban ! Do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me ? But there was more to it than that . I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him , rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard , which was how he had survived the Dark Lord ’s attack . Indeed , many of the Dark Lord ’s old followers thought Potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more . I was curious , I admit it , and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle . “
10747	10748	10742	10742	Dumbledore	138	” “
10764	10768	10769	10769	He	138	” asked Bellatrix . “
10784	10785	10778	10778	he	138	” “
10793	10797	10778	10778	he	138	” said Snape . “
10875	10886	10887	10889	the Dark Lord	4270	” ( for Bellatrix had made a scathing noise ) , “
10960	10989	10956	10958	the Dark Lord	4270	” Bellatrix still looked unhappy , though she appeared unsure how best to attack Snape next . Taking advantage of her silence , Snape turned to her sister . “
11002	11015	10992	10992	you	825	” Narcissa looked up at him , her face eloquent with despair . “
11047	11062	11063	11065	The Dark Lord	4270	” She closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids . “
11074	11083	11084	11084	He	4270	” Narcissa continued , her eyes still closed . “
11101	11102	11104	11104	he	4270	” “
11115	11121	11104	11104	he	4270	” said Snape at once . “
11130	11157	11122	11124	The Dark Lord	146	” Narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water . Bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house . “
11160	11168	11104	11104	he	4270	” she said triumphantly to her sister . “
11186	11227	11170	11170	Snape	147	” But Snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window , peered through the curtains at the deserted street , then closed them again with a jerk . He turned around to face Narcissa , frowning . “
11238	11246	11232	11232	I	0	” he said in a low voice . “
11285	11286	11287	11287	I	0	” “
11295	11303	11289	11289	you	0	” said Narcissa , breathing more freely . “
11311	11312	11313	11313	You	0	” “
11319	11335	11336	11336	You	0	” said Bellatrix , her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage . “
11339	11340	11336	11336	You	0	” “
11343	11347	11336	11336	You	0	” said Snape . “
11384	11385	11386	11386	Severus	147	” “
11388	11399	11386	11386	Severus	147	” she whispered , tears sliding down her pale cheeks . “
11407	11408	11409	11409	Draco	159	” “
11414	11419	11409	11409	Draco	159	” said Bellatrix indifferently . “
11462	11478	11447	11447	he	159	” Narcissa began to cry in earnest , gazing beseechingly all the while at Snape . “
11519	11549	11553	11553	he	159	” Snape said nothing . He looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent , but he could not pretend not to hear her . “
11562	11566	11556	11556	Draco	159	” she persisted . “
11571	11572	11556	11556	Draco	159	” “
11577	11587	11556	11556	Draco	159	” said Snape , still looking away from her , “
11596	11597	11556	11556	Draco	159	” “
11604	11608	11611	11611	he	159	” sobbed Narcissa . “
11620	11631	11617	11617	himself	4270	” Bellatrix gasped ; Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve . “
11693	11694	11684	11684	you	147	” “
11713	11718	11719	11719	I	0	” said Snape flatly . “
11776	11777	11764	11766	the Dark Lord	4270	” “
11790	11794	11795	11795	He	4270	” choked Narcissa . “
11811	11861	11862	11862	You	0	” When Snape said nothing , Narcissa seemed to lose what little self - restraint she still possessed . Standing up , she staggered to Snape and seized the front of his robes . Her face close to his , her tears falling onto his chest , she gasped , “
11896	11920	11887	11887	he	159	” Snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands . Looking down into her tearstained face , he said slowly , “
11974	11975	11944	11944	You	0	” “
11991	11992	11993	11995	The Dark Lord	4270	” “
12000	12005	12006	12006	He	159	” repeated Snape quietly . “
12030	12046	12047	12049	My only son	832	” She crumpled , falling at his feet , sobbing and moaning on the floor . “
12055	12056	12057	12057	You	0	” “
12062	12067	12057	12057	You	0	” said Bellatrix ruthlessly . “
12089	12140	12141	12141	Narcissa	144	” Narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair . Snape stooped , seized her by the arms , lifted her up , and steered her back onto the sofa . He then poured her more wine and forced the glass into her hand . “
12154	12171	12152	12152	me	0	” She quieted a little ; slopping wine down herself , she took a shaky sip . “
12183	12198	12178	12178	me	0	” She sat up , her face paper - white , her eyes huge . “
12223	12224	12225	12225	I	0	” “
12229	12271	12225	12225	I	0	” She flung away her glass ; it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at Snape ’s feet , seized his hand in both of hers , and pressed her lips to it . “
12294	12295	12288	12288	you	147	” “
12300	12321	12288	12288	you	147	” Snape ’s expression was blank , unreadable . Bellatrix , however , let out a cackle of triumphant laughter . “
12363	12392	12354	12356	the Dark Lord	4270	” Snape did not look at Bellatrix . His black eyes were fixed upon Narcissa ’s tear - filled blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand . “
12404	12409	12397	12397	I	0	” he said quietly . “
12420	12449	12450	12450	You	144	” Bellatrix ’s mouth fell open . Snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite Narcissa . Beneath Bellatrix ’s astonished gaze , they grasped right hands . “
12458	12471	12456	12456	Bellatrix	145	” said Snape coldly . She drew it , still looking astonished . “
12482	12511	12473	12473	you	144	” he said . She stepped forward so that she stood over them , and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands . Narcissa spoke . “
12535	12536	12537	12537	I	0	” “
12540	12568	12537	12537	I	0	” said Snape . A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a red - hot wire . “
12585	12586	12587	12587	I	0	” “
12590	12616	12587	12587	I	0	” said Snape . A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first , making a fine , glowing chain . “
12631	12650	12652	12652	you	144	” whispered Narcissa ( Snape ’s hand twitched within hers , but he did not draw away ) , “
12667	12689	12690	12690	I	0	” There was a moment ’s silence . Bellatrix watched , her wand upon their clasped hands , her eyes wide . “
12693	12741	12690	12690	I	0	” said Snape . Bellatrix ’s astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third tongue of flame , which shot from the wand , twisted with the others , and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands , like a rope , like a fiery snake .
12948	12964	12966	12968	one agitated Obliviator	864	“ We ’re not allowed to talk about it , do n’t ask me anything , ”
13106	13111	13105	13105	Potter	136	“ the Chosen One , ”
13406	13426	13428	13429	the Minister	891	“ For obvious reasons , the Ministry will not be going into detail about its stringent new security plans , ”
13484	13514	13480	13482	Mrs. Augusta Longbottom	161	“ My grandson , Neville — a good friend of Harry Potter ’s , incidentally , who fought the Death Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in June and — ”
14215	14217	14236	14236	Dumbledore	138	“ yes ”
14529	14541	14526	14526	Vernon	166	“ Who the blazes is calling at this time of night ? ”
14602	14625	14626	14626	Harry	136	“ Good evening . You must be Mr. Dursley . I daresay Harry has told you I would be coming for him ? ”
14750	14769	14771	14771	Dumbledore	138	“ Judging by your look of stunned disbelief , Harry did not warn you that I was coming , ”
14774	14803	14804	14804	He	138	“ However , let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house . It is unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times . ”
14818	14829	14831	14831	Dumbledore	138	“ It is a long time since my last visit , ”
14842	14852	14835	14835	his	138	“ I must say , your agapanthus are flourishing . ”
14939	14946	14948	14948	Dumbledore	138	“ Ah , good evening Harry , ”
14966	14971	14948	14948	Dumbledore	138	“ Excellent , excellent . ”
15000	15002	14991	15002	any man who could look at Harry and say “ excellent ”	4350	“ excellent ”
15016	15025	15026	15026	he	166	“ I do n’t mean to be rude — ”
15039	15051	15026	15026	he	166	“ — yet , sadly , accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often , ”
15058	15078	15026	15026	he	166	“ Best to say nothing at all , my dear man . Ah , and this must be Petunia . ”
15128	15132	15134	15134	Dumbledore	138	“ Albus Dumbledore , ”
15145	15153	15154	15154	Harry	136	“ We have corresponded , of course . ”
15183	15193	15175	15176	Aunt Petunia	169	“ And this must be your son , Dudley ? ”
15261	15275	15258	15258	he	138	“ Shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room ? ”
15336	15347	15348	15348	Harry	136	“ Are n’t — are n’t we leaving , sir ? ”
15352	15371	15373	15373	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , indeed we are , but there are a few matters we need to discuss first , ”
15375	15403	15373	15373	Dumbledore	138	“ And I would prefer not to do so in the open . We shall trespass upon your aunt and uncle ’s hospitality only a little longer . ”
15404	15411	15412	15413	Vernon Dursley	168	“ You will , will you ? ”
15431	15434	15436	15436	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , ”
15439	15443	15444	15444	He	138	“ I shall . ”
15502	15510	15512	15512	Dumbledore	138	“ We may as well be comfortable , ”
15545	15554	15516	15516	he	138	“ Sir — what happened to your — ? ”
15555	15560	15562	15562	Dumbledore	138	“ Later , Harry , ”
15564	15569	15562	15562	Dumbledore	138	“ Please sit down . ”
15590	15603	15604	15604	Dumbledore	138	“ I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment , ”
15610	15628	15604	15604	Dumbledore	138	“ but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness . ”
15676	15686	15688	15688	Dumbledore	138	“ Madam Rosmerta ’s finest oak - matured mead , ”
15768	15773	15775	15775	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , Harry , ”
15781	15835	15775	15775	Dumbledore	138	“ a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us . By us , I mean the Order of the Phoenix . But first of all I must tell you that Sirius ’s will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned . ”
15865	15870	15848	15848	Harry	136	“ Oh . Right . ”
15871	15882	15883	15883	Dumbledore	138	“ This is , in the main , fairly straightforward , ”
15887	15919	15883	15883	Dumbledore	138	“ You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts , and you inherit all of Sirius ’s personal possessions . The slightly problematic part of the legacy — ”
15920	15926	15928	15929	Uncle Vernon	166	“ His godfather ’s dead ? ”
15969	15977	15962	15962	he	136	“ He ’s dead ? His godfather ? ”
15978	15981	15983	15983	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , ”
15999	16003	16004	16004	he	138	“ Our problem , ”
16017	16030	16004	16004	he	138	“ is that Sirius also left you number twelve , Grimmauld Place . ”
16031	16039	16041	16042	Uncle Vernon	166	“ He ’s been left a house ? ”
16055	16064	16066	16066	Harry	136	“ You can keep using it as headquarters , ”
16068	16086	16066	16066	Harry	136	“ I do n’t care . You can have it , I do n’t really want it . ”
16137	16142	16144	16144	Dumbledore	138	“ That is generous , ”
16146	16157	16144	16144	Dumbledore	138	“ We have , however , vacated the building temporarily . ”
16158	16161	16167	16167	Dumbledore	138	“ Why ? ”
16162	16165	16167	16167	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , ”
16192	16287	16173	16174	Uncle Vernon	166	“ Black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line , to the next male with the name of ‘ Black . ’ Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother , Regulus , predeceased him and both were childless . While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house , it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it can not be owned by anyone other than a pureblood . ”
16318	16324	16325	16325	he	136	“ I bet there has , ”
16328	16331	16333	16333	Dumbledore	138	“ Quite , ”
16335	16372	16333	16333	Dumbledore	138	“ And if such an enchantment exists , then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius ’s living relatives , which would mean his cousin , Bellatrix Lestrange . ”
16409	16412	16413	16413	he	136	“ No , ”
16416	16431	16433	16433	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , obviously we would prefer that she did n’t get it either , ”
16436	16507	16433	16433	Dumbledore	138	“ The situation is fraught with complications . We do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it , for example , making it Unplottable , will hold now that ownership has passed from Sirius ’s hands . It might be that Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment . Naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position . ”
16508	16525	16531	16531	Dumbledore	138	“ But how are you going to find out if I ’m allowed to own it ? ”
16526	16529	16531	16531	Dumbledore	138	“ Fortunately , ”
16533	16540	16541	16541	He	138	“ there is a simple test . ”
16566	16576	16562	16563	Uncle Vernon	166	“ Will you get these ruddy things off us ? ”
16610	16618	16624	16624	he	138	“ Oh , I ’m so sorry , ”
16635	16650	16651	16651	It	956	“ But it would have been better manners to drink it , you know . ”
16693	16697	16698	16698	Dumbledore	138	“ You see , ”
16716	16730	16731	16731	He	138	“ if you have indeed inherited the house , you have also inherited — ”
16844	16851	16840	16841	Uncle Vernon	166	“ What the hell is that ? ”
16852	16855	16857	16857	Dumbledore	138	“ Kreacher , ”
16859	16872	16874	16877	the house - elf	959	“ Kreacher wo n’t , Kreacher wo n’t , Kreacher wo n’t ! ”
16897	16938	16874	16877	the house - elf	959	“ Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix , oh yes , Kreacher belongs to the Blacks , Kreacher wants his new mistress , Kreacher wo n’t go to the Potter brat , Kreacher wo n’t , wo n’t , wo n’t — ”
16939	16947	16949	16949	Dumbledore	138	“ As you can see , Harry , ”
16958	16968	16953	16953	Kreacher	173	“ wo n’t , wo n’t , wo n’t , ”
16969	16982	16874	16877	the house - elf	959	“ Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership . ”
16983	16989	16991	16991	Harry	136	“ I do n’t care , ”
17006	17013	16991	16991	Harry	136	“ I do n’t want him . ”
17014	17027	16953	16953	Kreacher	173	“ Wo n’t , wo n’t , wo n’t , wo n’t — ”
17028	17063	16991	16991	Harry	136	“ You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix Lestrange ? Bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for the past year ? ”
17064	17077	17078	17078	Harry	136	“ Wo n’t , wo n’t , wo n’t , wo n’t — ”
17120	17126	17128	17128	Dumbledore	138	“ Give him an order , ”
17130	17166	17128	17128	Dumbledore	138	“ If he has passed into your ownership , he will have to obey . If not , then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress . ”
17167	17179	17180	17180	Kreacher	173	“ Wo n’t , wo n’t , wo n’t , WON’T ! ”
17199	17205	17189	17189	Harry	136	“ Kreacher , shut up ! ”
17278	17285	17287	17287	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , that simplifies matters , ”
17290	17316	17287	17287	Dumbledore	138	“ It seems that Sirius knew what he was doing . You are the rightful owner of number twelve , Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher . ”
17317	17330	17331	17331	Harry	136	“ Do I — do I have to keep him with me ? ”
17344	17353	17355	17355	Dumbledore	138	“ Not if you do n’t want to , ”
17357	17394	17355	17355	Dumbledore	138	“ If I might make a suggestion , you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there . In that way , the other house - elves could keep an eye on him . ”
17395	17398	17400	17400	Harry	136	“ Yeah , ”
17404	17436	17437	17437	Kreacher	173	“ yeah , I ’ll do that . Er — Kreacher — I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other house - elves . ”
17475	17478	17480	17480	Dumbledore	138	“ Good , ”
17482	17520	17480	17480	Dumbledore	138	“ There is also the matter of the hippogriff , Buckbeak . Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died , but Buckbeak is yours now , so if you would prefer to make different arrangements — ”
17521	17524	17526	17526	Harry	136	“ No , ”
17530	17544	17526	17526	Harry	136	“ he can stay with Hagrid . I think Buckbeak would prefer that . ”
17545	17551	17553	17553	Dumbledore	138	“ Hagrid will be delighted , ”
17557	17619	17553	17553	Dumbledore	138	“ He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again . Incidentally , we have decided , in the interests of Buckbeak ’s safety , to rechristen him ‘ Witherwings ’ for the time being , though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death . Now , Harry , is your trunk packed ? ”
17620	17623	17633	17633	Dumbledore	138	“ Erm ... ”
17624	17632	17633	17633	Dumbledore	138	“ Doubtful that I would turn up ? ”
17637	17649	17651	17651	Harry	136	“ I ’ll just go and — er — finish off , ”
17806	17814	17803	17803	he	136	“ Professor — I ’m ready now . ”
17815	17818	17820	17820	Dumbledore	138	“ Good , ”
17822	17830	17832	17832	he	136	“ Just one last thing , then . ”
17842	17861	17832	17832	he	136	“ As you will no doubt be aware , Harry comes of age in a year ’s time — ”
17862	17865	17867	17868	Aunt Petunia	169	“ No , ”
17880	17885	17887	17887	Dumbledore	138	“ I ’m sorry ? ”
17890	17917	17887	17887	Dumbledore	138	“ No , he does n’t . He ’s a month younger than Dudley , and Dudders does n’t turn eighteen until the year after next . ”
17918	17921	17923	17923	Dumbledore	138	“ Ah , ”
17926	17940	17923	17923	Dumbledore	138	“ but in the Wizarding world , we come of age at seventeen . ”
17945	17948	17952	17952	him	166	“ Preposterous , ”
17954	18047	17950	17950	Dumbledore	138	“ Now , as you already know , the wizard called Lord Voldemort has returned to this country . The Wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare . Harry , whom Lord Voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions , is in even greater danger now than the day when I left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago , with a letter explaining about his parents ’ murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him as though he were your own . ”
18089	18147	18081	18082	the Dursleys	164	“ You did not do as I asked . You have never treated Harry as a son . He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands . The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you . ”
18171	18181	18183	18184	Uncle Vernon	166	“ Us — mistreat Dudders ? What d’you — ? ”
18208	18318	18201	18201	he	138	“ The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house ‘ home . ’ However miserable he has been here , however unwelcome , however badly treated , you have at least , grudgingly , allowed him houseroom . This magic will cease to operate the moment that Harry turns seventeen ; in other words , at the moment he becomes a man . I ask only this : that you allow Harry to return , once more , to this house , before his seventeenth birthday , which will ensure that the protection continues until that time . ”
18369	18381	18383	18383	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , Harry ... time for us to be off , ”
18396	18402	18403	18403	he	138	“ Until we meet again , ”
18437	18440	18442	18442	Harry	136	“ Bye , ”
18467	18480	18481	18481	he	138	“ We do not want to be encumbered by these just now , ”
18490	18519	18481	18481	he	138	“ I shall send them to the Burrow to await us there . However , I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak ... just in case . ”
18585	18606	18570	18570	his	138	“ And now , Harry , let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress , adventure . ”
18727	18737	18738	18738	he	138	“ Keep your wand at the ready , Harry , ”
18742	18758	18738	18738	he	138	“ But I thought I ’m not allowed to use magic outside school , sir ? ”
18759	18766	18768	18768	Dumbledore	138	“ If there is an attack , ”
18770	18801	18768	18768	Dumbledore	138	“ I give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you . However , I do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight . ”
18802	18808	18738	18738	he	138	“ Why not , sir ? ”
18809	18815	18817	18817	Dumbledore	138	“ You are with me , ”
18820	18827	18817	18817	Dumbledore	138	“ This will do , Harry . ”
18841	18854	18855	18855	he	138	“ You have not , of course , passed your Apparition Test , ”
18858	18861	18863	18863	Harry	136	“ No , ”
18865	18874	18863	18863	Harry	136	“ I thought you had to be seventeen ? ”
18875	18879	18881	18881	Dumbledore	138	“ You do , ”
18883	18922	18923	18923	Harry	136	“ So you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly . My left , if you do n’t mind — as you have noticed , my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment . ”
18930	18934	18936	18936	Dumbledore	138	“ Very good , ”
18938	18945	18936	18936	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , here we go . ”
19016	19115	19117	19117	you	136	” He gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes . He felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube . It was a few seconds before he realized that Privet Drive had vanished . He and Dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a deserted village square , in the center of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches . His comprehension catching up with his senses , Harry realized that he had just Apparated for the first time in his life . “
19121	19131	19117	19117	you	136	” asked Dumbledore , looking down at him solicitously . “
19141	19142	19143	19143	I	0	” “
19147	19167	19143	19143	I	0	” said Harry , rubbing his ears , which felt as though they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly . “
19176	19195	19169	19169	I	0	” Dumbledore smiled , drew his traveling cloak a little more tightly around his neck , and said , “
19199	19231	19169	19169	I	0	” He set off at a brisk pace , past an empty inn and a few houses . According to a clock on a nearby church , it was almost midnight . “
19238	19242	19236	19236	Harry	136	” said Dumbledore . “
19253	19270	19169	19169	I	0	” Harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed the lightning - shaped mark . “
19273	19277	19169	19169	I	0	” he said , “
19303	19319	19320	19320	I	0	” He glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression . “
19330	19334	19320	19320	I	0	” said Dumbledore . “
19364	19365	19356	19356	he	179	” “
19373	19415	19416	19416	Professor	4397	” said Harry , who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into Voldemort ’s mind . They turned a corner , passing a telephone box and a bus shelter . Harry looked sideways at Dumbledore again . “
19418	19419	19420	19420	Harry	136	” “
19422	19423	19420	19420	Harry	136	” “
19431	19432	19435	19435	Harry	136	” “
19445	19446	19435	19435	Harry	136	” “
19454	19455	19435	19435	Harry	136	” “
19468	19472	19462	19462	I	0	” said Dumbledore . “
19525	19526	19540	19540	I	0	” “
19536	19537	19540	19540	I	0	” “
19550	19555	19540	19540	I	0	” said Dumbledore vaguely . “
19561	19616	19559	19559	Harry	136	” They proceeded up a steep , narrow street lined with houses . All the windows were dark . The odd chill that had lain over Privet Drive for two weeks persisted here too . Thinking of dementors , Harry cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket . “
19633	19634	19617	19617	Professor	4397	” “
19649	19653	19617	19617	Professor	4397	” said Dumbledore . “
19688	19689	19691	19691	you	4397	” “
19702	19707	19708	19709	Hermione Granger	180	” said Harry quickly . “
19713	19714	19716	19716	she	180	” “
19726	19769	19721	19721	We	971	” The church clock chimed midnight behind them . Harry wondered why Dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late , but now that conversation had been established , he had more pressing questions to ask . “
19784	19785	19775	19777	the Daily Prophet	986	” “
19788	19800	19801	19801	He	129	” said Dumbledore , now turning up a steep side street . “
19828	19829	19831	19831	he	129	” “
19840	19844	19834	19834	you	0	” asked Harry . “
19849	19853	19834	19834	you	0	” said Dumbledore . “
19869	19870	19867	19867	Cornelius	129	” “
19877	19878	19874	19874	I	0	” “
19910	19949	19907	19908	Lord Voldemort	179	” Harry waited , but Dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with Scrimgeour that the Daily Prophet had reported , and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject , so he changed it . “
19960	19961	19954	19954	I	0	” “
19964	19969	19954	19954	I	0	” said Dumbledore quietly . “
19989	19998	19984	19984	I	0	” He had pointed with his injured hand . “
20007	20008	20009	20009	I	0	” “
20017	20021	20009	20009	I	0	” said Dumbledore . “
20035	20060	20061	20061	Sir	4356	” He smiled at Harry , who understood that he was not being snubbed , and that he had permission to keep asking questions . “
20085	20086	20063	20063	I	0	” “
20094	20101	20092	20092	myself	0	” said Dumbledore , still smiling . “
20108	20109	20103	20103	you	4397	” “
20113	20114	20103	20103	you	4397	” “
20151	20152	20153	20153	I	0	” “
20157	20172	20153	20153	I	0	” Harry began , not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not . “
20209	20210	20230	20230	Inferi	182	” “
20215	20219	20230	20230	Inferi	182	” said Harry . “
20244	20245	20246	20246	They	182	” “
20250	20255	20246	20246	They	182	” said Dumbledore calmly . “
20313	20365	20422	20422	Harry	136	” They were nearing a small , neat stone house set in its own garden . Harry was too busy digesting the horrible idea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything else , but as they reached the front gate , Dumbledore stopped dead and Harry walked into him . “
20376	20415	20422	20422	Harry	136	” Harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink . The front door was hanging off its hinges . Dumbledore glanced up and down the street . It seemed quite deserted . “
20424	20464	20422	20422	Harry	136	” he said quietly . He opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path , Harry at his heels , then pushed the front door very slowly , his wand raised and at the ready . “
20467	20630	20465	20465	Lumos	183	” Dumbledore ’s wand - tip ignited , casting its light up a narrow hallway . To the left , another door stood open . Holding his illuminated wand aloft , Dumbledore walked into the sitting room with Harry right behind him . A scene of total devastation met their eyes . A grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet , its face cracked , its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword . A piano was on its side , its keys strewn across the floor . The wreckage of a fallen chandelier glittered nearby . Cushions lay deflated , feathers oozing from slashes in their sides ; fragments of glass and china lay like powder over everything . Dumbledore raised his wand even higher , so that its light was thrown upon the walls , where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper . Harry ’s small intake of breath made Dumbledore look around . “
20637	20642	20770	20770	You	0	” he said heavily . “
20651	20704	20770	20770	You	0	” Dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room , scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet . Harry followed , gazing around , half - scared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa , but there was no sign of a body . “
20720	20747	20713	20713	they	1006	” Harry suggested , trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls . “
20754	20769	20748	20748	I	0	” said Dumbledore quietly , peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side . “
20776	20777	20772	20772	he	1007	” “
20784	20809	20772	20772	he	1007	” And without warning , Dumbledore swooped , plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair , which yelled , “
20812	20813	20772	20772	he	1007	” “
20819	20872	20817	20817	Horace	184	” said Dumbledore , straightening up again . Harry ’s jaw dropped . Where a split second before there had been an armchair , there now crouched an enormously fat , bald , old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at Dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye . “
20885	20895	20770	20770	You	0	” he said gruffly , clambering to his feet . “
20899	20952	20770	20770	You	0	” The wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate , his prominent eyes , his enormous , silver , walruslike mustache , and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas . The top of his head barely reached Dumbledore ’s chin . “
20958	20992	20995	20995	Horace	184	” he grunted as he staggered to his feet , still rubbing his lower belly . He seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair . “
20997	21004	20995	20995	Horace	184	” said Dumbledore , looking amused , “
21026	21038	21039	21041	The Dark Mark	156	” The wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead . “
21043	21047	21039	21041	The Dark Mark	156	” he muttered . “
21080	21095	21075	21075	you	184	” He heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache flutter . “
21104	21109	21097	21097	you	1012	” asked Dumbledore politely . “
21112	21225	21097	21097	you	1012	” said the other . They stood back to back , the tall thin wizard and the short round one , and waved their wands in one identical sweeping motion . The furniture flew back to its original places ; ornaments re - formed in midair , feathers zoomed into their cushions ; torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves ; oil lanterns soared onto side tables and reignited ; a vast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glittering across the room and alighted , whole and untarnished , upon a desk ; rips , cracks , and holes healed everywhere , and the walls wiped themselves clean . “
21235	21249	21296	21296	dragon	1013	” asked Dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather clock . “
21256	21293	21296	21296	dragon	1013	” shouted the wizard called Horace , as , with a deafening grinding and tinkling , the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling . There was a final plunk from the piano , and silence . “
21298	21304	21296	21296	dragon	1013	” repeated the wizard conversationally . “
21326	21355	21296	21296	dragon	1013	” He stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light , examining the thick liquid within . “
21361	21383	21296	21296	dragon	1013	” He set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed . It was then that his gaze fell upon Harry . “
21386	21408	21296	21296	dragon	1013	” he said , his large round eyes flying to Harry ’s forehead and the lightning - shaped scar it bore . “
21411	21412	21296	21296	dragon	1013	” “
21415	21426	21428	21429	Harry Potter	136	” said Dumbledore , moving forward to make the introduction , “
21446	21456	21443	21444	Horace Slughorn	184	” Slughorn turned on Dumbledore , his expression shrewd . “
21480	21502	21478	21478	Albus	138	” He pushed past Harry , his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation . “
21514	21518	21503	21503	I	0	” asked Dumbledore . “
21525	21529	21503	21503	I	0	” Slughorn hesitated . “
21537	21629	21503	21503	I	0	” he said ungraciously . Dumbledore smiled at Harry and directed him toward a chair not unlike the one that Slughorn had so recently impersonated , which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp . Harry took the seat with the distinct impression that Dumbledore , for some reason , wanted to keep him as visible as possible . Certainly when Slughorn , who had been busy with decanters and glasses , turned to face the room again , his eyes fell immediately upon Harry . “
21632	21647	21503	21503	I	0	” he said , looking away quickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes . “
21650	21698	21503	21503	I	0	” He gave a drink to Dumbledore , who had sat down without invitation , thrust the tray at Harry , and then sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence . His legs were so short they did not touch the floor . “
21709	21713	21707	21707	Horace	184	” Dumbledore asked . “
21718	21724	21707	21707	Horace	184	” said Slughorn at once . “
21754	21755	21503	21503	I	0	” “
21776	21780	21758	21758	you	1016	” said Dumbledore . “
21793	21803	21781	21781	You	1016	” Slughorn said , half irritably , half proudly , “
21823	21836	21843	21845	an old man	1018	” he added sternly , seeming to pull himself back together again , “
21868	21935	21936	21936	You	1016	” He certainly had those , thought Harry , looking around the room . It was stuffy and cluttered , yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable ; there were soft chairs and footstools , drinks and books , boxes of chocolates and plump cushions . If Harry had not known who lived there , he would have guessed at a rich , fussy old lady . “
21948	21952	21946	21946	Horace	184	” said Dumbledore . “
21964	21980	21962	21962	yourself	1016	” said Slughorn bluntly . His pale gooseberry eyes had found Dumbledore ’s injured hand . “
21990	21991	21987	21987	I	0	” “
21997	22031	21992	21992	You	1016	” said Dumbledore serenely , shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers ; the sight of them made the back of Harry ’s neck prickle unpleasantly . “
22046	22135	22144	22144	Horace	184	” He shrugged and spread his hands wide , as though to say that age had its compensations , and Harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen Dumbledore wear before : It was large , rather clumsily made of what looked like gold , and was set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle . Slughorn ’s eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too , and Harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead . “
22158	22162	22149	22151	the Death Eaters	4304	” asked Dumbledore . “
22180	22184	22188	22188	they	4304	” demanded Slughorn . “
22205	22209	22188	22188	they	4304	” said Dumbledore . “
22223	22235	22211	22211	you	184	” Slughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment , then muttered , “
22335	22336	22324	22325	the neighbors	1029	” “
22339	22343	22324	22325	the neighbors	1029	” said Dumbledore . “
22375	22376	22368	22368	you	184	” “
22432	22433	22426	22426	you	184	” “
22443	22447	22434	22435	Professor Umbridge	187	” said Dumbledore . “
22478	22479	22487	22487	she	186	” “
22489	22493	22494	22495	Idiotic woman	1036	” said Slughorn . “
22501	22514	22487	22487	she	186	” Harry chuckled and both Dumbledore and Slughorn looked round at him . “
22517	22522	22487	22487	she	186	” Harry said hastily . “
22534	22541	22527	22527	I	0	” Dumbledore stood up rather suddenly . “
22546	22555	22543	22543	you	184	” asked Slughorn at once , looking hopeful . “
22568	22572	22558	22558	I	0	” said Dumbledore . “
22575	22582	22558	22558	I	0	” said Slughorn , clearly disappointed . “
22591	22654	22558	22558	I	0	” Dumbledore strode from the room . Once the door had closed behind him , there was silence . After a few moments , Slughorn got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself . He shot a furtive look at Harry , then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it , warming his wide behind . “
22668	22699	22658	22658	I	0	” he said abruptly . Harry merely looked at Slughorn . Slughorn ’s watery eyes slid over Harry ’s scar , this time taking in the rest of his face . “
22707	22708	22700	22700	You	184	” “
22716	22720	22700	22700	You	184	” said Harry . “
22730	22731	22726	22726	You	184	” “
22739	22753	22754	22754	Hmpf	188	” Harry had heard it so often he found it a bit wearing . “
22782	22794	22795	22796	Lily Evans	189	” Slughorn added , in answer to Harry ’s questioning look . “
22838	22839	22831	22831	I	0	” “
22845	22846	22847	22847	I	0	” “
22853	22857	22847	22847	I	0	” said Slughorn . “
22862	22883	22847	22847	I	0	” he went on quickly , seeing the expression on Harry ’s face and wagging a stubby finger at him , “
22943	22961	22921	22921	You	184	” It was as though an invisible hand had twisted Harry ’s intestines and held them tight . “
23023	23063	23016	23016	I	0	” He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction . Apparently lost in memories , he gazed at the opposite wall , turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside . “
23097	23098	23084	23084	she	1043	” “
23109	23113	23115	23115	she	1058	” said Harry , “
23123	23124	23115	23115	she	1058	” “
23135	23139	23115	23115	she	1058	” said Slughorn . “
23143	23156	23115	23115	she	1058	” said Harry coldly . Slughorn looked down at him in surprise . “
23165	23169	23157	23157	You	0	” he said . “
23241	23277	23278	23281	All ex - students	1067	” He bounced up and down a little , smiling in a self - satisfied way , and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the dresser , each peopled with tiny moving occupants . “
23400	23410	23364	23365	Gwenog Jones	198	” This thought seemed to cheer him up enormously . “
23426	23480	23364	23365	Gwenog Jones	198	” asked Harry , who could not help wondering why the Death Eaters had not yet tracked down Slughorn if hampers of sweets , Quidditch tickets , and visitors craving his advice and opinions could find him . The smile slid from Slughorn ’s face as quickly as the blood from his walls . “
23485	23494	23364	23365	Gwenog Jones	198	” he said , looking down at Harry . “
23507	23531	23495	23495	I	0	” Harry had the impression that the words shocked Slughorn himself ; he looked quite unsettled for a moment . Then he shrugged . “
23604	23605	23595	23595	I	0	” “
23619	23661	23595	23595	I	0	” said Harry , who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice : It was hard to sympathize with Slughorn ’s cosseted existence when he remembered Sirius , crouching in a cave and living on rats . “
23701	23744	23695	23695	he	154	” Harry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear Voldemort ’s name spoken aloud , and was not disappointed : Slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest , which Harry ignored . “
23775	23800	23773	23773	he	1085	” Harry went on . Slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two : He seemed to be thinking over Harry ’s words . “
23828	23833	23835	23835	I	0	” he muttered grudgingly . “
23908	23927	23898	23898	she	132	” Dumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house . “
23936	23940	23934	23934	Albus	138	” he said . “
23952	23953	23934	23934	Albus	138	” “
23964	23968	23956	23956	I	0	” said Dumbledore . “
24000	24019	24020	24020	You	138	” Not at all reluctant to obey , Harry jumped to his feet . Slughorn seemed taken aback . “
24024	24025	24020	24020	You	138	” “
24042	24043	24032	24032	I	0	” “
24047	24075	24032	24032	I	0	” Slughorn seemed agitated . He twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak , and Harry zip up his jacket . “
24090	24103	24088	24088	Horace	184	” said Dumbledore , raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute . “
24134	24135	24144	24144	I	0	” “
24147	24148	24144	24144	I	0	” “
24155	24156	24144	24144	I	0	” “
24159	24178	24144	24144	I	0	” said Harry . They were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them . “
24190	24206	24207	24207	You	184	” Dumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room . “
24214	24215	24207	24207	You	184	” “
24220	24225	24207	24207	You	184	” said Slughorn impatiently . “
24234	24235	24226	24226	I	0	” “
24238	24244	24226	24226	I	0	” said Dumbledore , beaming . “
24259	24260	24252	24252	you	184	” “
24268	24288	24265	24265	you	184	” grunted Slughorn . As they set off down the garden path , Slughorn ’s voice floated after them , “
24298	24326	24352	24352	you	184	” Dumbledore chuckled . The garden gate swung shut behind them , and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist . “
24332	24336	24330	24330	Harry	136	” said Dumbledore . “
24343	24349	24337	24337	I	0	” said Harry in surprise . “
24375	24376	24371	24371	you	184	” “
24379	24430	24431	24431	Horace	184	” Harry was n’t sure whether he liked Slughorn or not . He supposed he had been pleasant in his way , but he had also seemed vain and , whatever he said to the contrary , much too surprised that a Muggle - born should make a good witch . “
24433	24448	24450	24450	his	184	” said Dumbledore , relieving Harry of the responsibility to say any of this , “
24606	24644	24645	24645	I	0	” Harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider , spinning a web around it , twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer . “
24651	24655	24645	24645	I	0	” Dumbledore continued , “
24724	24790	24795	24795	Harry	136	” At these words , a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over Harry . He was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago , words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him : Neither can live while the other survives ... Dumbledore had stopped walking , level with the church they had passed earlier . “
24804	24910	24798	24798	you	136	” Braced this time , Harry was ready for the Apparition , but still found it unpleasant . When the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again , he was standing in a country lane beside Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world : the Burrow . In spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him , his spirits could not help but lift at the sight of it . Ron was in there ... and so was Mrs. Weasley , who could cook better than anyone he knew ... “
24919	24930	24917	24917	Harry	136	” said Dumbledore , as they passed through the gate , “
24950	25011	25012	25012	I	0	” Dumbledore pointed toward a run - down stone outhouse where the Weasleys kept their broomsticks . A little puzzled , Harry followed Dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard . Dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand , so that it glowed like a torch , and smiled down at Harry . “
25063	25096	25055	25055	Sirius	135	” Harry swallowed ; his voice seemed to have deserted him . He did not think he could stand to discuss Sirius ; it had been painful enough to hear Uncle Vernon say “
25102	25117	25055	25055	Sirius	135	” and even worse to hear Sirius ’s name thrown out casually by Slughorn . “
25122	25127	25053	25053	I	0	” said Dumbledore softly , “
25153	25228	25247	25247	he	135	” Harry nodded , his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing Dumbledore ’s hat . He could tell that Dumbledore understood , that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived , Harry had spent nearly all his time at the Dursleys ’ lying on his bed , refusing meals , and staring at the misted window , full of the chill emptiness that he had come to associate with dementors . “
25234	25244	25247	25247	he	135	” Harry said finally , in a low voice , “
25255	25318	25319	25319	Sirius	135	” His eyes burned suddenly and he blinked . He felt stupid for admitting it , but the fact that he had had someone outside Hogwarts who cared what happened to him , almost like a parent , had been one of the best things about discovering his godfather ... and now the post owls would never bring him that comfort again ... “
25331	25336	25319	25319	Sirius	135	” said Dumbledore gently . “
25344	25345	25319	25319	Sirius	135	” “
25355	25364	25365	25365	I	0	” interrupted Harry , his voice growing stronger , “
25422	25440	25441	25441	I	0	” he said fiercely , now looking straight into Dumbledore ’s blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight , “
25466	25467	25468	25468	Spoken	1110	” “
25483	25496	25497	25497	I	0	” said Dumbledore , with an approving pat on Harry ’s back . “
25520	25548	25497	25497	I	0	“ And now , Harry , on a closely related subject ... I gather that you have been taking the Daily Prophet over the last two weeks ? ”
25549	25552	25554	25554	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
25564	25589	25554	25554	Harry	136	“ Then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in the Hall of Prophecy ? ”
25590	25593	25595	25595	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
25598	25609	25595	25595	Harry	136	“ And now everyone knows that I ’m the one — ”
25610	25617	25619	25619	Dumbledore	138	“ No , they do not , ”
25621	25690	25619	25619	Dumbledore	138	“ There are only two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and Lord Voldemort , and they are both standing in this smelly , spidery broom shed . It is true , however , that many have guessed , correctly , that Voldemort sent his Death Eaters to steal a prophecy , and that the prophecy concerned you . “
25714	25715	25701	25701	you	136	” “
25718	25722	25701	25701	you	136	” said Harry . “
25731	25735	25701	25701	you	136	” said Dumbledore . “
25760	25769	25770	25770	I	0	” he continued , when Harry looked startled , “
25791	25792	25777	25777	You	136	” “
25798	25799	25793	25793	I	0	” “
25807	25823	25793	25793	I	0	” said Dumbledore , surveying Harry over the top of his half - moon spectacles . “
25861	25879	25850	25850	Sirius	135	” Harry said nothing , but Dumbledore did not seem to require an answer . He continued , “
25903	25904	25894	25894	you	136	” “
25910	25921	25894	25894	you	136	” said Harry , surprised out of his preoccupied silence . “
25939	25940	25930	25930	I	0	” “
25950	25951	25943	25943	you	0	” “
25964	25991	25943	25943	you	0	” said Dumbledore airily . Harry waited hopefully , but Dumbledore did not elaborate , so he asked something else that had been bothering him slightly . “
26014	26015	26016	26017	Professor Snape	205	” “
26028	26029	26024	26024	you	136	” “
26032	26038	26024	26024	you	136	” said Harry in relief , “
26044	26057	26058	26058	I	0	” He stopped , careful not to say what he really thought . “
26072	26081	26058	26058	I	0	” said Dumbledore , nodding . Harry laughed . “
26098	26102	26086	26086	I	0	” he said , “
26129	26130	26125	26125	I	0	” “
26141	26146	26125	26125	I	0	” said Dumbledore gravely . “
26175	26209	26210	26210	Harry	136	“ Firstly , I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with you at all times from this moment onward . Even within Hogwarts itself . Just in case , you understand me ? ”
26213	26302	26210	26210	Harry	136	“ And lastly , while you stay here , the Burrow has been given the highest security the Ministry of Magic can provide . These measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to Arthur and Molly — all their post , for instance , is being searched at the Ministry before being sent on . They do not mind in the slightest , for their only concern is your safety . However , it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them . ”
26303	26307	26309	26309	Harry	136	“ I understand , ”
26312	26318	26320	26320	Dumbledore	138	“ Very well , then , ”
26335	26361	26320	26320	Dumbledore	138	“ I see a light in the kitchen . Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are . ”
26417	26422	26430	26431	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Who ’s there ? ”
26434	26438	26430	26431	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Declare yourself ! ”
26439	26449	26505	26505	Dumbledore	138	“ It is I , Dumbledore , bringing Harry . ”
26473	26497	26458	26459	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Harry , dear ! Gracious , Albus , you gave me a fright , you said not to expect you before morning ! ”
26498	26503	26505	26505	Dumbledore	138	“ We were lucky , ”
26513	26537	26505	26505	Dumbledore	138	“ Slughorn proved much more persuadable than I had expected . Harry ’s doing , of course . Ah , hello , Nymphadora ! ”
26585	26590	26591	26591	she	1127	“ Hello , Professor , ”
26594	26599	26591	26591	she	1127	“ Wotcher , Harry . ”
26600	26605	26608	26608	she	1127	“ Hi , Tonks . ”
26644	26651	26652	26652	she	1127	“ I ’d better be off , ”
26666	26676	26652	26652	she	1127	“ Thanks for the tea and sympathy , Molly . ”
26677	26686	26688	26688	Dumbledore	138	“ Please do n’t leave on my account , ”
26691	26707	26688	26688	Dumbledore	138	“ I can not stay , I have urgent matters to discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour . ”
26708	26719	26721	26721	Tonks	210	“ No , no , I need to get going , ”
26729	26733	26721	26721	Tonks	210	“ ’ Night — ”
26734	26755	26688	26688	Dumbledore	138	“ Dear , why not come to dinner at the weekend , Remus and Mad - Eye are coming — ? ”
26756	26771	26772	26772	Tonks	210	“ No , really , Molly ... thanks anyway ... Good night , everyone . ”
26808	26820	26822	26822	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , I shall see you at Hogwarts , Harry , ”
26824	26835	26836	26836	He	136	“ Take care of yourself . Molly , your servant . ”
26884	26890	26891	26891	she	202	“ You ’re like Ron , ”
26900	26937	26891	26891	she	202	“ Both of you look as though you ’ve had Stretching Jinxes put on you . I swear Ron ’s grown four inches since I last bought him school robes . Are you hungry , Harry ? ”
26938	26944	26946	26946	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I am , ”
26956	26968	26946	26946	Harry	136	“ Sit down , dear , I ’ll knock something up . ”
26992	26998	26999	26999	he	136	“ So Hermione ’s here ? ”
27010	27021	27023	27024	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Oh yes , she arrived the day before yesterday , ”
27051	27072	27073	27073	She	202	“ Everyone ’s in bed , of course , we did n’t expect you for hours . Here you are — ”
27115	27120	27093	27094	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Bread , dear ? ”
27121	27127	27128	27128	She	202	“ Thanks , Mrs. Weasley . ”
27171	27182	27164	27165	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ So you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job ? ”
27199	27206	27208	27209	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ He taught Arthur and me , ”
27211	27235	27236	27236	His	136	“ He was at Hogwarts for ages , started around the same time as Dumbledore , I think . Did you like him ? ”
27254	27261	27263	27264	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I know what you mean , ”
27269	27369	27263	27264	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Of course he can be charming when he wants to be , but Arthur ’s never liked him much . The Ministry ’s littered with Slughorn ’s old favorites , he was always good at giving leg ups , but he never had much time for Arthur — did n’t seem to think he was enough of a highflier . Well , that just shows you , even Slughorn makes mistakes . I do n’t know whether Ron ’s told you in any of his letters — it ’s only just happened — but Arthur ’s been promoted ! ”
27404	27409	27410	27410	he	136	“ That ’s great ! ”
27413	27418	27420	27421	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ You are sweet , ”
27434	27487	27420	27421	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Yes , Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation , and Arthur ’s heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects . It ’s a big job , he ’s got ten people reporting to him now ! ”
27488	27493	27420	27421	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ What exactly — ? ”
27494	27679	27680	27681	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Well , you see , in all the panic about You - Know - Who , odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere , things that are supposed to guard against You - Know - Who and the Death Eaters . You can imagine the kind of thing — so - called protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added , or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off ... Well , in the main the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus Fletcher , who ’ve never done an honest day ’s work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is , but every now and then something really nasty turns up . The other day Arthur confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a Death Eater . So you see , it ’s a very important job , and I tell him it ’s just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish . ”
27706	27714	27715	27715	Harry	136	“ Is Mr. Weasley still at work ? ”
27718	27746	27747	27747	She	202	“ Yes , he is . As a matter of fact , he ’s a tiny bit late ... He said he ’d be back around midnight ... ”
27839	27843	27928	27928	she	202	“ mortal peril . ”
27844	27855	27857	27858	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ It ’s been like that for a while now , ”
27866	27923	27857	27858	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ ever since You - Know - Who came back into the open . I suppose everybody ’s in mortal danger now ... I do n’t think it can be just our family ... but I do n’t know anyone else who ’s got a clock like this , so I ca n’t check . Oh ! ”
27943	27946	27936	27937	Mr. Weasley	204	“ traveling . ”
27947	27952	27928	27928	she	202	“ He ’s coming ! ”
27995	28002	27991	27991	she	202	“ Arthur , is that you ? ”
28003	28006	28008	28009	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Yes , ”
28014	28034	28008	28009	Mr. Weasley	204	“ But I would say that even if I were a Death Eater , dear . Ask the question ! ”
28035	28040	27991	27991	she	202	“ Oh , honestly ... ”
28041	28044	27991	27991	she	202	“ Molly ! ”
28045	28058	28008	28009	Mr. Weasley	204	“ All right , all right ... What is your dearest ambition ? ”
28059	28068	28069	28070	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ To find out how airplanes stay up . ”
28098	28111	28079	28080	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Molly ! I ’ve got to ask you your question first ! ”
28112	28122	28008	28009	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Arthur , really , this is just silly ... ”
28123	28138	28079	28080	Mr. Weasley	204	“ What do you like me to call you when we ’re alone together ? ”
28186	28189	28193	28194	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Mollywobbles , ”
28205	28208	28210	28211	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Correct , ”
28213	28221	28210	28211	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Now you can let me in . ”
28254	28273	28275	28276	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I still do n’t see why we have to go through that every time you come home , ”
28293	28312	28284	28284	she	202	“ I mean , a Death Eater might have forced the answer out of you before impersonating you ! ”
28313	28340	28341	28342	Mr. Weasley	204	“ I know , dear , but it ’s Ministry procedure , and I have to set an example . Something smells good — onion soup ? ”
28352	28363	28341	28342	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Harry ! We did n’t expect you until morning ! ”
28391	28440	28378	28379	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Thanks , Molly . It ’s been a tough night . Some idiot ’s started selling Metamorph - Medals . Just sling them around your neck and you ’ll be able to change your appearance at will . A hundred thousand disguises , all for ten Galleons ! ”
28441	28452	28378	28379	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ And what really happens when you put them on ? ”
28453	28492	28378	28379	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color , but a couple of people have also sprouted tentaclelike warts all over their bodies . As if St. Mungo ’s did n’t have enough to do already ! ”
28493	28508	28510	28511	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find funny , ”
28514	28520	28510	28511	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Are you sure — ? ”
28521	28527	28529	28530	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Of course I am ! ”
28532	28551	28529	28530	Mr. Weasley	204	“ The boys would n’t do anything like that now , not when people are desperate for protection ! ”
28552	28565	28378	28379	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ So is that why you ’re late , Metamorph - Medals ? ”
28566	28601	28602	28602	Harry	136	“ No , we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in Elephant and Castle , but luckily the Magical Law Enforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we got there ... ”
28610	28613	28617	28618	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Bed , ”
28622	28643	28617	28618	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I ’ve got Fred and George ’s room all ready for you , you ’ll have it to yourself . ”
28644	28651	28378	28379	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Why , where are they ? ”
28652	28676	28678	28679	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Oh , they ’re in Diagon Alley , sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as they ’re so busy , ”
28681	28719	28678	28679	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I must say , I did n’t approve at first , but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business ! Come on , dear , your trunk ’s already up there . ”
28720	28727	28729	28729	Harry	136	“ ’ Night , Mr. Weasley , ”
28749	28754	28756	28757	Mr. Weasley	204	“ G’night , Harry , ”
28784	28788	28777	28779	All the hands	1141	“ mortal peril . ”
29068	29071	29058	29058	he	136	“ Wuzzgoinon ? ”
29072	29082	29113	29114	a girl	1147	“ We did n’t know you were here already ! ”
29103	29111	29113	29114	a girl	1147	“ Ron , do n’t hit him ! ”
29171	29175	29160	29161	Ron Weasley	201	“ All right ? ”
29176	29181	29183	29183	Harry	136	“ Never been better , ”
29198	29201	29160	29161	Ron Weasley	201	“ You ? ”
29202	29206	29208	29208	Ron	201	“ Not bad , ”
29220	29234	29208	29208	Ron	201	“ When did you get here ? Mum ’s only just told us ! ”
29235	29242	29160	29161	Ron Weasley	201	“ About one o’clock this morning . ”
29243	29256	29160	29161	Ron Weasley	201	“ Were the Muggles all right ? Did they treat you okay ? ”
29257	29262	29264	29264	Harry	136	“ Same as usual , ”
29277	29300	29269	29269	herself	180	“ they did n’t talk to me much , but I like it better that way . How ’re you , Hermione ? ”
29301	29308	29310	29310	Hermione	180	“ Oh , I ’m fine , ”
29356	29367	29353	29353	he	136	“ What ’s the time ? Have I missed breakfast ? ”
29368	29389	29391	29391	Ron	201	“ Do n’t worry about that , Mum ’s bringing you up a tray ; she reckons you look underfed , ”
29397	29406	29391	29391	Ron	201	“ So , what ’s been going on ? ”
29407	29427	29353	29353	he	136	“ Nothing much , I ’ve just been stuck at my aunt and uncle ’s , have n’t I ? ”
29428	29433	29435	29435	Ron	201	“ Come off it ! ”
29437	29445	29435	29435	Ron	201	“ You ’ve been off with Dumbledore ! ”
29446	29476	29353	29353	he	136	“ It was n’t that exciting . He just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement . His name ’s Horace Slughorn . ”
29477	29480	29482	29482	Ron	201	“ Oh , ”
29487	29491	29482	29482	Ron	201	“ We thought — ”
29508	29519	29501	29501	Ron	201	“ — we thought it ’d be something like that . ”
29520	29524	29526	29526	Harry	136	“ You did ? ”
29530	29565	29526	29526	Harry	136	“ Yeah ... yeah , now Umbridge has left , obviously we need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher , do n’t we ? So , er , what ’s he like ? ”
29566	29584	29586	29586	Harry	136	“ He looks a bit like a walrus , and he used to be Head of Slytherin , ”
29588	29594	29586	29586	Harry	136	“ Something wrong , Hermione ? ”
29621	29643	29611	29611	She	180	“ No , of course not ! So , um , did Slughorn seem like he ’ll be a good teacher ? ”
29644	29647	29649	29649	Harry	136	“ Dunno , ”
29651	29663	29649	29649	Harry	136	“ He ca n’t be worse than Umbridge , can he ? ”
29664	29674	29611	29611	She	180	“ I know someone who ’s worse than Umbridge , ”
29694	29699	29682	29682	Ron	201	“ Hi , Harry . ”
29700	29707	29708	29708	Ron	201	“ What ’s up with you ? ”
29711	29716	29718	29718	Ginny	222	“ It ’s her , ”
29728	29735	29721	29721	herself	222	“ She ’s driving me mad . ”
29736	29743	29745	29745	Hermione	180	“ What ’s she done now ? ”
29748	29766	29745	29745	Hermione	180	“ It ’s the way she talks to me — you ’d think I was about three ! ”
29767	29771	29776	29776	her	180	“ I know , ”
29779	29787	29776	29776	her	180	“ She ’s so full of herself . ”
29809	29821	29804	29804	Ron	201	“ Ca n’t you two lay off her for five seconds ? ”
29822	29832	29834	29834	Ginny	222	“ Oh , that ’s right , defend her , ”
29836	29848	29834	29834	Ginny	222	“ We all know you ca n’t get enough of her . ”
29873	29879	29870	29870	Harry	136	“ Who are you — ? ”
29982	29986	29987	29987	she	1151	“ ’ Arry , ”
29994	30002	29987	29987	she	1151	“ Eet ’ as been too long ! ”
30027	30047	30012	30013	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ There was no need to bring up the tray , I was just about to do it myself ! ”
30048	30054	30056	30057	Fleur Delacour	224	“ Eet was no trouble , ”
30088	30124	30076	30076	He	136	“ I ’ ave been longing to see ’ i m. You remember my seester , Gabrielle ? She never stops talking about ’ Arry Potter . She will be delighted to see you again . ”
30125	30133	30134	30134	Harry	136	“ Oh ... is she here too ? ”
30137	30145	30147	30147	Fleur	224	“ No , no , silly boy , ”
30153	30168	30147	30147	Fleur	224	“ I mean next summer , when we — but do you not know ? ”
30185	30196	30175	30175	she	224	“ We had n’t got around to telling him yet . ”
30219	30229	30204	30204	her	224	“ Bill and I are going to be married ! ”
30230	30233	30235	30235	Harry	136	“ Oh , ”
30260	30267	30268	30268	She	224	“ Wow . Er — congratulations ! ”
30278	30361	30268	30268	She	224	“ Bill is very busy at ze moment , working very ’ ard , and I only work part - time at Gringotts for my Eenglish , so he brought me ’ ere for a few days to get to know ’ is family properly . I was so pleased to ’ ear you would be coming — zere is n’t much to do ’ ere , unless you like cooking and chickens ! Well — enjoy your breakfast , ’ Arry ! ”
30392	30395	30384	30385	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ tchah ! ”
30396	30401	30403	30403	Ginny	222	“ Mum hates her , ”
30406	30413	30415	30416	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I do not hate her ! ”
30422	30437	30415	30416	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I just think they ’ve hurried into this engagement , that ’s all ! ”
30438	30447	30449	30449	Ron	201	“ They ’ve known each other a year , ”
30463	30538	30449	30449	Ron	201	“ Well , that ’s not very long ! I know why it ’s happened , of course . It ’s all this uncertainty with You - Know - Who coming back , people think they might be dead tomorrow , so they ’re rushing all sorts of decisions they ’d normally take time over . It was the same last time he was powerful , people eloping left , right , and center — ”
30539	30545	30547	30547	Ginny	222	“ Including you and Dad , ”
30550	30572	30574	30575	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Yes , well , your father and I were made for each other , what was the point in waiting ? ”
30577	30611	30574	30575	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Whereas Bill and Fleur ... well ... what have they really got in common ? He ’s a hardworking , down - to - earth sort of person , whereas she ’s — ”
30612	30616	30618	30618	Ginny	222	“ A cow , ”
30622	30668	30618	30618	Ginny	222	“ But Bill ’s not that down - to - earth . He ’s a Curse - Breaker , is n’t he , he likes a bit of adventure , a bit of glamour ... I expect that ’s why he ’s gone for Phlegm . ”
30669	30677	30679	30680	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Stop calling her that , Ginny , ”
30689	30708	30712	30712	she	202	“ Well , I ’d better get on ... Eat your eggs while they ’re warm , Harry . ”
30742	30759	30760	30760	Harry	136	“ Do n’t you get used to her if she ’s staying in the same house ? ”
30763	30769	30771	30771	Ron	201	“ Well , you do , ”
30773	30786	30771	30771	Ron	201	“ but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly , like then ... ”
30787	30792	30794	30794	Hermione	180	“ It ’s pathetic , ”
30823	30833	30834	30834	Ginny	222	“ You do n’t really want her around forever ? ”
30847	30868	30844	30844	she	222	“ Well , Mum ’s going to put a stop to it if she can , I bet you anything . ”
30869	30878	30880	30880	Harry	136	“ How ’s she going to manage that ? ”
30882	30920	30844	30844	she	222	“ She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner . I think she ’s hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead . I hope he does , I ’d much rather have her in the family . ”
30921	30928	30930	30930	Ron	201	“ Yeah , that ’ll work , ”
30933	30976	30930	30930	Ron	201	“ Listen , no bloke in his right mind ’s going to fancy Tonks when Fleur ’s around . I mean , Tonks is okay - looking when she is n’t doing stupid things to her hair and her nose , but — ”
30977	30987	30989	30989	Ginny	222	“ She ’s a damn sight nicer than Phlegm , ”
30991	31003	31005	31005	Hermione	180	“ And she ’s more intelligent , she ’s an Auror ! ”
31010	31026	31028	31028	Harry	136	“ Fleur ’s not stupid , she was good enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament , ”
31030	31036	31038	31038	Hermione	180	“ Not you as well ! ”
31041	31058	31060	31060	Ginny	222	“ I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ‘ ’ Arry , ’ do you ? ”
31063	31066	31068	31068	Harry	136	“ No , ”
31076	31089	31071	31071	he	136	“ I was just saying , Phlegm — I mean , Fleur — ”
31090	31101	31103	31103	Ginny	222	“ I ’d much rather have Tonks in the family , ”
31105	31113	31103	31103	Ginny	222	“ At least she ’s a laugh . ”
31114	31125	31127	31127	Ron	201	“ She has n’t been much of a laugh lately , ”
31129	31144	31127	31127	Ron	201	“ Every time I ’ve seen her she ’s looked more like Moaning Myrtle . ”
31145	31151	31153	31153	Hermione	180	“ That ’s not fair , ”
31155	31176	31153	31153	Hermione	180	“ She still has n’t got over what happened ... you know ... I mean , he was her cousin ! ”
31216	31225	31227	31227	Ron	201	“ Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other ! ”
31229	31245	31227	31227	Ron	201	“ Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that their families never met — ”
31246	31253	31255	31255	Hermione	180	“ That ’s not the point , ”
31257	31267	31255	31255	Hermione	180	“ She thinks it was her fault he died ! ”
31268	31277	31279	31279	Harry	136	“ How does she work that one out ? ”
31286	31319	31279	31279	Harry	136	“ Well , she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange , was n’t she ? I think she feels that if only she had finished her off , Bellatrix could n’t have killed Sirius . ”
31320	31325	31327	31327	Ron	201	“ That ’s stupid , ”
31329	31336	31338	31338	Hermione	180	“ It ’s survivor ’s guilt , ”
31340	31367	31338	31338	Hermione	180	“ I know Lupin ’s tried to talk her round , but she ’s still really down . She ’s actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing ! ”
31368	31373	31279	31279	Harry	136	“ With her — ? ”
31374	31386	31388	31388	Hermione	180	“ She ca n’t change her appearance like she used to , ”
31390	31405	31388	31388	Hermione	180	“ I think her powers must have been affected by shock , or something . ”
31406	31415	31417	31417	Harry	136	“ I did n’t know that could happen , ”
31419	31424	31426	31426	Hermione	180	“ Nor did I , ”
31428	31438	31426	31426	Hermione	180	“ but I suppose if you ’re really depressed ... ”
31451	31454	31455	31455	she	202	“ Ginny , ”
31458	31468	31455	31455	she	202	“ come downstairs and help me with the lunch . ”
31469	31477	31479	31479	Ginny	222	“ I ’m talking to this lot ! ”
31483	31486	31488	31489	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Now ! ”
31494	31511	31513	31513	Ginny	222	“ She only wants me there so she does n’t have to be alone with Phlegm ! ”
31544	31554	31555	31555	she	222	“ You lot had better come down quickly too , ”
31615	31620	31595	31595	Ron	201	“ What ’s this ? ”
31634	31637	31639	31639	Ron	201	“ Dunno , ”
31641	31666	31639	31639	Ron	201	“ but if Fred and George’ve left it here , it ’s probably not ready for the joke shop yet , so be careful . ”
31667	31677	31679	31679	Harry	136	“ Your mum said the shop ’s going well , ”
31681	31694	31679	31679	Harry	136	“ Said Fred and George have got a real flair for business . ”
31695	31701	31703	31703	Ron	201	“ That ’s an understatement , ”
31705	31757	31703	31703	Ron	201	“ They ’re raking in the Galleons ! I ca n’t wait to see the place , we have n’t been to Diagon Alley yet , because Mum says Dad ’s got to be there for extra security and he ’s been really busy at work , but it sounds excellent . ”
31758	31764	31766	31766	Harry	136	“ And what about Percy ? ”
31784	31795	31801	31801	Ron	201	“ Is he talking to your mum and dad again ? ”
31796	31799	31801	31801	Ron	201	“ Nope , ”
31803	31819	31801	31801	Ron	201	“ But he knows your dad was right all along now about Voldemort being back — ”
31820	31838	31840	31840	Hermione	180	“ Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right , ”
31842	31852	31840	31840	Hermione	180	“ I heard him telling your mum , Ron . ”
31853	31865	31867	31867	Ron	201	“ Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore would say , ”
31869	31882	31884	31884	Harry	136	“ He ’s going to be giving me private lessons this year , ”
31899	31905	31907	31907	Ron	201	“ You kept that quiet ! ”
31909	31915	31917	31917	Harry	136	“ I only just remembered , ”
31920	31931	31917	31917	Harry	136	“ He told me last night in your broom shed . ”
31932	31940	31942	31942	Ron	201	“ Blimey ... private lessons with Dumbledore ! ”
31947	31955	31956	31956	His	201	“ I wonder why he ’s ... ? ”
32026	32053	32006	32006	his	136	“ I do n’t know exactly why he ’s going to be giving me lessons , but I think it must be because of the prophecy . ”
32078	32093	32069	32069	He	136	“ You know , the one they were trying to steal at the Ministry . ”
32094	32103	32105	32105	Hermione	180	“ Nobody knows what it said , though , ”
32108	32113	32105	32105	Hermione	180	“ It got smashed . ”
32114	32120	32122	32122	Ron	201	“ Although the Prophet says — ”
32128	32131	32125	32125	Hermione	180	“ Shh ! ”
32132	32140	32142	32142	Harry	136	“ The Prophet ’s got it right , ”
32161	32207	32208	32208	Harry	136	“ That glass ball that smashed was n’t the only record of the prophecy . I heard the whole thing in Dumbledore ’s office , he was the one the prophecy was made to , so he could tell me . From what it said , ”
32214	32245	32208	32208	Harry	136	“ it looks like I ’m the one who ’s got to finish off Voldemort ... At least , it said neither of us could live while the other survives . ”
32276	32279	32281	32281	Harry	136	“ Hermione ! ”
32317	32328	32329	32329	she	180	“ I squeezed it and it — it punched me ! ”
32354	32359	32361	32361	Ron	201	“ Do n’t worry , ”
32371	32384	32361	32361	Ron	201	“ Mum’ll fix that , she ’s good at healing minor injuries — ”
32385	32394	32396	32396	Hermione	180	“ Oh well , never mind that now ! ”
32399	32406	32396	32396	Hermione	180	“ Harry , oh , Harry ... ”
32418	32475	32407	32407	She	180	“ We wondered , after we got back from the Ministry ... Obviously , we did n’t want to say anything to you , but from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy , how it was about you and Voldemort , well , we thought it might be something like this ... Oh , Harry ... ”
32484	32489	32476	32476	She	180	“ Are you scared ? ”
32490	32498	32500	32500	Harry	136	“ Not as much as I was , ”
32502	32532	32500	32500	Harry	136	“ When I first heard it , I was ... but now , it seems as though I always knew I ’d have to face him in the end ... ”
32533	32562	32564	32564	Ron	201	“ When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in person , we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy , ”
32567	32609	32564	32564	Ron	201	“ And we were kind of right , were n’t we ? He would n’t be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner , would n’t waste his time — he must think you ’ve got a chance ! ”
32610	32615	32617	32617	Hermione	180	“ That ’s true , ”
32619	32644	32617	32617	Hermione	180	“ I wonder what he ’ll teach you , Harry ? Really advanced defensive magic , probably ... powerful countercurses ... anti - jinxes ... ”
32735	32744	32746	32746	Hermione	180	“ . . . and evasive enchantments generally , ”
32748	32782	32746	32746	Hermione	180	“ Well , at least you know one lesson you ’ll be having this year , that ’s one more than Ron and me . I wonder when our O.W.L. results will come ? ”
32783	32796	32798	32798	Ron	201	“ Ca n’t be long now , it ’s been a month , ”
32800	32804	32806	32806	Harry	136	“ Hang on , ”
32821	32834	32806	32806	Harry	136	“ I think Dumbledore said our O.W.L. results would be arriving today ! ”
32835	32838	32840	32840	Hermione	180	“ Today ? ”
32842	32860	32861	32861	She	180	“ Today ? But why did n’t you — oh my God — you should have said — ”
32867	32879	32861	32861	She	180	“ I ’m going to see whether any owls have come ... ”
32925	32932	32913	32914	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ It just wo n’t budge , ”
32958	32966	32933	32934	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Bruises , Cuts , and Abrasions . ”
32967	32981	32933	32934	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ This has always worked before , I just ca n’t understand it . ”
32982	33004	33006	33006	Ginny	222	“ It ’ll be Fred and George ’s idea of a funny joke , making sure it ca n’t come off , ”
33008	33017	33019	33019	Hermione	180	“ But it ’s got to come off ! ”
33021	33032	33019	33019	Hermione	180	“ I ca n’t go around looking like this forever ! ”
33033	33050	33052	33053	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ You wo n’t , dear , we ’ll find an antidote , do n’t worry , ”
33056	33069	33071	33071	Fleur	224	“ Bill told me ’ ow Fred and George are very amusing ! ”
33076	33086	33088	33088	Hermione	180	“ Yes , I can hardly breathe for laughing , ”
33107	33124	33090	33090	She	180	“ Mrs. Weasley , you ’re quite , quite sure no owls have arrived this morning ? ”
33125	33135	33137	33138	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Yes , dear , I ’d have noticed , ”
33141	33155	33137	33138	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ But it ’s barely nine , there ’s still plenty of time ... ”
33156	33165	33167	33167	Hermione	180	“ I know I messed up Ancient Runes , ”
33170	33208	33167	33167	Hermione	180	“ I definitely made at least one serious mistranslation . And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all . I thought Transfiguration went all right at the time , but looking back — ”
33209	33227	33229	33229	Ron	201	“ Hermione , will you shut up , you ’re not the only one who ’s nervous ! ”
33231	33244	33229	33229	Ron	201	“ And when you ’ve got your ten ‘ Outstanding ’ O.W.L.s ... ”
33245	33255	33260	33260	her	180	“ Do n’t , do n’t , do n’t ! ”
33264	33272	33260	33260	her	180	“ I know I ’ve failed everything ! ”
33273	33280	33281	33281	Harry	136	“ What happens if we fail ? ”
33296	33318	33292	33292	Hermione	180	“ We discuss our options with our Head of House , I asked Professor McGonagall at the end of last term . ”
33332	33336	33338	33338	Fleur	224	“ At Beauxbatons , ”
33341	33374	33338	33338	Fleur	224	“ we ’ ad a different way of doing things . I think eet was better . We sat our examinations after six years of study , not five , and then — ”
33408	33414	33416	33416	Ron	201	“ They ’re definitely owls , ”
33428	33436	33438	33438	Harry	136	“ And there are three of them , ”
33446	33453	33455	33455	Hermione	180	“ One for each of us , ”
33461	33471	33472	33472	She	180	“ Oh no ... oh no ... oh no ... ”
33523	33527	33529	33529	Hermione	180	“ Oh no ! ”
33752	33754	33762	33762	He	136	“ Outstanding ”
33783	33798	33799	33799	he	136	“ Only failed Divination and History of Magic , and who cares about them ? ”
33805	33810	33799	33799	he	136	“ Here — swap — ”

33826	33839	33841	33841	Ron	201	“ Knew you ’d be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts , ”
33849	33860	33841	33841	Ron	201	“ We ’ve done all right , have n’t we ? ”
33861	33865	33867	33868	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Well done ! ”
33876	33890	33867	33868	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Seven O.W.L.s , that ’s more than Fred and George got together ! ”

33952	33972	33973	33973	He	201	“ Yep — nine ‘ Outstandings ’ and one ‘ Exceeds Expectations ’ at Defense Against the Dark Arts . ”
33987	33997	33973	33973	He	201	“ You ’re actually disappointed , are n’t you ? ”
34007	34016	34004	34004	Harry	136	“ Well , we ’re N.E.W.T. students now ! ”
34020	34029	34018	34018	Ron	201	“ Mum , are there any more sausages ? ”
34394	34404	34405	34405	he	211	“ There have been another couple of dementor attacks , ”
34420	34482	34409	34410	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ And they ’ve found Igor Karkaroff ’s body in a shack up north . The Dark Mark had been set over it — well , frankly , I ’m surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death Eaters ; Sirius ’s brother , Regulus , only managed a few days as far as I can remember . ”
34483	34488	34490	34491	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Yes , well , ”
34495	34504	34490	34491	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ perhaps we should talk about something diff — ”
34505	34515	34517	34517	Bill	226	“ Did you hear about Florean Fortescue , Remus ? ”
34528	34534	34526	34526	Fleur	224	“ The man who ran — ”
34535	34546	34547	34547	Harry	136	“ — the ice - cream place in Diagon Alley ? ”
34563	34579	34547	34547	Harry	136	“ He used to give me free ice creams . What ’s happened to him ? ”
34580	34591	34526	34526	Fleur	224	“ Dragged off , by the look of his place . ”
34592	34595	34597	34597	Ron	201	“ Why ? ”
34607	34626	34600	34601	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Who knows ? He must ’ve upset them somehow . He was a good man , Florean . ”
34627	34633	34635	34636	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Talking of Diagon Alley , ”
34638	34646	34635	34636	Mr. Weasley	204	“ looks like Ollivander ’s gone too . ”
34647	34651	34653	34653	Ginny	222	“ The wandmaker ? ”
34658	34685	34653	34653	Ginny	222	“ That ’s the one . Shop ’s empty . No sign of a struggle . No one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped . ”
34686	34697	34600	34601	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ But wands — what ’ll people do for wands ? ”
34698	34707	34709	34709	Lupin	211	“ They ’ll make do with other makers , ”
34711	34734	34709	34709	Lupin	211	“ But Ollivander was the best , and if the other side have got him it ’s not so good for us . ”
34765	34774	34776	34776	Hermione	180	“ That gives you equal status with prefects ! ”
34779	34790	34776	34776	Hermione	180	“ You can use our special bathroom now and everything ! ”
34791	34803	34805	34805	Ron	201	“ Wow , I remember when Charlie wore one of these , ”
34813	34841	34805	34805	Ron	201	“ Harry , this is so cool , you ’re my Captain — if you let me back on the team , I suppose , ha ha ... ”
34842	34866	34868	34869	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Well , I do n’t suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer now you ’ve got these , ”
34877	34905	34868	34869	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ We ’ll go on Saturday as long as your father does n’t have to go into work again . I ’m not going there without him . ”
34906	34930	34932	34932	Ron	201	“ Mum , d’you honestly think You - Know - Who ’s going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts ? ”
34934	34945	34947	34948	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Fortescue and Ollivander went on holiday , did they ? ”
34955	34976	34947	34948	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ If you think security ’s a laughing matter you can stay behind and I ’ll get your things myself — ”
34977	34994	34996	34996	Ron	201	“ No , I wanna come , I want to see Fred and George ’s shop ! ”
34999	35023	35025	35026	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Then you just buck up your ideas , young man , before I decide you ’re too immature to come with us ! ”
35043	35047	35025	35026	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ mortal peril , ”
35062	35073	35074	35074	Ron	201	“ And that goes for returning to Hogwarts as well ! ”
35102	35116	35093	35093	her	202	“ Blimey ... you ca n’t even make a joke round here anymore ... ”
35182	35187	35189	35189	Ron	201	“ Where ’s mine ? ”
35197	35206	35208	35208	Bill	226	“ That ’s already Harry ’s , idiot , ”
35210	35273	35208	35208	Bill	226	“ I got it out of your vault for you , Harry , because it ’s taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment , the goblins have tightened security so much . Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity Probe stuck up his ... Well , trust me , this way ’s easier . ”
35274	35279	35281	35281	Harry	136	“ Thanks , Bill , ”
35287	35295	35297	35297	Fleur	224	“ ’ E is always so thoughtful , ”
35372	35383	35385	35385	Ron	201	“ It ’s good Dad can get us these again , ”
35428	35443	35448	35448	his	204	“ Do n’t get used to it , it ’s only because of Harry , ”
35479	35505	35506	35506	Harry	136	“ He ’s been given top - grade security status . And we ’ll be joining up with additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too . ”
35577	35584	35586	35587	the driver	1203	“ Here you are , then , ”
35614	35630	35586	35587	the driver	1203	“ I ’m to wait for you , any idea how long you ’ll be ? ”
35631	35640	35642	35643	Mr. Weasley	204	“ A couple of hours , I expect , ”
35645	35654	35642	35643	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Ah , good , he ’s here ! ”
35719	35722	35723	35723	he	1203	“ Harry ! ”
35744	35771	35723	35723	he	1203	“ Buckbeak — Witherwings , I mean — yeh should see him , Harry , he ’s so happy ter be back in the open air — ”
35772	35778	35780	35780	Harry	136	“ Glad he ’s pleased , ”
35789	35800	35784	35784	he	136	“ We did n’t know ‘ security ’ meant you ! ”
35801	35833	35835	35835	Hagrid	177	“ I know , jus ’ like old times , innit ? See , the Ministry wanted ter send a bunch o ’ Aurors , but Dumbledore said I ’d do , ”
35850	35864	35835	35835	Hagrid	177	“ Let ’s get goin’ then — after yeh , Molly , Arthur — ”
35915	35935	35911	35911	Hagrid	177	“ Jus ’ passin ’ through today , Tom , sure yeh understand , Hogwarts business , yeh know . ”
36202	36211	36212	36212	he	1222	“ One for your little girl , madam ? ”
36225	36231	36212	36212	he	1222	“ Protect her pretty neck ? ”
36232	36239	36241	36242	Mr. Weasley	204	“ If I were on duty ... ”
36251	36270	36272	36273	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Yes , but do n’t go arresting anyone now , dear , we ’re in a hurry , ”
36280	36332	36272	36273	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I think we ’d better do Madam Malkin ’s first , Hermione wants new dress robes , and Ron ’s showing much too much ankle in his school robes , and you must need new ones too , Harry , you ’ve grown so much — come on , everyone — ”
36333	36352	36354	36355	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Molly , it does n’t make sense for all of us to go to Madam Malkin ’s , ”
36357	36381	36354	36355	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Why do n’t those three go with Hagrid , and we can go to Flourish and Blotts and get everyone ’s schoolbooks ? ”
36382	36388	36390	36391	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ I do n’t know , ”
36414	36422	36354	36355	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Hagrid , do you think — ? ”
36423	36437	36439	36439	Hagrid	177	“ Don ’ fret , they ’ll be fine with me , Molly , ”
36547	36563	36565	36565	Hagrid	177	“ Migh ’ be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us , ”
36581	36591	36565	36565	Hagrid	177	“ I ’ll stand guard outside , all right ? ”
36646	36673	36687	36688	Madam Malkin	246	“ . . . not a child , in case you have n’t noticed , Mother . I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone . ”
36695	36730	36687	36688	Madam Malkin	246	“ Now , dear , your mother ’s quite right , none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore , it ’s nothing to do with being a child — ”
36731	36743	36687	36688	Madam Malkin	246	“ Watch where you ’re sticking that pin , will you ! ”
36820	36838	36840	36841	Draco Malfoy	159	“ If you ’re wondering what the smell is , Mother , a Mudblood just walked in , ”
36843	36857	36859	36860	Madam Malkin	246	“ I do n’t think there ’s any need for language like that ! ”
36877	36890	36891	36891	she	246	“ And I do n’t want wands drawn in my shop either ! ”
36930	36944	36919	36919	Hermione	180	“ No , do n’t , honestly , it ’s not worth it ... ”
36945	36958	36960	36960	Malfoy	159	“ Yeah , like you ’d dare do magic out of school , ”
36962	36977	36960	36960	Malfoy	159	“ Who blacked your eye , Granger ? I want to send them flowers . ”
36978	36984	36986	36987	Madam Malkin	246	“ That ’s quite enough ! ”
36997	37002	36986	36987	Madam Malkin	246	“ Madam — please — ”
37013	37018	37019	37019	she	144	“ Put those away , ”
37027	37048	37019	37019	she	144	“ If you attack my son again , I shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do . ”
37049	37052	37054	37054	Harry	136	“ Really ? ”
37089	37106	37080	37080	He	136	“ Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in , are you ? ”
37116	37134	37107	37108	Madam Malkin	246	“ Really , you should n’t accuse — dangerous thing to say — wands away , please ! ”
37148	37179	37143	37144	Narcissa Malfoy	144	“ I see that being Dumbledore ’s favorite has given you a false sense of security , Harry Potter . But Dumbledore wo n’t always be there to protect you . ”
37188	37227	37180	37180	Harry	136	“ Wow ... look at that ... he ’s not here now ! So why not have a go ? They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband ! ”
37247	37261	37262	37262	Malfoy	144	“ Do n’t you dare talk to my mother like that , Potter ! ”
37265	37273	37275	37275	Narcissa	144	“ It ’s all right , Draco , ”
37288	37305	37280	37280	her	144	“ I expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius . ”
37312	37317	37319	37319	Hermione	180	“ Harry , no ! ”
37334	37348	37319	37319	Hermione	180	“ Think ... You must n’t ... You ’ll be in such trouble ... ”
37390	37410	37378	37378	She	246	“ I think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more , dear , let me just — ”
37411	37414	37416	37416	Malfoy	159	“ Ouch ! ”
37423	37445	37446	37446	He	159	“ Watch where you ’re putting your pins , woman ! Mother — I do n’t think I want these anymore — ”
37465	37472	37474	37474	Narcissa	144	“ You ’re right , Draco , ”
37483	37505	37474	37474	Narcissa	144	“ now I know the kind of scum that shops here ... We ’ll do better at Twilfitt and Tatting ’s . ”
37537	37542	37544	37545	Madam Malkin	246	“ Well , really ! ”
37628	37632	37634	37634	Hagrid	177	“ Got ev’rything ? ”
37643	37647	37649	37649	Harry	136	“ Just about , ”
37651	37658	37649	37649	Harry	136	“ Did you see the Malfoys ? ”
37659	37662	37664	37664	Hagrid	177	“ Yeah , ”
37668	37694	37664	37664	Hagrid	177	“ Bu ’ they wouldn ’ dare make trouble in the middle o ’ Diagon Alley , Harry . Don ’ worry abou ’ them . ”
37730	37735	37737	37738	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Everyone all right ? ”
37740	37771	37737	37738	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Got your robes ? Right then , we can pop in at the Apothecary and Eeylops on the way to Fred and George ’s — stick close , now ... ”
37845	37854	37855	37856	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ We really have n’t got too long , ”
37859	37892	37855	37856	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ So we ’ll just have a quick look around and then back to the car . We must be close , that ’s number ninety - two ... ninety - four ... ”
37893	37896	37898	37898	Ron	201	“ Whoa , ”
38090	38097	38082	38082	Her	202	“ U - No - Poo . ”
38098	38107	38108	38108	she	202	“ They ’ll be murdered in their beds ! ”
38111	38117	38119	38119	Ron	201	“ No they wo n’t ! ”
38129	38134	38119	38119	Ron	201	“ This is brilliant ! ”
38331	38338	38339	38339	Hermione	180	“ ‘ Patented Daydream Charms ... ’ ”
38387	38443	38445	38445	Hermione	180	“ ‘ One simple incantation and you will enter a top - quality , highly realistic , thirty - minute daydream , easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable ( side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling ) . Not for sale to under - sixteens . ’ You know , ”
38452	38459	38445	38445	Hermione	180	“ that really is extraordinary magic ! ”
38460	38466	38482	38484	A beaming Fred	217	“ For that , Hermione , ”
38473	38481	38482	38484	A beaming Fred	217	“ you can have one for free . ”
38503	38510	38482	38484	A beaming Fred	217	“ How are you , Harry ? ”
38515	38526	38482	38484	A beaming Fred	217	“ And what ’s happened to your eye , Hermione ? ”
38527	38532	38533	38533	she	180	“ Your punching telescope , ”
38537	38546	38548	38548	Fred	217	“ Oh blimey , I forgot about those , ”
38550	38553	38554	38554	He	1269	“ Here — ”
38579	38593	38595	38595	Fred	217	“ Just dab it on , that bruise’ll be gone within the hour , ”
38597	38617	38595	38595	Fred	217	“ We had to find a decent bruise remover . We ’re testing most of our products on ourselves . ”
38622	38631	38632	38632	she	180	“ It is safe , is n’t it ? ”
38635	38641	38643	38643	Fred	217	“ ’ Course it is , ”
38646	38659	38643	38643	Fred	217	“ Come on , Harry , I ’ll give you a tour . ”
38690	38695	38697	38697	Fred	217	“ Muggle magic tricks ! ”
38704	38743	38697	38697	Fred	217	“ For freaks like Dad , you know , who love Muggle stuff . It ’s not a big earner , but we do fairly steady business , they ’re great novelties ... Oh , here ’s George ... ”
38753	38790	38791	38791	he	1271	“ Giving him the tour ? Come through the back , Harry , that ’s where we ’re making the real money — pocket anything , you , and you ’ll pay in more than Galleons ! ”
38848	38858	38860	38860	Fred	217	“ We ’ve just developed this more serious line , ”
38862	38868	38860	38860	Fred	217	“ Funny how it happened ... ”
38869	38894	38896	38896	George	218	“ You would n’t believe how many people , even people who work at the Ministry , ca n’t do a decent Shield Charm , ”
38898	38912	38896	38896	George	218	“ ’ Course , they did n’t have you teaching them , Harry . ”
38913	38974	38860	38860	Fred	217	“ That ’s right ... Well , we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh , you know , challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off . But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff ! And we ’re still getting massive orders ! ”
38975	38990	38860	38860	Fred	217	“ So we ’ve expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks , Shield Gloves ... ”
38991	39017	38896	38896	George	218	“ . . . I mean , they would n’t help much against the Unforgivable Curses , but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes ... ”
39018	39045	39047	39047	George	218	“ And then we thought we ’d get into the whole area of Defense Against the Dark Arts , because it ’s such a money spinner , ”
39050	39078	39047	39047	George	218	“ This is cool . Look , Instant Darkness Powder , we ’re importing it from Peru . Handy if you want to make a quick escape . ”
39079	39093	39095	39095	Fred	217	“ And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves , look , ”
39120	39150	39095	39095	Fred	217	“ You just drop one surreptitiously and it ’ll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight , giving you a diversion if you need one . ”
39151	39154	39156	39156	Harry	136	“ Handy , ”
39160	39163	39165	39165	George	218	“ Here , ”
39201	39220	39221	39221	she	1276	“ There ’s a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron , Mr. Weasley and Mr. Weasley , ”
39235	39239	39231	39231	Fred	217	“ Mr. Weasley , ”
39248	39259	39261	39261	George	218	“ Right you are , Verity , I ’m coming , ”
39264	39281	39261	39261	George	218	“ Harry , you help yourself to anything you want , all right ? No charge . ”
39282	39289	39291	39291	Harry	136	“ I ca n’t do that ! ”
39308	39315	39317	39317	Fred	217	“ You do n’t pay here , ”
39326	39329	39317	39317	Fred	217	“ But — ”
39330	39345	39347	39347	George	218	“ You gave us our start - up loan , we have n’t forgotten , ”
39350	39371	39347	39347	George	218	“ Take whatever you like , and just remember to tell people where you got it , if they ask . ”
39409	39421	39423	39423	Fred	217	“ Have n’t you girls found our special WonderWitch products yet ? ”
39425	39431	39423	39423	Fred	217	“ Follow me , ladies ... ”
39463	39468	39470	39470	Fred	217	“ There you go , ”
39473	39484	39470	39470	Fred	217	“ Best range of love potions you ’ll find anywhere . ”
39491	39496	39497	39497	she	222	“ Do they work ? ”
39500	39525	39497	39497	she	222	“ Certainly they work , for up to twenty - four hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question — ”
39526	39535	39537	39537	George	218	“ — and the attractiveness of the girl , ”
39545	39556	39557	39557	he	1283	“ But we ’re not selling them to our sister , ”
39564	39582	39557	39557	he	1283	“ not when she ’s already got about five boys on the go from what we ’ve — ”
39583	39596	39598	39598	Ginny	222	“ Whatever you ’ve heard from Ron is a big fat lie , ”
39613	39618	39598	39598	Ginny	222	“ What ’s this ? ”
39619	39627	39629	39629	Fred	217	“ Guaranteed ten - second pimple vanisher , ”
39631	39663	39629	39629	Fred	217	“ Excellent on everything from boils to blackheads , but do n’t change the subject . Are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called Dean Thomas ? ”
39664	39670	39672	39672	Ginny	222	“ Yes , I am , ”
39674	39694	39672	39672	Ginny	222	“ And last time I looked , he was definitely one boy , not five . What are those ? ”
39728	39732	39734	39734	George	218	“ Pygmy Puffs , ”
39736	39754	39734	39734	George	218	“ Miniature puffskeins , we ca n’t breed them fast enough . So what about Michael Corner ? ”
39755	39766	39768	39768	Ginny	222	“ I dumped him , he was a bad loser , ”
39788	39794	39734	39734	George	218	“ They ’re really cute ! ”
39795	39803	39805	39805	Fred	217	“ They ’re fairly cuddly , yes , ”
39807	39822	39805	39805	Fred	217	“ But you ’re moving through boyfriends a bit fast , are n’t you ? ”
39857	39871	39872	39872	she	222	“ It ’s none of your business . And I ’ll thank you , ”
39891	39902	39872	39872	she	222	“ not to tell tales about me to these two ! ”
39903	39916	39918	39918	Fred	217	“ That ’s three Galleons , nine Sickles , and a Knut , ”
39929	39933	39918	39918	Fred	217	“ Cough up . ”
39934	39940	39872	39872	she	222	“ I ’m your brother ! ”
39941	39964	39872	39872	she	222	“ And that ’s our stuff you ’re nicking . Three Galleons , nine Sickles . I ’ll knock off the Knut . ”
39965	39977	39918	39918	Fred	217	“ But I have n’t got three Galleons , nine Sickles ! ”
39978	39997	39998	39998	Ron	201	“ You ’d better put it back then , and mind you put it on the right shelves . ”
40029	40044	40045	40045	she	202	“ If I see you do that again I ’ll jinx your fingers together , ”
40049	40059	40061	40061	Ginny	222	“ Mum , can I have a Pygmy Puff ? ”
40065	40069	40071	40072	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ A what ? ”
40075	40083	40071	40072	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Look , they ’re so sweet ... ”
40153	40160	40162	40162	Harry	136	“ Wonder where his mummy is ? ”
40166	40177	40179	40179	Ron	201	“ Given her the slip by the looks of it , ”
40181	40186	40188	40188	Hermione	180	“ Why , though ? ”
40305	40312	40314	40314	Harry	136	“ Get under here , quick , ”
40325	40335	40337	40337	Hermione	180	“ Oh — I do n’t know , Harry , ”
40345	40349	40351	40351	Ron	201	“ Come on ! ”
40425	40433	40435	40435	Harry	136	“ He was going in that direction , ”
40451	40455	40435	40435	Harry	136	“ C’m on . ”
40476	40485	40486	40486	she	180	“ That ’s him , is n’t it ? ”
40489	40493	40486	40486	she	180	“ Turning left ? ”
40494	40498	40500	40500	Ron	201	“ Big surprise , ”
40518	40527	40529	40529	Harry	136	“ Quick , or we ’ll lose him , ”
40534	40540	40542	40542	Hermione	180	“ Our feet’ll be seen ! ”
40570	40576	40578	40578	Harry	136	“ It does n’t matter , ”
40581	40585	40578	40578	Harry	136	“ Just hurry ! ”
40662	40665	40677	40677	she	180	“ Ouch ! ”
40666	40676	40677	40677	she	180	“ Shh ! Look ! He ’s in there ! ”
40805	40816	40818	40818	Hermione	180	“ If only we could hear what they ’re saying ! ”
40820	40824	40826	40826	Ron	201	“ We can ! ”
40829	40835	40836	40836	He	201	“ Hang on — damn — ”
40855	40861	40836	40836	He	201	“ Extendable Ears , look ! ”
40862	40865	40867	40867	Hermione	180	“ Fantastic ! ”
40891	40902	40870	40870	Ron	201	“ Oh , I hope the door is n’t Imperturbable — ”
40903	40906	40908	40908	Ron	201	“ No ! ”
40911	40914	40908	40908	Ron	201	“ Listen ! ”
40951	40962	40932	40932	Malfoy	159	“ . . . you know how to fix it ? ”
40963	40966	40968	40968	Borgin	256	“ Possibly , ”
40982	41002	40968	40968	Borgin	256	“ I ’ll need to see it , though . Why do n’t you bring it into the shop ? ”
41003	41008	41010	41010	Malfoy	159	“ I ca n’t , ”
41012	41032	41010	41010	Malfoy	159	“ It ’s got to stay put . I just need you to tell me how to do it . ”
41041	41068	41037	41037	his	256	“ Well , without seeing it , I must say it will be a very difficult job , perhaps impossible . I could n’t guarantee anything . ”
41069	41072	41074	41074	Malfoy	159	“ No ? ”
41090	41099	41100	41100	He	136	“ Perhaps this will make you more confident . ”
41141	41145	41147	41147	Malfoy	159	“ Tell anyone , ”
41149	41188	41147	41147	Malfoy	159	“ and there will be retribution . You know Fenrir Greyback ? He ’s a family friend . He ’ll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you ’re giving the problem your full attention . ”
41189	41197	41135	41135	Borgin	256	“ There will be no need for — ”
41198	41204	41206	41206	Malfoy	159	“ I ’ll decide that , ”
41208	41232	41206	41206	Malfoy	159	“ Well , I ’d better be off . And do n’t forget to keep that one safe , I ’ll need it . ”
41233	41243	41135	41135	Borgin	256	“ Perhaps you ’d like to take it now ? ”
41244	41274	41135	41135	Borgin	256	“ No , of course I would n’t , you stupid little man , how would I look carrying that down the street ? Just do n’t sell it . ”
41275	41282	41283	41283	Borgin	256	“ Of course not ... sir . ”
41301	41318	41296	41296	him	256	“ Not a word to anyone , Borgin , and that includes my mother , understand ? ”
41319	41324	41326	41326	Borgin	256	“ Naturally , naturally , ”
41394	41400	41402	41402	Ron	201	“ What was that about ? ”
41410	41413	41415	41415	Harry	136	“ Dunno , ”
41420	41450	41415	41415	Harry	136	“ He wants something mended ... and he wants to reserve something in there ... Could you see what he pointed at when he said ‘ that one ’ ? ”
41451	41460	41479	41479	Hermione	180	“ No , he was behind that cabinet — ”
41461	41467	41469	41469	Hermione	180	“ You two stay here , ”
41471	41477	41469	41469	Hermione	180	“ What are you — ? ”
41531	41541	41542	41542	Hermione	180	“ Hello , horrible morning , is n’t it ? ”
41573	41580	41581	41581	she	180	“ Is this necklace for sale ? ”
41592	41604	41606	41607	Mr. Borgin	256	“ If you ’ve got one and a half thousand Galleons , ”
41610	41625	41627	41627	Hermione	180	“ Oh — er — no , I have n’t got quite that much , ”
41632	41644	41627	41627	Hermione	180	“ And ... what about this lovely — um — skull ? ”
41645	41649	41669	41670	Mr. Borgin	256	“ Sixteen Galleons . ”
41650	41668	41669	41670	Mr. Borgin	256	“ So it ’s for sale , then ? It is n’t being ... kept for anyone ? ”
41706	41769	41698	41698	she	180	“ The thing is , that — er — boy who was in here just now , Draco Malfoy , well , he ’s a friend of mine , and I want to get him a birthday present , but if he ’s already reserved anything , I obviously do n’t want to get him the same thing , so ... um ... ”
41788	41791	41792	41792	he	256	“ Out , ”
41796	41800	41792	41792	he	256	“ Get out ! ”
41840	41844	41846	41846	Ron	201	“ Ah well , ”
41855	41867	41846	41846	Ron	201	“ Worth a try , but you were a bit obvious — ”
41868	41886	41887	41887	she	180	“ Well , next time you can show me how it ’s done , Master of Mystery ! ”
42085	42098	42100	42100	Hermione	180	“ Yes , I ’ve already agreed it was fishy , Harry , ”
42142	42156	42105	42105	She	180	“ But have n’t we agreed there could be a lot of explanations ? ”
42157	42167	42169	42169	Ron	201	“ Maybe he ’s broken his Hand of Glory , ”
42184	42194	42169	42169	Ron	201	“ Remember that shriveled - up arm Malfoy had ? ”
42195	42214	42216	42216	Harry	136	“ But what about when he said , ‘ Do n’t forget to keep that one safe ’ ? ”
42222	42243	42216	42216	Harry	136	“ That sounded to me like Borgin ’s got another one of the broken objects , and Malfoy wants both . ”
42244	42248	42250	42250	Ron	201	“ You reckon ? ”
42263	42269	42271	42271	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I do , ”
42283	42299	42280	42280	he	201	“ Malfoy ’s father ’s in Azkaban . Do n’t you think Malfoy’d like revenge ? ”
42306	42318	42300	42300	Ron	201	“ Malfoy , revenge ? What can he do about it ? ”
42319	42330	42332	42332	Harry	136	“ That ’s my point , I do n’t know ! ”
42336	42360	42332	42332	Harry	136	“ But he ’s up to something and I think we should take it seriously . His father ’s a Death Eater and — ”
42387	42390	42392	42392	Hermione	180	“ Harry ? ”
42398	42403	42392	42392	Hermione	180	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
42404	42415	42417	42417	Ron	201	“ Your scar ’s not hurting again , is it ? ”
42420	42427	42429	42429	Harry	136	“ He ’s a Death Eater , ”
42432	42443	42429	42429	Harry	136	“ He ’s replaced his father as a Death Eater ! ”
42455	42476	42450	42450	Ron	201	“ Malfoy ? He ’s sixteen , Harry ! You think You - Know - Who would let Malfoy join ? ”
42477	42485	42487	42487	Hermione	180	“ It seems very unlikely , Harry , ”
42495	42502	42487	42487	Hermione	180	“ What makes you think — ? ”
42503	42549	42550	42550	Ron	201	“ In Madam Malkin ’s . She did n’t touch him , but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve . It was his left arm . He ’s been branded with the Dark Mark . ”
42558	42561	42563	42563	Ron	201	“ Well ... ”
42569	42583	42585	42585	Hermione	180	“ I think he just wanted to get out of there , Harry , ”
42587	42597	42598	42598	Harry	136	“ He showed Borgin something we could n’t see , ”
42603	42637	42638	42638	Ron	201	“ Something that seriously scared Borgin . It was the Mark , I know it — he was showing Borgin who he was dealing with , you saw how seriously Borgin took him ! ”
42645	42653	42638	42638	Ron	201	“ I ’m not sure , Harry ... ”
42654	42672	42678	42678	he	136	“ Yeah , I still do n’t reckon You - Know - Who would let Malfoy join ... ”
42738	42749	42750	42750	she	222	“ I would n’t go in the kitchen just now , ”
42754	42763	42750	42750	she	222	“ There ’s a lot of Phlegm around . ”
42764	42775	42776	42776	Harry	136	“ I ’ll be careful not to slip in it . ”
42828	42876	42810	42811	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ . . . Bill and I ’ ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids , Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer . I am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold — pink would of course be ’ orrible with Ginny ’s ’ air — ”
42877	42882	42884	42885	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Ah , Harry ! ”
42894	42929	42884	42885	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Good , I wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to Hogwarts tomorrow . We ’ve got Ministry cars again , and there will be Aurors waiting at the station — ”
42930	42938	42940	42940	Harry	136	“ Is Tonks going to be there ? ”
42948	42968	42940	42940	Harry	136	“ No , I do n’t think so , she ’s been stationed somewhere else from what Arthur said . ”
42969	42980	42981	42981	Fleur	224	“ She has let ’ erself go , zat Tonks , ”
42996	43004	42981	42981	Fleur	224	“ A big mistake if you ask — ”
43005	43011	43013	43014	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Yes , thank you , ”
43022	43053	43013	43014	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ You ’d better get on , Harry , I want the trunks ready tonight , if possible , so we do n’t have the usual last - minute scramble . ”
43122	43129	43131	43131	Fleur	224	“ Au revoir , ’ Arry , ”
43236	43245	43247	43248	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Quick , quick , through the barrier , ”
43260	43269	43270	43270	She	202	“ Harry had better go first , with — ”
43303	43310	43312	43312	Harry	136	“ I can walk , thanks , ”
43407	43414	43416	43416	Hermione	180	“ We ca n’t , Harry , ”
43421	43444	43416	43416	Hermione	180	“ Ron and I ’ve got to go to the prefects ’ carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit . ”
43445	43452	43454	43454	Harry	136	“ Oh yeah , I forgot , ”
43456	43480	43482	43483	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ You ’d better get straight on the train , all of you , you ’ve only got a few minutes to go , ”
43489	43499	43486	43486	her	202	“ Well , have a lovely term , Ron ... ”
43500	43511	43513	43513	Harry	136	“ Mr. Weasley , can I have a quick word ? ”
43526	43530	43532	43533	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Of course , ”
43641	43649	43650	43650	Harry	136	“ When we were in Diagon Alley , ”
43662	43694	43654	43655	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Am I about to discover where you , Ron , and Hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred and George ’s shop ? ”
43695	43701	43654	43655	Mr. Weasley	204	“ How did you — ? ”
43702	43719	43654	43655	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Harry , please . You ’re talking to the man who raised Fred and George . ”
43720	43736	43654	43655	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Er ... yeah , all right , we were n’t in the back room . ”
43737	43749	43654	43655	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Very well , then , let ’s hear the worst . ”
43750	43764	43654	43655	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Well , we followed Draco Malfoy . We used my Invisibility Cloak . ”
43765	43783	43654	43655	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Did you have any particular reason for doing so , or was it a mere whim ? ”
43784	43794	43796	43796	Harry	136	“ Because I thought Malfoy was up to something , ”
43809	43824	43654	43655	Mr. Weasley	204	“ He ’d given his mother the slip and I wanted to know why . ”
43825	43831	43833	43834	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Of course you did , ”
43839	43848	43654	43655	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Well ? Did you find out why ? ”
43849	43857	43859	43859	Harry	136	“ He went into Borgin and Burkes , ”
43861	43915	43859	43859	Harry	136	“ and started bullying the bloke in there , Borgin , to help him fix something . And he said he wanted Borgin to keep something else for him . He made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing . Like they were a pair . And ... ”
43922	43968	43916	43916	Harry	136	“ There ’s something else . We saw Malfoy jump about a mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm . I think he ’s been branded with the Dark Mark . I think he ’s replaced his father as a Death Eater . ”
43981	44001	43978	43978	he	136	“ Harry , I doubt whether You - Know - Who would allow a sixteen - year - old — ”
44002	44019	44021	44021	Harry	136	“ Does anyone really know what You - Know - Who would or would n’t do ? ”
44024	44068	43978	43978	he	136	“ Mr. Weasley , I ’m sorry , but is n’t it worth investigating ? If Malfoy wants something fixing , and he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done , it ’s probably something Dark or dangerous , is n’t it ? ”
44069	44080	44082	44083	Mr. Weasley	204	“ I doubt it , to be honest , Harry , ”
44086	44111	44082	44083	Mr. Weasley	204	“ You see , when Lucius Malfoy was arrested , we raided his house . We took away everything that might have been dangerous . ”
44112	44119	44121	44121	Harry	136	“ I think you missed something , ”
44124	44129	44131	44132	Mr. Weasley	204	“ Well , maybe , ”
44164	44170	44172	44173	Mr. Weasley	204	“ You ’d better hurry , ”
44180	44185	44186	44186	He	136	“ Harry , quickly ! ”
44203	44231	44233	44234	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ Now , dear , you ’re coming to us for Christmas , it ’s all fixed with Dumbledore , so we ’ll see you quite soon , ”
44254	44264	44240	44240	Harry	136	“ You make sure you look after yourself and — ”
44271	44277	44278	44278	She	202	“ — be good and — ”
44286	44291	44292	44292	Harry	136	“ — stay safe ! ”
44408	44411	44433	44433	He	136	“ Chosen One ”
44440	44448	44433	44433	He	136	“ Fancy trying to find a compartment ? ”
44449	44463	44465	44465	Ginny	222	“ I ca n’t , Harry , I said I ’d meet Dean , ”
44468	44473	44465	44465	Ginny	222	“ See you later . ”
44474	44477	44479	44479	Harry	136	“ Right , ”
44548	44553	44560	44560	him	136	“ Hi , Harry ! ”
44562	44565	44567	44567	Harry	136	“ Neville ! ”
44583	44588	44590	44598	a girl with long hair and large misty eyes	1365	“ Hello , Harry , ”
44606	44615	44590	44598	a girl with long hair and large misty eyes	1365	“ Luna , hi , how are you ? ”
44616	44623	44625	44625	Luna	264	“ Very well , thank you , ”
44652	44660	44662	44662	Harry	136	“ Quibbler still going strong , then ? ”
44683	44692	44694	44694	Luna	264	“ Oh yes , circulation ’s well up , ”
44697	44703	44705	44705	Harry	136	“ Let ’s find seats , ”
44738	44746	44748	44748	Neville	162	“ They ’re even staring at us ! ”
44755	44762	44748	44748	Neville	162	“ Because we ’re with you ! ”
44763	44777	44779	44779	Harry	136	“ They ’re staring at you because you were at the Ministry too , ”
44791	44809	44782	44782	he	136	“ Our little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet , you must ’ve seen it . ”
44810	44824	44826	44826	Neville	162	“ Yes , I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity , ”
44828	44858	44859	44859	He	162	“ but she was really pleased . Says I ’m starting to live up to my dad at long last . She bought me a new wand , look ! ”
44869	44875	44876	44876	he	162	“ Cherry and unicorn hair , ”
44880	44906	44876	44876	he	162	“ We think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold , he vanished next day — oi , come back here , Trevor ! ”
44928	44940	44942	44942	Luna	264	“ Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year , Harry ? ”
44959	44973	44975	44975	Harry	136	“ No point now we ’ve got rid of Umbridge , is there ? ”
44999	45011	44994	44994	He	162	“ I liked the D.A. ! I learned loads with you ! ”
45012	45019	45021	45021	Luna	264	“ I enjoyed the meetings too , ”
45024	45031	45021	45021	Luna	264	“ It was like having friends . ”
45091	45096	45180	45180	she	1373	“ You ask him ! ”
45097	45102	45180	45180	she	1373	“ No , you ! ”
45103	45109	45113	45113	them	1371	“ I ’ll do it ! ”
45140	45152	45153	45153	she	1373	“ Hi , Harry , I ’m Romilda , Romilda Vane , ”
45159	45179	45180	45180	she	1373	“ Why do n’t you join us in our compartment ? You do n’t have to sit with them , ”
45231	45238	45240	45240	Harry	136	“ They ’re friends of mine , ”
45243	45246	45248	45249	the girl	4700	“ Oh , ”
45255	45260	45262	45262	she	1373	“ Oh . Okay . ”
45272	45283	45285	45285	Luna	264	“ People expect you to have cooler friends than us , ”
45296	45301	45303	45303	Harry	136	“ You are cool , ”
45306	45322	45303	45303	Harry	136	“ None of them was at the Ministry . They did n’t fight with me . ”
45323	45333	45335	45335	Luna	264	“ That ’s a very nice thing to say , ”
45354	45363	45365	45365	Neville	162	“ We did n’t face him , though , ”
45389	45431	45365	45365	Neville	162	“ You did . You should hear my gran talk about you . ‘ That Harry Potter ’s got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together ! ’ She ’d give anything to have you as a grandson ... ”
45469	45472	45473	45473	Harry	136	“ Acceptable , ”
45613	45616	45595	45595	she	1376	“ Chosen One ”
45648	45659	45661	45661	Neville	162	“ You all right , Harry ? You look funny , ”
45666	45671	45663	45663	Harry	136	“ Sorry — I — ”
45672	45677	45679	45679	Luna	264	“ Wrackspurt got you ? ”
45691	45696	45679	45679	Luna	264	“ I — what ? ”
45697	45718	45719	45719	she	264	“ A Wrackspurt ... They ’re invisible . They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy , ”
45722	45733	45734	45734	She	264	“ I thought I felt one zooming around in here . ”
45827	45840	45842	45842	Ron	201	“ Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up , I ’m starving , ”
45856	45868	45869	45869	he	201	“ Hi , Neville . Hi , Luna . Guess what ? ”
45876	45903	45869	45869	he	201	“ Malfoy ’s not doing prefect duty . He ’s just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins , we saw him when we passed . ”
45938	45948	45926	45926	prefect	1383	“ What did he do when he saw you ? ”
45949	45953	45955	45955	Ron	201	“ The usual , ”
45964	45978	45980	45980	he	201	“ Not like him , though , is it ? Well — that is ”
45987	45999	45980	45980	he	201	“ but why is n’t he out there bullying first years ? ”
46000	46003	46005	46005	Harry	136	“ Dunno , ”
46032	46040	46042	46042	Hermione	180	“ Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad , ”
46044	46056	46042	46042	Hermione	180	“ Maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that . ”
46057	46064	46066	46066	Harry	136	“ I do n’t think so , ”
46068	46074	46066	46066	Harry	136	“ I think he ’s — ”
46100	46116	46117	46117	she	1386	“ I ’m supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry P - Potter , ”
46167	46172	46173	46173	Ron	201	“ What is it ? ”
46181	46185	46187	46187	Harry	136	“ An invitation , ”
46213	46219	46221	46221	Neville	162	“ Who ’s Professor Slughorn ? ”
46230	46234	46236	46236	Harry	136	“ New teacher , ”
46238	46253	46236	46236	Harry	136	“ Well , I suppose we ’ll have to go , wo n’t we ? ”
46254	46263	46265	46265	Neville	162	“ But what does he want me for ? ”
46275	46279	46281	46281	Harry	136	“ No idea , ”
46301	46304	46305	46305	he	136	“ Listen , ”
46315	46344	46305	46305	he	136	“ let ’s go under the Invisibility Cloak , then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way , see what he ’s up to . ”
46545	46550	46552	46552	Slughorn	200	“ Harry , m’boy ! ”
46602	46620	46621	46621	Neville	162	“ Good to see you , good to see you ! And you must be Mr. Longbottom ! ”
46718	46726	46727	46727	Slughorn	200	“ Now , do you know everyone ? ”
46733	46744	46727	46727	Slughorn	200	“ Blaise Zabini is in your year , of course — ”
46772	46789	46790	46790	McLaggen	276	“ This is Cormac McLaggen , perhaps you ’ve come across each other — ? No ? ”
46813	46828	46807	46807	Neville	162	“ — and this is Marcus Belby , I do n’t know whether — ? ”
46844	46857	46858	46858	Slughorn	200	“ — and this charming young lady tells me she knows you ! ”
46873	46882	46884	46884	Slughorn	200	“ Well now , this is most pleasant , ”
46887	46947	46884	46884	Slughorn	200	“ A chance to get to know you all a little better . Here , take a napkin . I ’ve packed my own lunch ; the trolley , as I remember it , is heavy on licorice wands , and a poor old man ’s digestive system is n’t quite up to such things ... Pheasant , Belby ? ”
46960	46979	46980	46980	Slughorn	200	“ I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles , ”
46994	47020	46980	46980	Slughorn	200	“ Outstanding wizard , outstanding , and his Order of Merlin most well - deserved . Do you see much of your uncle , Marcus ? ”
47052	47055	47057	47057	Slughorn	200	“ Anapneo , ”
47074	47084	47086	47086	Belby	277	“ Not ... not much of him , no , ”
47092	47104	47106	47106	Slughorn	200	“ Well , of course , I daresay he ’s busy , ”
47113	47126	47106	47106	Slughorn	200	“ I doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work ! ”
47127	47131	47133	47133	Belby	277	“ I suppose ... ”
47155	47181	47182	47182	His	277	“ Er ... he and my dad do n’t get on very well , you see , so I do n’t really know much about ... ”
47199	47206	47208	47208	Slughorn	200	“ Now , you , Cormac , ”
47210	47245	47208	47208	Slughorn	200	“ I happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius , because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in , I think , Norfolk ? ”
47246	47258	47260	47260	McLaggen	276	“ Oh , yeah , that was fun , that was , ”
47262	47281	47260	47260	McLaggen	276	“ We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour — this was before he became Minister , obviously — ”
47282	47292	47294	47294	Slughorn	200	“ Ah , you know Bertie and Rufus too ? ”
47312	47317	47307	47307	Belby	277	“ Now tell me ... ”
47470	47474	47476	47476	Slughorn	200	“ And now , ”
47494	47516	47517	47517	He	200	“ Harry Potter ! Where to begin ? I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer ! ”
47539	47552	47517	47517	He	200	“ ‘ The Chosen One , ’ they ’re calling you now ! ”
47569	47573	47575	47575	Slughorn	200	“ Of course , ”
47581	47621	47575	47575	Slughorn	200	“ there have been rumors for years ... I remember when — well — after that terrible night — Lily — James — and you survived — and the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary — ”
47646	47660	47575	47575	Slughorn	200	“ Yeah , Zabini , because you ’re so talented ... at posing ... ”
47661	47665	47667	47667	Slughorn	200	“ Oh dear ! ”
47686	47721	47722	47722	Zabini	275	“ You want to be careful , Blaise ! I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous Bat - Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage ! I would n’t cross her ! ”
47727	47730	47732	47732	Slughorn	200	“ Anyway , ”
47739	47801	47732	47732	Slughorn	200	“ Such rumors this summer . Of course , one does n’t know what to believe , the Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies , make mistakes — but there seems little doubt , given the number of witnesses , that there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all ! ”
47828	47877	47823	47823	Slughorn	200	“ So modest , so modest , no wonder Dumbledore is so fond — you were there , then ? But the rest of the stories — so sensational , of course , one does n’t know quite what to believe — this fabled prophecy , for instance — ”
47878	47885	47887	47887	Neville	162	“ We never heard a prophecy , ”
47897	47902	47904	47904	Ginny	222	“ That ’s right , ”
47907	47934	47904	47904	Ginny	222	“ Neville and I were both there too , and all this ‘ Chosen One ’ rubbish is just the Prophet making things up as usual . ”
47935	47945	47947	47947	Slughorn	200	“ You were both there too , were you ? ”
47969	47986	47987	47987	Slughorn	200	“ Yes ... well ... it is true that the Prophet often exaggerates , of course ... ”
47995	48019	48020	48020	He	200	“ I remember dear Gwenog telling me ( Gwenog Jones , I mean , of course , Captain of the Holyhead Harpies ) — ”
48082	48085	48079	48079	he	200	“ Slug Club ”
48131	48196	48197	48197	he	200	“ Good gracious , it ’s getting dark already ! I did n’t notice that they ’d lit the lamps ! You ’d better go and change into your robes , all of you . McLaggen , you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails . Harry , Blaise — any time you ’re passing . Same goes for you , miss , ”
48202	48213	48215	48215	he	200	“ Well , off you go , off you go ! ”
48249	48257	48259	48259	Neville	162	“ I ’m glad that ’s over , ”
48261	48269	48259	48259	Neville	162	“ Strange man , is n’t he ? ”
48270	48278	48280	48280	Harry	136	“ Yeah , he is a bit , ”
48287	48298	48282	48282	his	136	“ How come you ended up in there , Ginny ? ”
48299	48307	48309	48309	Ginny	222	“ He saw me hex Zacharias Smith , ”
48311	48382	48309	48309	Ginny	222	“ You remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D.A. ? He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him — when Slughorn came in I thought I was going to get detention , but he just thought it was a really good hex and invited me to lunch ! Mad , eh ? ”
48383	48396	48398	48398	Harry	136	“ Better reason for inviting someone than because their mother ’s famous , ”
48409	48415	48398	48398	Harry	136	“ or because their uncle — ”
48544	48552	48554	48554	Harry	136	“ I ’ll see you two later , ”
48570	48577	48579	48579	Neville	162	“ But what ’re you — ? ”
48581	48584	48586	48586	Harry	136	“ Later ! ”
48684	48692	48697	48697	he	275	“ What ’s wrong with this thing ? ”
48955	48960	48962	48962	Malfoy	159	“ So , Zabini , ”
48964	48970	48962	48962	Malfoy	159	“ what did Slughorn want ? ”
48971	48983	48985	48985	Zabini	275	“ Just trying to make up to well - connected people , ”
48994	49003	48985	48985	Zabini	275	“ Not that he managed to find many . ”
49013	49020	49021	49021	he	159	“ Who else had he invited ? ”
49024	49029	49031	49031	Zabini	275	“ McLaggen from Gryffindor , ”
49033	49045	49047	49047	Malfoy	159	“ Oh yeah , his uncle ’s big in the Ministry , ”
49049	49059	49047	49047	Malfoy	159	“ — someone else called Belby , from Ravenclaw — ”
49060	49069	49071	49071	Pansy	289	“ Not him , he ’s a prat ! ”
49073	49085	49071	49071	Pansy	289	“ — and Longbottom , Potter , and that Weasley girl , ”
49101	49106	49089	49089	Malfoy	159	“ He invited Longbottom ? ”
49107	49119	49121	49121	Zabini	275	“ Well , I assume so , as Longbottom was there , ”
49124	49133	49121	49121	Zabini	275	“ What ’s Longbottom got to interest Slughorn ? ”
49137	49155	49134	49134	Zabini	275	“ Potter , precious Potter , obviously he wanted a look at ‘ the Chosen One , ’ ”
49159	49172	49157	49157	Malfoy	159	“ but that Weasley girl ! What ’s so special about her ? ”
49173	49181	49183	49183	Pansy	289	“ A lot of boys like her , ”
49198	49225	49195	49195	his	159	“ Even you think she ’s good - looking , do n’t you , Blaise , and we all know how hard you are to please ! ”
49226	49243	49245	49245	Zabini	275	“ I would n’t touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like , ”
49270	49328	49261	49261	her	1438	“ Well , I pity Slughorn ’s taste . Maybe he ’s going a bit senile . Shame , my father always said he was a good wizard in his day . My father used to be a bit of a favorite of his . Slughorn probably has n’t heard I ’m on the train , or — ”
49329	49338	49340	49340	Zabini	275	“ I would n’t bank on an invitation , ”
49342	49403	49404	49404	Malfoy	159	“ He asked me about Nott ’s father when I first arrived . They used to be old friends , apparently , but when he heard he ’d been caught at the Ministry he did n’t look happy , and Nott did n’t get an invitation , did he ? I do n’t think Slughorn ’s interested in Death Eaters . ”
49416	49443	49444	49444	Malfoy	159	“ Well , who cares what he ’s interested in ? What is he , when you come down to it ? Just some stupid teacher . ”
49448	49480	49444	49444	Malfoy	159	“ I mean , I might not even be at Hogwarts next year , what ’s it matter to me if some fat old has - been likes me or not ? ”
49481	49496	49498	49498	Pansy	289	“ What do you mean , you might not be at Hogwarts next year ? ”
49507	49514	49516	49516	Malfoy	159	“ Well , you never know , ”
49524	49539	49516	49516	Malfoy	159	“ I might have — er — moved on to bigger and better things . ”
49618	49625	49626	49626	Malfoy	159	“ Do you mean — Him ? ”
49629	49706	49626	49626	Malfoy	159	“ Mother wants me to complete my education , but personally , I do n’t see it as that important these days . I mean , think about it ... When the Dark Lord takes over , is he going to care how many O.W.L.s or N.E.W.T.s anyone ’s got ? Of course he is n’t ... It ’ll be all about the kind of service he received , the level of devotion he was shown . ”
49707	49721	49723	49723	Zabini	275	“ And you think you ’ll be able to do something for him ? ”
49726	49737	49723	49723	Zabini	275	“ Sixteen years old and not even fully qualified yet ? ”
49738	49777	49779	49779	Malfoy	159	“ I ’ve just said , have n’t I ? Maybe he does n’t care if I ’m qualified . Maybe the job he wants me to do is n’t something that you need to be qualified for , ”
49813	49819	49821	49821	Malfoy	159	“ I can see Hogwarts , ”
49839	49848	49831	49831	he	159	“ We ’d better get our robes on . ”
50090	50095	50096	50096	Malfoy	159	“ You go on , ”
50118	50126	50127	50127	Pansy	289	“ I just want to check something . ”
50231	50235	50239	50239	Malfoy	159	“ Petrificus Totalus ! ”
50323	50328	50329	50329	he	159	“ I thought so , ”
50333	50358	50329	50329	he	159	“ I heard Goyle ’s trunk hit you . And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came back ... ”
50370	50390	50392	50392	he	159	“ You did n’t hear anything I care about , Potter . But while I ’ve got you here ... ”
50412	50425	50426	50426	Malfoy	159	“ That ’s from my father . Now , let ’s see ... ”
50443	50460	50461	50461	he	159	“ I do n’t reckon they ’ll find you till the train ’s back in London , ”
50465	50475	50461	50461	he	159	“ See you around , Potter ... or not . ”
50773	50777	50826	50826	he	136	“ Accio Wand ! ”
50969	50974	50983	50983	Harry	136	“ Wotcher , Harry . ”
51038	51049	51050	51050	she	210	“ We ’d better get out of here , quickly , ”
51071	51079	51050	51050	she	210	“ Come on , we ’ll jump . ”
51190	51195	51182	51182	she	210	“ Who did it ? ”
51196	51200	51202	51202	Harry	136	“ Draco Malfoy , ”
51205	51211	51182	51182	she	210	“ Thanks for ... well ... ”
51212	51216	51218	51218	Tonks	210	“ No problem , ”
51255	51266	51243	51243	she	210	“ I can fix your nose if you stand still . ”
51322	51325	51327	51327	Tonks	210	“ Episkey , ”
51356	51361	51341	51341	He	136	“ Thanks a lot ! ”
51362	51381	51383	51383	Tonks	210	“ You ’d better put that Cloak back on , and we can walk up to the school , ”
51419	51425	51427	51427	Harry	136	“ Was that a Patronus ? ”
51438	51467	51468	51468	They	1486	“ Yes , I ’m sending word to the castle that I ’ve got you or they ’ll worry . Come on , we ’d better not dawdle . ”
51480	51487	51468	51468	They	1486	“ How did you find me ? ”
51488	51532	51399	51399	her	210	“ I noticed you had n’t left the train and I knew you had that Cloak . I thought you might be hiding for some reason . When I saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought I ’d check . ”
51533	51543	51544	51544	Harry	136	“ But what are you doing here , anyway ? ”
51547	51562	51564	51564	Tonks	210	“ I ’m stationed in Hogsmeade now , to give the school extra protection , ”
51566	51580	51564	51564	Tonks	210	“ Is it just you who ’s stationed up here , or — ? ”
51581	51594	51544	51544	Harry	136	“ No , Proudfoot , Savage , and Dawlish are here too . ”
51595	51605	51564	51564	Tonks	210	“ Dawlish , that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year ? ”
51606	51611	51612	51612	They	1489	“ That ’s right . ”
51878	51881	51882	51882	he	136	“ Alohomora ! ”
51897	51905	51907	51907	Tonks	210	“ That wo n’t work on these , ”
51909	51915	51907	51907	Tonks	210	“ Dumbledore bewitched them himself . ”
51920	51927	51928	51928	he	136	“ I could climb a wall , ”
51931	51938	51940	51940	Tonks	210	“ No , you could n’t , ”
51943	51962	51940	51940	Tonks	210	“ Anti - intruder jinxes on all of them . Security ’s been tightened a hundredfold this summer . ”
51963	51967	51969	51969	Harry	136	“ Well then , ”
51981	51997	51969	51969	Harry	136	“ I suppose I ’ll just have to sleep out here and wait for morning . ”
51998	52006	52008	52008	Tonks	210	“ Someone ’s coming down for you , ”
52010	52013	52008	52008	Tonks	210	“ Look . ”
52117	52124	52126	52126	Snape	147	“ Well , well , well , ”
52150	52177	52130	52130	his	147	“ Nice of you to turn up , Potter , although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance . ”
52178	52190	52191	52191	Harry	136	“ I could n’t change , I did n’t have my — ”
52200	52221	52195	52195	Snape	147	“ There is no need to wait , Nymphadora , Potter is quite — ah — safe in my hands . ”
52222	52231	52233	52233	Tonks	210	“ I meant Hagrid to get the message , ”
52237	52264	52266	52266	Snape	147	“ Hagrid was late for the start - of - term feast , just like Potter here , so I took it instead . And incidentally , ”
52277	52287	52266	52266	Snape	147	“ I was interested to see your new Patronus . ”
52319	52331	52333	52333	Snape	147	“ I think you were better off with the old one , ”
52342	52349	52333	52333	Snape	147	“ The new one looks weak . ”
52382	52386	52387	52387	Harry	136	“ Good night , ”
52407	52413	52387	52387	Harry	136	“ Thanks for ... everything . ”
52414	52420	52421	52421	Snape	147	“ See you , Harry . ”
52595	52606	52608	52608	Snape	147	“ Fifty points from Gryffindor for lateness , I think , ”
52610	52661	52608	52608	Snape	147	“ And , let me see , another twenty for your Muggle attire . You know , I do n’t believe any House has ever been in negative figures this early in the term : We have n’t even started pudding . You might have set a record , Potter . ”
52697	52710	52711	52711	Snape	147	“ I suppose you wanted to make an entrance , did you ? ”
52714	52740	52711	52711	Snape	147	“ And with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect . ”
52881	52905	52878	52878	Snape	147	“ No Cloak . You can walk in so that everyone sees you , which is what you wanted , I ’m sure . ”
53031	53046	53048	53048	Ron	201	“ Where ’ve you — blimey , what ’ve you done to your face ? ”
53061	53070	53072	53072	Harry	136	“ Why , what ’s wrong with it ? ”
53084	53091	53093	53093	Hermione	180	“ You ’re covered in blood ! ”
53095	53099	53100	53100	She	180	“ Come here — ”
53106	53109	53102	53102	her	180	“ Tergeo ! ”
53117	53120	53122	53122	Harry	136	“ Thanks , ”
53130	53137	53122	53122	Harry	136	“ How ’s my nose looking ? ”
53138	53141	53143	53143	Hermione	180	“ Normal , ”
53146	53162	53143	53143	Hermione	180	“ Why should n’t it ? Harry , what happened ? We ’ve been terrified ! ”
53163	53170	53172	53172	Harry	136	“ I ’ll tell you later , ”
53210	53213	53215	53215	Hermione	180	“ But — ”
53217	53223	53225	53225	Harry	136	“ Not now , Hermione , ”
53323	53331	53333	53333	Hermione	180	“ You missed the Sorting , anyway , ”
53344	53350	53352	53352	Harry	136	“ Hat say anything interesting ? ”
53361	53384	53352	53352	Harry	136	“ More of the same , really ... advising us all to unite in the face of our enemies , you know . ”
53385	53392	53333	53333	Hermione	180	“ Dumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all ? ”
53393	53420	53333	53333	Hermione	180	“ Not yet , but he always saves his proper speech for after the feast , does n’t he ? It ca n’t be long now . ”
53421	53431	53352	53352	Harry	136	“ Snape said Hagrid was late for the feast — ”
53432	53441	53443	53443	Ron	201	“ You ’ve seen Snape ? How come ? ”
53450	53455	53457	53457	Harry	136	“ Bumped into him , ”
53460	53469	53471	53471	Hermione	180	“ Hagrid was only a few minutes late , ”
53473	53484	53471	53471	Hermione	180	“ Look , he ’s waving at you , Harry . ”
53757	53765	53766	53766	Hermione	180	“ So what did Professor Slughorn want ? ”
53769	53779	53781	53781	Harry	136	“ To know what really happened at the Ministry , ”
53783	53790	53792	53792	Hermione	180	“ Him and everyone else here , ”
53794	53811	53792	53792	Hermione	180	“ People were interrogating us about it on the train , were n’t they , Ron ? ”
53812	53815	53817	53817	Ron	201	“ Yeah , ”
53819	53834	53817	53817	Ron	201	“ All wanting to know if you really are ‘ the Chosen One ’ — ”
53835	53850	53852	53854	Nearly Headless Nick	300	“ There has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts , ”
53872	53938	53817	53817	Ron	201	“ I am considered something of a Potter authority ; it is widely known that we are friendly . I have assured the spirit community that I will not pester you for information , however . ‘ Harry Potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence , ’ I told them . ‘ I would rather die than betray his trust . ’ ”
53939	53953	53954	53954	Ron	201	“ That ’s not saying much , seeing as you ’re already dead , ”
53957	53971	53973	53975	Nearly Headless Nick	300	“ Once again , you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe , ”
54022	54031	54032	54032	he	263	“ The very best of evenings to you ! ”
54050	54057	54059	54059	Hermione	180	“ What happened to his hand ? ”
54125	54131	54132	54132	he	263	“ Nothing to worry about , ”
54136	54163	54132	54132	he	263	“ Now ... to our new students , welcome , to our old students , welcome back ! Another year full of magical education awaits you ... ”
54164	54178	54179	54179	Harry	136	“ His hand was like that when I saw him over the summer , ”
54184	54204	54179	54179	Harry	136	“ I thought he ’d have cured it by now , though ... or Madam Pomfrey would ’ve done . ”
54205	54214	54216	54216	Hermione	180	“ It looks as if it ’s died , ”
54223	54244	54216	54216	Hermione	180	“ But there are some injuries you ca n’t cure ... old curses ... and there are poisons without antidotes ... ”
54245	54281	54179	54179	Harry	136	“ . . . and Mr. Filch , our caretaker , has asked me to say that there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes . “
54317	54333	54335	54335	Slughorn	200	“ We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year . Professor Slughorn ”
54358	54377	54335	54335	Slughorn	200	“ is a former colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master . ”
54378	54381	54347	54347	his	200	“ Potions ? ”
54382	54385	54335	54335	Slughorn	200	“ Potions ? ”
54402	54405	54407	54407	Ron	201	“ Potions ? ”
54418	54423	54435	54435	his	263	“ But you said — ”
54424	54430	54435	54435	his	263	“ Professor Snape , meanwhile , ”
54446	54461	54435	54435	his	263	“ will be taking over the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher . ”
54462	54465	54467	54467	Harry	136	“ No ! ”
54530	54549	54551	54551	Hermione	180	“ But Harry , you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts ! ”
54553	54559	54561	54561	Harry	136	“ I thought he was ! ”
54656	54665	54666	54666	he	136	“ Well , there ’s one good thing , ”
54670	54681	54666	54666	he	136	“ Snape’ll be gone by the end of the year . ”
54682	54688	54690	54690	Ron	201	“ What do you mean ? ”
54692	54727	54690	54690	Ron	201	“ That job ’s jinxed . No one ’s lasted more than a year ... Quirrell actually died doing it ... Personally , I ’m going to keep my fingers crossed for another death ... ”
54728	54731	54733	54733	Hermione	180	“ Harry ! ”
54739	54755	54757	54757	Ron	201	“ He might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the year , ”
54760	54777	54780	54780	his	263	“ That Slughorn bloke might not want to stay long - term . Moody did n’t . ”
54859	54884	54836	54836	Dumbledore	263	“ Now , as everybody in this Hall knows , Lord Voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength . ”
54932	55097	55098	55098	Dumbledore	263	“ I can not emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is , and how much care each of us at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe . The castle ’s magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer , we are protected in new and more powerful ways , but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff . I urge you , therefore , to abide by any security restrictions that your teachers might impose upon you , however irksome you might find them — in particular , the rule that you are not to be out of bed after hours . I implore you , should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle , to report it to a member of staff immediately . I trust you to conduct yourselves , always , with the utmost regard for your own and others ’ safety . ”
55112	55158	55107	55107	he	263	“ But now , your beds await , as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish , and I know that your top priority is to be well - rested for your lessons tomorrow . Let us therefore say good night . Pip pip ! ”
55269	55277	55278	55278	he	201	“ What really happened to your nose ? ”
55325	55337	55338	55338	he	201	“ I saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose , ”
55342	55351	55353	55353	Harry	136	“ Yeah , well , never mind that , ”
55356	55371	55353	55353	Harry	136	“ Listen to what he was saying before he found out I was there ... ”
55397	55425	55393	55393	Ron	201	“ Come on , Harry , he was just showing off for Parkinson ... What kind of mission would You - Know - Who have given him ? ”
55426	55445	55386	55386	Harry	136	“ How d’you know Voldemort does n’t need someone at Hogwarts ? It would n’t be the first — ”
55446	55459	55393	55393	Ron	201	“ I wish yeh’d stop sayin ’ tha ’ name , Harry , ”
55479	55485	55487	55487	Harry	136	“ Dumbledore uses that name , ”
55490	55501	55503	55503	Hagrid	177	“ Yeah , well , tha ’s Dumbledore , innit ? ”
55506	55520	55503	55503	Hagrid	177	“ So how come yeh were late , Harry ? I was worried . ”
55521	55529	55531	55531	Harry	136	“ Got held up on the train , ”
55533	55539	55531	55531	Harry	136	“ Why were you late ? ”
55540	55546	55548	55548	Hagrid	177	“ I was with Grawp , ”
55551	55598	55548	55548	Hagrid	177	“ Los ’ track o ’ the time . He ’s got a new home up in the mountains now , Dumbledore fixed it — nice big cave . He ’s much happier than he was in the forest . We were havin’ a good chat . ”
55599	55602	55604	55604	Harry	136	“ Really ? ”
55658	55668	55670	55670	Hagrid	177	“ Oh yeah , he ’s really come on , ”
55673	55692	55693	55693	Ron	201	“ Yeh’ll be amazed . I ’m thinkin ’ o ’ trainin ’ him up as me assistant . ”
55718	55751	55759	55759	he	201	“ Anyway , I ’ll see yeh tomorrow , firs ’ lesson ’s straight after lunch . Come early an ’ yeh can say hello ter Buck — I mean , Witherwings ! ”
55792	55805	55806	55806	Ron	201	“ You ’re not taking Care of Magical Creatures , are you ? ”
55811	55821	55806	55806	Ron	201	“ And you ’re not either , are you ? ”
55828	55832	55834	55834	Ron	201	“ And Hermione , ”
55836	55844	55834	55834	Ron	201	“ she ’s not , is she ? ”
55916	55930	55932	55932	Ron	201	“ But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson , was n’t he ? ”
55941	55944	55945	55945	she	180	“ Well , ”
55949	55979	55945	55945	she	180	“ I do n’t know ... It would be like Malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is ... but that ’s a big lie to tell ... ”
55980	55983	55985	55985	Harry	136	“ Exactly , ”
56020	56027	56028	56028	Ron	201	“ It ’s rude to point , ”
56083	56115	56080	56080	Ron	201	“ I love being a sixth year . And we ’re going to be getting free time this year . Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax . ”
56116	56129	56131	56131	Hermione	180	“ We ’re going to need that time for studying , Ron ! ”
56141	56148	56150	56150	Ron	201	“ Yeah , but not today , ”
56152	56165	56150	56150	Ron	201	“ Today ’s going to be a real doss , I reckon . ”
56166	56170	56172	56172	Hermione	180	“ Hold it ! ”
56204	56214	56215	56215	she	180	“ Fanged Frisbees are banned , hand it over , ”
56257	56268	56241	56241	Ron	201	“ Excellent , I ’ve always wanted one of these . ”
56369	56384	56385	56385	she	180	“ But he ca n’t really think we ’d continue Care of Magical Creatures ! ”
56391	56408	56385	56385	she	180	“ I mean , when has any of us expressed ... you know ... any enthusiasm ? ”
56409	56418	56420	56420	Ron	201	“ That ’s it , though , innit ? ”
56429	56466	56420	56420	Ron	201	“ We were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid . But he thinks we liked the stupid subject . D’you reckon anyone ’s going to go on to N.E.W.T. ? ”
56644	56649	56650	56650	she	237	“ Herbology , fine , ”
56653	56727	56650	56650	she	237	“ Professor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an ‘ Outstanding ’ O.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark Arts with ‘ Exceeds Expectations . ’ But the problem is Transfiguration . I ’m sorry , Longbottom , but an ‘ Acceptable ’ really is n’t good enough to continue to N.E.W.T. level . I just do n’t think you ’d be able to cope with the coursework . ”
56743	56767	56733	56734	Professor McGonagall	237	“ Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration , anyway ? I ’ve never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it . ”
56775	56780	56768	56768	Neville	162	“ my grandmother wants . ”
56781	56784	56786	56787	Professor McGonagall	237	“ Hmph , ”
56789	56826	56786	56787	Professor McGonagall	237	“ It ’s high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she ’s got , rather than the one she thinks she ought to have — particularly after what happened at the Ministry . ”
56845	56887	56835	56836	Professor McGonagall	237	“ I ’m sorry , Longbottom , but I can not let you into my N.E.W.T. class . I see that you have an ‘ Exceeds Expectations ’ in Charms , however — why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms ? ”
56888	56898	56900	56900	Neville	162	“ My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option , ”
56902	56906	56908	56909	Professor McGonagall	237	“ Take Charms , ”
56911	56937	56908	56909	Professor McGonagall	237	“ and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L. , the subject is not necessarily worthless . ”
57002	57015	57025	57025	her	237	“ He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year , ”
57040	57051	57052	57052	Parvati	312	“ The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney . ”
57064	57071	57073	57074	Professor McGonagall	237	“ So , Potter , Potter ... ”
57085	57141	57080	57080	she	237	“ Charms , Defense Against the Dark Arts , Herbology , Transfiguration ... all fine . I must say , I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark , Potter , very pleased . Now , why have n’t you applied to continue with Potions ? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror ? ”
57142	57164	57073	57074	Professor McGonagall	237	“ It was , but you told me I had to get an ‘ Outstanding ’ in my O.W.L. , Professor . ”
57165	57205	57080	57080	she	237	“ And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject . Professor Slughorn , however , is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with ‘ Exceeds Expectations ’ at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with Potions ? ”
57206	57209	57211	57211	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
57213	57227	57211	57211	Harry	136	“ but I did n’t buy the books or any ingredients or anything — ”
57228	57242	57244	57245	Professor McGonagall	237	“ I ’m sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some , ”
57247	57298	57244	57245	Professor McGonagall	237	“ Very well , Potter , here is your schedule . Oh , by the way — twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the Gryffindor Quidditch team . I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure . ”
57325	57328	57330	57330	Ron	201	“ Look , ”
57338	57360	57330	57330	Ron	201	“ we ’ve got a free period now ... and a free period after break ... and after lunch ... excellent ! ”
57402	57413	57414	57414	she	314	“ I thought you ’d get that , well done , ”
57429	57437	57414	57414	she	314	“ Tell me when you call trials ! ”
57438	57444	57446	57446	Harry	136	“ Do n’t be stupid , ”
57448	57466	57446	57446	Harry	136	“ you do n’t need to try out , I ’ve watched you play for five years ... ”
57467	57476	57477	57477	she	314	“ You must n’t start off like that , ”
57481	57519	57477	57477	she	314	“ For all you know , there ’s someone much better than me out there . Good teams have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing the old faces , or letting in their friends ... ”
57614	57623	57624	57624	she	180	“ We got so much homework for Runes , ”
57635	57655	57624	57624	she	180	“ A fifteen - inch essay , two translations , and I ’ve got to read these by Wednesday ! ”
57656	57659	57661	57661	Ron	201	“ Shame , ”
57663	57667	57668	57668	she	180	“ You wait , ”
57672	57680	57668	57668	she	180	“ I bet Snape gives us loads . ”
57717	57720	57721	57721	he	205	“ Inside , ”
57805	57817	57819	57819	Snape	205	“ I have not asked you to take out your books , ”
57855	57870	57871	57871	His	205	“ I wish to speak to you , and I want your fullest attention . ”
57896	57911	57871	57871	His	205	“ You have had five teachers in this subject so far , I believe . ”
57938	57996	57935	57935	Harry	136	“ Naturally , these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities . Given this confusion I am surprised so many of you scraped an O.W.L. in this subject . I shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work , which will be much more advanced . ”
58025	58030	58032	58032	Snape	205	“ The Dark Arts , ”
58034	58089	58032	58032	Snape	205	“ are many , varied , ever - changing , and eternal . Fighting them is like fighting a many - headed monster , which , each time a neck is severed , sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before . You are fighting that which is unfixed , mutating , indestructible . ”
58129	58133	58135	58135	Snape	205	“ Your defenses , ”
58141	58159	58161	58161	he	205	“ must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo . These pictures ”
58172	58191	58193	58193	he	205	“ give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer , for instance , the Cruciatus Curse ”
58207	58213	58193	58193	he	205	“ feel the Dementor ’s Kiss ”
58229	58237	58193	58193	he	205	“ or provoke the aggression of the Inferius ”
58246	58255	58257	58258	Parvati Patil	312	“ Has an Inferius been seen , then ? ”
58266	58276	58257	58258	Parvati Patil	312	“ Is it definite , is he using them ? ”
58277	58288	58290	58290	Snape	205	“ The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past , ”
58292	58311	58312	58312	He	205	“ which means you would be well - advised to assume he might use them again . Now ... ”
58344	58372	58330	58330	they	1597	“ . . . you are , I believe , complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells . What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell ? ”
58402	58409	58383	58383	his	205	“ Very well — Miss Granger ? ”
58410	58427	58429	58429	Hermione	180	“ Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you ’re about to perform , ”
58431	58441	58429	58429	Hermione	180	“ which gives you a split - second advantage . ”
58442	58460	58462	58462	Snape	205	“ An answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book of Spells , Grade Six , ”
58474	58523	58525	58525	his	205	“ but correct in essentials . Yes , those who progress to using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spell - casting . Not all wizards can do this , of course ; it is a question of concentration and mind power which some ”
58534	58537	58525	58525	his	205	“ lack . ”
58569	58575	58576	58576	Snape	205	“ You will now divide , ”
58580	58610	58576	58576	Snape	205	“ into pairs . One partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking . The other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence . Carry on . ”
58811	58816	58818	58818	Snape	205	“ Pathetic , Weasley , ”
58824	58832	58833	58833	He	205	“ Here — let me show you — ”
58856	58859	58853	58853	he	136	“ Protego ! ”
58893	58908	58887	58887	Snape	205	“ Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells , Potter ? ”
58909	58912	58914	58914	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
58917	58922	58914	58914	Harry	136	“ Yes , sir . ”
58923	58937	58947	58947	he	136	“ There ’s no need to call me ‘ sir , ’ Professor . ”
58972	58981	58983	58983	Snape	205	“ Detention , Saturday night , my office , ”
58985	59004	58983	58983	Snape	205	“ I do not take cheek from anyone , Potter ... not even ‘ the Chosen One . ’ ”
59005	59012	59014	59014	Ron	201	“ That was brilliant , Harry ! ”
59030	59039	59041	59041	Hermione	180	“ You really should n’t have said it , ”
59047	59052	59041	59041	Hermione	180	“ What made you ? ”
59053	59067	59069	59069	Harry	136	“ He tried to jinx me , in case you did n’t notice ! ”
59071	59128	59069	59069	Harry	136	“ I had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons ! Why does n’t he use another guinea pig for a change ? What ’s Dumbledore playing at , anyway , letting him teach Defense ? Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts ? He loves them ! All that unfixed , indestructible stuff — ”
59129	59132	59134	59134	Hermione	180	“ Well , ”
59136	59146	59134	59134	Hermione	180	“ I thought he sounded a bit like you . ”
59147	59151	59069	59069	Harry	136	“ Like me ? ”
59152	59216	59217	59217	Harry	136	“ Yes , when you were telling us what it ’s like to face Voldemort . You said it was n’t just memorizing a bunch of spells , you said it was just you and your brains and your guts — well , was n’t that what Snape was saying ? That it really comes down to being brave and quick - thinking ? ”
59243	59250	59251	59251	Harry	136	“ Harry ! Hey , Harry ! ”
59280	59284	59286	59286	Sloper	317	“ For you , ”
59288	59305	59286	59286	Sloper	317	“ Listen , I heard you ’re the new Captain . When ’re you holding trials ? ”
59306	59313	59315	59315	Harry	136	“ I ’m not sure yet , ”
59332	59339	59315	59315	Harry	136	“ I ’ll let you know . ”
59340	59354	59356	59356	Harry	136	“ Oh , right . I was hoping it ’d be this weekend — ”
59443	59449	59451	59451	Ron	201	“ He enjoys Acid Pops ? ”
59467	59481	59483	59483	Harry	136	“ It ’s the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study , ”
59489	59510	59511	59511	He	201	“ Ha ! Snape ’s not going to be pleased ... I wo n’t be able to do his detention ! ”
59736	59739	59740	59740	Ernie	320	“ Harry , ”
59752	59800	59749	59749	Harry	136	“ did n’t get a chance to speak in Defense Against the Dark Arts this morning . Good lesson , I thought , but Shield Charms are old hat , of course , for us old D.A. lags ... And how are you , Ron — Hermione ? ”
59807	59810	59802	59802	they	1622	“ fine , ”
60010	60020	60022	60022	Slughorn	200	“ Now then , now then , now then , ”
60035	60057	60022	60022	Slughorn	200	“ Scales out , everyone , and potion kits , and do n’t forget your copies of Advanced Potion - Making ... ”
60058	60061	60063	60063	Harry	136	“ Sir ? ”
60069	60074	60063	60063	Harry	136	“ Harry , m’boy ? ”
60075	60107	60022	60022	Slughorn	200	“ I have n’t got a book or scales or anything — nor ’s Ron — we did n’t realize we ’d be able to do the N.E.W.T. , you see — ”
60108	60177	60178	60178	Slughorn	200	“ Ah , yes , Professor McGonagall did mention ... not to worry , my dear boy , not to worry at all . You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today , and I ’m sure we can lend you some scales , and we ’ve got a small stock of old books here , they ’ll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts ... ”
60225	60229	60231	60231	Slughorn	200	“ Now then , ”
60258	60324	60325	60325	He	200	“ I ’ve prepared a few potions for you to have a look at , just out of interest , you know . These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s . You ought to have heard of ’em , even if you have n’t made ’em yet . Anyone tell me what this one is ? ”
60372	60391	60393	60393	Hermione	180	“ It ’s Veritaserum , a colorless , odorless potion that forces the drinker to tell the truth , ”
60395	60402	60404	60404	Slughorn	200	“ Very good , very good ! ”
60407	60410	60411	60411	he	200	“ Now , ”
60423	60445	60411	60411	he	200	“ this one here is pretty well known ... Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too ... Who can — ? ”
60454	60462	60463	60463	she	180	“ It ’s Polyjuice Potion , sir , ”
60516	60532	60534	60534	Slughorn	200	“ Excellent , excellent ! Now , this one here ... yes , my dear ? ”
60550	60555	60542	60542	Hermione	180	“ It ’s Amortentia ! ”
60556	60568	60570	60570	Slughorn	200	“ It is indeed . It seems almost foolish to ask , ”
60578	60588	60570	60570	Slughorn	200	“ but I assume you know what it does ? ”
60589	60601	60603	60603	Hermione	180	“ It ’s the most powerful love potion in the world ! ”
60605	60626	60603	60603	Hermione	180	“ Quite right ! You recognized it , I suppose , by its distinctive mother - of - pearl sheen ? ”
60627	60636	60638	60638	Hermione	180	“ And the steam rising in characteristic spirals , ”
60641	60672	60638	60638	Hermione	180	“ and it ’s supposed to smell differently to each of us , according to what attracts us , and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and — ”
60685	60695	60697	60697	Slughorn	200	“ May I ask your name , my dear ? ”
60704	60710	60697	60697	Slughorn	200	“ Hermione Granger , sir . ”
60711	60736	60697	60697	Slughorn	200	“ Granger ? Granger ? Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth - Granger , who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers ? ”
60737	60757	60758	60758	Harry	136	“ No , I do n’t think so , sir . I ’m Muggle - born , you see . ”
60800	60839	60791	60791	Harry	136	“ Oho ! ‘ One of my best friends is Muggle - born , and she ’s the best in our year ! ’ I ’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke , Harry ? ”
60840	60845	60847	60847	Harry	136	“ Yes , sir , ”
60849	60866	60868	60868	Slughorn	200	“ Well , well , take twenty well - earned points for Gryffindor , Miss Granger , ”
60899	60917	60888	60888	Hermione	180	“ Did you really tell him I ’m the best in the year ? Oh , Harry ! ”
60918	60928	60930	60930	Ron	201	“ Well , what ’s so impressive about that ? ”
60939	60960	60930	60930	Ron	201	“ You are the best in the year — I ’d ’ve told him so if he ’d asked me ! ”
60966	60968	60977	60977	Slughorn	200	“ shhing ”
60986	61034	61035	61035	he	200	“ Amortentia does n’t really create love , of course . It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love . No , this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession . It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room — oh yes , ”
61052	61075	61035	61035	he	200	“ When you have seen as much of life as I have , you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love ... “
61079	61083	61035	61035	he	200	” said Slughorn , “
61093	61094	61095	61095	Sir	4356	” “
61108	61159	61097	61097	you	4356	” said Ernie Macmillan , pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughorn ’s desk . The potion within was splashing about merrily ; it was the color of molten gold , and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface , though not a particle had spilled . “
61162	61190	61097	61097	you	4356	” said Slughorn again . Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all , but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect . “
61218	61237	61214	61214	I	0	” he turned , smiling , to look at Hermione , who had let out an audible gasp , “
61249	61250	61246	61247	Miss Granger	180	” “
61256	61261	61246	61247	Miss Granger	180	” said Hermione excitedly . “
61267	61308	61246	61247	Miss Granger	180	” The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter . Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head , because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention . “
61331	61335	61328	61329	Felix Felicis	326	” said Slughorn . “
61377	61378	61328	61329	Felix Felicis	326	” “
61391	61397	61382	61382	people	584	” said Terry Boot eagerly . “
61414	61418	61382	61382	people	584	” said Slughorn . “
61443	61444	61446	61446	you	4356	” “
61453	61461	61446	61446	you	4356	” asked Michael Corner with great interest . “
61467	61471	61446	61446	you	4356	” said Slughorn . “
61498	61521	61446	61446	you	4356	” He gazed dreamily into the distance . Whether he was playacting or not , thought Harry , the effect was good . “
61525	61535	61446	61446	you	4356	” said Slughorn , apparently coming back to earth , “
61549	61567	61538	61538	I	0	” There was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold . “
61575	61600	61538	61538	I	0	” said Slughorn , taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all . “
61622	61674	61538	61538	I	0	“ Now , I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organized competitions ... sporting events , for instance , examinations , or elections . So the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only ... and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary ! “
61677	61684	61538	61538	I	0	” said Slughorn , suddenly brisk , “
61778	62003	61775	61775	you	1638	” There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales , but nobody spoke . The concentration within the room was almost tangible . Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of Advanced Potion - Making . It could not have been clearer that Malfoy really wanted that lucky day . Harry bent swiftly over the tattered book Slughorn had lent him . To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages , so that the margins were as black as the printed portions . Bending low to decipher the ingredients ( even here , the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out ) Harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed . As he dashed back to his cauldron , he saw Malfoy cutting up valerian roots as fast as he could . Everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing ; this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of Potions , that it was hard to keep your work private . Within ten minutes , the whole place was full of bluish steam . Hermione , of course , seemed to have progressed furthest . Her potion already resembled the “
62011	62093	61775	61775	you	1638	” mentioned as the ideal halfway stage . Having finished chopping his roots , Harry bent low over his book again . It was really very irritating , having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner , who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction : Crush with flat side of silver dagger , releases juice better than cutting .
62094	62107	62108	62108	Harry	136	“ Sir , I think you knew my grandfather , Abraxas Malfoy ? ”
62120	62123	62125	62125	Slughorn	200	“ Yes , ”
62132	62156	62125	62125	Slughorn	200	“ I was sorry to hear he had died , although of course it was n’t unexpected , dragon pox at his age ... ”
62241	62249	62250	62250	She	180	“ Can I borrow your silver knife ? ”
62444	62451	62453	62453	Hermione	180	“ How are you doing that ? ”
62482	62488	62508	62508	he	136	“ Add a clockwise stir — ”
62489	62499	62500	62500	she	180	“ No , no , the book says counterclockwise ! ”
62586	62593	62595	62595	Slughorn	200	“ And time ’s ... up ! ”
62597	62603	62595	62595	Slughorn	200	“ Stop stirring , please ! ”
62695	62700	62701	62701	he	200	“ The clear winner ! ”
62707	62763	62701	62701	he	200	“ Excellent , excellent , Harry ! Good lord , it ’s clear you ’ve inherited your mother ’s talent . She was a dab hand at Potions , Lily was ! Here you are , then , here you are — one bottle of Felix Felicis , as promised , and use it well ! ”
62807	62814	62815	62815	he	201	“ How did you do that ? ”
62825	62832	62834	62834	Harry	136	“ Got lucky , I suppose , ”
62875	62883	62884	62884	he	136	“ I s’pose you think I cheated ? ”
62892	62906	62907	62907	she	180	“ Well , it was n’t exactly your own work , was it ? ”
62911	62920	62922	62922	Ron	201	“ He only followed different instructions to ours , ”
62924	62945	62946	62946	He	136	“ Could ’ve been a catastrophe , could n’t it ? But he took a risk and it paid off . ”
62951	62988	62946	62946	He	136	“ Slughorn could ’ve handed me that book , but no , I get the one no one ’s ever written on . Puked on , by the look of page fifty - two , but — ”
62989	62993	63028	63028	Ginny	222	“ Hang on , ”
63033	63054	63028	63028	Ginny	222	“ Did I hear right ? You ’ve been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book , Harry ? ”
63071	63076	63077	63077	he	136	“ It ’s nothing , ”
63085	63109	63077	63077	he	136	“ It ’s not like , you know , Riddle ’s diary . It ’s just an old textbook someone ’s scribbled on . ”
63110	63119	63082	63082	his	136	“ But you ’re doing what it says ? ”
63120	63143	63082	63082	his	136	“ I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins , honestly , Ginny , there ’s nothing funny — ”
63144	63151	63153	63153	Hermione	180	“ Ginny ’s got a point , ”
63160	63184	63153	63153	Hermione	180	“ We ought to check that there ’s nothing odd about it . I mean , all these funny instructions , who knows ? ”
63185	63188	63190	63190	Harry	136	“ Hey ! ”
63212	63216	63217	63217	she	222	“ Specialis Revelio ! ”
63247	63250	63252	63252	Harry	136	“ Finished ? ”
63255	63270	63252	63252	Harry	136	“ Or d’you want to wait and see if it does a few backflips ? ”
63271	63277	63279	63279	Hermione	180	“ It seems all right , ”
63288	63303	63279	63279	Hermione	180	“ I mean , it really does seem to be ... just a textbook . ”
63304	63314	63316	63316	Harry	136	“ Good . Then I ’ll have it back , ”
63527	63529	63524	63524	she	180	“ official ”
63636	63640	63642	63642	Hermione	180	“ Or herself , ”
63662	63685	63653	63653	Ron	201	“ It might have been a girl . I think the handwriting looks more like a girl ’s than a boy ’s . ”
63686	63697	63698	63698	Harry	136	“ The Half - Blood Prince , he was called , ”
63701	63709	63698	63698	Harry	136	“ How many girls have been Princes ? ”
63765	63784	63744	63744	Harry	136	“ It ’s five to eight , I ’d better go , I ’ll be late for Dumbledore . ”
63785	63788	63790	63790	Hermione	180	“ Ooooh ! ”
63797	63815	63790	63790	Hermione	180	“ Good luck ! We ’ll wait up , we want to hear what he teaches you ! ”
63816	63822	63824	63824	Ron	201	“ Hope it goes okay , ”
63883	63890	63891	63891	she	301	“ Two of spades : conflict , ”
63905	63938	63891	63891	she	301	“ Seven of spades : an ill omen . Ten of spades : violence . Knave of spades : a dark young man , possibly troubled , one who dislikes the questioner — ”
63953	63962	63963	63963	she	301	“ Well , that ca n’t be right , ”
64026	64030	64032	64032	Harry	136	“ Acid Pops , ”
64087	64091	64093	64093	Dumbledore	138	“ Come in , ”
64097	64103	64105	64105	Harry	136	“ Good evening , sir , ”
64114	64125	64127	64127	Dumbledore	138	“ Ah , good evening , Harry . Sit down , ”
64131	64145	64127	64127	Dumbledore	138	“ I hope you ’ve had an enjoyable first week back at school ? ”
64146	64153	64155	64155	Harry	136	“ Yes , thanks , sir , ”
64157	64171	64155	64155	Harry	136	“ You must have been busy , a detention under your belt already ! ”
64172	64175	64177	64177	Harry	136	“ Er , ”
64188	64205	64181	64181	Dumbledore	138	“ I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead . ”
64206	64209	64211	64211	Harry	136	“ Right , ”
64321	64326	64328	64328	Dumbledore	138	“ So , Harry , ”
64335	64363	64328	64328	Dumbledore	138	“ You have been wondering , I am sure , what I have planned for you during these — for want of a better word — lessons ? ”
64364	64369	64445	64445	his	136	“ Yes , sir . ”
64370	64406	64328	64328	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , I have decided that it is time , now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago , for you to be given certain information . ”
64412	64431	64433	64433	Harry	136	“ You said , at the end of last term , you were going to tell me everything , ”
64448	64451	64452	64452	he	136	“ Sir , ”
64455	64461	64463	64463	Dumbledore	138	“ And so I did , ”
64466	64531	64463	64463	Dumbledore	138	“ I told you everything I know . From this point forth , we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork . From here on in , Harry , I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher , who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron . ”
64532	64540	64542	64542	Harry	136	“ But you think you ’re right ? ”
64544	64588	64542	64542	Harry	136	“ Naturally I do , but as I have already proven to you , I make mistakes like the next man . In fact , being — forgive me — rather cleverer than most men , my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger . ”
64589	64592	64594	64594	Harry	136	“ Sir , ”
64597	64621	64594	64594	Harry	136	“ does what you ’re going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy ? Will it help me ... survive ? ”
64622	64635	64637	64637	Dumbledore	138	“ It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy , ”
64654	64667	64643	64643	Harry	136	“ and I certainly hope that it will help you to survive . ”
64732	64737	64720	64720	He	138	“ You look worried . ”
64798	64818	64794	64794	Dumbledore	138	“ This time , you enter the Pensieve with me ... and , even more unusually , with permission . ”
64819	64827	64794	64794	Dumbledore	138	“ Where are we going , sir ? ”
64828	64839	64841	64841	Dumbledore	138	“ For a trip down Bob Ogden ’s memory lane , ”
64858	64864	64845	64845	his	138	“ Who was Bob Ogden ? ”
64865	64877	64879	64879	Dumbledore	138	“ He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement , ”
64881	64931	64879	64879	Dumbledore	138	“ He died some time ago , but not before I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me . We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties . If you will stand , Harry ... ”
64954	64962	64946	64946	His	138	“ Shall — shall I , sir ? ”
64963	64969	64970	64970	Dumbledore	138	“ No matter , Harry — ”
64983	64993	64994	64994	Harry	136	“ Sir — how did you injure your hand ? ”
65011	65034	65035	65035	Dumbledore	138	“ Now is not the moment for that story , Harry . Not yet . We have an appointment with Bob Ogden . ”
65058	65062	65064	65064	Dumbledore	138	“ After you , ”
65911	65917	65918	65922	The man standing before them	1709	“ You ’re not welcome . ”
65988	66002	65985	65985	he	335	“ Er — good morning . I ’m from the Ministry of Magic — ”
66003	66009	66040	66040	himself	1711	“ You ’re not welcome . ”
66010	66023	66025	66025	Ogden	335	“ Er — I ’m sorry — I do n’t understand you , ”
66069	66080	66082	66082	Dumbledore	138	“ You understand him , I ’m sure , Harry ? ”
66085	66091	66093	66093	Harry	136	“ Yes , of course , ”
66098	66105	66093	66093	Harry	136	“ Why ca n’t Ogden — ? ”
66123	66129	66142	66145	The man in rags	1712	“ He ’s speaking Parseltongue ? ”
66130	66134	66136	66136	Dumbledore	138	“ Very good , ”
66162	66167	66168	66168	Ogden	335	“ Now , look — ”
66202	66205	66211	66213	An elderly man	1713	“ Morfin ! ”
66311	66317	66319	66321	the older man	1717	“ Ministry , is it ? ”
66328	66331	66333	66333	Ogden	335	“ Correct ! ”
66340	66352	66333	66333	Ogden	335	“ And you , I take it , are Mr. Gaunt ? ”
66353	66356	66358	66358	Gaunt	337	“ S’right , ”
66360	66370	66358	66358	Gaunt	337	“ Got you in the face , did he ? ”
66371	66377	66379	66379	Ogden	335	“ Yes , he did ! ”
66381	66393	66395	66395	Gaunt	337	“ Should ’ve made your presence known , should n’t you ? ”
66398	66419	66395	66395	Gaunt	337	“ This is private property . Ca n’t just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself . ”
66420	66428	66430	66430	Ogden	335	“ Defend himself against what , man ? ”
66438	66447	66448	66448	Ogden	335	“ Busybodies . Intruders . Muggles and filth . ”
66490	66500	66477	66478	Mr. Gaunt	337	“ Get in the house . Do n’t argue . ”
66585	66599	66604	66604	he	335	“ It ’s your son I ’m here to see , Mr. Gaunt , ”
66618	66627	66604	66604	he	335	“ That was Morfin , was n’t it ? ”
66628	66635	66637	66639	the old man	1720	“ Ar , that was Morfin , ”
66642	66649	66650	66650	he	1720	“ Are you pure - blood ? ”
66656	66664	66666	66666	Ogden	335	“ That ’s neither here nor there , ”
66704	66724	66684	66684	He	1720	“ Now I come to think about it , I ’ve seen noses like yours down in the village . ”
66725	66742	66744	66744	Ogden	335	“ I do n’t doubt it , if your son ’s been let loose on them , ”
66746	66755	66744	66744	Ogden	335	“ Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside ? ”
66756	66759	66684	66684	He	1720	“ Inside ? ”
66760	66783	66684	66684	He	1720	“ Yes , Mr. Gaunt . I ’ve already told you . I ’m here about Morfin . We sent an owl — ”
66784	66792	66794	66794	Gaunt	337	“ I ’ve no use for owls , ”
66796	66803	66794	66794	Gaunt	337	“ I do n’t open letters . ”
66804	66818	66820	66820	Ogden	335	“ Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors , ”
66823	66846	66820	66820	Ogden	335	“ I am here following a serious breach of Wizarding law , which occurred here in the early hours of this morning — ”
66847	66857	66859	66859	Gaunt	337	“ All right , all right , all right ! ”
66861	66878	66859	66859	Gaunt	337	“ Come in the bleeding house , then , and much good it ’ll do you ! ”
67087	67092	67094	67094	Gaunt	337	“ M’daughter , Merope , ”
67104	67108	67110	67110	Ogden	335	“ Good morning , ”
67142	67148	67150	67150	Ogden	335	“ Well , Mr. Gaunt , ”
67152	67182	67150	67150	Ogden	335	“ to get straight to the point , we have reason to believe that your son , Morfin , performed magic in front of a Muggle late last night . ”
67197	67202	67203	67203	Gaunt	337	“ Pick it up ! ”
67208	67234	67203	67203	Gaunt	337	“ That ’s it , grub on the floor like some filthy Muggle , what ’s your wand for , you useless sack of muck ? ”
67235	67241	67243	67243	Ogden	335	“ Mr. Gaunt , please ! ”
67328	67339	67325	67325	Gaunt	337	“ Mend it , you pointless lump , mend it ! ”
67365	67368	67356	67356	Ogden	335	“ Reparo . ”
67406	67438	67400	67400	he	337	“ Lucky the nice man from the Ministry ’s here , is n’t it ? Perhaps he ’ll take you off my hands , perhaps he does n’t mind dirty Squibs ... ”
67498	67502	67503	67503	Ogden	335	“ Mr. Gaunt , ”
67507	67519	67503	67503	Ogden	335	“ as I ’ve said : the reason for my visit — ”
67520	67528	67530	67530	Gaunt	337	“ I heard you the first time ! ”
67532	67556	67530	67530	Gaunt	337	“ And so what ? Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him — what about it , then ? ”
67557	67564	67566	67566	Ogden	335	“ Morfin has broken Wizarding law , ”
67569	67578	67579	67579	Gaunt	337	“ ‘ Morfin has broken Wizarding law . ’ ”
67595	67612	67591	67591	Morfin	192	“ He taught a filthy Muggle a lesson , that ’s illegal now , is it ? ”
67613	67616	67618	67618	Ogden	335	“ Yes , ”
67620	67627	67628	67628	He	337	“ I ’m afraid it is . ”
67643	67653	67655	67655	Gaunt	337	“ What ’s that , then , his sentence ? ”
67662	67674	67657	67657	his	337	“ It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing — ”
67675	67692	67657	67657	his	337	“ Summons ! Summons ? Who do you think you are , summoning my son anywhere ? ”
67693	67704	67706	67706	Ogden	335	“ I ’m Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad , ”
67708	67719	67721	67721	Gaunt	337	“ And you think we ’re scum , do you ? ”
67740	67770	67721	67721	Gaunt	337	“ Scum who ’ll come running when the Ministry tells ’em to ? Do you know who you ’re talking to , you filthy little Mudblood , do you ? ”
67771	67785	67787	67787	Ogden	335	“ I was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr. Gaunt , ”
67797	67802	67804	67804	Gaunt	337	“ That ’s right ! ”
67850	67913	67824	67824	he	337	“ See this ? See this ? Know what it is ? Know where it came from ? Centuries it ’s been in our family , that ’s how far back we go , and pure - blood all the way ! Know how much I ’ve been offered for this , with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone ? ”
67914	67921	67923	67923	Ogden	335	“ I ’ve really no idea , ”
67937	67954	67923	67923	Ogden	335	“ and it ’s quite beside the point , Mr. Gaunt . Your son has committed — ”
68005	68009	68010	68010	he	136	“ See this ? ”
68031	68040	68042	68042	Ogden	335	“ I see it , I see it ! ”
68045	68049	68051	68051	Gaunt	337	“ Slytherin ’s ! ”
68053	68074	68051	68051	Gaunt	337	“ Salazar Slytherin ’s ! We ’re his last living descendants , what do you say to that , eh ? ”
68075	68082	68084	68084	Ogden	335	“ Mr. Gaunt , your daughter ! ”
68114	68117	68119	68119	Gaunt	337	“ So ! ”
68136	68171	68124	68124	he	337	“ Do n’t you go talking to us as if we ’re dirt on your shoes ! Generations of purebloods , wizards all — more than you can say , I do n’t doubt ! ”
68209	68213	68215	68215	Ogden	335	“ Mr. Gaunt , ”
68218	68257	68259	68259	he	335	“ I am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand . I am here because of Morfin , Morfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night . Our information ”
68268	68291	68259	68259	he	335	“ is that Morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said Muggle , causing him to erupt in highly painful hives . ”
68295	68301	68303	68303	Gaunt	337	“ Be quiet , boy , ”
68313	68323	68324	68324	Gaunt	337	“ And so what if he did , then ? ”
68330	68351	68324	68324	Gaunt	337	“ I expect you ’ve wiped the Muggle ’s filthy face clean for him , and his memory to boot — ”
68352	68365	68367	68367	Ogden	335	“ That ’s hardly the point , is it , Mr. Gaunt ? ”
68369	68379	68367	68367	Ogden	335	“ This was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless — ”
68380	68399	68401	68401	Gaunt	337	“ Ar , I had you marked out as a Muggle - lover the moment I saw you , ”
68411	68419	68421	68421	Ogden	335	“ This discussion is getting us nowhere , ”
68424	68442	68443	68443	He	335	“ It is clear from your son ’s attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions . ”
68453	68486	68487	68487	Ogden	335	“ Morfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and causing harm and distress to that same Mugg — ”
68567	68575	68578	68579	a girl	1147	“ My God , what an eyesore ! ”
68601	68614	68592	68592	she	1147	“ Could n’t your father have that hovel cleared away , Tom ? ”
68615	68621	68623	68625	a young man	1745	“ It ’s not ours , ”
68629	68676	68623	68625	a young man	1745	“ Everything on the other side of the valley belongs to us , but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called Gaunt , and his children . The son ’s quite mad , you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village — ”
68701	68706	68708	68709	his father	818	“ Keep your seat , ”
68715	68718	68720	68721	the girl	4700	“ Tom , ”
68737	68753	68720	68721	the girl	4700	“ I might be wrong — but has somebody nailed a snake to that door ? ”
68754	68762	68764	68765	the man	781	“ Good lord , you ’re right ! ”
68769	68797	68764	68765	the man	781	“ That ’ll be the son , I told you he ’s not right in the head . Do n’t look at it , Cecilia , darling . ”
68809	68814	68816	68816	Morfin	192	“ ‘ Darling , ’ ”
68825	68842	68816	68816	Morfin	192	“ ‘ Darling , ’ he called her . So he would n’t have you anyway . ”
68856	68861	68863	68863	Gaunt	337	“ What ’s that ? ”
68878	68886	68863	68863	Gaunt	337	“ What did you say , Morfin ? ”
68887	68895	68897	68897	Morfin	192	“ She likes looking at that Muggle , ”
68917	68941	68906	68906	he	192	“ Always in the garden when he passes , peering through the hedge at him , is n’t she ? And last night — ”
68956	68973	68951	68951	Morfin	192	“ Hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home , was n’t she ? ”
68974	68986	68988	68988	Gaunt	337	“ Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle ? ”
69019	69024	69026	69026	Gaunt	337	“ Is it true ? ”
69042	69064	69026	69026	Gaunt	337	“ My daughter — pure - blooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin — hankering after a filthy , dirt - veined Muggle ? ”
69082	69090	69092	69092	Morfin	192	“ But I got him , Father ! ”
69094	69120	69092	69092	Morfin	192	“ I got him as he went by and he did n’t look so pretty with hives all over him , did he , Merope ? ”
69121	69133	69135	69135	Gaunt	337	“ You disgusting little Squib , you filthy little blood traitor ! ”
69155	69158	69153	69153	Ogden	335	“ No ! ”
69171	69174	69164	69164	Ogden	335	“ Relashio ! ”
69344	69353	69355	69355	Dumbledore	138	“ I think that will do , Harry , ”
69393	69403	69405	69405	Harry	136	“ What happened to the girl in the cottage ? ”
69421	69430	69418	69418	his	138	“ Merope , or whatever her name was ? ”
69431	69437	69439	69439	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh , she survived , ”
69455	69531	69439	69439	Dumbledore	138	“ Ogden Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes . Morfin and his father attempted to fight , but both were overpowered , removed from the cottage , and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot . Morfin , who already had a record of Muggle attacks , was sentenced to three years in Azkaban . Marvolo , who had injured several Ministry employees in addition to Ogden , received six months . ”
69532	69535	69536	69536	Harry	136	“ Marvolo ? ”
69540	69545	69547	69547	Dumbledore	138	“ That ’s right , ”
69553	69564	69547	69547	Dumbledore	138	“ I am glad to see you ’re keeping up . ”
69565	69572	69439	69439	Dumbledore	138	“ That old man was — ? ”
69573	69580	69582	69582	Dumbledore	138	“ Voldemort ’s grandfather , yes , ”
69584	69707	69582	69582	Dumbledore	138	“ Marvolo , his son , Morfin , and his daughter , Merope , were the last of the Gaunts , a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins . Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born . He , as you saw , was left in squalor and poverty , with a very nasty temper , a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride , and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son , and rather more than his daughter . ”
69708	69712	69714	69714	Harry	136	“ So Merope , ”
69726	69743	69714	69714	Harry	136	“ so Merope was ... Sir , does that mean she was ... Voldemort ’s mother ? ”
69744	69748	69750	69750	Dumbledore	138	“ It does , ”
69752	69774	69750	69750	Dumbledore	138	“ And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort ’s father . I wonder whether you noticed ? ”
69775	69787	69714	69714	Harry	136	“ The Muggle Morfin attacked ? The man on the horse ? ”
69788	69793	69795	69795	Dumbledore	138	“ Very good indeed , ”
69799	69832	69795	69795	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , that was Tom Riddle senior , the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret , burning passion . ”
69833	69840	69841	69841	Harry	136	“ And they ended up married ? ”
69858	69865	69867	69867	Dumbledore	138	“ I think you are forgetting , ”
69869	69953	69867	69867	Dumbledore	138	“ that Merope was a witch . I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father . Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban , once she was alone and free for the first time in her life , then , I am sure , she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years . “
69982	69983	69955	69955	you	1769	” “
69988	69992	69955	69955	you	1769	” Harry suggested . “
69998	69999	69955	69955	you	1769	” “
70109	70165	70107	70107	Merope	329	“ But the villagers ’ shock was nothing to Marvolo ’s . He returned from Azkaban , expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table . Instead , he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell , explaining what she had done . “
70231	70232	70225	70225	Morfin	192	” “
70254	70255	70247	70247	Voldemort	179	” “
70260	70264	70247	70247	Voldemort	179	” said Dumbledore . “
70415	70416	70407	70407	he	345	” “
70424	70425	70407	70407	he	345	” “

70452	70456	70436	70437	Tom Riddle	345	” asked Harry . “
70465	70466	70436	70437	Tom Riddle	345	” “
70473	70477	70436	70437	Tom Riddle	345	” said Dumbledore , “
70585	70607	70608	70608	I	0	” The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Dumbledore ’s office seemed to glow more brightly than before . “
70618	70627	70616	70616	Harry	136	” said Dumbledore after a moment or two . “
70632	70647	70648	70648	Sir	4356	” said Harry . He got to his feet , but did not leave . “
70662	70663	70667	70667	I	0	” “
70670	70674	70667	70667	I	0	” said Dumbledore . “

70703	70735	70736	70736	Sir	4356	” said Harry , a little confused , but reassured all the same . He turned to go , then another question occurred to him , and he turned back again . “
70752	70763	70747	70747	you	4356	” Dumbledore considered him for a moment , then said , “
70825	70826	70820	70821	Lord Voldemort	179	” “
70845	70897	70898	70898	Sir	4356	” He turned away again , and was almost at the door when he saw it . Sitting on one of the little spindle - legged tables that supported so many frail - looking silver instruments , was an ugly gold ring set with a large , cracked , black stone . “
70900	70908	70898	70898	Sir	4356	” said Harry , staring at it . “
70912	70913	70898	70898	Sir	4356	” “
70916	70920	70898	70898	Sir	4356	” said Dumbledore . “

70939	70943	70936	70936	I	0	” Dumbledore agreed . “
70962	70968	70957	70958	Marvolo Gaunt	344	” Dumbledore bowed his head . “
70973	70974	70957	70958	Marvolo Gaunt	344	” “

71408	71417	71419	71419	Hermione	180	“ We ’ve got to go and explain , ”
71439	71448	71450	71450	Ron	201	“ We ’ve got Quidditch tryouts this morning ! ”
71452	71484	71450	71450	Ron	201	“ And we ’re supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti Charm from Flitwick ! Anyway , explain what ? How are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject ? ”
71485	71492	71494	71494	Hermione	180	“ We did n’t hate it ! ”
71496	71508	71510	71510	Ron	201	“ Speak for yourself , I have n’t forgotten the skrewts , ”
71513	71556	71510	71510	Ron	201	“ And I ’m telling you now , we ’ve had a narrow escape . You did n’t hear him going on about his gormless brother — we ’d have been teaching Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if we ’d stayed . ”
71557	71565	71567	71567	Hermione	180	“ I hate not talking to Hagrid , ”
71572	71580	71581	71581	Harry	136	“ We ’ll go down after Quidditch , ”
71607	71623	71624	71624	He	136	“ But trials might take all morning , the number of people who have applied . ”
71637	71651	71624	71624	He	136	“ I dunno why the team ’s this popular all of a sudden . ”
71652	71660	71662	71662	Hermione	180	“ Oh , come on , Harry , ”
71667	71697	71662	71662	Hermione	180	“ It ’s not Quidditch that ’s popular , it ’s you ! You ’ve never been more interesting , and frankly , you ’ve never been more fanciable . ”
71720	71797	71798	71798	Harry	136	“ Everyone knows you ’ve been telling the truth now , do n’t they ? The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about Voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times . And now they ’re calling you ‘ the Chosen One ’ — well , come on , ca n’t you see why people are fascinated by you ? ”
71821	71879	71926	71926	Hermione	180	“ And you ’ve been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar . You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood , but you stuck to your story anyway ... ”
71880	71898	71900	71900	Ron	201	“ You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry , look , ”
71907	71925	71926	71926	Hermione	180	“ And it does n’t hurt that you ’ve grown about a foot over the summer either , ”
71932	71937	71939	71939	Ron	201	“ I ’m tall , ”
72090	72093	72095	72095	Harry	136	“ Ha ! ”
72117	72121	72123	72123	Hermione	180	“ Oh good , ”
72127	72137	72123	72123	Hermione	180	“ Now you can give that graffitied copy back . ”
72138	72143	72145	72145	Harry	136	“ Are you mad ? ”
72147	72161	72162	72162	He	136	“ I ’m keeping it ! Look , I ’ve thought it out — ”
72186	72189	72181	72181	his	136	“ Diffindo ! ”
72224	72227	72212	72212	He	136	“ Reparo ! ”
72256	72276	72277	72277	Hermione	180	“ I ’ll give Slughorn back the new one , he ca n’t complain , it cost nine Galleons . ”
72320	72326	72328	72328	Ron	201	“ Anyone we know dead ? ”
72347	72358	72360	72360	Hermione	180	“ No , but there have been more dementor attacks , ”
72362	72367	72360	72360	Hermione	180	“ And an arrest . ”
72368	72373	72375	72375	Harry	136	“ Excellent , who ? ”
72382	72386	72388	72388	Hermione	180	“ Stan Shunpike , ”
72390	72393	72395	72395	Harry	136	“ What ? ”
72399	72445	72395	72395	Harry	136	“ ‘ Stanley Shunpike , conductor on the popular Wizarding conveyance the Knight Bus , has been arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity . Mr. Shunpike , 21 , was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his Clapham home ... ’ ”
72446	72454	72456	72456	Harry	136	“ Stan Shunpike , a Death Eater ? ”
72470	72474	72459	72468	the spotty youth he had first met three years before	1824	“ No way ! ”
72475	72486	72488	72488	Ron	201	“ He might have been put under the Imperius Curse , ”
72491	72497	72488	72488	Ron	201	“ You never can tell . ”
72498	72506	72508	72508	Hermione	180	“ It does n’t look like it , ”
72515	72538	72539	72539	She	180	“ It says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters ’ secret plans in a pub . ”
72550	72572	72539	72539	She	180	“ If he was under the Imperius Curse , he ’d hardly stand around gossiping about their plans , would he ? ”
72573	72590	72592	72592	Ron	201	“ It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did , ”
72594	72620	72592	72592	Ron	201	“ Is n’t he the one who claimed he was going to become Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela ? ”
72621	72628	72630	72630	Harry	136	“ Yeah , that ’s him , ”
72632	72645	72630	72630	Harry	136	“ I dunno what they ’re playing at , taking Stan seriously . ”
72646	72659	72661	72661	Hermione	180	“ They probably want to look as though they ’re doing something , ”
72665	72699	72661	72661	Hermione	180	“ People are terrified — you know the Patil twins ’ parents want them to go home ? And Eloise Midgen has already been withdrawn . Her father picked her up last night . ”
72700	72703	72705	72705	Ron	201	“ What ! ”
72711	72742	72705	72705	Ron	201	“ But Hogwarts is safer than their homes , bound to be ! We ’ve got Aurors , and all those extra protective spells , and we ’ve got Dumbledore ! ”
72743	72756	72758	72758	Hermione	180	“ I do n’t think we ’ve got him all the time , ”
72774	72794	72795	72795	Harry	136	“ Have n’t you noticed ? His seat ’s been empty as often as Hagrid ’s this past week . ”
72834	72849	72851	72851	Hermione	180	“ I think he ’s left the school to do something with the Order , ”
72857	72871	72851	72851	Hermione	180	“ I mean ... it ’s all looking serious , is n’t it ? ”
73165	73178	73179	73179	he	136	“ We met on the train , in old Sluggy ’s compartment , ”
73194	73200	73179	73179	he	136	“ Cormac McLaggen , Keeper . ”
73201	73213	73215	73215	Harry	136	“ You did n’t try out last year , did you ? ”
73239	73252	73254	73254	McLaggen	276	“ I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials , ”
73262	73273	73254	73254	McLaggen	276	“ Ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet . ”
73274	73277	73279	73279	Harry	136	“ Right , ”
73281	73290	73279	73279	Harry	136	“ Well ... if you wait over there ... ”
73332	73336	73318	73318	McLaggen	276	“ old Sluggy ’s ”
73517	73530	73532	73532	Harry	136	“ If there ’s anyone else here who ’s not from Gryffindor , ”
73542	73548	73532	73532	Harry	136	“ leave now , please ! ”
73674	73698	73699	73699	he	136	“ That ’s my final decision and if you do n’t get out of the way for the Keepers I ’ll hex you , ”
73987	73991	74011	74012	Lavender Brown	310	“ Good luck ! ”
74130	74138	74140	74140	McLaggen	276	“ His sister did n’t really try , ”
74163	74171	74154	74154	Harry	136	“ She gave him an easy save . ”
74172	74175	74177	74177	Harry	136	“ Rubbish , ”
74180	74189	74177	74177	Harry	136	“ That was the one he nearly missed . ”
74204	74210	74190	74190	McLaggen	276	“ Give me another go . ”
74211	74214	74216	74216	Harry	136	“ No , ”
74218	74250	74216	74216	Harry	136	“ You ’ve had your go . You saved four . Ron saved five . Ron ’s Keeper , he won it fair and square . Get out of my way . ”
74295	74299	74300	74300	he	136	“ Well done , ”
74303	74309	74300	74300	he	136	“ You flew really well — ”
74310	74317	74323	74323	Hermione	180	“ You did brilliantly , Ron ! ”
74447	74459	74460	74460	Ron	201	“ I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty , ”
74465	74483	74460	74460	Ron	201	“ Tricky shot from Demelza , did you see , had a bit of spin on it — ”
74484	74493	74495	74495	Hermione	180	“ Yes , yes , you were magnificent , ”
74500	74509	74511	74511	Ron	201	“ I was better than that McLaggen anyway , ”
74518	74540	74511	74511	Ron	201	“ Did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth ? Looked like he ’d been Confunded ... ”
74610	74614	74616	74616	Hermione	180	“ Oh dear , ”
74619	74631	74616	74616	Hermione	180	“ He ’s still a bit scary , is n’t he ? ”
74632	74646	74648	74648	Ron	201	“ Come off it , you ’ve ridden him , have n’t you ? ”
74678	74683	74684	74684	Harry	136	“ How are you ? ”
74700	74716	74684	74684	Harry	136	“ Missing him ? But you ’re okay here with Hagrid , are n’t you ? ”
74717	74720	74726	74726	Hagrid	177	“ Oi ! ”
74768	74787	74788	74788	Fang	361	“ Git away from him ! He ’ll have yer fingers — oh . It ’s yeh lot . ”
74829	74833	74835	74835	Hermione	180	“ Oh dear ! ”
74840	74847	74849	74849	Harry	136	“ Do n’t worry about it , ”
74862	74875	74852	74852	He	136	“ Hagrid ! Open up , we want to talk to you ! ”
74883	74898	74899	74899	Harry	136	“ If you do n’t open the door , we ’ll blast it open ! ”
74907	74910	74912	74912	Hermione	180	“ Harry ! ”
74917	74923	74912	74912	Hermione	180	“ You ca n’t possibly — ”
74924	74930	74932	74932	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I can ! ”
74934	74938	74932	74932	Harry	136	“ Stand back — ”
74979	74985	74986	74986	he	177	“ I ’m a teacher ! ”
74991	75007	74986	74986	he	177	“ A teacher , Potter ! How dare yeh threaten ter break down my door ! ”
75008	75015	75017	75017	Harry	136	“ I ’m sorry , sir , ”
75036	75047	75032	75032	Hagrid	177	“ Since when have yeh called me ‘ sir ’ ? ”
75048	75059	74986	74986	he	177	“ Since when have you called me ‘ Potter ’ ? ”
75060	75066	75068	75068	Hagrid	177	“ Oh , very clever , ”
75070	75094	75098	75098	he	177	“ Very amusin ’ . That ’s me outsmarted , innit ? All righ ’ , come in then , yeh ungrateful little ... ”
75116	75119	75121	75121	Hagrid	177	“ Well ? ”
75155	75173	75139	75139	Fang	361	“ What ’s this ? Feelin ’ sorry for me ? Reckon I ’m lonely or summat ? ”
75174	75177	75179	75179	Harry	136	“ No , ”
75183	75190	75179	75179	Harry	136	“ We wanted to see you . ”
75191	75197	75199	75199	Hermione	180	“ We ’ve missed you ! ”
75202	75209	75211	75211	Hagrid	177	“ Missed me , have yeh ? ”
75213	75219	75220	75220	He	177	“ Yeah . Righ ’ . ”
75280	75283	75289	75289	he	136	“ Hagrid , ”
75316	75332	75333	75333	Hagrid	177	“ we really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures , you know . ”
75361	75365	75367	75367	Hermione	180	“ We did ! ”
75369	75381	75367	75367	Hermione	180	“ But none of us could fit it into our schedules ! ”
75382	75388	75390	75390	Hagrid	177	“ Yeah . Righ ’ , ”
75459	75466	75468	75468	Harry	136	“ What are they , Hagrid ? ”
75488	75494	75496	75496	Hagrid	177	“ Jus ’ giant grubs , ”
75498	75505	75507	75507	Ron	201	“ And they grow into ... ? ”
75512	75520	75522	75522	Hagrid	177	“ They won ’ grow inter nuthin’ , ”
75524	75533	75522	75522	Hagrid	177	“ I got ’em ter feed ter Aragog . ”
75543	75546	75548	75548	Hermione	180	“ Hagrid ! ”
75576	75581	75548	75548	Hermione	180	“ What is it ? ”
75582	75588	75590	75590	Hagrid	177	“ It ’s ... him ... ”
75607	75656	75599	75599	he	177	“ It ’s ... Aragog ... I think he ’s dyin ’ ... He got ill over the summer an ’ he ’s not gettin ’ better ... I don ’ know what I ’ll do if he ... if he ... We ’ve bin tergether so long ... ”
75758	75769	75770	75770	Hermione	180	“ Is there — is there anything we can do ? ”
75783	75793	75795	75795	Hagrid	177	“ I don ’ think there is , Hermione , ”
75806	75835	75795	75795	Hagrid	177	“ See , the rest o ’ the tribe ... Aragog ’s family ... they ’re gettin ’ a bit funny now he ’s ill ... bit restive ... ”
75836	75851	75853	75853	Ron	201	“ Yeah , I think we saw a bit of that side of them , ”
75858	75884	75885	75885	Hagrid	177	“ . . . I don ’ reckon it ’d be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo ’ , ”
75899	75913	75889	75889	his	177	“ But thanks fer offerin ’ , Hermione ... It means a lot ... ”
75968	75985	75986	75986	he	177	“ Ar , I always knew yeh’d find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables , ”
75995	76005	75986	75986	he	177	“ Even if yeh applied fer Time - Turners — ”
76006	76013	76015	76015	Hermione	180	“ We could n’t have done , ”
76017	76042	76015	76015	Hermione	180	“ We smashed the entire stock of Ministry Time - Turners when we were there last summer . It was in the Daily Prophet . ”
76043	76049	76051	76051	Hagrid	177	“ Ar , well then , ”
76053	76102	76051	76051	Hagrid	177	“ There ’s no way yeh could ’ve done it ... I ’m sorry I ’ve bin — yeh know — I ’ve jus ’ bin worried abou ’ Aragog ... an ’ I did wonder whether , if Professor Grubbly - Plank had bin teachin ’ yeh — ”
76154	76159	76161	76161	Harry	136	“ I ’m starving , ”
76199	76219	76181	76181	he	136	“ And I ’ve got that detention with Snape tonight , I have n’t got much time for dinner ... ”
76280	76283	76285	76285	Hermione	180	“ What ? ”
76288	76294	76296	76296	Harry	136	“ If you ask me , ”
76299	76322	76296	76296	Harry	136	“ McLaggen looks like he was Confunded this morning . And he was standing right in front of where you were sitting . ”
76326	76337	76338	76338	she	180	“ Oh , all right then , I did it , ”
76341	76390	76338	76338	she	180	“ But you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny ! Anyway , he ’s got a nasty temper , you saw how he reacted when he did n’t get in — you would n’t have wanted someone like that on the team . ”
76391	76394	76396	76396	Harry	136	“ No , ”
76398	76427	76396	76396	Harry	136	“ No , I suppose that ’s true . But was n’t that dishonest , Hermione ? I mean , you ’re a prefect , are n’t you ? ”
76428	76434	76435	76435	she	180	“ Oh , be quiet , ”
76442	76449	76451	76451	Ron	201	“ What are you two doing ? ”
76465	76468	76470	76470	Harry	136	“ Nothing , ”
76518	76532	76533	76533	he	200	“ Harry , Harry , just the man I was hoping to see ! ”
76551	76639	76533	76533	he	200	“ I was hoping to catch you before dinner ! What do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead ? We ’re having a little party , just a few rising stars , I ’ve got McLaggen coming and Zabini , the charming Melinda Bobbin — I do n’t know whether you know her ? Her family owns a large chain of apothecaries — and , of course , I hope very much that Miss Granger will favor me by coming too . ”
76670	76678	76680	76680	Harry	136	“ I ca n’t come , Professor , ”
76684	76694	76680	76680	Harry	136	“ I ’ve got a detention with Professor Snape . ”
76695	76699	76701	76701	Slughorn	200	“ Oh dear ! ”
76708	76764	76765	76765	He	200	“ Dear , dear , I was counting on you , Harry ! Well , now , I ’ll just have to have a word with Severus and explain the situation . I ’m sure I ’ll be able to persuade him to postpone your detention . Yes , I ’ll see you both later ! ”
76773	76783	76785	76785	Harry	136	“ He ’s got no chance of persuading Snape , ”
76795	76820	76785	76785	Harry	136	“ This detention ’s already been postponed once ; Snape did it for Dumbledore , but he wo n’t do it for anyone else . ”
76821	76840	76848	76848	she	180	“ Oh , I wish you could come , I do n’t want to go on my own ! ”
76854	76867	76869	76869	Ron	201	“ I doubt you ’ll be alone , Ginny’ll probably be invited , ”
76969	76973	76975	76975	Harry	136	“ Anything new ? ”
76977	76981	76975	76975	Harry	136	“ Not really ... ”
76994	77012	77013	77013	she	180	“ Oh , look , your dad ’s in here , Ron — he ’s all right ! ”
77025	77090	77018	77018	Ron	201	“ It just says he ’s been to visit the Malfoys ’ house . ‘ This second search of the Death Eater ’s residence does not seem to have yielded any results . Arthur Weasley of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that his team had been acting upon a confidential tip - off . ’ ”
77091	77096	77098	77098	Harry	136	“ Yeah , mine ! ”
77100	77144	77098	77098	Harry	136	“ I told him at King ’s Cross about Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix ! Well , if it ’s not at their house , he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him — ”
77145	77155	77157	77157	Hermione	180	“ But how can he have done , Harry ? ”
77168	77181	77157	77157	Hermione	180	“ We were all searched when we arrived , were n’t we ? ”
77182	77186	77188	77188	Harry	136	“ Were you ? ”
77193	77198	77188	77188	Harry	136	“ I was n’t ! ”
77199	77267	77268	77268	Momentarily	367	“ Oh no , of course you were n’t , I forgot you were late ... Well , Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors when we got into the entrance hall . Any Dark object would have been found , I know for a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated . So you see , Malfoy ca n’t have brought in anything dangerous ! ”
77292	77304	77305	77305	he	136	“ Someone ’s sent it to him by owl , then , ”
77308	77314	77305	77305	he	136	“ His mother or someone . ”
77315	77324	77326	77326	Hermione	180	“ All the owls are being checked too , ”
77328	77345	77326	77326	Hermione	180	“ Filch told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he could reach . ”
77399	77409	77389	77389	his	201	“ Can you think of any way Malfoy — ? ”
77410	77418	77420	77420	Ron	201	“ Oh , drop it , Harry , ”
77422	77450	77452	77452	Harry	136	“ Listen , it ’s not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione and me to his stupid party , neither of us wanted to go , you know ! ”
77457	77469	77471	77471	Ron	201	“ Well , as I ’m not invited to any parties , ”
77479	77488	77471	77471	Ron	201	“ I think I ’ll go to bed . ”
77509	77512	77514	77516	the new Chaser	1913	“ Harry ? ”
77527	77536	77514	77516	the new Chaser	1913	“ I ’ve got a message for you . ”
77537	77542	77544	77544	Harry	136	“ From Professor Slughorn ? ”
77550	77557	77559	77559	Demelza	356	“ No ... from Professor Snape , ”
77566	77633	77561	77561	Harry	136	“ He says you ’re to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detention — er — no matter how many party invitations you ’ve received . And he wanted you to know you ’ll be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones , to use in Potions and — and he says there ’s no need to bring protective gloves . ”
77634	77637	77639	77639	Harry	136	“ Right , ”
77642	77649	77639	77639	Harry	136	“ Thanks a lot , Demelza . ”
78208	78211	78212	78212	Harry	136	“ nonverbal . ”
78289	78292	78275	78275	he	136	“ Aaaaaaaargh ! ”
78349	78352	78354	78354	Harry	136	“ Sorry ! ”
78379	78389	78390	78390	He	136	“ Hang on — I ’ll let you down — ”
78460	78463	78465	78465	Harry	136	“ Sorry , ”
78478	78481	78483	78483	Ron	201	“ Tomorrow , ”
78489	78499	78483	78483	Ron	201	“ I ’d rather you set the alarm clock . ”
78572	78592	78593	78593	Ron	201	“ . . . and then there was another flash of light and I landed on the bed again ! ”
78622	78640	78641	78641	she	180	“ Was this spell , by any chance , another one from that potion book of yours ? ”
78649	78661	78644	78644	Harry	136	“ Always jump to the worst conclusion , do n’t you ? ”
78662	78666	78601	78601	Hermione	180	“ Was it ? ”
78667	78679	78644	78644	Harry	136	“ Well ... yeah , it was , but so what ? ”
78680	78699	78644	78644	Harry	136	“ So you just decided to try out an unknown , handwritten incantation and see what would happen ? ”
78700	78710	78712	78712	Harry	136	“ Why does it matter if it ’s handwritten ? ”
78724	78736	78738	78738	Hermione	180	“ Because it ’s probably not Ministry of Magic – approved , ”
78740	78744	78745	78745	she	180	“ And also , ”
78756	78771	78745	78745	she	180	“ because I ’m starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy . ”
78782	78788	78790	78790	Ron	201	“ It was a laugh ! ”
78800	78811	78790	78790	Ron	201	“ Just a laugh , Hermione , that ’s all ! ”
78812	78821	78823	78823	Hermione	180	“ Dangling people upside down by the ankle ? ”
78825	78839	78823	78823	Hermione	180	“ Who puts their time and energy into making up spells like that ? ”
78840	78845	78847	78847	Ron	201	“ Fred and George , ”
78851	78863	78847	78847	Ron	201	“ it ’s their kind of thing . And , er — ”
78864	78868	78870	78870	Harry	136	“ My dad , ”
78878	78881	78883	78883	Ron	201	“ What ? ”
78888	78895	78897	78897	Harry	136	“ My dad used this spell , ”
78899	78906	78897	78897	Harry	136	“ I — Lupin told me . ”
78965	78975	78977	78977	Hermione	180	“ Maybe your dad did use it , Harry , ”
78979	79020	78977	78977	Hermione	180	“ but he ’s not the only one . We ’ve seen a whole bunch of people use it , in case you ’ve forgotten . Dangling people in the air . Making them float along , asleep , helpless . ”
79052	79057	79058	79058	he	201	“ That was different , ”
79062	79087	79088	79088	he	201	“ They were abusing it . Harry and his dad were just having a laugh . You do n’t like the Prince , Hermione , ”
79098	79108	79088	79088	he	201	“ because he ’s better than you at Potions — ”
79109	79119	79121	79121	Hermione	180	“ It ’s got nothing to do with that ! ”
79127	79190	79121	79121	Hermione	180	“ I just think it ’s very irresponsible to start performing spells when you do n’t even know what they ’re for , and stop talking about ‘ the Prince ’ as if it ’s his title , I bet it ’s just a stupid nickname , and it does n’t seem as though he was a very nice person to me ! ”
79191	79202	79204	79204	Harry	136	“ I do n’t see where you get that from , ”
79207	79233	79204	79204	Harry	136	“ If he ’d been a budding Death Eater he would n’t have been boasting about being ‘ half - blood , ’ would he ? ”
79268	79290	79292	79292	Hermione	180	“ The Death Eaters ca n’t all be pure - blood , there are n’t enough pure - blood wizards left , ”
79295	79332	79292	79292	Hermione	180	“ I expect most of them are half - bloods pretending to be pure . It ’s only Muggle - borns they hate , they ’d be quite happy to let you and Ron join up . ”
79333	79347	79349	79349	Ron	201	“ There is no way they ’d let me be a Death Eater ! ”
79374	79394	79368	79369	Ernie Macmillan	320	“ My whole family are blood traitors ! That ’s as bad as Muggle - borns to Death Eaters ! ”
79395	79404	79406	79406	Harry	136	“ And they ’d love to have me , ”
79409	79426	79406	79406	Harry	136	“ We ’d be best pals if they did n’t keep trying to do me in . ”
79449	79462	79447	79447	Ginny	222	“ Hey , Harry , I ’m supposed to give you this . ”
79483	79495	79496	79496	Harry	136	“ Thanks , Ginny ... It ’s Dumbledore ’s next lesson ! ”
79512	79516	79517	79517	He	136	“ Monday evening ! ”
79524	79534	79535	79535	he	136	“ Want to join us in Hogsmeade , Ginny ? ”
79538	79550	79551	79551	she	180	“ I ’m going with Dean — might see you there , ”
79605	79618	79620	79620	Ron	201	“ What does it matter if we ’re smuggling Dark stuff OUT ? ”
79631	79644	79645	79645	His	201	“ Surely you ought to be checking what we bring back IN ? ”
79798	79802	79804	79804	Ron	201	“ Thank God , ”
79817	79825	79804	79804	Ron	201	“ Let ’s stay here all afternoon . ”
79826	79831	79804	79804	Ron	201	“ Harry , m’boy ! ”
79840	79844	79846	79846	Harry	136	“ Oh no , ”
79891	79906	79908	79908	Slughorn	200	“ Harry , that ’s three of my little suppers you ’ve missed now ! ”
79917	79941	79908	79908	Slughorn	200	“ It wo n’t do , m’boy , I ’m determined to have you ! Miss Granger loves them , do n’t you ? ”
79942	79945	79947	79947	Hermione	180	“ Yes , ”
79950	79955	79947	79947	Hermione	180	“ they ’re really — ”
79956	79967	79969	79969	Slughorn	200	“ So why do n’t you come along , Harry ? ”
79971	79982	79984	79984	Harry	136	“ Well , I ’ve had Quidditch practice , Professor , ”
80035	80053	80055	80055	Slughorn	200	“ Well , I certainly expect you to win your first match after all this hard work ! ”
80057	80084	80055	80055	Slughorn	200	“ But a little recreation never hurt anybody . Now , how about Monday night , you ca n’t possibly want to practice in this weather ... ”
80085	80106	80137	80137	he	200	“ I ca n’t , Professor , I ’ve got — er — an appointment with Professor Dumbledore that evening . ”
80107	80111	80113	80113	Slughorn	200	“ Unlucky again ! ”
80116	80130	80113	80113	Slughorn	200	“ Ah , well ... you ca n’t evade me forever , Harry ! ”
80161	80174	80176	80176	Hermione	180	“ I ca n’t believe you ’ve wriggled out of another one , ”
80182	80199	80176	80176	Hermione	180	“ They ’re not that bad , you know ... They ’re even quite fun sometimes ... ”
80210	80227	80202	80202	she	180	“ Oh , look — they ’ve got deluxe sugar quills — those would last hours ! ”
80276	80285	80287	80287	Harry	136	“ Let ’s go to the Three Broomsticks , ”
80289	80295	80287	80287	Harry	136	“ It ’ll be warm . ”
80443	80446	80436	80436	Harry	136	“ Mundungus ! ”
80485	80494	80496	80497	Mundungus Fletcher	215	“ Oh , ’ ello , ’ Arry , ”
80507	80517	80519	80519	he	215	“ Well , do n’t let me keep ya . ”
80543	80550	80552	80552	Harry	136	“ Are you selling this stuff ? ”
80568	80579	80581	80581	Mundungus	215	“ Oh , well , got ta scrape a living , ”
80583	80587	80581	80581	Mundungus	215	“ Gimme that ! ”
80598	80602	80603	80603	Ron	201	“ Hang on , ”
80607	80612	80603	80603	Ron	201	“ This looks familiar — ”
80613	80617	80619	80619	Mundungus	215	“ Thank you ! ”
80637	80648	80649	80649	Harry	136	“ Well , I ’ll see you all — OUCH ! ”
80676	80679	80681	80681	Hermione	180	“ Harry ! ”
80683	80692	80694	80694	Harry	136	“ You took that from Sirius ’s house , ”
80717	80727	80694	80694	Harry	136	“ That had the Black family crest on it . ”
80728	80736	80738	80738	Mundungus	215	“ I — no — what — ? ”
80746	80763	80765	80765	Harry	136	“ What did you do , go back the night he died and strip the place ? ”
80767	80772	80765	80765	Harry	136	“ I — no — ”
80773	80779	80789	80789	Hermione	180	“ Give it to me ! ”
80780	80787	80789	80789	Hermione	180	“ Harry , you must n’t ! ”
80851	80859	80831	80831	Harry	136	“ COME BACK , YOU THIEVING — ! ”
80860	80868	80869	80869	Tonks	210	“ There ’s no point , Harry . ”
80883	80899	80869	80869	Tonks	210	“ Mundungus will probably be in London by now . There ’s no point yelling . ”
80900	80911	80831	80831	Harry	136	“ He ’s nicked Sirius ’s stuff ! Nicked it ! ”
80912	80918	80920	80920	Tonks	210	“ Yes , but still , ”
80932	80941	80920	80920	Tonks	210	“ You should get out of the cold . ”
80964	80972	80960	80960	Harry	136	“ He was nicking Sirius ’s stuff ! ”
80973	80989	80991	80991	Hermione	180	“ I know , Harry , but please do n’t shout , people are staring , ”
80993	81006	80991	80991	Hermione	180	“ Go and sit down , I ’ll get you a drink . ”
81027	81035	81036	81036	Harry	136	“ Ca n’t the Order control Mundungus ? ”
81047	81068	81036	81036	Harry	136	“ Ca n’t they at least stop him stealing everything that ’s not fixed down when he ’s at headquarters ? ”
81069	81072	81074	81074	Hermione	180	“ Shh ! ”
81115	81134	81105	81105	Zabini	275	“ Harry , I ’d be annoyed too , I know it ’s your things he ’s stealing — ”
81154	81162	81163	81163	he	136	“ Yeah , it ’s my stuff ! ”
81166	81199	81163	81163	he	136	“ No wonder he was n’t pleased to see me ! Well , I ’m going to tell Dumbledore what ’s going on , he ’s the only one who scares Mundungus . ”
81200	81204	81206	81206	Hermione	180	“ Good idea , ”
81216	81225	81163	81163	he	136	“ Ron , what are you staring at ? ”
81226	81229	81231	81231	Ron	201	“ Nothing , ”
81270	81284	81286	81286	Hermione	180	“ I expect ‘ nothing ’s ’ in the back getting more firewhisky , ”
81354	81369	81351	81351	she	180	“ Shall we call it a day and go back to school , then ? ”
81555	81566	81569	81569	Katie	314	“ It ’s nothing to do with you , Leanne ! ”
81852	81856	81857	81857	he	136	“ Stay there ! ”
81867	81874	81857	81857	he	136	“ I ’m going for help ! ”
81926	81929	81930	81930	he	136	“ Hagrid ! ”
81944	81947	81949	81949	Hagrid	177	“ Harry ! ”
81971	81990	81964	81964	his	177	“ Jus ’ bin visitin ’ Grawp , he ’s comin ’ on so well yeh wouldn ’ — ”
81991	82006	82013	82013	Hagrid	177	“ Hagrid , someone ’s hurt back there , or cursed , or something — ”
82007	82011	82013	82013	Hagrid	177	“ Wha ’ ? ”
82028	82034	82036	82036	Harry	136	“ Someone ’s been cursed ! ”
82038	82051	82036	82036	Harry	136	“ Cursed ? Who ’s bin cursed — not Ron ? Hermione ? ”
82052	82068	82020	82020	Harry	136	“ No , it ’s not them , it ’s Katie Bell — this way ... ”
82115	82119	82121	82121	Hagrid	177	“ Get back ! ”
82123	82128	82121	82121	Hagrid	177	“ Lemme see her ! ”
82129	82136	82138	82138	Leanne	371	“ Something ’s happened to her ! ”
82140	82147	82138	82138	Leanne	371	“ I do n’t know what — ”
82215	82224	82225	82226	The girl	4700	“ It ’s Leanne , is n’t it ? ”
82229	82242	82225	82226	The girl	4700	“ Did it just happen all of a sudden , or — ? ”
82243	82251	82253	82253	Leanne	371	“ It was when that package tore , ”
82296	82302	82303	82303	He	136	“ Do n’t touch it ! ”
82320	82327	82329	82329	Harry	136	“ I ’ve seen that before , ”
82336	82361	82362	82362	He	136	“ It was on display in Borgin and Burkes ages ago . The label said it was cursed . Katie must have touched it . ”
82375	82384	82362	82362	He	136	“ How did Katie get hold of this ? ”
82385	82451	82452	82452	Leanne	371	“ Well , that ’s why we were arguing . She came back from the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks holding it , said it was a surprise for somebody at Hogwarts and she had to deliver it . She looked all funny when she said it ... Oh no , oh no , I bet she ’d been Imperiused and I did n’t realize ! ”
82464	82478	82458	82458	Hermione	180	“ She did n’t say who ’d given it to her , Leanne ? ”
82479	82526	82527	82527	Leanne	371	“ No ... she would n’t tell me ... and I said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school , but she just would n’t listen and ... and then I tried to grab it from her ... and — and — ”
82535	82544	82546	82546	Hermione	180	“ We ’d better get up to school , ”
82554	82569	82548	82548	her	180	“ We ’ll be able to find out how she is . Come on ... ”
82602	82613	82614	82614	he	136	“ We ’ll need to show this to Madam Pomfrey , ”
82652	82714	82639	82639	he	136	“ Malfoy knows about this necklace . It was in a case at Borgin and Burkes four years ago , I saw him having a good look at it while I was hiding from him and his dad . This is what he was buying that day when we followed him ! He remembered it and he went back for it ! ”
82715	82723	82725	82725	Ron	201	“ I — I dunno , Harry , ”
82728	82753	82725	82725	Ron	201	“ Loads of people go to Borgin and Burkes ... and did n’t that girl say Katie got it in the girls ’ bathroom ? ”
82754	82777	82639	82639	he	136	“ She said she came back from the bathroom with it , she did n’t necessarily get it in the bathroom itself — ”
82778	82781	82783	82783	Ron	201	“ McGonagall ! ”
82808	82838	82793	82794	Professor McGonagall	237	“ Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell — upstairs to my office at once , please ! What ’s that you ’re holding , Potter ? ”
82839	82847	82849	82849	Harry	136	“ It ’s the thing she touched , ”
82851	82855	82857	82858	Professor McGonagall	237	“ Good lord , ”
82870	82882	82883	82883	she	237	“ No , no , Filch , they ’re with me ! ”
82902	82927	82928	82928	Harry	136	“ Take this necklace to Professor Snape at once , but be sure not to touch it , keep it wrapped in the scarf ! ”
82989	82992	82993	82993	she	237	“ Well ? ”
82997	83001	82993	82993	she	237	“ What happened ? ”
83094	83098	83100	83101	Professor McGonagall	237	“ All right , ”
83106	83129	83100	83101	Professor McGonagall	237	“ go up to the hospital wing , please , Leanne , and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock . ”
83149	83158	83137	83138	Professor McGonagall	237	“ What happened when Katie touched the necklace ? ”
83159	83167	83169	83169	Harry	136	“ She rose up in the air , ”
83179	83199	83137	83138	Professor McGonagall	237	“ and then began to scream , and collapsed . Professor , can I see Professor Dumbledore , please ? ”
83200	83210	83212	83213	Professor McGonagall	237	“ The headmaster is away until Monday , Potter , ”
83218	83221	83222	83222	Harry	136	“ Away ? ”
83226	83233	83235	83236	Professor McGonagall	237	“ Yes , Potter , away ! ”
83239	83260	83235	83236	Professor McGonagall	237	“ But anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me , I ’m sure ! ”
83319	83331	83336	83336	him	136	“ I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace , Professor . ”
83369	83379	83381	83382	Professor McGonagall	237	“ That is a very serious accusation , Potter , ”
83389	83396	83381	83382	Professor McGonagall	237	“ Do you have any proof ? ”
83397	83400	83402	83402	Harry	136	“ No , ”
83404	83407	83409	83409	he	136	“ but ... ”
83443	83454	83437	83438	Professor McGonagall	237	“ Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair ? ”
83455	83507	83432	83432	he	136	“ No , Professor , he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something , he did n’t have it with him . But that ’s not the point , the thing is that he bought something at the same time , and I think it was that necklace — ”
83508	83520	83432	83432	he	136	“ You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package ? ”
83521	83538	83437	83438	Professor McGonagall	237	“ No , Professor , he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him — ”
83539	83543	83544	83544	Hermione	180	“ But Harry , ”
83547	83565	83544	83544	Hermione	180	“ Borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him , and Malfoy said no — ”
83566	83578	83580	83580	Harry	136	“ Because he did n’t want to touch it , obviously ! ”
83583	83602	83604	83604	Hermione	180	“ What he actually said was , ‘ How would I look carrying that down the street ? ’ ”
83606	83621	83623	83623	Ron	201	“ Well , he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace , ”
83625	83630	83632	83632	Hermione	180	“ Oh , Ron , ”
83635	83702	83703	83703	she	180	“ it would be all wrapped up , so he would n’t have to touch it , and quite easy to hide inside a cloak , so nobody would see it ! I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky , something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street — and in any case , ”
83713	83767	83703	83703	she	180	“ I asked Borgin about the necklace , do n’t you remember ? When I went in to try and find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep , I saw it there . And Borgin just told me the price , he did n’t say it was already sold or anything — ”
83768	83810	83818	83819	Professor McGonagall	237	“ Well , you were being really obvious , he realized what you were up to within about five seconds , of course he was n’t going to tell you — anyway , Malfoy could ’ve sent off for it since — ”
83811	83816	83818	83819	Professor McGonagall	237	“ That ’s enough ! ”
83832	83878	83824	83824	her	180	“ Potter , I appreciate you telling me this , but we can not point the finger of blame at Mr. Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased . The same is probably true of hundreds of people — ”
83879	83887	83889	83889	Ron	201	“ — that ’s what I said — ”
83891	83925	83889	83889	Ron	201	“ — and in any case , we have put stringent security measures in place this year . I do not believe that necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge — ”
83926	83929	83939	83940	Professor McGonagall	237	“ But — ”
83930	83937	83939	83940	Professor McGonagall	237	“ — and what is more , ”
83949	83958	83939	83940	Professor McGonagall	237	“ Mr. Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today . ”
83966	83974	83962	83962	her	237	“ How do you know , Professor ? ”
83975	84010	84011	84011	she	237	“ Because he was doing detention with me . He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row . So , thank you for telling me your suspicions , Potter , ”
84019	84043	84044	84044	She	237	“ but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell . Good day to you all . ”
84092	84107	84109	84109	Ron	201	“ So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace to ? ”
84121	84126	84128	84128	Hermione	180	“ Goodness only knows , ”
84130	84153	84128	84128	Hermione	180	“ But whoever it was has had a narrow escape . No one could have opened that package without touching the necklace . ”
84154	84165	84167	84167	Harry	136	“ It could ’ve been meant for loads of people , ”
84169	84216	84167	84167	Harry	136	“ Dumbledore — the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him , he must be one of their top targets . Or Slughorn — Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really wanted him and they ca n’t be pleased that he ’s sided with Dumbledore . Or — ”
84217	84221	84223	84223	Hermione	180	“ Or you , ”
84228	84234	84236	84236	Harry	136	“ Could n’t have been , ”
84238	84310	84236	84236	Harry	136	“ or Katie would ’ve just turned around in the lane and given it to me , would n’t she ? I was behind her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks . It would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts , what with Filch searching everyone who goes in and out . I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle ? ”
84311	84320	84322	84322	Hermione	180	“ Harry , Malfoy was n’t in Hogsmeade ! ”
84331	84341	84343	84343	Harry	136	“ He must have used an accomplice , then , ”
84345	84378	84343	84343	Harry	136	“ Crabbe or Goyle — or , come to think of it , another Death Eater , he ’ll have loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now he ’s joined up — ”
84395	84398	84400	84400	Hermione	180	“ Dilligrout , ”
84470	84489	84491	84491	Ron	201	“ It was n’t a very slick attack , really , when you stop and think about it , ”
84515	84534	84491	84491	Ron	201	“ The curse did n’t even make it into the castle . Not what you ’d call foolproof . ”
84535	84540	84542	84542	Hermione	180	“ You ’re right , ”
84562	84574	84542	84542	Hermione	180	“ It was n’t very well thought - out at all . ”
84575	84590	84592	84592	Harry	136	“ But since when has Malfoy been one of the world ’s great thinkers ? ”
84665	84675	84677	84677	Harry	136	“ Oh , and Malfoy knows , of course , ”
84801	84814	84815	84815	Dumbledore	138	“ You have had a busy time while I have been away , ”
84818	84827	84815	84815	Dumbledore	138	“ I believe you witnessed Katie ’s accident . ”
84828	84837	84775	84775	he	138	“ Yes , sir . How is she ? ”
84838	84914	84815	84815	Dumbledore	138	“ Still very unwell , although she was relatively lucky . She appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin : There was a tiny hole in her glove . Had she put it on , had she even held it in her ungloved hand , she would have died , perhaps instantly . Luckily Professor Snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse — ”
84915	84919	84921	84921	Harry	136	“ Why him ? ”
84924	84930	84921	84921	Harry	136	“ Why not Madam Pomfrey ? ”
84931	84934	84815	84815	Dumbledore	138	“ Impertinent , ”
84975	84993	84962	84962	his	374	“ I would not have permitted a student to question the way Hogwarts operated in my day . ”
84994	85002	85004	85004	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , thank you , Phineas , ”
85007	85050	85004	85004	Dumbledore	138	“ Professor Snape knows much more about the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey , Harry . Anyway , the St. Mungo ’s staff are sending me hourly reports , and I am hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery in time . ”
85051	85060	85061	85061	Harry	136	“ Where were you this weekend , sir ? ”
85088	85097	85099	85099	Dumbledore	138	“ I would rather not say just now , ”
85101	85112	85099	85099	Dumbledore	138	“ However , I shall tell you in due course . ”
85113	85117	85119	85119	Harry	136	“ You will ? ”
85123	85130	85132	85132	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , I expect so , ”
85155	85158	85160	85160	Harry	136	“ Sir , ”
85163	85170	85160	85160	Harry	136	“ I met Mundungus in Hogsmeade . ”
85171	85192	85194	85194	Dumbledore	138	“ Ah yes , I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating your inheritance with light - fingered contempt , ”
85200	85243	85194	85194	Dumbledore	138	“ He has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the Three Broomsticks ; I rather think he dreads facing me . However , rest assured that he will not be making away with any more of Sirius ’s old possessions . ”
85244	85257	85259	85260	Phineas Nigellus	374	“ That mangy old half - blood has been stealing Black heirlooms ? ”
85284	85287	85289	85289	Harry	136	“ Professor , ”
85296	85315	85289	85289	Harry	136	“ did Professor McGonagall tell you what I told her after Katie got hurt ? About Draco Malfoy ? ”
85316	85326	85328	85328	Dumbledore	138	“ She told me of your suspicions , yes , ”
85330	85336	85328	85328	Dumbledore	138	“ And do you — ? ”
85337	85358	85360	85360	Dumbledore	138	“ I shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in Katie ’s accident , ”
85362	85375	85360	85360	Dumbledore	138	“ But what concerns me now , Harry , is our lesson . ”
85441	85507	85418	85418	Dumbledore	138	“ You will remember , I am sure , that we left the tale of Lord Voldemort ’s beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle , Tom Riddle , had abandoned his witch wife , Merope , and returned to his family home in Little Hangleton . Merope was left alone in London , expecting the baby who would one day become Lord Voldemort . ”
85508	85520	85559	85559	He	138	“ How do you know she was in London , sir ? ”
85521	85531	85533	85533	Dumbledore	138	“ Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke , ”
85535	85558	85559	85559	He	138	“ who , by an odd coincidence , helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing . ”
85623	85785	85786	85786	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , we acquired it in curious circumstances . It was brought in by a young witch just before Christmas , oh , many years ago now . She said she needed the gold badly , well , that much was obvious . Covered in rags and pretty far along ... Going to have a baby , see . She said the locket had been Slytherin ’s . Well , we hear that sort of story all the time , ‘ Oh , this was Merlin ’s , this was , his favorite teapot , ’ but when I looked at it , it had his mark all right , and a few simple spells were enough to tell me the truth . Of course , that made it near enough priceless . She did n’t seem to have any idea how much it was worth . Happy to get ten Galleons for it . Best bargain we ever made ! ”
85812	85820	85822	85822	Harry	136	“ He only gave her ten Galleons ? ”
85825	85835	85837	85837	Dumbledore	138	“ Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity , ”
85839	85887	85837	85837	Dumbledore	138	“ So we know that , near the end of her pregnancy , Merope was alone in London and in desperate need of gold , desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession , the locket that was one of Marvolo ’s treasured family heirlooms . ”
85888	85895	85897	85897	Harry	136	“ But she could do magic ! ”
85900	85917	85897	85897	Harry	136	“ She could have got food and everything for herself by magic , could n’t she ? ”
85918	85921	85923	85923	Dumbledore	138	“ Ah , ”
85925	86024	85923	85923	Dumbledore	138	“ perhaps she could . But it is my belief — I am guessing again , but I am sure I am right — that when her husband abandoned her , Merope stopped using magic . I do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer . Of course , it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers ; that can happen . In any case , as you are about to see , Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life . ”
86025	86036	86037	86037	Dumbledore	138	“ She would n’t even stay alive for her son ? ”
86042	86053	86039	86039	his	138	“ Could you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort ? ”
86054	86057	86059	86059	Harry	136	“ No , ”
86062	86078	86059	86059	Harry	136	“ but she had a choice , did n’t she , not like my mother — ”
86079	86087	86089	86089	Dumbledore	138	“ Your mother had a choice too , ”
86092	86142	86089	86089	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her , but do not judge her too harshly , Harry . She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your mother ’s courage . And now , if you will stand ... ”
86143	86149	86150	86150	Harry	136	“ Where are we going ? ”
86164	86168	86170	86170	Dumbledore	138	“ This time , ”
86172	86200	86170	86170	Dumbledore	138	“ we are going to enter my memory . I think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate . After you , Harry ... ”
86256	86261	86263	86263	Dumbledore	138	“ There I am , ”
86332	86338	86340	86340	Harry	136	“ Nice suit , sir , ”
86419	86442	86412	86417	a scruffy girl wearing an apron	2037	“ Good afternoon . I have an appointment with a Mrs. Cole , who , I believe , is the matron here ? ”
86443	86446	86448	86452	the bewildered - looking girl	2038	“ Oh , ”
86461	86473	86474	86474	she	2038	“ Um ... just a mo ’ ... MRS . COLE ! ”
86497	86508	86490	86491	The girl	4700	“ Come in , she ’s on ’ er way . ”
86588	86625	86626	86626	she	2043	“ . . . and take the iodine upstairs to Martha , Billy Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalley ’s oozing all over his sheets — chicken pox on top of everything else , ”
86661	86665	86667	86667	Dumbledore	138	“ Good afternoon , ”
86679	86703	86674	86675	Mrs. Cole	376	“ My name is Albus Dumbledore . I sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today . ”
86721	86740	86717	86717	she	2043	“ Oh yes . Well — well then — you ’d better come into my room . Yes . ”
86793	86816	86818	86818	Dumbledore	138	“ I am here , as I told you in my letter , to discuss Tom Riddle and arrangements for his future , ”
86820	86825	86827	86828	Mrs. Cole	376	“ Are you family ? ”
86830	86838	86840	86840	Dumbledore	138	“ No , I am a teacher , ”
86842	86855	86840	86840	Dumbledore	138	“ I have come to offer Tom a place at my school . ”
86856	86864	86783	86783	herself	2043	“ What school ’s this , then ? ”
86865	86871	86873	86873	Dumbledore	138	“ It is called Hogwarts , ”
86875	86885	86873	86873	Dumbledore	138	“ And how come you ’re interested in Tom ? ”
86886	86897	86783	86783	herself	2043	“ We believe he has qualities we are looking for . ”
86898	86921	86783	86783	herself	2043	“ You mean he ’s won a scholarship ? How can he have done ? He ’s never been entered for one . ”
86922	86936	86873	86873	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , his name has been down for our school since birth — ”
86937	86945	86951	86952	Mrs. Cole	376	“ Who registered him ? His parents ? ”
87000	87003	87005	87005	Dumbledore	138	“ Here , ”
87020	87029	87012	87012	he	138	“ I think this will make everything clear . ”
87053	87060	87061	87061	she	376	“ That seems perfectly in order , ”
87092	87104	87105	87105	she	376	“ Er — may I offer you a glass of gin ? ”
87114	87120	87122	87122	Dumbledore	138	“ Thank you very much , ”
87184	87210	87165	87165	she	376	“ I was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom Riddle ’s history ? I think he was born here in the orphanage ? ”
87211	87216	87218	87219	Mrs. Cole	376	“ That ’s right , ”
87227	87311	87218	87219	Mrs. Cole	376	“ I remember it clear as anything , because I ’d just started here myself . New Year ’s Eve and bitter cold , snowing , you know . Nasty night . And this girl , not much older than I was myself at the time , came staggering up the front steps . Well , she was n’t the first . We took her in , and she had the baby within the hour . And she was dead in another hour . ”
87324	87333	87335	87335	Dumbledore	138	“ Did she say anything before she died ? ”
87337	87348	87335	87335	Dumbledore	138	“ Anything about the boy ’s father , for instance ? ”
87349	87359	87361	87362	Mrs. Cole	376	“ Now , as it happens , she did , ”
87387	87490	87361	87362	Mrs. Cole	376	“ I remember she said to me , ‘ I hope he looks like his papa , ’ and I wo n’t lie , she was right to hope it , because she was no beauty — and then she told me he was to be named Tom , for his father , and Marvolo , for her father — yes , I know , funny name , is n’t it ? We wondered whether she came from a circus — and she said the boy ’s surname was to be Riddle . And she died soon after that without another word . “
87547	87577	87540	87540	he	2054	” Mrs. Cole helped herself , almost absentmindedly , to another healthy measure of gin . Two pink spots had appeared high on her cheekbones . Then she said , “
87584	87585	87578	87578	He	2054	” “
87588	87592	87595	87595	he	2054	” said Dumbledore . “
87599	87600	87595	87595	he	2054	” “
87631	87632	87626	87626	he	2054	” “
87638	87643	87646	87646	he	2054	” asked Dumbledore gently . “
87648	87675	87646	87646	he	2054	” But Mrs. Cole pulled up short , and there was nothing blurry or vague about the inquisitorial glance she shot Dumbledore over her gin glass . “
87689	87690	87676	87676	He	2054	” “
87693	87697	87676	87676	He	2054	” said Dumbledore . “
87706	87707	87700	87700	I	0	” “
87710	87714	87700	87700	I	0	” said Dumbledore . “
87724	87725	87715	87715	You	2062	” “
87728	87761	87715	87715	You	2062	” repeated Dumbledore gravely . She squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him . Apparently she decided she could , because she said in a sudden rush , “
87768	87769	87762	87762	He	2054	” “
87777	87781	87784	87784	he	2054	” asked Dumbledore . “
87788	87796	87784	87784	he	2054	” said Mrs. Cole , frowning slightly , “
87816	87847	87848	87849	Billy Stubbs	226	” Dumbledore did not press her , though Harry could tell that he was interested . She took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still . “
87889	87890	87891	87891	I	0	” “
87899	87904	87891	87891	I	0	” said Dumbledore quietly . “
87936	87955	87925	87925	he	2054	” — Mrs. Cole took another swig of gin , slopping a little over her chin this time — “
88049	88069	88070	88070	I	0	” She looked around at Dumbledore again , and though her cheeks were flushed , her gaze was steady . “
88086	88087	88088	88088	You	0	” “
88104	88108	88109	88109	He	345	” said Dumbledore . “
88124	88125	88109	88109	He	345	” “
88144	88183	88184	88184	I	0	” said Mrs. Cole with a slight hiccup . She got to her feet , and Harry was impressed to see that she was quite steady , even though two - thirds of the gin was now gone . “
88193	88194	88186	88186	you	0	” “
88198	88272	88186	88186	you	0	” said Dumbledore , rising too . She led him out of her office and up the stone stairs , calling out instructions and admonitions to helpers and children as she passed . The orphans , Harry saw , were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic . They looked reasonably well - cared for , but there was no denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up . “
88277	88306	88307	88307	Tom	345	” said Mrs. Cole , as they turned off the second landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor . She knocked twice and entered . “
88340	88468	88336	88336	him	381	” Harry and the two Dumbledores entered the room , and Mrs. Cole closed the door on them . It was a small bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe , a wooden chair , and an iron bedstead . A boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets , his legs stretched out in front of him , holding a book . There was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddle ’s face . Merope had got her dying wish : He was his handsome father in miniature , tall for eleven years old , dark - haired , and pale . His eyes narrowed slightly as he took in Dumbledore ’s eccentric appearance . There was a moment ’s silence . “
88476	88526	88471	88471	you	2075	” said Dumbledore , walking forward and holding out his hand . The boy hesitated , then took it , and they shook hands . Dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside Riddle , so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor . “
88532	88533	88535	88535	Professor	4397	” “
88538	88546	88535	88535	Professor	4397	” repeated Riddle . He looked wary . “
88572	88587	88561	88561	she	2078	” He was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole had just left . “
88592	88598	88561	88561	she	2078	” said Dumbledore , smiling . “
88605	88609	88603	88603	you	2075	” said Riddle . “
88624	88697	88618	88618	she	2078	” He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking . It was a command , and it sounded as though he had given it many times before . His eyes had widened and he was glaring at Dumbledore , who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly . After a few seconds Riddle stopped glaring , though he looked , if anything , warier still . “
88702	88703	88700	88700	you	2075	” “
88746	88770	88771	88771	You	2075	” Riddle ’s reaction to this was most surprising . He leapt from the bed and backed away from Dumbledore , looking furious . “
88845	88846	88840	88840	they	2087	” “
88854	88859	88847	88847	I	0	” said Dumbledore patiently . “
88898	88899	88893	88893	nobody	596	” “
88908	88912	88900	88900	I	0	” sneered Riddle . “
88915	88931	88913	88913	Hogwarts	14	” Dumbledore went on , as though he had not heard Riddle ’s last words , “
88941	88942	88943	88943	I	0	” “
88948	88949	88953	88953	you	0	” “
88974	89011	89031	89031	It	2095	” There was silence . Riddle had frozen , his face expressionless , but his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of Dumbledore ’s , as though trying to catch one of them lying . “
89014	89021	89031	89031	It	2095	” he repeated in a whisper . “
89026	89030	89031	89031	It	2095	” said Dumbledore . “
89043	89044	89031	89031	It	2095	” “
89053	89054	89049	89049	you	0	” “
89058	89080	89049	89049	you	0	” breathed Riddle . A flush of excitement was rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks ; he looked fevered . “
89128	89158	89159	89159	I	0	” His legs were trembling . He stumbled forward and sat down on the bed again , staring at his hands , his head bowed as though in prayer . “
89165	89174	89159	89159	I	0	” he whispered to his own quivering fingers . “
89189	89190	89183	89183	I	0	” “
89198	89213	89193	89193	you	0	” said Dumbledore , who was no longer smiling , but watching Riddle intently . “
89219	89267	89216	89217	a wizard	4251	” Riddle lifted his head . His face was transfigured : There was a wild happiness upon it , yet for some reason it did not make him better looking ; on the contrary , his finely carved features seemed somehow rougher , his expression almost bestial . “
89274	89275	89269	89269	you	0	” “
89281	89282	89269	89269	you	0	” “
89286	89305	89269	89269	you	0	” said Riddle at once , in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said , “
89310	89316	89269	89269	you	0	” Dumbledore raised his eyebrows . “
89332	89333	89324	89324	you	0	” “
89339	89340	89324	89324	you	0	” “
89355	89375	89342	89342	you	0	” Riddle ’s expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said , in an unrecognizably polite voice , “
89395	89548	89390	89390	you	4356	” Harry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse , that he would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time for practical demonstrations at Hogwarts , that they were currently in a building full of Muggles and must therefore be cautious . To his great surprise , however , Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket , pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner , and gave the wand a casual flick . The wardrobe burst into flames . Riddle jumped to his feet ; Harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage ; all his worldly possessions must be in there . But even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore , the flames vanished , leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged . Riddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore ; then , his expression greedy , he pointed at the wand . “
89557	89558	89390	89390	you	4356	” “
89564	89568	89390	89390	you	4356	” said Dumbledore . “
89582	89606	89569	89569	I	0	” And sure enough , a faint rattling could be heard from inside it . For the first time , Riddle looked frightened . “
89611	89660	89569	89569	I	0	” said Dumbledore . Riddle hesitated , then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door . On the topmost shelf , above a rail of threadbare clothes , a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several frantic mice trapped inside it . “
89665	89680	89569	89569	I	0	” said Dumbledore . Riddle took down the quaking box . He looked unnerved . “
89694	89709	89712	89712	I	0	” asked Dumbledore . Riddle threw Dumbledore a long , clear , calculating look . “
89718	89728	89716	89716	sir	4356	” he said finally , in an expressionless voice . “
89732	89807	89716	89716	sir	4356	” said Dumbledore . Riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed without looking at them . Harry , who had expected something much more exciting , saw a mess of small , everyday objects : a yo - yo , a silver thimble , and a tarnished mouth organ among them . Once free of the box , they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blankets . “
89819	89832	89816	89816	your	0	” said Dumbledore calmly , putting his wand back into his jacket . “
89853	89880	89883	89883	sir	4356	” Riddle did not look remotely abashed ; he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at Dumbledore . At last he said in a colorless voice , “
89885	89886	89883	89883	sir	4356	” “
89890	89895	89896	89896	we	2110	” Dumbledore went on , “
90007	90008	90011	90011	sir	4356	” “
90013	90061	90011	90011	sir	4356	” said Riddle again . It was impossible to tell what he was thinking ; his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box . When he had finished , he turned to Dumbledore and said baldly , “
90069	90070	90011	90011	sir	4356	” “
90076	90090	90011	90011	sir	4356	” said Dumbledore , drawing a leather money - pouch from his pocket . “
90124	90125	90108	90108	You	4356	” “
90132	90156	90128	90128	you	4356	” interrupted Riddle , who had taken the heavy money bag without thanking Dumbledore , and was now examining a fat gold Galleon . “
90161	90165	90128	90128	you	4356	” said Dumbledore . “
90185	90186	90187	90187	You	4356	” “
90193	90200	90204	90204	you	4356	” asked Riddle , looking up . “
90206	90207	90204	90204	you	4356	” “
90214	90218	90204	90204	you	4356	” said Riddle . “
90250	90306	90241	90241	you	4356	” he added , catching Dumbledore ’s eye . Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle , but once again he was surprised . Dumbledore handed Riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment , and after telling Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the orphanage , he said , “
90348	90364	90333	90335	Tom the barman	345	” Riddle gave an irritable twitch , as though trying to displace an irksome fly . “
90373	90374	90365	90365	You	4356	” “
90382	90411	90380	90380	Toms	383	” muttered Riddle . Then , as though he could not suppress the question , as though it burst from him in spite of himself , he asked , “
90430	90431	90425	90425	they	2124	” “
90440	90448	90435	90435	I	0	” said Dumbledore , his voice gentle . “
90464	90474	90479	90479	him	4840	” said Riddle , more to himself than Dumbledore . “
90499	90500	90479	90479	him	4840	” “
90515	90519	90479	90479	him	4840	” said Dumbledore . “
90543	90565	90566	90566	I	0	” Riddle nodded . Dumbledore got to his feet and held out his hand again . Taking it , Riddle said , “
90601	90622	90589	90589	they	2127	” Harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment , determined to impress . “
90627	90637	90589	90589	they	2127	” said Dumbledore , after a moment ’s hesitation , “
90643	90685	90589	90589	they	2127	” His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Riddle ’s face . They stood for a moment , man and boy , staring at each other . Then the handshake was broken ; Dumbledore was at the door . “
90699	90700	90692	90692	I	0	” “
90707	90742	90701	90701	I	0	” said the white - haired Dumbledore at Harry ’s side , and seconds later , they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more , before landing squarely in the present - day office . “
90746	90768	90769	90769	He	2131	” said Dumbledore , landing beside Harry . Harry obeyed , his mind still full of what he had just seen . “
90790	90794	90782	90782	you	0	” said Harry . “
90808	90809	90804	90804	he	2131	” “
90831	90835	90824	90824	his	345	” said Dumbledore . “
90842	90846	90837	90837	you	0	” asked Harry . “
90864	90868	90837	90837	you	0	” said Dumbledore . “
90945	91061	91071	91071	Harry	136	“ His powers , as you heard , were surprisingly well - developed for such a young wizard and — most interestingly and ominously of all — he had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them , and begun to use them consciously . And as you saw , they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards : He was already using magic against other people , to frighten , to punish , to control . The little stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive ... ‘ I can make them hurt if I want to ... ’ ”
91062	91069	91071	91071	Harry	136	“ And he was a Parselmouth , ”
91073	91135	91071	91071	Harry	136	“ Yes , indeed ; a rare ability , and one supposedly connected with the Dark Arts , although as we know , there are Parselmouths among the great and the good too . In fact , his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty , secrecy , and domination . “
91144	91156	91071	91071	Harry	136	” said Dumbledore , indicating the dark sky beyond the windows . “
91196	91220	91221	91221	Harry	136	“ Firstly , I hope you noticed Riddle ’s reaction when I mentioned that another shared his first name , ‘ Tom ’ ? ”
91224	91294	91221	91221	Harry	136	“ There he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people , anything that made him ordinary . Even then , he wished to be different , separate , notorious . He shed his name , as you know , within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of ‘ Lord Voldemort ’ behind which he has been hidden for so long . “
91397	91481	91391	91391	he	179	“ And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this , Harry — the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies . You saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room . These were taken from victims of his bullying behavior , souvenirs , if you will , of particularly unpleasant bits of magic . Bear in mind this magpie - like tendency , for this , particularly , will be important later . “
91492	91532	91535	91535	Harry	136	” Harry got to his feet . As he walked across the room , his eyes fell upon the little table on which Marvolo Gaunt ’s ring had rested last time , but the ring was no longer there . “
91537	91549	91535	91535	Harry	136	” said Dumbledore , for Harry had come to a halt . “
91555	91562	91535	91535	Harry	136	” said Harry , looking around . “
91575	91592	91596	91596	Harry	136	” Dumbledore beamed at him , peering over the top of his half - moon spectacles . “
91609	91626	91596	91596	Harry	136	” And on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry , who understood himself to be dismissed .
91705	91719	91721	91721	Ron	201	“ Wow , scary thought , the boy You - Know - Who , ”
91751	91782	91721	91721	Ron	201	“ But I still do n’t get why Dumbledore ’s showing you all this . I mean , it ’s really interesting and everything , but what ’s the point ? ”
91783	91786	91788	91788	Harry	136	“ Dunno , ”
91795	91810	91788	91788	Harry	136	“ But he says it ’s all important and it ’ll help me survive . ”
91811	91818	91820	91820	Hermione	180	“ I think it ’s fascinating , ”
91823	91846	91820	91820	Hermione	180	“ It makes absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible . How else will you find out his weaknesses ? ”
91847	91856	91857	91857	Harry	136	“ So how was Slughorn ’s latest party ? ”
91866	91876	91878	91878	Hermione	180	“ Oh , it was quite fun , really , ”
91886	91931	91878	91878	Hermione	180	“ I mean , he drones on about famous ex - pupils a bit , and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he ’s so well - connected , but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones . ”
91932	91936	91938	91938	Ron	201	“ Gwenog Jones ? ”
91948	91959	91940	91940	his	201	“ The Gwenog Jones ? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies ? ”
91960	91965	91967	91967	Hermione	180	“ That ’s right , ”
91969	91984	91967	91967	Hermione	180	“ Personally , I thought she was a bit full of herself , but — ”
91985	91992	91994	91995	Professor Sprout	311	“ Quite enough chat over here ! ”
92004	92024	91994	91995	Professor Sprout	311	“ You ’re lagging behind , everybody else has started , and Neville ’s already got his first pod ! ”
92064	92074	92076	92076	Ron	201	“ Okay , Professor , we ’re starting now ! ”
92088	92096	92082	92082	she	180	“ should ’ve used Muffliato , Harry . ”
92097	92104	92113	92113	she	180	“ No , we should n’t ! ”
92132	92144	92145	92145	She	180	“ Well , come on ... we ’d better get going ... ”
92315	92341	92343	92343	Ron	201	“ You know , I do n’t think I ’ll be having any of these in my garden when I ’ve got my own place , ”
92359	92365	92367	92367	Hermione	180	“ Pass me a bowl , ”
92398	92416	92418	92419	Professor Sprout	311	“ Do n’t be squeamish , squeeze it out , they ’re best when they ’re fresh ! ”
92421	92424	92426	92426	Hermione	180	“ Anyway , ”
92444	92497	92498	92498	Harry	136	“ Slughorn ’s going to have a Christmas party , Harry , and there ’s no way you ’ll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings , so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come . ”
92537	92552	92531	92531	he	201	“ And this is another party just for Slughorn ’s favorites , is it ? ”
92553	92562	92564	92564	Hermione	180	“ Just for the Slug Club , yes , ”
92615	92630	92611	92611	Hermione	180	“ Look , I did n’t make up the name ‘ Slug Club ’ — ”
92631	92637	92639	92639	Ron	201	“ ‘ Slug Club , ’ ”
92647	92681	92639	92639	Ron	201	“ It ’s pathetic . Well , I hope you enjoy your party . Why do n’t you try hooking up with McLaggen , then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug — ”
92682	92690	92692	92692	Hermione	180	“ We ’re allowed to bring guests , ”
92706	92731	92692	92692	Hermione	180	“ and I was going to ask you to come , but if you think it ’s that stupid then I wo n’t bother ! ”
92801	92809	92811	92811	Ron	201	“ You were going to ask me ? ”
92819	92822	92824	92824	Hermione	180	“ Yes , ”
92827	92840	92824	92824	Hermione	180	“ But obviously if you ’d rather I hooked up with McLaggen ... ”
92857	92864	92866	92866	Ron	201	“ No , I would n’t , ”
92887	92890	92891	92891	he	136	“ Reparo , ”
92973	92980	92982	92982	Hermione	180	“ Hand that over , Harry , ”
92985	92998	92999	92999	Harry	136	“ It says we ’re supposed to puncture them with something sharp ... ”
93189	93192	93194	93194	Ron	201	“ Gotcha ! ”
93469	93478	93490	93490	Dean	244	“ Are you still interested in playing Chaser ? ”
93479	93488	93490	93490	Dean	244	“ Wha — ? Yeah , of course ! ”
93564	93572	93574	93574	Harry	136	“ Well then , you ’re in , ”
93576	93586	93574	93574	Harry	136	“ There ’s a practice tonight , seven o’clock . ”
93587	93590	93592	93592	Dean	244	“ Right , ”
93594	93609	93610	93610	He	244	“ Cheers , Harry ! Blimey , I ca n’t wait to tell Ginny ! ”
93897	93912	93913	93913	Ron	201	“ It was an accident , I ’m sorry , Demelza , really sorry ! ”
93929	93933	93913	93913	Ron	201	“ I just — ”
93934	93937	93938	93938	Ginny	222	“ Panicked , ”
93952	93965	93938	93938	Ginny	222	“ You prat , Ron , look at the state of her ! ”
93966	93972	93974	93974	Harry	136	“ I can fix that , ”
93992	93995	93983	93983	his	136	“ Episkey . ”
93996	94016	93983	93983	his	136	“ And Ginny , do n’t call Ron a prat , you ’re not the Captain of this team — ”
94017	94035	94036	94036	Harry	136	“ Well , you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should — ”
94043	94054	94036	94036	Harry	136	“ In the air , everyone , let ’s go ... ”
94089	94102	94103	94103	he	136	“ Good work , everyone , I think we ’ll flatten Slytherin , ”
94122	94132	94134	94134	Ron	201	“ I played like a sack of dragon dung , ”
94148	94155	94157	94157	Harry	136	“ No , you did n’t , ”
94160	94178	94157	94157	Harry	136	“ You ’re the best Keeper I tried out , Ron . Your only problem is nerves . ”
94321	94324	94310	94310	Ron	201	“ Oi ! ”
94334	94337	94339	94339	Ginny	222	“ What ? ”
94341	94356	94339	94339	Ginny	222	“ I do n’t want to find my own sister snogging people in public ! ”
94357	94369	94371	94371	Ginny	222	“ This was a deserted corridor till you came butting in ! ”
94407	94415	94417	94417	Dean	244	“ Er ... c’m on , Ginny , ”
94419	94429	94417	94417	Dean	244	“ let ’s go back to the common room ... ”
94430	94434	94436	94436	Ginny	222	“ You go ! ”
94438	94448	94449	94449	Dean	244	“ I want a word with my dear brother ! ”
94464	94467	94469	94469	Ginny	222	“ Right , ”
94485	94516	94472	94472	her	222	“ let ’s get this straight once and for all . It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them , Ron — ”
94517	94523	94525	94525	Ron	201	“ Yeah , it is ! ”
94531	94543	94525	94525	Ron	201	“ D’you think I want people saying my sister ’s a — ”
94544	94548	94550	94550	Ginny	222	“ A what ? ”
94556	94562	94550	94550	Ginny	222	“ A what , exactly ? ”
94563	94572	94574	94574	Harry	136	“ He does n’t mean anything , Ginny — ”
94589	94595	94596	94596	she	222	“ Oh yes he does ! ”
94604	94631	94596	94596	she	222	“ Just because he ’s never snogged anyone in his life , just because the best kiss he ’s ever had is from our Auntie Muriel — ”
94632	94637	94639	94639	Ron	201	“ Shut your mouth ! ”
94647	94654	94656	94656	Ginny	222	“ No , I will not ! ”
94661	94712	94656	94656	Ginny	222	“ I ’ve seen you with Phlegm , hoping she ’ll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her , it ’s pathetic ! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done yourself , you would n’t mind so much that everyone else does it ! ”
94727	94738	94739	94739	Ron	201	“ You do n’t know what you ’re talking about ! ”
94766	94778	94779	94779	Ginny	222	“ Just because I do n’t do it in public — ! ”
94794	94816	94779	94779	Ginny	222	“ Been kissing Pigwidgeon , have you ? Or have you got a picture of Auntie Muriel stashed under your pillow ? ”
94817	94820	94828	94828	Harry	136	“ You — ”
94846	94852	94838	94838	Harry	136	“ Do n’t be stupid — ”
94853	94860	94862	94862	Ginny	222	“ Harry ’s snogged Cho Chang ! ”
94871	94911	94862	94862	Ginny	222	“ And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum , it ’s only you who acts like it ’s something disgusting , Ron , and that ’s because you ’ve got about as much experience as a twelve - year - old ! ”
94961	94965	94967	94967	Harry	136	“ C’m on , ”
94994	95002	95003	95003	Ron	201	“ Oi , out of the way ! ”
95123	95127	95115	95115	his	201	“ betrayal of trust ”
95129	95135	95115	95115	his	201	“ supposed to be my friend ”
95137	95145	95146	95146	Ron	201	“ D’you think Hermione did snog Krum ? ”
95185	95188	95189	95189	he	201	“ What ? ”
95193	95198	95189	95189	he	201	“ Oh ... er ... ”
95203	95206	95208	95208	he	136	“ yes , ”
95232	95235	95236	95236	he	136	“ Dilligrout , ”
95699	95708	95710	95710	Peakes	283	“ You shut up and leave her alone ! ”
95729	95732	95734	95734	Harry	136	“ ENOUGH ! ”
95772	95796	95797	95797	he	201	“ Peakes , go and pack up the Bludgers . Demelza , pull yourself together , you played really well today . Ron ... ”
95813	95841	95797	95797	he	201	“ you ’re my best mate , but carry on treating the rest of them like this and I ’m going to kick you off the team . ”
95880	95888	95877	95877	he	201	“ I resign . I ’m pathetic . ”
95889	95900	95902	95902	Harry	136	“ You ’re not pathetic and you ’re not resigning ! ”
95914	95934	95877	95877	he	201	“ You can save anything when you ’re on form , it ’s a mental problem you ’ve got ! ”
95935	95941	95877	95877	he	201	“ You calling me mental ? ”
95942	95949	95950	95950	They	2214	“ Yeah , maybe I am ! ”
95966	96003	95962	95962	his	201	“ I know you have n’t got any time to find another Keeper , so I ’ll play tomorrow , but if we lose , and we will , I ’m taking myself off the team . ”
96342	96348	96350	96350	Lavender	310	“ Cheer up , Ron ! ”
96352	96360	96361	96361	Ron	201	“ I know you ’ll be brilliant ! ”
96365	96368	96369	96369	Harry	136	“ Tea ? ”
96373	96379	96369	96369	Harry	136	“ Coffee ? Pumpkin juice ? ”
96380	96383	96385	96385	Ron	201	“ Anything , ”
96431	96438	96439	96439	she	180	“ How are you both feeling ? ”
96453	96456	96458	96458	Harry	136	“ Fine , ”
96472	96482	96483	96483	Ron	201	“ There you go , Ron . Drink up . ”
96497	96505	96493	96493	Hermione	180	“ Do n’t drink that , Ron ! ”
96515	96519	96521	96521	Ron	201	“ Why not ? ”
96538	96547	96531	96531	she	180	“ You just put something in that drink . ”
96548	96552	96554	96554	Harry	136	“ Excuse me ? ”
96556	96585	96554	96554	Harry	136	“ You heard me . I saw you . You just tipped something into Ron ’s drink . You ’ve got the bottle in your hand right now ! ”
96586	96597	96599	96599	Harry	136	“ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about , ”
96610	96622	96623	96623	Hermione	180	“ Ron , I warn you , do n’t drink it ! ”
96645	96653	96630	96630	Ron	201	“ Stop bossing me around , Hermione . ”
96671	96690	96668	96668	she	180	“ You should be expelled for that . I ’d never have believed it of you , Harry ! ”
96691	96697	96698	96698	he	136	“ Hark who ’s talking , ”
96702	96707	96708	96708	She	180	“ Confunded anyone lately ? ”
96749	96753	96755	96755	Harry	136	“ Nearly time , ”
96771	96782	96783	96783	Harry	136	“ Pretty lucky the weather ’s this good , eh ? ”
96787	96790	96792	96792	Ron	201	“ Yeah , ”
96818	96823	96825	96825	Ginny	222	“ Conditions look ideal , ”
96830	96873	96825	96825	Ginny	222	“ And guess what ? That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey — he took a Bludger in the head yesterday during their practice , and he ’s too sore to play ! And even better than that — Malfoy ’s gone off sick too ! ”
96874	96877	96879	96879	Harry	136	“ What ? ”
96888	96899	96879	96879	Harry	136	“ He ’s ill ? What ’s wrong with him ? ”
96900	96911	96913	96913	Ginny	222	“ No idea , but it ’s great for us , ”
96916	96934	96913	96913	Ginny	222	“ They ’re playing Harper instead ; he ’s in my year and he ’s an idiot . ”
97012	97019	97020	97020	he	136	“ Fishy , is n’t it ? ”
97028	97033	97020	97020	he	136	“ Malfoy not playing ? ”
97034	97041	97043	97043	Ron	201	“ Lucky , I call it , ”
97050	97070	97071	97071	he	201	“ And Vaisey off too , he ’s their best goal scorer , I did n’t fancy — hey ! ”
97089	97092	97071	97071	he	201	“ What ? ”
97093	97098	97099	97099	Ron	201	“ I ... you ... ”
97112	97125	97105	97105	he	201	“ My drink ... my pumpkin juice ... you did n’t ... ? ”
97136	97154	97128	97128	his	136	“ We ’ll be starting in about five minutes , you ’d better get your boots on . ”
97241	97246	97247	97247	she	400	“ Captains shake hands , ”
97264	97279	97262	97262	Urquhart	401	“ Mount your brooms . On the whistle ... three ... two ... one ... ”
97344	97406	97337	97339	the usual commentator	2241	“ Well , there they go , and I think we ’re all surprised to see the team that Potter ’s put together this year . Many thought , given Ronald Weasley ’s patchy performance as Keeper last year , that he might be off the team , but of course , a close personal friendship with the Captain does help ... ”
97477	97499	97466	97467	Zacharias Smith	284	“ Oh , and here comes Slytherin ’s first attempt on goal , it ’s Urquhart streaking down the pitch and — ”
97506	97525	97466	97467	Zacharias Smith	284	“ — Weasley saves it , well , he ’s bound to get lucky sometimes , I suppose ... ”
97526	97536	97538	97538	Harry	136	“ That ’s right , Smith , he is , ”
97636	97651	97653	97653	Zacharias	284	“ Of course , Coote is n’t really the usual build for a Beater , ”
97656	97666	97653	97653	Zacharias	284	“ they ’ve generally got a bit more muscle — ”
97667	97674	97675	97675	Harry	136	“ Hit a Bludger at him ! ”
97786	97792	97793	97793	he	201	“ Weasley Is Our King , ”
97802	97814	97793	97793	he	201	“ Thinks he ’s something special today , does n’t he ? ”
97837	97844	97829	97829	Harper	398	“ Your blood - traitor pal ... ”
97888	97900	97902	97903	Zacharias Smith	284	“ And I think Harper of Slytherin ’s seen the Snitch ! ”
97908	97920	97902	97903	Zacharias Smith	284	“ Yes , he ’s certainly seen something Potter has n’t ! ”
98054	98059	98061	98061	Harry	136	“ Oi , Harper ! ”
98065	98079	98061	98061	Harry	136	“ How much did Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him ? ”
98131	98134	98135	98135	Harry	136	“ YES ! ”
98185	98193	98195	98195	Harry	136	“ Ginny , where ’re you going ? ”
98273	98282	98264	98264	Ginny	222	“ Forgot to brake , Professor , sorry . ”
98351	98362	98364	98364	Dean	244	“ Party up in the common room , Seamus said ! ”
98367	98375	98364	98364	Dean	244	“ C’m on , Ginny , Demelza ! ”
98413	98423	98424	98424	She	180	“ I want a word with you , Harry . ”
98430	98446	98424	98424	She	180	“ You should n’t have done it . You heard Slughorn , it ’s illegal . ”
98447	98459	98461	98461	Ron	201	“ What are you going to do , turn us in ? ”
98463	98471	98473	98473	Harry	136	“ What are you two talking about ? ”
98492	98503	98505	98505	Hermione	180	“ You know perfectly well what we ’re talking about ! ”
98508	98523	98505	98505	Hermione	180	“ You spiked Ron ’s juice with lucky potion at breakfast ! Felix Felicis ! ”
98524	98531	98533	98533	Harry	136	“ No , I did n’t , ”
98542	98567	98533	98533	Harry	136	“ Yes you did , Harry , and that ’s why everything went right , there were Slytherin players missing and Ron saved everything ! ”
98568	98576	98578	98578	Harry	136	“ I did n’t put it in ! ”
98623	98645	98646	98646	He	136	“ I wanted Ron to think I ’d done it , so I faked it when I knew you were looking . ”
98651	98666	98667	98667	He	136	“ You saved everything because you felt lucky . You did it all yourself . ”
98673	98684	98685	98685	Ron	201	“ There really was n’t anything in my pumpkin juice ? ”
98690	98712	98685	98685	Ron	201	“ But the weather ’s good ... and Vaisey could n’t play ... I honestly have n’t been given lucky potion ? ”
98735	98765	98732	98732	her	180	“ You added Felix Felicis to Ron ’s juice this morning , that ’s why he saved everything ! See ! I can save goals without help , Hermione ! ”
98766	98785	98787	98787	Ron	201	“ I never said you could n’t — Ron , you thought you ’d been given it too ! ”
98804	98807	98809	98809	Harry	136	“ Er , ”
98826	98839	98815	98815	he	136	“ shall ... shall we go up to the party , then ? ”
98840	98844	98846	98846	Hermione	180	“ You go ! ”
98852	98874	98846	98846	Hermione	180	“ I ’m sick of Ron at the moment , I do n’t know what I ’m supposed to have done ... ”
99124	99129	99130	99130	she	222	“ Looking for Ron ? ”
99135	99145	99146	99146	Harry	136	“ He ’s over there , the filthy hypocrite . ”
99183	99197	99199	99199	Ginny	222	“ It looks like he ’s eating her face , does n’t it ? ”
99202	99220	99199	99199	Ginny	222	“ But I suppose he ’s got to refine his technique somehow . Good game , Harry . ”
99333	99336	99337	99337	He	136	“ Hermione ? ”
99394	99401	99402	99402	she	222	“ Oh , hello , Harry , ”
99409	99415	99402	99402	she	222	“ I was just practicing . ”
99416	99427	99429	99429	Harry	136	“ Yeah ... they ’re — er — really good ... ”
99485	99494	99474	99474	she	222	“ Ron seems to be enjoying the celebrations . ”
99495	99501	99503	99503	Harry	136	“ Er ... does he ? ”
99505	99515	99517	99517	Hermione	180	“ Do n’t pretend you did n’t see him , ”
99519	99530	99517	99517	Hermione	180	“ He was n’t exactly hiding it , was — ? ”
99555	99558	99559	99559	he	201	“ Oh , ”
99573	99576	99578	99578	Lavender	310	“ Oops ! ”
99631	99643	99611	99611	Ron	201	“ Hi , Harry ! Wondered where you ’d got to ! ”
99679	99688	99689	99689	she	180	“ You should n’t leave Lavender waiting outside , ”
99693	99702	99689	99689	she	180	“ She ’ll wonder where you ’ve gone . ”
99728	99731	99689	99689	she	180	“ Oppugno ! ”
99799	99802	99803	99803	he	201	“ Gerremoffme ! ”
100119	100125	100126	100126	he	201	“ She ca n’t complain , ”
100130	100162	100126	100126	he	201	“ She snogged Krum . So she ’s found out someone wants to snog me too . Well , it ’s a free country . I have n’t done anything wrong . ”
100219	100226	100227	100227	Ron	201	“ I never promised Hermione anything , ”
100230	100265	100227	100227	Ron	201	“ I mean , all right , I was going to go to Slughorn ’s Christmas party with her , but she never said ... just as friends ... I ’m a free agent ... ”
100305	100307	100280	100280	Ron	201	“ Krum ”
100309	100313	100280	100280	Ron	201	“ ca n’t complain ”
100389	100401	100403	100403	Hermione	180	“ He ’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes , ”
100418	100426	100427	100427	She	180	“ I really could n’t care less . ”
100496	100500	100502	100502	Hermione	180	“ And incidentally , ”
100509	100516	100502	100502	Hermione	180	“ you need to be careful . ”
100517	100523	100525	100525	Harry	136	“ For the last time , ”
100543	100571	100525	100525	Harry	136	“ I am not giving back this book , I ’ve learned more from the Half - Blood Prince than Snape or Slughorn have taught me in — ”
100572	100585	100587	100587	Hermione	180	“ I ’m not talking about your stupid so - called Prince , ”
100604	100691	100587	100587	Hermione	180	“ I ’m talking about earlier . I went into the girls ’ bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there , including that Romilda Vane , trying to decide how to slip you a love potion . They ’re all hoping they ’re going to get you to take them to Slughorn ’s party , and they all seem to have bought Fred and George ’s love potions , which I ’m afraid to say probably work — ”
100692	100701	100703	100703	Harry	136	“ Why did n’t you confiscate them then ? ”
100724	100737	100739	100739	Hermione	180	“ They did n’t have the potions with them in the bathroom , ”
100742	100759	100761	100761	she	180	“ They were just discussing tactics . As I doubt whether even the Half - Blood Prince ”
100769	100818	100761	100761	she	180	“ could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once , I ’d just invite someone to go with you , that ’ll stop all the others thinking they ’ve still got a chance . It ’s tomorrow night , they ’re getting desperate . ”
100819	100829	100831	100831	Harry	136	“ There is n’t anyone I want to invite , ”
100874	100893	100895	100895	Hermione	180	“ Well , just be careful what you drink , because Romilda Vane looked like she meant business , ”
100934	100940	100941	100941	he	136	“ Hang on a moment , ”
100945	100959	100941	100941	he	136	“ I thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes ? ”
100960	100974	100976	100976	Hermione	180	“ And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned ? ”
100984	101009	101055	101055	she	180	“ But I thought all the owls were being searched . So how come these girls are able to bring love potions into school ? ”
101010	101023	101025	101025	Hermione	180	“ Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions , ”
101027	101037	101025	101025	Hermione	180	“ It ’s part of their Owl Order Service . ”
101038	101046	101047	101047	Hermione	180	“ You know a lot about it . ”
101067	101086	101087	101087	she	180	“ It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer , ”
101091	101116	101087	101087	she	180	“ I do n’t go around putting potions in people ’s drinks ... or pretending to , either , which is just as bad ... ”
101117	101126	101128	101128	Harry	136	“ Yeah , well , never mind that , ”
101131	101172	101128	101128	Harry	136	“ The point is , Filch is being fooled , is n’t he ? These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else ! So why could n’t Malfoy have brought the necklace into the school — ? ”
101173	101182	101087	101087	she	180	“ Oh , Harry ... not that again ... ”
101183	101190	101192	101192	Harry	136	“ Come on , why not ? ”
101194	101197	101199	101199	Hermione	180	“ Look , ”
101201	101273	101199	101199	Hermione	180	“ Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes , curses , and concealment charms , do n’t they ? They ’re used to find Dark Magic and Dark objects . They ’d have picked up a powerful curse , like the one on that necklace , within seconds . But something that ’s just been put in the wrong bottle would n’t register — and anyway , love potions are n’t Dark or dangerous — ”
101274	101281	101283	101283	Harry	136	“ Easy for you to say , ”
101290	101326	101327	101327	Hermione	180	“ — so it would be down to Filch to realize it was n’t a cough potion , and he ’s not a very good wizard , I doubt he can tell one potion from — ”
101389	101396	101397	101397	she	180	“ The library is now closed , ”
101400	101425	101397	101397	she	180	“ Mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct — what have you been doing to that book , you depraved boy ? ”
101426	101438	101440	101440	Harry	136	“ It is n’t the library ’s , it ’s mine ! ”
101464	101467	101468	101468	she	180	“ Despoiled ! ”
101471	101476	101468	101468	she	180	“ Desecrated ! Befouled ! ”
101477	101489	101491	101491	Harry	136	“ It ’s just a book that ’s been written on ! ”
101531	101555	101510	101510	Hermione	180	“ She ’ll ban you from the library if you ’re not careful . Why did you have to bring that stupid book ? ”
101556	101593	101510	101510	Hermione	180	“ It ’s not my fault she ’s barking mad , Hermione . Or d’you think she overheard you being rude about Filch ? I ’ve always thought there might be something going on between them ... ”
101594	101600	101510	101510	Hermione	180	“ Oh , ha ha ... ”
101646	101649	101651	101651	Harry	136	“ Baubles , ”
101665	101670	101672	101674	the Fat Lady	2014	“ Same to you , ”
101688	101693	101695	101696	Romilda Vane	270	“ Hi , Harry ! ”
101708	101713	101716	101716	him	136	“ Fancy a gillywater ? ”
101718	101729	101732	101732	her	180	“ what - did - I - tell - you ? ”
101735	101739	101741	101741	Harry	136	“ No thanks , ”
101744	101752	101741	101741	Harry	136	“ I do n’t like it much . ”
101753	101760	101762	101762	Romilda	270	“ Well , take these anyway , ”
101771	101796	101762	101762	Romilda	270	“ Chocolate Cauldrons , they ’ve got firewhisky in them . My gran sent them to me , but I do n’t like them . ”
101797	101806	101808	101808	Harry	136	“ Oh — right — thanks a lot , ”
101819	101830	101831	101831	He	136	“ Er — I ’m just going over here with ... ”
101843	101847	101849	101849	Hermione	180	“ Told you , ”
101852	101869	101849	101849	Hermione	180	“ Sooner you ask someone , sooner they ’ll all leave you alone and you can — ”
101893	101901	101903	101903	Hermione	180	“ Well , good night , Harry , ”
102198	102205	102207	102207	Luna	264	“ Oh , hello , Harry , ”
102209	102221	102207	102207	Luna	264	“ Did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow ? ”
102222	102234	102235	102235	He	136	“ Hi , Luna . Hermione , you left your stuff ... ”
102241	102245	102247	102247	Hermione	180	“ Oh yes , ”
102275	102289	102265	102265	she	180	“ Thank you , Harry . Well , I ’d better get going ... ”
102315	102322	102324	102324	Luna	264	“ She ’s a bit upset , ”
102326	102354	102324	102324	Luna	264	“ I thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there , but it turned out to be Hermione . She said something about that Ron Weasley ... ”
102355	102364	102366	102366	Harry	136	“ Yeah , they ’ve had a row , ”
102368	102380	102382	102382	Luna	264	“ He says very funny things sometimes , does n’t he ? ”
102393	102408	102382	102382	Luna	264	“ But he can be a bit unkind . I noticed that last year . ”
102409	102413	102415	102415	Harry	136	“ I s’pose , ”
102437	102446	102420	102420	her	264	“ So have you had a good term ? ”
102447	102456	102458	102458	Luna	264	“ Oh , it ’s been all right , ”
102460	102491	102458	102458	Luna	264	“ A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny ’s been nice , though . She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me ‘ Loony ’ the other day — ”
102492	102507	102535	102535	Luna	264	“ How would you like to come to Slughorn ’s party with me tonight ? ”
102545	102553	102535	102535	Luna	264	“ Slughorn ’s party ? With you ? ”
102554	102557	102559	102559	Harry	136	“ Yeah , ”
102561	102579	102580	102580	He	136	“ We ’re supposed to bring guests , so I thought you might like ... I mean ... ”
102590	102609	102610	102610	He	136	“ I mean , just as friends , you know . But if you do n’t want to ... ”
102622	102637	102639	102639	Luna	264	“ Oh , no , I ’d love to go with you as friends ! ”
102651	102684	102639	102639	Luna	264	“ Nobody ’s ever asked me to a party before , as a friend ! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow , for the party ? Should I do mine too ? ”
102685	102688	102690	102690	Harry	136	“ No , ”
102693	102725	102690	102690	Harry	136	“ that was a mistake . I ’ll get Hermione to put it right for me . So , I ’ll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o’clock then . ”
102726	102729	102690	102690	Harry	136	“ AHA ! ”
102769	102787	102789	102789	he	2327	“ Potty asked Loony to go to the party ! Potty lurves Loony ! Potty luuuuurves Looooooony ! ”
102797	102802	102789	102789	he	2327	“ Potty loves Loony ! ”
102803	102811	102813	102813	Harry	136	“ Nice to keep these things private , ”
102842	102849	102851	102851	Ron	201	“ You could ’ve taken anyone ! ”
102857	102866	102851	102851	Ron	201	“ Anyone ! And you chose Loony Lovegood ? ”
102867	102876	102878	102878	Ginny	222	“ Do n’t call her that , Ron , ”
102890	102907	102909	102909	she	222	“ I ’m really glad you ’re taking her , Harry , she ’s so excited . ”
102969	102975	102977	102977	Harry	136	“ You could say sorry , ”
102980	102992	102994	102994	Ron	201	“ What , and get attacked by another flock of canaries ? ”
102996	103006	102994	102994	Ron	201	“ What did you have to imitate her for ? ”
103007	103014	103051	103051	Harry	136	“ She laughed at my mustache ! ”
103015	103030	103032	103032	Ron	201	“ So did I , it was the stupidest thing I ’ve ever seen . ”
103064	103069	103071	103071	Parvati	312	“ Hi , Harry , ”
103090	103093	103095	103095	Harry	136	“ Hi , ”
103097	103119	103095	103095	Harry	136	“ How ’re you ? You ’re staying at Hogwarts , then ? I heard your parents wanted you to leave . ”
103120	103134	103136	103136	Parvati	312	“ I managed to talk them out of it for the time being , ”
103138	103162	103136	103136	Parvati	312	“ That Katie thing really freaked them out , but as there has n’t been anything since ... Oh , hi , Hermione ! ”
103206	103211	103213	103213	Hermione	180	“ Hi , Parvati ! ”
103221	103231	103213	103213	Hermione	180	“ Are you going to Slughorn ’s party tonight ? ”
103232	103236	103238	103238	Parvati	312	“ No invite , ”
103241	103269	103238	103238	Parvati	312	“ I ’d love to go , though , it sounds like it ’s going to be really good ... You ’re going , are n’t you ? ”
103270	103284	103213	103213	Hermione	180	“ Yes , I ’m meeting Cormac at eight , and we ’re — ”
103314	103325	103306	103306	she	180	“ — we ’re going up to the party together . ”
103326	103329	103331	103331	Parvati	312	“ Cormac ? ”
103333	103340	103331	103331	Parvati	312	“ Cormac McLaggen , you mean ? ”
103341	103346	103348	103348	Hermione	180	“ That ’s right , ”
103351	103356	103358	103358	she	180	“ The one who almost ”
103369	103374	103358	103358	she	180	“ became Gryffindor Keeper . ”
103375	103385	103387	103387	Parvati	312	“ Are you going out with him , then ? ”
103393	103403	103405	103405	Hermione	180	“ Oh — yes — did n’t you know ? ”
103417	103420	103422	103422	Parvati	312	“ No ! ”
103433	103452	103422	103422	Parvati	312	“ Wow , you like your Quidditch players , do n’t you ? First Krum , then McLaggen ... ”
103453	103461	103464	103464	her	180	“ I like really good Quidditch players , ”
103469	103485	103486	103486	She	180	“ Well , see you ... Got to go and get ready for the party ... ”
103641	103644	103645	103645	he	136	“ Hi , ”
103648	103655	103645	103645	he	136	“ Shall we get going then ? ”
103656	103660	103661	103661	she	264	“ Oh yes , ”
103665	103671	103661	103661	she	264	“ Where is the party ? ”
103672	103677	103679	103679	Harry	136	“ Slughorn ’s office , ”
103695	103709	103679	103679	Harry	136	“ Did you hear , there ’s supposed to be a vampire coming ? ”
103710	103714	103716	103716	Luna	264	“ Rufus Scrimgeour ? ”
103718	103723	103725	103725	Harry	136	“ I — what ? ”
103729	103737	103725	103725	Harry	136	“ You mean the Minister of Magic ? ”
103738	103746	103748	103748	Luna	264	“ Yes , he ’s a vampire , ”
103755	103798	103799	103799	Harry	136	“ Father wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge , but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry . Obviously , they did n’t want the truth to get out ! ”
104031	104036	104038	104038	Slughorn	200	“ Harry , m’boy ! ”
104054	104071	104072	104072	Slughorn	200	“ Come in , come in , so many people I ’d like you to meet ! ”
104121	104159	104109	104109	Harry	136	“ Harry , I ’d like you to meet Eldred Worple , an old student of mine , author of Blood Brothers : My Life Amongst the Vampires — and , of course , his friend Sanguini . ”
104220	104229	104231	104231	Worple	410	“ Harry Potter , I am simply delighted ! ”
104241	104270	104231	104231	Worple	410	“ I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day , ‘ Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been waiting ? ’ ”
104271	104274	104276	104276	Harry	136	“ Er , ”
104278	104282	104276	104276	Harry	136	“ were you ? ”
104283	104291	104293	104293	Worple	410	“ Just as modest as Horace described ! ”
104295	104298	104300	104300	his	410	“ But seriously ”
104309	104392	104394	104394	Worple	410	“ I would be delighted to write it myself — people are craving to know more about you , dear boy , craving ! If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews , say in four- or five - hour sessions , why , we could have the book finished within months . And all with very little effort on your part , I assure you — ask Sanguini here if it is n’t quite — Sanguini , stay here ! ”
104420	104427	104429	104429	Worple	410	“ Here , have a pasty , ”
104452	104468	104446	104446	his	410	“ My dear boy , the gold you could make , you have no idea — ”
104469	104476	104478	104478	Harry	136	“ I ’m definitely not interested , ”
104481	104494	104495	104495	He	136	“ and I ’ve just seen a friend of mine , sorry . ”
104527	104532	104504	104504	he	136	“ Hermione ! Hermione ! ”
104533	104547	104501	104502	the crowd	1262	“ Harry ! There you are , thank goodness ! Hi , Luna ! ”
104548	104555	104557	104557	Harry	136	“ What ’s happened to you ? ”
104583	104600	104601	104601	she	180	“ Oh , I ’ve just escaped — I mean , I ’ve just left Cormac , ”
104604	104609	104610	104610	she	180	“ Under the mistletoe , ”
104624	104633	104634	104634	he	136	“ Serves you right for coming with him , ”
104639	104648	104650	104650	Hermione	180	“ I thought he ’d annoy Ron most , ”
104653	104671	104650	104650	Hermione	180	“ I debated for a while about Zacharias Smith , but I thought , on the whole — ”
104672	104677	104679	104679	Harry	136	“ You considered Smith ? ”
104683	104727	104679	104679	Harry	136	“ Yes , I did , and I ’m starting to wish I ’d chosen him , McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman . Let ’s go this way , we ’ll be able to see him coming , he ’s so tall ... ”
104764	104767	104769	104769	Luna	264	“ Hello , ”
104775	104782	104784	104785	Professor Trelawney	301	“ Good evening , my dear , ”
104801	104812	104794	104794	Harry	136	“ I have n’t seen you in my classes lately ... ”
104813	104823	104825	104825	Luna	264	“ No , I ’ve got Firenze this year , ”
104827	104833	104835	104836	Professor Trelawney	301	“ Oh , of course , ”
104844	104904	104905	104906	Professor Trelawney	301	“ Or Dobbin , as I prefer to think of him . You would have thought , would you not , that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse ? But no ... we share classes ... It ’s an insult , frankly , an insult . Do you know ... ”
104932	104952	104924	104924	Harry	136	“ Let ’s get something straight . Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts ? ”
104958	104969	104970	104970	Harry	136	“ Do you really think I ’d stoop that low ? ”
104976	104986	104970	104970	Harry	136	“ Hermione , if you can ask out McLaggen — ”
104987	104993	104995	104995	Hermione	180	“ There ’s a difference , ”
104999	105023	104995	104995	Hermione	180	“ I ’ve got no plans to tell Ron anything about what might , or might not , have happened at Keeper tryouts . ”
105024	105027	105029	105029	Harry	136	“ Good , ”
105032	105049	105029	105029	Harry	136	“ Because he ’ll just fall apart again , and we ’ll lose the next match — ”
105050	105053	105055	105055	Hermione	180	“ Quidditch ! ”
105058	105106	105055	105055	Hermione	180	“ Is that all boys care about ? Cormac has n’t asked me one single question about myself , no , I ’ve just been treated to ‘ A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen ’ nonstop ever since — oh no , here he comes ! ”
105138	105142	105147	105147	his	276	“ Seen Hermione ? ”
105156	105161	105163	105163	Harry	136	“ No , sorry , ”
105187	105191	105193	105194	Professor Trelawney	301	“ Harry Potter ! ”
105208	105213	105215	105215	Harry	136	“ Oh , hello , ”
105218	105223	105224	105224	she	180	“ My dear boy ! ”
105232	105289	105224	105224	she	180	“ The rumors ! The stories ! ‘ The Chosen One ’ ! Of course , I have known for a very long time ... The omens were never good , Harry ... But why have you not returned to Divination ? For you , of all people , the subject is of the utmost importance ! ”
105290	105304	105311	105311	Slughorn	184	“ Ah , Sybill , we all think our subject ’s most important ! ”
105348	105364	105366	105366	Slughorn	184	“ But I do n’t think I ’ve ever known such a natural at Potions ! ”
105379	105414	105366	105366	Slughorn	184	“ Instinctive , you know — like his mother ! I ’ve only ever taught a few with this kind of ability , I can tell you that , Sybill — why even Severus — ”
105438	105449	105451	105451	Slughorn	184	“ Stop skulking and come and join us , Severus ! ”
105454	105484	105451	105451	Slughorn	184	“ I was just talking about Harry ’s exceptional potion - making ! Some credit must go to you , of course , you taught him for five years ! ”
105509	105527	105498	105498	his	147	“ Funny , I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all . ”
105528	105538	105540	105540	Slughorn	184	“ Well , then , it ’s natural ability ! ”
105542	105580	105540	105540	Slughorn	184	“ You should have seen what he gave me , first lesson , Draught of Living Death — never had a student produce finer on a first attempt , I do n’t think even you , Severus — ”
105581	105584	105586	105586	Snape	147	“ Really ? ”
105622	105634	105636	105636	Slughorn	184	“ Remind me what other subjects you ’re taking , Harry ? ”
105638	105651	105636	105636	Slughorn	184	“ Defense Against the Dark Arts , Charms , Transfiguration , Herbology ... ”
105652	105665	105667	105667	Snape	147	“ All the subjects required , in short , for an Auror , ”
105674	105688	105690	105690	Harry	136	“ Yeah , well , that ’s what I ’d like to do , ”
105693	105703	105705	105705	Slughorn	184	“ And a great one you ’ll make too ! ”
105707	105720	105722	105722	Luna	264	“ I do n’t think you should be an Auror , Harry , ”
105730	105768	105725	105725	Everybody	1074	“ The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy , I thought everyone knew that . They ’re working to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a combination of Dark Magic and gum disease . ”
105832	105836	105838	105838	Filch	417	“ Professor Slughorn , ”
105856	105893	105852	105852	his	417	“ I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor . He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out . Did you issue him with an invitation ? ”
105906	105915	105916	105916	he	417	“ All right , I was n’t invited ! ”
105920	105931	105916	105916	he	417	“ I was trying to gate - crash , happy ? ”
105932	105939	105941	105941	Filch	417	“ No , I ’m not ! ”
105955	105987	105941	105941	Filch	417	“ You ’re in trouble , you are ! Did n’t the headmaster say that nighttime prowling ’s out , unless you ’ve got permission , did n’t he , eh ? ”
105988	106001	106003	106003	Slughorn	200	“ That ’s all right , Argus , that ’s all right , ”
106009	106044	106003	106003	Slughorn	200	“ It ’s Christmas , and it ’s not a crime to want to come to a party . Just this once , we ’ll forget any punishment ; you may stay , Draco . ”
106141	106148	106150	106150	Slughorn	200	“ It ’s nothing , nothing , ”
106158	106168	106150	106150	Slughorn	200	“ I did know your grandfather , after all ... ”
106169	106180	106182	106182	Malfoy	159	“ He always spoke very highly of you , sir , ”
106185	106199	106182	106182	Malfoy	159	“ Said you were the best potion - maker he ’d ever known ... ”
106279	106290	106292	106292	Snape	147	“ I ’d like a word with you , Draco , ”
106295	106302	106304	106304	Slughorn	200	“ Oh , now , Severus , ”
106309	106320	106304	106304	Slughorn	200	“ it ’s Christmas , do n’t be too hard — ”
106321	106342	106344	106344	Snape	147	“ I ’m his Head of House , and I shall decide how hard , or otherwise , to be , ”
106347	106353	106344	106344	Snape	147	“ Follow me , Draco . ”
106378	106393	106366	106366	Harry	136	“ I ’ll be back in a bit , Luna — er — bathroom . ”
106394	106398	106399	106399	she	2370	“ All right , ”
106568	106585	106705	106705	Snape	147	“ . . . can not afford mistakes , Draco , because if you are expelled — ”
106586	106600	106705	106705	Snape	147	“ I did n’t have anything to do with it , all right ? ”
106601	106629	106705	106705	Snape	147	“ I hope you are telling the truth , because it was both clumsy and foolish . Already you are suspected of having a hand in it . ”
106630	106635	106637	106637	Malfoy	159	“ Who suspects me ? ”
106640	106698	106637	106637	Malfoy	159	“ For the last time , I did n’t do it , okay ? That Bell girl must ’ve had an enemy no one knows about — do n’t look at me like that ! I know what you ’re doing , I ’m not stupid , but it wo n’t work — I can stop you ! ”
106709	106736	106705	106705	Snape	147	“ Ah ... Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency , I see . What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master , Draco ? ”
106737	106757	106758	106758	Harry	136	“ I ’m not trying to conceal anything from him , I just do n’t want you butting in ! ”
106794	106838	106781	106781	Snape	147	“ So that is why you have been avoiding me this term ? You have feared my interference ? You realize that , had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there , Draco — ”
106839	106851	106853	106853	Malfoy	159	“ So put me in detention ! Report me to Dumbledore ! ”
106864	106881	106861	106861	Snape	147	“ You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things . ”
106882	106896	106906	106906	his	147	“ You ’d better stop telling me to come to your office then ! ”
106897	106902	106904	106904	Snape	147	“ Listen to me , ”
106926	106952	106906	106906	his	147	“ I am trying to help you . I swore to your mother I would protect you . I made the Unbreakable Vow , Draco — ”
106953	107014	106906	106906	his	147	“ Looks like you ’ll have to break it , then , because I do n’t need your protection ! It ’s my job , he gave it to me and I ’m doing it , I ’ve got a plan and it ’s going to work , it ’s just taking a bit longer than I thought it would ! ”
107015	107021	106906	106906	his	147	“ What is your plan ? ”
107022	107030	106906	106906	his	147	“ It ’s none of your business ! ”
107031	107048	106906	106906	his	147	“ If you tell me what you are trying to do , I can assist you — ”
107049	107066	106906	106906	his	147	“ I ’ve got all the assistance I need , thanks , I ’m not alone ! ”
107067	107094	106906	106906	his	147	“ You were certainly alone tonight , which was foolish in the extreme , wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup , these are elementary mistakes — ”
107095	107114	106906	106906	his	147	“ I would ’ve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you had n’t put them in detention ! ”
107115	107121	107123	107123	Snape	147	“ Keep your voice down ! ”
107133	107169	107126	107126	Malfoy	159	“ If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. this time around , they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres — ”
107170	107176	107178	107178	Malfoy	159	“ What does it matter ? ”
107180	107212	107178	107178	Malfoy	159	“ Defense Against the Dark Arts — it ’s all just a joke , is n’t it , an act ? Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts — ”
107213	107226	107228	107228	Snape	147	“ It is an act that is crucial to success , Draco ! ”
107230	107285	107228	107228	Snape	147	“ Where do you think I would have been all these years , if I had not known how to act ? Now listen to me ! You are being incautious , wandering around at night , getting yourself caught , and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle — ”
107286	107306	107343	107343	Snape	147	“ They ’re not the only ones , I ’ve got other people on my side , better people ! ”
107307	107319	107343	107343	Snape	147	“ Then why not confide in me , and I can — ”
107320	107336	107343	107343	Snape	147	“ I know what you ’re up to ! You want to steal my glory ! ”
107347	107371	107343	107343	Snape	147	“ You are speaking like a child . I quite understand that your father ’s capture and imprisonment has upset you , but — ”
107490	107491	107482	107482	He	147	” “
107499	107503	107482	107482	He	147	” said Harry , “
107512	107513	107514	107514	I	0	” “
107519	107554	107557	107557	Snape	147	” said Ron . They were standing alone at the Burrow ’s kitchen sink , peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs. Weasley . Snow was drifting past the window in front of them . “
107564	107568	107569	107569	He	147	” said Harry . “
107591	107592	107582	107582	he	147	” “
107597	107604	107569	107569	He	147	” said Ron , looking stunned . “
107616	107617	107613	107613	you	0	” “
107624	107628	107620	107620	I	0	” said Harry . “

107676	107681	107682	107682	Fred	217	” said Ron simply . “
107720	107732	107716	107716	He	227	” said Ron , with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes . “
107757	107758	107745	107745	Fred	217	” “
107770	107771	107745	107745	Fred	217	” “
107777	107789	107745	107745	Fred	217	” said Fred ’s voice as the twins entered the kitchen . “
107808	107809	107806	107806	them	2387	” “
107823	107828	107810	107810	I	0	” said Ron grumpily , “
107841	107842	107831	107831	I	0	” “
107846	107864	107831	107831	I	0	” said George , sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it , “
107883	107884	107885	107885	You	0	” “
107891	107901	107885	107885	You	0	” said Ron angrily , sucking his cut thumb . “
107910	107911	107902	107902	You	0	” “
107926	107930	107915	107915	you	0	” yawned Fred . “
107940	107944	107938	107938	Ronald	204	” said George , “
107969	107989	107966	107967	Lavender Brown	310	” Ron turned a little pink , but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts . “
107995	107996	107991	107991	your	204	” “
108002	108006	107991	107991	your	204	” said Fred . “
108032	108033	107991	107991	your	204	” “
108038	108039	107991	107991	your	204	” “
108048	108049	108041	108041	she	2389	” “
108052	108053	108041	108041	she	2389	” “
108069	108104	108105	108105	Ron	201	” Mrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred , who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand . “
108107	108112	108105	108105	Ron	201	” she said furiously . “
108125	108126	108115	108115	you	201	” “
108131	108135	108137	108137	you	2391	” said Ron , “
108140	108156	108157	108157	Fred	217	” he added under his breath , as he turned back to the sprout mountain . “
108184	108185	108174	108174	Bill	226	” “
108189	108193	108174	108174	Bill	226	” said George . “
108220	108221	108215	108215	Fleur	224	” “
108230	108234	108226	108226	Ginny	222	” muttered Fred . “
108251	108260	108261	108261	Percy	232	” said Mrs. Weasley , sounding slightly harassed . “
108271	108283	108265	108265	his	232	” asked Fred . Mrs. Weasley turned away before she answered . “
108297	108298	108286	108286	he	232	” “
108308	108319	108352	108352	you	2399	” said Fred , as Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen . “
108336	108337	108334	108334	George	218	” “
108345	108349	108340	108340	you	2399	” asked Ron . “
108373	108374	108352	108352	you	2399	” “
108386	108391	108377	108377	I	0	” said Fred seriously . “
108419	108420	108417	108417	Squibs	420	” “
108433	108444	108431	108431	Ron	201	” added George , throwing the paper airplane at him , “
108490	108491	108467	108508	a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous ... almost like real magic ... ” “ Gits , ” said Ron darkly , watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard	5581	” “
108494	108510	108467	108508	a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous ... almost like real magic ... ” “ Gits , ” said Ron darkly , watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard	5581	” said Ron darkly , watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard . “
108526	108527	108467	108508	a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous ... almost like real magic ... ” “ Gits , ” said Ron darkly , watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard	5581	” “
108532	108536	108528	108528	I	0	” said Harry . “
108551	108552	108528	108528	I	0	” “
108556	108570	108528	108528	I	0	” said Ron . He peeled a few more sprouts and then said , “
108588	108589	108578	108578	you	0	” “
108592	108596	108578	108578	you	0	” said Harry . “
108629	108630	108619	108619	I	0	” “
108644	108645	108646	108646	I	0	” “
108668	108682	108661	108661	he	159	” There was silence for a moment or two , then Ron said , “
108727	108728	108733	108733	him	147	” “
108735	108740	108729	108729	They	2407	” said Harry flatly . “
108753	108754	108751	108751	Snape	147	” “
108764	108776	108757	108757	I	0	” said Ron . Harry turned to face him , frowning . “
108785	108786	108779	108779	I	0	” “
108792	108797	108789	108789	I	0	” said Ron hastily . “
108818	109041	109042	109042	I	0	” Harry said nothing . It had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence ; he could hear Hermione now : Obviously , Harry , he was pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he ’s doing ... This was pure imagination , however , as he had had no opportunity to tell Hermione what he had overheard . She had disappeared from Slughorn ’s party before he returned to it , or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen , and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room . As he and Ron had left for the Burrow early the next day , he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays . He was not entirely sure that she had heard him , though ; Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good - bye just behind him at the time . Still , even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing : Malfoy was definitely up to something , and Snape knew it , so Harry felt fully justified in saying “
109047	109286	109042	109042	I	0	” which he had done several times to Ron already . Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley , who was working very long hours at the Ministry , until Christmas Eve night . The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room , which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paper - chain explosion . Fred , George , Harry , and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as he pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner . Stupefied , painted gold , stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to its back , it glowered down at them all , the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen , with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet . They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs. Weasley ’s favorite singer , Celestina Warbeck , whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set . Fleur , who seemed to find Celestina very dull , was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume control , so that Celestina grew louder and louder . Under cover of a particularly jazzy number called “
109296	109362	109363	109363	We	2412	” Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny . Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks , as though hoping to pick up tips . Meanwhile , Remus Lupin , who was thinner and more ragged - looking than ever , was sitting beside the fire , staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestina ’s voice . “
109372	109384	109363	109363	We	2412	” said Mrs. Weasley , wiping her eyes on her knitting . “
109391	109392	109386	109386	you	2413	” “
109395	109412	109386	109386	you	2413	” said Mr. Weasley , whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling . “
109419	109443	109363	109363	We	2412	” With an effort , he sat up a little straighter and looked around at Harry , who was sitting next to him . “
109448	109465	109363	109363	We	2412	” he said , jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus . “
109470	109471	109386	109386	you	2413	” “
109475	109481	109386	109386	you	2413	” said Harry , grinning . “
109490	109491	109543	109543	Harry	136	” “
109494	109499	109543	109543	Harry	136	” said Mr. Weasley . “
109545	109559	109543	109543	Harry	136	” he added quickly , looking much more awake all of a sudden . “
109571	109575	109569	109569	they	2416	” asked Harry . “
109581	109586	109569	109569	they	2416	” said Mr. Weasley . “
109662	109663	109664	109664	I	0	” “
109670	109704	109705	109705	You	2420	” said Harry . He hesitated for a moment , wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say ; as he marshaled his thoughts , Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called “
109714	109715	109705	109705	You	2420	” “
109736	109737	109738	109738	I	0	” “
109743	109750	109741	109741	Harry	136	” said Mr. Weasley at once . “
109776	109777	109780	109780	I	0	” “
109804	109854	109780	109780	I	0	” And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape . As Harry spoke , he saw Lupin ’s head turn a little toward him , taking in every word . When he had finished , there was silence , except for Celestina ’s crooning . “
109863	109868	109861	109861	Harry	136	” said Mr. Weasley , “
109876	109877	109870	109870	Snape	147	” “
109895	109900	109870	109870	Snape	147	” said Harry quickly . “
109916	109917	109950	109950	Dumbledore	138	” “
109926	109947	109948	109948	It	2426	” said Lupin unexpectedly . He had turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr. Weasley . “
109970	109971	109954	109954	Dumbledore	138	” “
109974	109978	109984	109984	Dumbledore	138	” said Harry , “
109990	109991	109992	109992	People	584	” “
110022	110023	110020	110020	Severus	147	” “
110030	110034	110035	110035	He	138	” argued Harry . “
110042	110052	110038	110038	himself	138	” — he looked Lupin straight in the eye — “
110059	110060	110054	110054	you	204	” “
110068	110072	110061	110061	I	0	” said Lupin . “
110083	110094	110075	110075	Harry	136	” he added , as Harry pulled a skeptical expression . “
110167	110168	110170	110170	he	147	” “
110189	110197	110170	110170	he	147	” said Harry angrily . Lupin shrugged . “
110240	110241	110243	110243	he	147	” “
110256	110260	110261	110261	You	136	” said Harry . “
110270	110278	110268	110268	Harry	136	” said Lupin with a faint smile . “
110355	110386	110351	110351	Severus	147	” Celestina ended her song on a very long , high - pitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless , which Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically . “
110391	110396	110351	110351	Severus	147	” said Fleur loudly . “
110405	110406	110351	110351	Severus	147	” “
110415	110426	110351	110351	Severus	147	” asked Mr. Weasley loudly , leaping to his feet . “
110431	110432	110351	110351	Severus	147	” “
110441	110465	110435	110435	you	136	” Harry asked Lupin , as Mr. Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog , and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation . “
110473	110477	110468	110468	I	0	” said Lupin . “
110506	110507	110510	110510	you	136	” “
110513	110514	110510	110510	you	136	” “
110526	110530	110531	110531	Werewolves	245	” said Lupin . “
110533	110544	110531	110531	Werewolves	245	” he added , at Harry ’s look of incomprehension . “
110568	110590	110591	110591	I	0	” He sounded a little bitter , and perhaps realized it , for he smiled more warmly as he went on , “
110656	110657	110660	110660	they	621	” “
110664	110665	110666	110666	They	621	” “
110681	110685	110666	110666	They	621	” said Lupin . “
110697	110698	110693	110693	Greyback	258	” “
110703	110704	110701	110701	Greyback	258	” “
110712	110722	110705	110705	You	2443	” Lupin ’s hands closed convulsively in his lap . “
110827	110834	110837	110837	Greyback	258	” Lupin paused and then said , “
110842	110843	110837	110837	Greyback	258	” “
110846	110852	110837	110837	Greyback	258	” said Harry , astonished . “
110864	110865	110861	110861	you	0	” “
111000	111001	110981	110981	Greyback	258	” “
111007	111012	111003	111003	you	2460	” said Harry fiercely . “
111022	111028	111013	111013	You	2460	” Lupin burst out laughing . “
111064	111117	111050	111051	Many people	1603	” He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks , looking slightly more cheerful . Harry , meanwhile , felt a rush of excitement : This last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to asking Lupin . “
111131	111132	111133	111136	The Half - Blood	2463	” “
111139	111140	111141	111141	Prince	2464	” “
111143	111155	111141	111141	Prince	2464	” said Harry , watching him closely for signs of recognition . “
111162	111169	111158	111160	no Wizarding princes	2465	” said Lupin , now smiling . “
111194	111195	111180	111180	I	0	” “
111204	111209	111210	111214	The Half - Blood Prince	1659	” said Harry indignantly . “
111249	111250	111247	111247	Levicorpus	422	” “
111265	111270	111247	111247	Levicorpus	422	” said Lupin reminiscently . “
111295	111296	111297	111297	My	0	” “
111302	111306	111309	111309	him	4773	” said Harry . “
111320	111360	111314	111314	he	4773	” He tried to sound casual , as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance , but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect ; Lupin ’s smile was a little too understanding . “
111363	111367	111314	111314	he	4773	” he said , “
111394	111395	111385	111385	You	2460	” “
111409	111413	111404	111404	you	0	” Harry persisted . “
111417	111421	111404	111404	you	0	” said Lupin . “
111433	111445	111446	111446	James	283	” He looked into Harry ’s face and then said quietly , “
111469	111476	111458	111458	he	283	” Abandoning pretense , Harry said , “
111486	111487	111484	111484	you	0	” “
111491	111492	111484	111484	you	0	” “
111495	111502	111484	111484	you	0	” Harry stared into the fire . “
111524	111525	111509	111509	he	283	” “
111534	111535	111532	111532	Harry	136	” “
111544	111545	111532	111532	Harry	136	” “
111564	111578	111558	111559	the Prince	330	” said Lupin . Shortly after this , Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing “
111588	111771	111772	111772	She	2472	” which was taken by everyone , once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley ’s expression , to be the cue to go to bed . Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron ’s attic bedroom , where a camp bed had been added for Harry . Ron fell asleep almost immediately , but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced Potion - Making before getting into bed . There he turned its pages , searching , until he finally found , at the front of the book , the date that it had been published . It was nearly fifty years old . Neither his father , nor his father ’s friends , had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago . Feeling disappointed , Harry threw the book back into his trunk , turned off the lamp , and rolled over , thinking of werewolves and Snape , Stan Shunpike and the Half - Blood Prince , and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children ... “
111779	111841	111772	111772	She	2472	” Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed . He put on his glasses and looked around ; the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and , in front of it , Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain . “
111846	111850	111772	111772	She	2472	” asked Harry . “
111856	111863	111864	111864	She	2472	” said Ron , sounding revolted . “
111873	111901	111864	111864	She	2472	” Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter . Dangling from the chain in large gold letters were the words : My Sweetheart . “
111904	111908	111864	111864	She	2472	” he said . “
111923	111924	111921	111921	George	218	” “
111930	111944	111945	111945	I	0	” said Ron , shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow , “
111952	111953	111949	111949	I	0	” “
111958	111964	111949	111949	I	0	” said Harry , grinning . “
111971	111972	111969	111969	I	0	” “
111986	111997	111975	111975	she	2472	” Ron demanded of thin air , looking rather shocked . “
112003	112007	111975	111975	she	2472	” said Harry . “
112034	112035	112009	112009	you	0	” “
112045	112049	112038	112038	we	2474	” said Ron . “
112054	112055	112038	112038	we	2474	” “
112058	112062	112038	112038	we	2474	” said Harry . “
112067	112079	112038	112038	we	2474	” said Ron . He hesitated a moment , then said , “
112088	112089	112086	112086	McLaggen	276	” “
112093	112097	112086	112086	McLaggen	276	” said Harry . “
112116	112192	112107	112107	I	0	” Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking . Harry ’s presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front , hand - knitted by Mrs. Weasley , a large box of Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes products from the twins , and a slightly damp , moldy - smelling package that came with a label reading TO MASTER , FROM KREACHER . Harry stared at it . “
112201	112205	112107	112107	I	0	” he asked . “
112223	112235	112236	112236	I	0	” replied Ron , though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously . “
112256	112265	112266	112266	Hermione	180	” asked Harry , prodding the parcel cautiously . “
112269	112273	112266	112266	Hermione	180	” said Ron . “
112289	112317	112266	112266	Hermione	180	” A moment later , Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed ; the package contained a large number of maggots . “
112320	112328	112266	112266	Hermione	180	” said Ron , roaring with laughter . “
112332	112333	112266	112266	Hermione	180	” “
112343	112419	112420	112420	Fred	217	” said Harry , which sobered Ron up at once . Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch , everyone except Fleur ( on whom , it appeared , Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one ) and Mrs. Weasley herself , who was sporting a brand - new midnight blue witch ’s hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds , and a spectacular golden necklace . “
112433	112434	112420	112420	Fred	217	” “
112456	112465	112449	112449	we	2478	” said George , waving an airy hand . “
112470	112471	112472	112472	Harry	136	” “
112483	112514	112516	112518	Ow ’ orrible	423	” said Ginny cheerfully , leaning across the table to pick it out ; Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot . “
112520	112530	112516	112518	Ow ’ orrible	423	” said Fleur , with an affected little shudder . “
112537	112541	112542	112542	Gravy	424	” said Ron . “
112546	112580	112544	112544	Fleur	224	” In his eagerness to help her , he knocked the gravy boat flying ; Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat . “
112589	112604	112605	112605	She	210	” said Fleur to Ron , when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks . “
112610	112611	112605	112605	She	210	” “
112621	112638	112612	112612	I	0	” said Mrs. Weasley , setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur . “
112654	112655	112646	112646	you	136	” “
112669	112673	112658	112658	I	0	” said Lupin . “
112689	112690	112687	112687	she	210	” “
112693	112698	112687	112687	she	210	” said Mrs. Weasley . “
112715	112810	112811	112811	Tonks	210	” She gave Lupin an annoyed look , as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daughter - in - law instead of Tonks , but Harry , glancing across at Fleur , who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork , thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a long - lost battle . He was , however , reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks , and who better to ask than Lupin , the man who knew all about Patronuses ? “
112819	112824	112825	112825	Snape	147	” he told him . “
112844	112858	112840	112841	your Patronus	2481	” Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly , “
112869	112870	112871	112871	It	2481	” “
112881	112895	112871	112871	It	2481	” said Harry , struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice . “
112904	112905	112906	112906	Arthur	206	” “
112908	112938	112939	112939	Arthur	206	” said Mrs. Weasley suddenly . She had risen from her chair ; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window . “
112945	112946	112943	112943	Percy	232	” “
112949	113003	113004	113004	Arthur	206	” Mr. Weasley looked around . Everybody looked quickly at the window ; Ginny stood up for a better look . There , sure enough , was Percy Weasley , striding across the snowy yard , his horn - rimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight . He was not , however , alone . “
113015	113097	113009	113009	he	232	” And sure enough , the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet was following along in Percy ’s wake , limping slightly , his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow . Before any of them could say anything , before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do more than exchange stunned looks , the back door opened and there stood Percy . There was a moment ’s painful silence . Then Percy said rather stiffly , “
113103	113104	113101	113101	Mother	247	” “
113109	113143	113107	113107	Percy	232	” said Mrs. Weasley , and she threw herself into his arms . Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway , leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene . “
113150	113168	113144	113144	You	247	” he said , when Mrs. Weasley looked around at him , beaming and wiping her eyes . “
113194	113247	113183	113183	he	232	” But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family . He stood , poker - straight and awkward - looking , and stared over everybody else ’s heads . Mr. Weasley , Fred , and George were all observing him , stony - faced . “
113258	113267	113268	113271	Have a little purkey	2485	” fluttered Mrs. Weasley , straightening her hat . “
113280	113281	113268	113271	Have a little purkey	2485	” “
113290	113310	113288	113288	Molly	207	” said Scrimgeour . Harry guessed that he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house . “
113336	113337	113340	113340	Perce	232	” “
113342	113354	113340	113340	Perce	232	” said Mrs. Weasley tearfully , reaching up to kiss him . “
113428	113489	113421	113421	he	2493	” The atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly . Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to Harry . Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour ’s pretense that he did not know Harry ’s name convincing , or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny , Fleur , and George also had clean plates . “
113495	113550	113421	113421	he	2493	” said Harry into the silence . He was not fooled ; for all Scrimgeour ’s talk that they had just been in the area , that Percy wanted to look up his family , this must be the real reason that they had come , so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone . “
113555	113573	113421	113421	he	2493	” he said quietly , as he passed Lupin , who had half risen from his chair . “
113576	113589	113421	113421	he	2493	” he added , as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak . “
113592	113609	113610	113610	We	2494	” said Scrimgeour , standing back to let Harry pass through the door ahead of him . “
113633	113688	113631	113631	everyone	4489	” Harry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys ’ overgrown , snow - covered garden , Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side . He had , Harry knew , been Head of the Auror office ; he looked tough and battle - scarred , very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat . “
113691	113712	113631	113631	everyone	4489	” said Scrimgeour , stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants . “
113715	113729	113730	113730	I	0	” Harry said nothing . He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching him . “
113742	113751	113730	113730	I	0	” said Scrimgeour , after a few moments . “
113757	113758	113753	113753	you	2497	” “
113761	113766	113753	113753	you	2497	” said Harry truthfully . “
113785	113789	113777	113777	Dumbledore	138	” said Scrimgeour . “
113811	113831	113832	113832	I	0	” He waited for Harry to say something , but Harry did not oblige , so he went on , “
113863	113872	113850	113850	Dumbledore	138	” Still , Harry said nothing , waiting . “
113880	113884	113850	113850	Dumbledore	138	” said Scrimgeour . “
113915	113932	113936	113936	I	0	” They were getting near it now , Harry thought , the reason Scrimgeour was here . “
113947	114014	113939	113939	Dumbledore	138	” Harry deliberated , wondering whether he ought to lie or not . He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds , and the scuffed - up patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree . Finally , he decided on the truth ... or a bit of it . “
114022	114023	113939	113939	Dumbledore	138	” “
114030	114074	113939	113939	Dumbledore	138	” said Scrimgeour . Harry could see , out of the corner of his eye , Scrimgeour squinting at him , so he pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron . “
114084	114085	114078	114078	Dumbledore	138	” “
114094	114123	114078	114078	Dumbledore	138	” said Harry . He kept his voice as pleasant as he could , and Scrimgeour ’s tone , too , was light and friendly as he said , “
114169	114184	114185	114185	I	0	” Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before responding . “
114196	114197	114191	114191	you	0	” “
114210	114217	114191	114191	you	0	” said Scrimgeour with a laugh . “
114244	114295	114238	114238	people	584	” Harry said nothing . He thought he saw , dimly , where they were heading , but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there . The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots , and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it . “
114309	114313	114306	114306	you	2497	” said Scrimgeour . “
114358	114369	114383	114383	Harry	136	” he pressed on , without waiting for a reply , “
114465	114513	114514	114516	Funny little chaps	2513	” The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm . It was now tugging very hard on it , trying to get it out of the frozen ground . Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said , looking from Harry to the gnome , “
114529	114530	114525	114525	you	136	” “
114540	114545	114537	114537	you	0	” said Harry slowly . “
114558	114559	114537	114537	you	0	” “
114573	114577	114537	114537	you	0	” said Scrimgeour . “
114659	114683	114635	114636	Dolores Umbridge	186	” Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach : So Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry , was she ? “
114687	114702	114703	114703	you	136	” he said , as though he just wanted to clarify a few points , “
114718	114719	114703	114703	you	136	” “
114735	114749	114733	114733	Harry	136	” said Scrimgeour , sounding relieved that Harry had cottoned on so quickly . “
114775	114776	114703	114703	you	136	” “
114789	114801	114779	114779	I	0	” said Harry , still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly , “
114818	114819	114808	114808	I	0	” “
114822	114829	114808	114808	I	0	” said Scrimgeour , frowning slightly , “
114842	114843	114808	114808	I	0	” “
114854	114859	114846	114846	I	0	” said Harry pleasantly . “
114884	114898	114899	114899	I	0	” Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hardened instantly . “
114907	114929	114960	114960	he	138	” he said , and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been . “
114949	114950	114943	114943	You	136	” “
114971	114975	114960	114960	he	138	” said Harry . “
114993	115014	115015	115015	I	0	” They looked at each other , long and hard . Finally Scrimgeour said , with no pretense at warmth , “
115034	115035	115036	115036	I	0	” “
115044	115048	115036	115036	I	0	” said Harry . “
115063	115064	115049	115049	Some	875	” “
115090	115099	115100	115100	You	136	” said Harry , his temper rising now . “
115167	115168	115159	115161	the Chosen One	862	” “
115179	115183	115170	115170	you	136	” said Scrimgeour . “
115195	115204	115186	115186	you	136	” said Harry , with a bitter laugh . “
115210	115211	115212	115212	I	0	” “
115219	115224	115212	115212	I	0	” said Scrimgeour quickly . “
115229	115230	115212	115212	I	0	” “
115237	115241	115248	115248	you	136	” said Harry . “
115289	115330	115331	115331	I	0	” He raised his right fist . There , shining white on the back of his cold hand , were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh : I must not tell lies . “
115363	115404	115351	115352	The Ministry	4203	” They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet . The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily , leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush . “
115411	115416	115407	115407	Dumbledore	138	” said Scrimgeour brusquely . “
115428	115429	115407	115407	Dumbledore	138	” “
115433	115437	115407	115407	Dumbledore	138	” said Harry . “
115448	115452	115454	115454	you	136	” said Scrimgeour , “
115456	115457	115454	115454	you	136	” “
115464	115468	115460	115460	I	0	” said Harry . “
115488	115489	115490	115490	You	136	” “
115494	115499	115490	115490	You	136	” said Harry indifferently . “
115553	115560	115551	115551	you	136	” There was a long pause . “
115579	115595	115569	115569	he	138	” said Scrimgeour , his eyes cold and hard behind his wire - rimmed glasses . “
115609	115610	115607	115607	Potter	136	” “
115616	115620	115613	115613	I	0	” said Harry . “
115627	115644	115613	115613	I	0	” And turning his back on the Minister of Magic , he strode back toward the house .
115787	115794	115796	115796	Ginny	222	“ Do n’t cry , Mum , ”
115811	115816	115804	115805	Mrs. Weasley	202	“ It ’s okay ... ”
115817	115826	115828	115828	Ron	201	“ Yeah , do n’t worry about us , ”
115843	115864	115828	115828	Ron	201	“ or about Percy . He ’s such a prat , it ’s not really a loss , is it ? ”
115879	115893	115872	115872	she	202	“ Promise me you ’ll look after yourself ... Stay out of trouble ... ”
115894	115902	115904	115904	Harry	136	“ I always do , Mrs. Weasley , ”
115906	115917	115904	115904	Harry	136	“ I like a quiet life , you know me . ”
115927	115937	115918	115918	She	202	“ Be good , then , all of you ... ”
115946	115949	115938	115938	Harry	136	“ Hogwarts ! ”
116033	116049	116018	116018	She	202	“ Evening , Potter . Try not to get too much ash on the carpet . ”
116050	116055	116056	116056	Harry	136	“ No , Professor . ”
116138	116141	116143	116143	Ron	201	“ Baubles , ”
116167	116170	116171	116171	she	2014	“ No , ”
116174	116183	116171	116171	she	2014	“ What d’you mean , ‘ no ’ ? ”
116184	116191	116192	116192	she	2014	“ There is a new password , ”
116195	116202	116192	116192	she	2014	“ And please do n’t shout . ”
116203	116217	116171	116171	she	2014	“ But we ’ve been away , how ’re we supposed to — ? ”
116218	116223	116192	116192	she	2014	“ Harry ! Ginny ! ”
116244	116269	116270	116270	she	180	“ I got back a couple of hours ago , I ’ve just been down to visit Hagrid and Buck — I mean Witherwings , ”
116274	116282	116270	116270	she	180	“ Did you have a good Christmas ? ”
116283	116286	116288	116288	Ron	201	“ Yeah , ”
116292	116299	116288	116288	Ron	201	“ pretty eventful , Rufus Scrim — ”
116300	116310	116312	116312	Hermione	180	“ I ’ve got something for you , Harry , ”
116328	116338	116312	116312	Hermione	180	“ Oh , hang on — password . Abstinence . ”
116339	116342	116344	116346	the Fat Lady	2014	“ Precisely , ”
116361	116368	116370	116370	Harry	136	“ What ’s up with her ? ”
116372	116379	116387	116387	she	180	“ Overindulged over Christmas , apparently , ”
116397	116424	116425	116425	She	180	“ She and her friend Violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monks down by the Charms corridor . Anyway ... ”
116448	116451	116453	116453	Harry	136	“ Great , ”
116474	116491	116453	116453	Harry	136	“ I ’ve got loads to tell him — and you . Let ’s sit down — ”
116502	116507	116509	116510	Lavender Brown	310	“ Won - Won ! ”
116536	116548	116528	116528	Hermione	180	“ There ’s a table over here ... Coming , Ginny ? ”
116549	116561	116563	116563	Ginny	222	“ No , thanks , I said I ’d meet Dean , ”
116601	116608	116592	116592	Harry	136	“ So how was your Christmas ? ”
116609	116614	116615	116615	she	180	“ Oh , fine , ”
116618	116631	116615	116615	she	180	“ Nothing special . How was it at Won - Won ’s ? ”
116632	116641	116643	116643	Harry	136	“ I ’ll tell you in a minute , ”
116645	116655	116643	116643	Harry	136	“ Look , Hermione , ca n’t you — ? ”
116656	116663	116664	116664	she	180	“ No , I ca n’t , ”
116668	116675	116664	116664	she	180	“ So do n’t even ask . ”
116676	116687	116643	116643	Harry	136	“ I thought maybe , you know , over Christmas — ”
116688	116725	116726	116726	She	180	“ It was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of five - hundred - year - old wine , Harry , not me . So what was this important news you wanted to tell me ? ”
116772	116779	116761	116761	Hermione	180	“ Do n’t you think — ? ”
116780	116802	116810	116810	Hermione	180	“ — he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he ’s doing ? ”
116803	116808	116810	116810	Hermione	180	“ Well , yes , ”
116812	116821	116822	116822	Harry	136	“ Ron ’s dad and Lupin think so , ”
116826	116842	116822	116822	Harry	136	“ But this definitely proves Malfoy ’s planning something , you ca n’t deny that . ”
116843	116850	116851	116851	she	180	“ No , I ca n’t , ”
116855	116870	116851	116851	she	180	“ And he ’s acting on Voldemort ’s orders , just like I said ! ”
116871	116884	116885	116885	Harry	136	“ Hmm ... did either of them actually mention Voldemort ’s name ? ”
116892	116913	116885	116885	Harry	136	“ I ’m not sure ... Snape definitely said ‘ your master , ’ and who else would that be ? ”
116914	116920	116925	116925	her	180	“ I do n’t know , ”
116928	116933	116925	116925	her	180	“ Maybe his father ? ”
116952	116957	116948	116948	Lavender	310	“ How ’s Lupin ? ”
116958	116962	116964	116964	Harry	136	“ Not great , ”
116985	116994	116967	116967	he	136	“ Have you heard of this Fenrir Greyback ? ”
116995	117001	117003	117003	Hermione	180	“ Yes , I have ! ”
117008	117016	117003	117003	Hermione	180	“ And so have you , Harry ! ”
117017	117032	116967	116967	he	136	“ When , History of Magic ? You know full well I never listened ... ”
117033	117049	117051	117051	Hermione	180	“ No , no , not History of Magic — Malfoy threatened Borgin with him ! ”
117053	117086	117051	117051	Hermione	180	“ Back in Knockturn Alley , do n’t you remember ? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend and that he ’d be checking up on Borgin ’s progress ! ”
117092	117121	117087	117087	Harry	136	“ I forgot ! But this proves Malfoy ’s a Death Eater , how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling him what to do ? ”
117122	117128	117130	117130	Hermione	180	“ It is pretty suspicious , ”
117132	117135	117130	117130	Hermione	180	“ Unless ... ”
117136	117142	117144	117144	Harry	136	“ Oh , come on , ”
117148	117157	117144	117144	Harry	136	“ you ca n’t get round this one ! ”
117158	117171	117130	117130	Hermione	180	“ Well ... there is the possibility it was an empty threat . ”
117172	117180	117182	117182	Harry	136	“ You ’re unbelievable , you are , ”
117188	117223	117185	117185	his	136	“ We ’ll see who ’s right ... You ’ll be eating your words , Hermione , just like the Ministry . Oh yeah , I had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour as well ... ”
117414	117422	117405	117405	her	180	“ Guess who , Won - Won ? ”
117488	117493	117495	117495	Ron	201	“ So — Apparition , ”
117514	117522	117497	117497	his	201	“ Should be a laugh , eh ? ”
117523	117527	117529	117529	Harry	136	“ I dunno , ”
117531	117557	117529	117529	Harry	136	“ Maybe it ’s better when you do it yourself , I did n’t enjoy it much when Dumbledore took me along for the ride . ”
117558	117576	117578	117578	Ron	201	“ I forgot you ’d already done it ... I ’d better pass my test first time , ”
117583	117589	117578	117578	Ron	201	“ Fred and George did . ”
117590	117600	117529	117529	Harry	136	“ Charlie failed , though , did n’t he ? ”
117601	117610	117612	117612	Ron	201	“ Yeah , but Charlie ’s bigger than me ”
117627	117646	117612	117612	Ron	201	“ so Fred and George did n’t go on about it much ... not to his face anyway ... ”
117647	117656	117529	117529	Harry	136	“ When can we take the actual test ? ”
117657	117671	117612	117612	Ron	201	“ Soon as we ’re seventeen . That ’s only March for me ! ”
117672	117691	117612	117612	Ron	201	“ Yeah , but you would n’t be able to Apparate in here , not in the castle ... ”
117692	117710	117529	117529	Harry	136	“ Not the point , is it ? Everyone would know I could Apparate if I wanted . ”
117755	117766	117767	117767	Seamus	299	“ How cool will it be when we can just — ”
117775	117803	117767	117767	Seamus	299	“ Me cousin Fergus does it just to annoy me , you wait till I can do it back ... He ’ll never have another peaceful moment ... ”
117861	117867	117868	117868	Ron	201	“ Harry ’s already Apparated , ”
117893	117906	117886	117886	his	433	“ I am a wizard , not a baboon brandishing a stick . ”
117907	117925	117886	117886	his	433	“ Dum — er — someone took him . Side - Along - Apparition , you know . ”
117926	117929	117931	117931	Seamus	299	“ Whoa ! ”
118165	118178	118162	118162	Dumbledore	138	“ I hear that you met the Minister of Magic over Christmas ? ”
118179	118182	118184	118184	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
118186	118195	118184	118184	Harry	136	“ He ’s not very happy with me . ”
118196	118199	118201	118201	Dumbledore	138	“ No , ”
118203	118229	118230	118230	Harry	136	“ He is not very happy with me either . We must try not to sink beneath our anguish , Harry , but battle on . ”
118233	118251	118230	118230	Harry	136	“ He wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that the Ministry ’s doing a wonderful job . ”
118255	118300	118252	118252	Dumbledore	138	“ It was Fudge ’s idea originally , you know . During his last days in office , when he was trying desperately to cling to his post , he sought a meeting with you , hoping that you would give him your support — ”
118301	118309	118311	118311	Harry	136	“ After everything Fudge did last year ? ”
118314	118318	118311	118311	Harry	136	“ After Umbridge ? ”
118319	118360	118252	118252	Dumbledore	138	“ I told Cornelius there was no chance of it , but the idea did not die when he left office . Within hours of Scrimgeour ’s appointment we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you — ”
118361	118369	118370	118370	Harry	136	“ So that ’s why you argued ! ”
118374	118382	118370	118370	Harry	136	“ It was in the Daily Prophet . ”
118383	118394	118396	118396	Dumbledore	138	“ The Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally , ”
118398	118426	118396	118396	Dumbledore	138	“ if only accidentally . Yes , that was why we argued . Well , it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last . ”
118427	118442	118370	118370	Harry	136	“ He accused me of being ‘ Dumbledore ’s man through and through . ’ ”
118443	118450	118497	118497	Dumbledore	138	“ How very rude of him . ”
118451	118458	118459	118459	Dumbledore	138	“ I told him I was . ”
118526	118534	118520	118520	his	138	“ I am very touched , Harry . ”
118535	118550	118552	118552	Harry	136	“ Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you ’re not at Hogwarts , ”
118561	118571	118573	118573	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , he is very nosy about that , ”
118589	118634	118573	118573	Dumbledore	138	“ He has even attempted to have me followed . Amusing , really . He set Dawlish to tail me . It was n’t kind . I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once ; I did it again with the greatest regret . ”
118635	118646	118648	118648	Harry	136	“ So they still do n’t know where you go ? ”
118673	118708	118660	118660	Dumbledore	138	“ No , they do n’t , and the time is not quite right for you to know either . Now , I suggest we press on , unless there ’s anything else — ? ”
118709	118717	118719	118719	Harry	136	“ There is , actually , sir , ”
118721	118729	118719	118719	Harry	136	“ It ’s about Malfoy and Snape . ”
118730	118736	118660	118660	Dumbledore	138	“ Professor Snape , Harry . ”
118737	118759	118760	118760	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , sir . I overheard them during Professor Slughorn ’s party ... well , I followed them , actually ... ”
118787	118820	118775	118775	he	136	“ Thank you for telling me this , Harry , but I suggest that you put it out of your mind . I do not think that it is of great importance . ”
118821	118827	118829	118829	Harry	136	“ Not of great importance ? ”
118832	118840	118829	118829	Harry	136	“ Professor , did you understand — ? ”
118841	118861	118863	118863	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , Harry , blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower , I understood everything you told me , ”
118869	118915	118863	118863	Dumbledore	138	“ I think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did . Again , I am glad that you have confided in me , but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet . ”
118981	118986	118988	118988	Harry	136	“ So , sir , ”
119001	119008	118988	118988	Harry	136	“ you definitely still trust — ? ”
119009	119021	119023	119023	Dumbledore	138	“ I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already , ”
119034	119041	119026	119026	he	138	“ My answer has not changed . ”
119042	119048	119066	119066	him	374	“ I should think not , ”
119068	119094	119064	119064	Dumbledore	138	“ And now , Harry , I must insist that we press on . I have more important things to discuss with you this evening . ”
119139	119179	119136	119136	his	138	“ Ah , Harry , how often this happens , even between the best of friends ! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute ! ”
119180	119196	119198	119198	Harry	136	“ I do n’t think what you ’ve got to say is unimportant , sir , ”
119201	119214	119216	119216	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , you are quite right , because it is not , ”
119219	119254	119216	119216	Dumbledore	138	“ I have two more memories to show you this evening , both obtained with enormous difficulty , and the second of them is , I think , the most important I have collected . ”
119288	119291	119293	119293	Dumbledore	138	“ So , ”
119300	119373	119293	119293	Dumbledore	138	“ we meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle , whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts . You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard , that he refused my company on a trip to Diagon Alley , and that I , in turn , warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school . “
119427	119451	119410	119410	He	345	” continued Dumbledore , waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat , ancient and unmoving . “
119494	119582	119410	119410	He	345	“ However , if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with displays of Parseltongue in their common room , no hint of it reached the staff . He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all . As an unusually talented and very good - looking orphan , he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival . He seemed polite , quiet , and thirsty for knowledge . Nearly all were most favorably impressed by him . ”
119583	119605	119607	119607	Harry	136	“ Did n’t you tell them , sir , what he ’d been like when you met him at the orphanage ? ”
119609	119656	119657	119657	Dumbledore	138	“ No , I did not . Though he had shown no hint of remorse , it was possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf . I chose to give him that chance . ”
119702	119746	119766	119766	Dumbledore	138	“ But you did n’t really trust him , sir , did you ? He told me ... the Riddle who came out of that diary said , ‘ Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did . ’ ”
119747	119764	119766	119766	Dumbledore	138	“ Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy , ”
119768	119895	119766	119766	Dumbledore	138	“ I had , as I have already indicated , resolved to keep a close eye upon him , and so I did . I can not pretend that I gleaned a great deal from my observations at first . He was very guarded with me ; he felt , I am sure , that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much . He was careful never to reveal as much again , but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excitement , nor what Mrs. Cole had confided in me . However , he had the sense never to try and charm me as he charmed so many of my colleagues . “
120019	120094	120095	120095	I	0	“ Rigidly controlled by Riddle , they were never detected in open wrongdoing , although their seven years at Hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfactorily linked , the most serious of which was , of course , the opening of the Chamber of Secrets , which resulted in the death of a girl . As you know , Hagrid was wrongly accused of that crime . “
120109	120121	120105	120105	Riddle	345	” said Dumbledore , placing his withered hand on the Pensieve . “
120180	120341	120343	120343	he	2605	“ Those whom I could persuade to talk told me that Riddle was obsessed with his parentage . This is understandable , of course ; he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there . It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room , on the lists of prefects in the old school records , even in the books of Wizarding history . Finally he was forced to accept that his father had never set foot in Hogwarts . I believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever , assumed the identity of Lord Voldemort , and began his investigations into his previously despised mother ’s family — the woman whom , you will remember , he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death . “
120432	120455	120456	120456	I	0	” Dumbledore rose , and Harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal bottle filled with swirling , pearly memory . “
120464	120478	120456	120456	I	0	” he said , as he poured the gleaming mass into the Pensieve . “
120492	120768	120769	120769	YOU	2614	” Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory ; he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness . It took him several seconds to recognize the place , by which time Dumbledore had landed beside him . The Gaunts ’ house was now more indescribably filthy than anywhere Harry had ever seen . The ceiling was thick with cobwebs , the floor coated in grime ; moldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots . The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown Harry could see neither eyes nor mouth . He was slumped in an armchair by the fire , and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead . But then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake , raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left . The door creaked open . There on the threshold , holding an old - fashioned lamp , stood a boy Harry recognized at once : tall , pale , dark - haired , and handsome — the teenage Voldemort . Voldemort ’s eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair . For a few seconds they looked at each other , then the man staggered upright , the many empty bottles at his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor . “
120771	120775	120776	120776	YOU	2614	” he bellowed . “
120778	120792	120776	120776	YOU	2614	” And he hurtled drunkenly at Riddle , wand and knife held aloft . “
120795	120837	120838	120838	You	2614	” Riddle spoke in Parseltongue . The man skidded into the table , sending moldy pots crashing to the floor . He stared at Riddle . There was a long silence while they contemplated each other . The man broke it . “
120842	120843	120838	120838	You	2614	” “
120850	120898	120846	120846	I	0	” said Riddle . He moved forward into the room , allowing the door to swing shut behind him . Harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for Voldemort ’s complete lack of fear . His face merely expressed disgust and , perhaps , disappointment . “
120903	120907	120901	120901	Marvolo	345	” he asked . “
120910	120915	120901	120901	Marvolo	345	” said the other . “
120924	120928	120922	120922	he	345	” Riddle frowned . “
120935	120936	120931	120931	you	2614	” “
120945	120946	120943	120943	I	0	” “
120951	120952	120922	120922	he	345	” “
120960	120994	120995	120995	I	0	” Morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face , the better to see Riddle , and Harry saw that he wore Marvolo ’s black - stoned ring on his right hand . “
121002	121006	120999	121000	that Muggle	2616	” whispered Morfin . “
121014	121015	121011	121012	that Muggle	2616	” “
121019	121024	121017	121017	Muggle	192	” said Riddle sharply . “
121047	121061	121035	121036	that Muggle	2616	” said Morfin , and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor between them . “
121091	121111	121112	121112	He	2616	” Morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little , still clutching the edge of the table for support . “
121118	121143	121112	121112	He	2616	” he added stupidly . Voldemort was gazing at Morfin as though appraising his possibilities . Now he moved a little closer and said , “
121148	121149	121150	121150	Ar	434	” “
121164	121174	121152	121152	he	2616	” said Morfin , spitting on the floor again . “
121198	121220	121194	121194	Slytherin	389	” Voldemort did not answer . Morfin was working himself into a rage again ; he brandished his knife and shouted , “
121255	121328	121251	121251	It	2626	” He looked away , staggering slightly , and Voldemort moved forward . As he did so , an unnatural darkness fell , extinguishing Voldemort ’s lamp and Morfin ’s candle , extinguishing everything ... Dumbledore ’s fingers closed tightly around Harry ’s arm and they were soaring back into the present again . The soft golden light in Dumbledore ’s office seemed to dazzle Harry ’s eyes after that impenetrable darkness . “
121333	121339	121251	121251	It	2626	” said Harry at once . “
121349	121350	121251	121251	It	2626	” “
121362	121373	121352	121352	Morfin	192	” said Dumbledore , gesturing Harry back into his seat . “
121396	121440	121390	121390	Marvolo	345	“ Meanwhile , in the village of Little Hangleton , a maid was running along the High Street , screaming that there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of the big house : Tom Riddle Senior and his mother and father . “
121486	121498	121480	121481	The exception	1395	” Dumbledore added , with a nod to Harry ’s scar . “
121554	121745	121522	121526	a convicted Muggle - hater	2630	“ So the Ministry called upon Morfin . They did not need to question him , to use Veritaserum or Legilimency . He admitted to the murder on the spot , giving details only the murderer could know . He was proud , he said , to have killed the Muggles , had been awaiting his chance all these years . He handed over his wand , which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles . And he permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight . All that disturbed him was the fact that his father ’s ring had disappeared . ‘ He ’ll kill me for losing it , ’ he told his captors over and over again . ‘ He ’ll kill me for losing his ring . ’ And that , apparently , was all he ever said again . He lived out the remainder of his life in Azkaban , lamenting the loss of Marvolo ’s last heirloom , and is buried beside the prison , alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls . ”
121746	121757	121759	121759	Harry	136	“ So Voldemort stole Morfin ’s wand and used it ? ”
121765	121770	121772	121772	Dumbledore	138	“ That ’s right , ”
121774	121907	121772	121772	Dumbledore	138	“ We have no memories to show us this , but I think we can be fairly sure what happened . Voldemort Stupefied his uncle , took his wand , and proceeded across the valley to ‘ the big house over the way . ’ There he murdered the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother , and , for good measure , his Muggle grandparents , thus obliterating the last of the unworthy Riddle line and revenging himself upon the father who never wanted him . Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel , performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle ’s mind , laid Morfin ’s wand beside its unconscious owner , pocketed the ancient ring he wore , and departed . ”
121908	121919	121522	121526	a convicted Muggle - hater	2630	“ And Morfin never realized he had n’t done it ? ”
121920	121923	121925	121925	Dumbledore	138	“ Never , ”
121927	121941	121925	121925	Dumbledore	138	“ He gave , as I say , a full and boastful confession . ”
121942	121955	121522	121526	a convicted Muggle - hater	2630	“ But he had this real memory in him all the time ! ”
121956	121975	121977	121977	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him , ”
121979	122076	121977	121977	Dumbledore	138	“ and why should anybody delve further into Morfin ’s mind when he had already confessed to the crime ? However , I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life , by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I could about Voldemort ’s past . I extracted this memory with difficulty . When I saw what it contained , I attempted to use it to secure Morfin ’s release from Azkaban . Before the Ministry reached their decision , however , Morfin had died . ”
122077	122095	122096	122096	Harry	136	“ But how come the Ministry did n’t realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin ? ”
122100	122120	122096	122096	Harry	136	“ He was underage at the time , was n’t he ? I thought they could detect underage magic ! ”
122121	122160	121977	121977	Dumbledore	138	“ You are quite right — they can detect magic , but not the perpetrator : You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was , in fact , cast by — ”
122161	122164	122166	122166	Harry	136	“ Dobby , ”
122173	122198	121977	121977	Dumbledore	138	“ So if you ’re underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard ’s house , the Ministry wo n’t know ? ”
122199	122212	122214	122214	Dumbledore	138	“ They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic , ”
122229	122248	122214	122214	Dumbledore	138	“ They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring ’s obedience while within their walls . ”
122249	122256	122258	122258	Harry	136	“ Well , that ’s rubbish , ”
122260	122272	122258	122258	Harry	136	“ Look what happened here , look what happened to Morfin ! ”
122273	122277	122279	122279	Dumbledore	138	“ I agree , ”
122281	122323	122279	122279	Dumbledore	138	“ Whatever Morfin was , he did not deserve to die as he did , blamed for murders he had not committed . But it is getting late , and I want you to see this other memory before we part ... ”
122380	122387	122392	122392	he	138	“ This will not take long , ”
122399	122417	122392	122392	he	138	“ We shall be back before you know it . Once more into the Pensieve , then ... ”
122691	122703	122704	122704	he	136	“ Sir , is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring ? ”
122707	122721	122723	122723	Slughorn	184	“ Tom , Tom , if I knew I could n’t tell you , ”
122744	122772	122773	122773	Riddle	345	“ I must say , I ’d like to know where you get your information , boy , more knowledgeable than half the staff , you are . ”
122786	122829	122776	122778	the other boys	2641	“ What with your uncanny ability to know things you should n’t , and your careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for the pineapple , by the way , you ’re quite right , it is my favorite — ”
122885	122897	122873	122873	Slughorn	184	“ You ’ll go wrong , boy , mark my words . ”
122947	122957	122959	122959	Slughorn	184	“ Good gracious , is it that time already ? ”
122961	122998	122959	122959	Slughorn	184	“ You ’d better get going , boys , or we ’ll all be in trouble . Lestrange , I want your essay by tomorrow or it ’s detention . Same goes for you , Avery . ”
123046	123052	123054	123054	Slughorn	184	“ Look sharp , Tom , ”
123064	123084	123054	123054	Slughorn	184	“ You do n’t want to be caught out of bed out of hours , and you a prefect ... ”
123085	123095	123031	123031	he	136	“ Sir , I wanted to ask you something . ”
123096	123107	123054	123054	Slughorn	184	“ Ask away , then , m’boy , ask away ... ”
123108	123121	123054	123054	Slughorn	184	“ Sir , I wondered what you know about ... about Horcruxes ? ”
123170	123206	123156	123156	Slughorn	184	“ I do n’t know anything about Horcruxes and I would n’t tell you if I did ! Now get out of here at once and do n’t let me catch you mentioning them again ! ”
123207	123214	123216	123216	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , that ’s that , ”
123221	123226	123216	123216	Dumbledore	138	“ Time to go . ”
123251	123258	123260	123260	Harry	136	“ That ’s all there is ? ”
123329	123336	123338	123338	Dumbledore	138	“ As you might have noticed , ”
123346	123354	123338	123338	Dumbledore	138	“ that memory has been tampered with . ”
123355	123359	123361	123361	Harry	136	“ Tampered with ? ”
123368	123371	123373	123373	Dumbledore	138	“ Certainly , ”
123375	123385	123373	123373	Dumbledore	138	“ Professor Slughorn has meddled with his own recollections . ”
123386	123394	123338	123338	Dumbledore	138	“ But why would he do that ? ”
123395	123409	123411	123411	Dumbledore	138	“ Because , I think , he is ashamed of what he remembers , ”
123413	123476	123411	123411	Dumbledore	138	“ He has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light , obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see . It is , as you will have noticed , very crudely done , and that is all to the good , for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations . “
123521	123527	123500	123501	Professor Slughorn	200	” Harry stared at him . “
123533	123545	123546	123546	you	4356	” he said , keeping his voice as respectful as possible , “
123560	123561	123562	123563	Professor Slughorn	200	” “
123575	123579	123562	123563	Professor Slughorn	200	” said Dumbledore . “
123622	123728	123610	123610	I	0	“ No , I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from Professor Slughorn by force , and might do much more harm than good ; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts . However , he has his weaknesses like the rest of us , and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses . It is most important that we secure the true memory , Harry ... How important , we will only know when we have seen the real thing . So , good luck ... and good night . ”
123745	123751	123738	123738	Harry	136	“ Good night , sir . ”
123768	123788	123764	123765	Phineas Nigellus	374	“ I ca n’t see why the boy should be able to do it better than you , Dumbledore . ”
123789	123799	123801	123801	Dumbledore	138	“ I would n’t expect you to , Phineas , ”
123869	123874	123875	123875	he	201	“ He loves you , ”
123888	123915	123875	123875	he	201	“ Wo n’t refuse you anything , will he ? Not his little Potions Prince . Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him . ”
123925	123945	123946	123946	she	180	“ He must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore could n’t get it out of him , ”
123965	123978	123946	123946	she	180	“ Horcruxes ... Horcruxes ... I ’ve never even heard of them ... ”
123979	123984	123985	123985	Harry	136	“ You have n’t ? ”
124009	124062	123993	123993	Hermione	180	“ They must be really advanced Dark Magic , or why would Voldemort have wanted to know about them ? I think it ’s going to be difficult to get the information , Harry , you ’ll have to be very careful about how you approach Slughorn , think out a strategy ... ”
124063	124076	123946	123946	she	180	“ Ron reckons I should just hang back after Potions this afternoon ... ”
124077	124095	124096	124096	she	180	“ Oh , well , if Won - Won thinks that , you ’d better do it , ”
124104	124119	124096	124096	she	180	“ After all , when has Won - Won ’s judgment ever been faulty ? ”
124120	124128	123946	123946	she	180	“ Hermione , ca n’t you — ? ”
124129	124132	124133	124133	she	180	“ No ! ”
124197	124203	124204	124204	Ron	201	“ What ’ve you done ? ”
124234	124275	124222	124222	Slughorn	200	“ Settle down , settle down , please ! Quickly , now , lots of work to get through this afternoon ! Golpalott ’s Third Law ... who can tell me — ? But Miss Granger can , of course ! ”
124282	124339	124222	124222	Slughorn	200	“ Golpalott’s - Third - Law - states - that - the - antidote - for - a - blended - poison - will - be - equal - to - more - than - the - sum - of - the - antidotes - for - each - of - the - separate - components . ”
124340	124343	124345	124345	Slughorn	200	“ Precisely ! ”
124347	124365	124345	124345	Slughorn	200	“ Ten points for Gryffindor ! Now , if we accept Golpalott ’s Third Law as true ... ”
124409	124476	124477	124477	Ron	201	“ . . . which means , of course , that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion ’s ingredients by Scarpin ’s Revelaspell , our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in and of themselves , but to find that added component that will , by an almost alchemical process , transform these disparate elements — ”
124527	124534	124536	124536	Slughorn	200	“ . . . and so , ”
124538	124585	124536	124536	Slughorn	200	“ I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk . You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson . Good luck , and do n’t forget your protective gloves ! ”
124647	124668	124669	124669	she	180	“ It ’s a shame that the Prince wo n’t be able to help you much with this , Harry , ”
124677	124693	124669	124669	she	180	“ You have to understand the principles involved this time . No shortcuts or cheats ! ”
124766	124777	124778	124778	Ron	201	“ You sure the Prince has n’t got any tips ? ”
124850	124853	124855	124855	Harry	136	“ Nothing , ”
124908	124912	124900	124901	Ernie Macmillan	320	“ Specialis Revelio ! ”
125123	125141	125112	125112	Snape	205	“ A stone taken from the stomach of a goat , which will protect from most poisons . ”
125228	125235	125225	125225	Slughorn	200	“ Two minutes left , everyone ! ”
125275	125281	125283	125283	Slughorn	200	“ Time ’s ... UP ! ”
125286	125306	125283	125283	Slughorn	200	“ Well , let ’s see how you ’ve done ! Blaise ... what have you got for me ? ”
125418	125424	125425	125425	he	200	“ And you , Harry , ”
125428	125437	125425	125425	he	200	“ What have you got to show me ? ”
125489	125497	125498	125498	he	200	“ You ’ve got nerve , boy ! ”
125516	125546	125498	125498	he	200	“ Oh , you ’re like your mother ... Well , I ca n’t fault you ... A bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions ! ”
125597	125613	125614	125614	she	180	“ And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself , did you , Harry ? ”
125620	125633	125635	125635	Slughorn	200	“ That ’s the individual spirit a real potion - maker needs ! ”
125643	125716	125635	125635	Slughorn	200	“ Just like his mother , she had the same intuitive grasp of potion - making , it ’s undoubtedly from Lily he gets it ... Yes , Harry , yes , if you ’ve got a bezoar to hand , of course that would do the trick ... although as they do n’t work on everything , and are pretty rare , it ’s still worth knowing how to mix antidotes ... ”
125778	125784	125786	125786	Slughorn	200	“ Time to pack up ! ”
125788	125800	125804	125804	he	159	“ And an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek ! ”
125863	125880	125882	125882	Slughorn	200	“ Come on , now , Harry , you ’ll be late for your next lesson , ”
125897	125900	125902	125902	Harry	136	“ Sir , ”
125910	125918	125902	125902	Harry	136	“ I wanted to ask you something . ”
125919	125932	125947	125947	Slughorn	200	“ Ask away , then , my dear boy , ask away ... ”
125933	125946	125947	125947	Slughorn	200	“ Sir , I wondered what you know about ... about Horcruxes ? ”
125968	125974	125960	125960	He	200	“ What did you say ? ”
125975	125990	125962	125962	his	200	“ I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes , sir . You see — ”
125991	125999	126001	126001	Slughorn	200	“ Dumbledore put you up to this , ”
126037	126053	126020	126020	He	200	“ Dumbledore ’s shown you that — that memory . Well ? Has n’t he ? ”
126054	126057	126059	126059	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
126073	126079	126081	126081	Slughorn	200	“ Yes , of course , ”
126091	126117	126119	126119	he	200	“ Of course ... well , if you ’ve seen that memory , Harry , you ’ll know that I do n’t know anything — anything ”
126125	126129	126119	126119	he	200	“ about Horcruxes . ”
126153	126156	126158	126158	Harry	136	“ Sir , ”
126161	126175	126158	126158	Harry	136	“ I just thought there might be a bit more to the memory — ”
126176	126180	126182	126182	Slughorn	200	“ Did you ? ”
126184	126196	126197	126197	He	200	“ Then you were wrong , were n’t you ? WRONG ! ”
126264	126278	126280	126280	Harry	136	“ It would ’ve just looked stupid if we ’d both done it ! ”
126283	126314	126315	126315	he	136	“ Look , I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort , did n’t I ? Oh , will you get a grip ! ”
126561	126574	126575	126575	she	180	“ I have n’t found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do ! ”
126579	126659	126660	126660	she	180	“ Not a single one ! I ’ve been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books , where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions — nothing ! All I could find was this , in the introduction to Magick Moste Evile — listen — ‘ Of the Horcrux , wickedest of magical inventions , we shall not speak nor give direction ... ’ I mean , why mention it then ? ”
126677	126683	126684	126684	she	180	“ Oh , shut up , ”
126909	126913	126915	126917	the Ministry wizard	2701	“ Good morning , ”
126935	126971	126915	126917	the Ministry wizard	2701	“ My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry Apparition instructor for the next twelve weeks . I hope to be able to prepare you for your Apparition Tests in this time — ”
126972	126981	126983	126984	Professor McGonagall	237	“ Malfoy , be quiet and pay attention ! ”
127055	127072	127073	127073	Twycross	448	“ — by which time , many of you may be ready to take your tests , ”
127084	127153	127073	127073	Twycross	448	“ As you may know , it is usually impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts . The headmaster has lifted this enchantment , purely within the Great Hall , for one hour , so as to enable you to practice . May I emphasize that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall , and that you would be unwise to try . “
127179	127222	127223	127223	Harry	136	” There was a great scrambling and jostling as people separated , banged into each other , and ordered others out of their space . The Heads of Houses moved among the students , marshaling them into position and breaking up arguments . “
127230	127334	127223	127223	Harry	136	” demanded Hermione . But Harry did not answer ; he was moving quickly through the crowd , past the place where Professor Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few Ravenclaws , all of whom wanted to be near the front , past Professor Sprout , who was chivying the Hufflepuffs into line , until , by dodging around Ernie Macmillan , he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd , directly behind Malfoy , who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with Crabbe , standing five feet away and looking mutinous . “
127346	127360	127398	127398	your	2708	” Malfoy shot at him , oblivious to Harry standing right behind him . “
127371	127391	127398	127398	your	2708	” Crabbe opened his mouth , but Malfoy appeared to second - guess what he was going to say . “
127421	127422	127423	127423	I	0	” “
127444	127483	127423	127423	I	0	” Harry said , just loud enough for Malfoy to hear him . Malfoy spun around on the spot , his hand flying to his wand , but at that precise moment the four Heads of House shouted , “
127486	127501	127423	127423	I	0	” and silence fell again . Malfoy turned slowly to face the front again . “
127505	127509	127423	127423	I	0	” said Twycross . “
127513	127535	127575	127575	Twycross	448	” He waved his wand . Old - fashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in front of every student . “
127549	127553	127575	127575	Twycross	448	” said Twycross . “
127560	127573	127575	127575	Twycross	448	“ Step one : Fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination , ”
127577	127595	127596	127596	Everybody	1074	“ In this case , the interior of your hoop . Kindly concentrate upon that destination now . ”
127660	127664	127666	127666	Twycross	448	“ Step two , ”
127668	127695	127666	127666	Twycross	448	“ focus your determination to occupy the visualized space ! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body ! ”
127753	127757	127759	127759	Twycross	448	“ Step three , ”
127761	127793	127759	127759	Twycross	448	“ and only when I give the command ... Turn on the spot , feeling your way into nothingness , moving with deliberation ! On my command , now ... one — ”
127814	127818	127819	127819	Harry	136	“ — two — ”
127842	127846	127847	127847	Harry	136	“ — THREE ! ”
127921	127928	127930	127930	Twycross	448	“ Never mind , never mind , ”
127943	127957	127930	127930	Twycross	448	“ Adjust your hoops , please , and back to your original positions ... ”
128057	128068	128070	128071	Wilkie Twycross	448	“ Splinching , or the separation of random body parts , ”
128074	128103	128070	128071	Wilkie Twycross	448	“ occurs when the mind is insufficiently determined . You must concentrate continuously upon your destination , and move , without haste , but with deliberation ... thus . ”
128134	128141	128142	128142	he	448	“ Remember the three D ’s , ”
128145	128156	128142	128142	he	448	“ and try again ... one — two — three — ”
128192	128210	128188	128188	he	448	“ Until next Saturday , everybody , and do not forget : Destination . Determination . Deliberation . ”
128248	128254	128256	128256	Ron	201	“ How did you do ? ”
128262	128282	128256	128256	Ron	201	“ I think I felt something the last time I tried — a kind of tingling in my feet . ”
128283	128296	128304	128304	Hermione	180	“ I expect your trainers are too small , Won - Won , ”
128310	128317	128319	128319	Harry	136	“ I did n’t feel anything , ”
128325	128335	128319	128319	Harry	136	“ But I do n’t care about that now — ”
128336	128355	128357	128357	Ron	201	“ What d’you mean , you do n’t care ? Do n’t you want to learn to Apparate ? ”
128360	128372	128374	128374	Harry	136	“ I ’m not fussed , really , I prefer flying , ”
128397	128414	128417	128417	Ron	201	“ Look , hurry up , will you , there ’s something I want to do ... ”
128489	128503	128505	128505	Ron	201	“ Are you going to tell me what we ’re doing , then ? ”
128510	128514	128516	128516	Harry	136	“ Up here , ”
128565	128568	128561	128561	Ron	201	“ Harry ... ”
128569	128594	128595	128595	He	136	“ Malfoy ’s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts . He was arguing with Crabbe just now . I want to know — aha . ”
128622	128639	128609	128609	he	136	“ I solemnly swear that I am up to no good ... or Malfoy is anyway . ”
128688	128694	128696	128696	Harry	136	“ Help me find Malfoy , ”
128717	128720	128722	128722	Ron	201	“ There ! ”
128730	128750	128722	128722	Ron	201	“ He ’s in the Slytherin common room , look ... with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle ... ”
128766	128780	128781	128781	he	136	“ Well , I ’m keeping an eye on him from now on , ”
128785	128820	128821	128821	He	136	“ And the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside , it ’ll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what he ’s — ”
129110	129117	129118	129118	he	201	“ It was on my birthday ! ”
129121	129129	129118	129118	he	201	“ I was looking forward to that ! ”
129130	129141	129143	129143	Harry	136	“ Not a big surprise , though , is it ? ”
129145	129153	129143	129143	Harry	136	“ Not after what happened to Katie . ”
129186	129201	129203	129203	Ron	201	“ But now all I ’ve got to look forward to is stupid Apparition ! ”
129206	129211	129203	129203	Ron	201	“ Big birthday treat ... ”
129277	129283	129285	129285	Harry	136	“ Happy birthday , Ron , ”
129305	129310	129311	129311	He	136	“ Have a present . ”
129346	129349	129351	129351	Ron	201	“ Cheers , ”
129426	129429	129430	129430	he	136	“ Right , ”
129447	129459	129430	129430	he	136	“ I solemnly swear that I am up to no good , ”
129480	129486	129488	129488	Ron	201	“ Nice one , Harry ! ”
129505	129509	129511	129511	Harry	136	“ No problem , ”
129524	129537	129538	129538	Ron	201	“ Hey ... I do n’t think he ’s in his bed ... ”
129561	129568	129569	129569	he	136	“ Seriously good haul this year ! ”
129592	129614	129569	129569	he	136	“ See what Mum and Dad got me ? Blimey , I think I ’ll come of age next year too ... ”
129615	129618	129620	129620	Harry	136	“ Cool , ”
129684	129688	129690	129690	Ron	201	“ Want one ? ”
129701	129705	129707	129707	Harry	136	“ No thanks , ”
129712	129718	129707	129707	Harry	136	“ Malfoy ’s gone again ! ”
129719	129725	129727	129727	Ron	201	“ Ca n’t have done , ”
129746	129775	129776	129776	Ron	201	“ Come on , if you do n’t hurry up , you ’ll have to Apparate on an empty stomach ... Might make it easier , I suppose ... ”
129805	129809	129795	129795	Harry	136	“ Mischief managed , ”
129898	129901	129902	129902	he	136	“ Ready ? ”
129947	129952	129944	129944	his	201	“ Ron ? Breakfast . ”
129953	129959	129960	129960	Harry	136	“ I ’m not hungry . ”
129965	129973	129960	129960	Harry	136	“ I thought you just said — ? ”
129974	129987	129989	129989	Ron	201	“ Well , all right , I ’ll come down with you , ”
129991	130000	129989	129989	Ron	201	“ but I do n’t want to eat . ”
130006	130022	130001	130001	Harry	136	“ You ’ve just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons , have n’t you ? ”
130023	130029	130030	130030	Ron	201	“ It ’s not that , ”
130034	130042	130030	130030	Ron	201	“ You ... you would n’t understand . ”
130043	130047	130049	130049	Harry	136	“ Fair enough , ”
130062	130065	130067	130067	Ron	201	“ Harry ! ”
130070	130073	130067	130067	Ron	201	“ What ? ”
130074	130083	130030	130030	Ron	201	“ Harry , I ca n’t stand it ! ”
130084	130091	130093	130093	Harry	136	“ You ca n’t stand what ? ”
130117	130126	130128	130128	Ron	201	“ I ca n’t stop thinking about her ! ”
130162	130167	130158	130158	Ron	201	“ Lav - Lav , ”
130177	130186	130187	130187	Harry	136	“ Why does that stop you having breakfast ? ”
130202	130212	130214	130214	Ron	201	“ I do n’t think she knows I exist , ”
130220	130227	130229	130229	Harry	136	“ She definitely knows you exist , ”
130233	130243	130229	130229	Harry	136	“ She keeps snogging you , does n’t she ? ”
130247	130254	130244	130244	Ron	201	“ Who are you talking about ? ”
130255	130262	130264	130264	Harry	136	“ Who are you talking about ? ”
130280	130284	130286	130286	Ron	201	“ Romilda Vane , ”
130326	130338	130323	130323	Harry	136	“ This is a joke , right ? You ’re joking . ”
130339	130351	130353	130353	Ron	201	“ I think ... Harry , I think I love her , ”
130359	130362	130364	130364	Harry	136	“ Okay , ”
130384	130395	130364	130364	Harry	136	“ okay ... Say that again with a straight face . ”
130396	130401	130403	130403	Ron	201	“ I love her , ”
130406	130434	130403	130403	Ron	201	“ Have you seen her hair , it ’s all black and shiny and silky ... and her eyes ? Her big dark eyes ? And her — ”
130435	130443	130445	130445	Harry	136	“ This is really funny and everything , ”
130448	130460	130445	130445	Harry	136	“ but joke ’s over , all right ? Drop it . ”
130560	130566	130567	130567	Harry	136	“ What was that for ? ”
130570	130584	130586	130586	Ron	201	“ You insulted her , Harry ! You said it was a joke ! ”
130605	130610	130612	130612	Harry	136	“ This is insane ! ”
130614	130621	130612	130612	Harry	136	“ What ’s got into — ? ”
130648	130657	130612	130612	Harry	136	“ Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons ? ”
130658	130665	130667	130667	Ron	201	“ They were a birthday present ! ”
130680	130690	130667	130667	Ron	201	“ I offered you one , did n’t I ? ”
130691	130705	130612	130612	Harry	136	“ You just picked them up off the floor , did n’t you ? ”
130706	130721	130612	130612	Harry	136	“ They ’d fallen off my bed , all right ? Let me go ! ”
130722	130778	130667	130667	Ron	201	“ They did n’t fall off your bed , you prat , do n’t you understand ? They were mine , I chucked them out of my trunk when I was looking for the map , they ’re the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas , and they ’re all spiked with love potion ! ”
130792	130795	130796	130796	he	201	“ Romilda ? ”
130799	130817	130796	130796	he	201	“ Did you say Romilda ? Harry — do you know her ? Can you introduce me ? ”
130922	130930	130932	130932	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I ’ll introduce you , ”
130937	130949	130950	130950	He	136	“ I ’m going to let you down now , okay ? ”
130979	130988	130990	130990	Harry	136	“ She ’ll be in Slughorn ’s office , ”
131000	131008	131010	131010	Ron	201	“ Why will she be in there ? ”
131018	131029	131031	131031	Harry	136	“ Oh , she has extra Potions lessons with him , ”
131036	131049	131051	131051	Ron	201	“ Maybe I could ask if I can have them with her ? ”
131054	131058	131060	131060	Harry	136	“ Great idea , ”
131077	131086	131087	131087	she	2764	“ You ’re late , Won - Won ! ”
131090	131098	131087	131087	she	2764	“ I ’ve got you a birthday — ”
131099	131104	131106	131106	Ron	201	“ Leave me alone , ”
131109	131120	131106	131106	Ron	201	“ Harry ’s going to introduce me to Romilda Vane . ”
131212	131215	131216	131216	he	136	“ Harry , ”
131219	131236	131216	131216	he	136	“ This is very early for a call ... I generally sleep late on a Saturday ... ”
131237	131248	131250	131250	Harry	136	“ Professor , I ’m really sorry to disturb you , ”
131271	131324	131257	131257	Ron	201	“ but my friend Ron ’s swallowed a love potion by mistake . You could n’t make him an antidote , could you ? I ’d take him to Madam Pomfrey , but we ’re not supposed to have anything from Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes and , you know ... awkward questions ... ”
131325	131347	131349	131349	Slughorn	200	“ I ’d have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy , Harry , an expert potioneer like you ? ”
131351	131354	131356	131356	Harry	136	“ Er , ”
131383	131415	131364	131364	Ron	201	“ well , I ’ve never mixed an antidote for a love potion , sir , and by the time I get it right , Ron might ’ve done something serious — ”
131425	131439	131418	131418	Ron	201	“ I ca n’t see her , Harry — is he hiding her ? ”
131440	131447	131449	131449	Slughorn	200	“ Was this potion within date ? ”
131458	131472	131449	131449	Slughorn	200	“ They can strengthen , you know , the longer they ’re kept . ”
131473	131480	131482	131482	Harry	136	“ That would explain a lot , ”
131497	131505	131506	131506	he	200	“ It ’s his birthday , Professor , ”
131510	131524	131526	131526	Slughorn	200	“ Oh , all right , come in , then , come in , ”
131530	131548	131526	131526	Slughorn	200	“ I ’ve got the necessary here in my bag , it ’s not a difficult antidote ... ”
131581	131591	131526	131526	Slughorn	200	“ She did n’t see that , did she ? ”
131592	131599	131601	131601	Harry	136	“ She ’s not here yet , ”
131624	131629	131631	131631	Ron	201	“ That ’s good , ”
131634	131640	131631	131631	Ron	201	“ How do I look ? ”
131641	131645	131647	131647	Slughorn	200	“ Very handsome , ”
131658	131682	131647	131647	Slughorn	200	“ Now drink that up , it ’s a tonic for the nerves , keep you calm when she arrives , you know . ”
131683	131686	131688	131688	Ron	201	“ Brilliant , ”
131735	131742	131744	131744	Harry	136	“ Back to normal , then ? ”
131751	131758	131748	131748	Slughorn	200	“ Thanks a lot , Professor . ”
131759	131772	131774	131774	Slughorn	200	“ Do n’t mention it , m’boy , do n’t mention it , ”
131787	131800	131801	131801	Slughorn	200	“ Pick - me - up , that ’s what he needs , ”
131814	131853	131854	131854	He	200	“ I ’ve got butterbeer , I ’ve got wine , I ’ve got one last bottle of this oak - matured mead ... hmm ... meant to give that to Dumbledore for Christmas ... ah , well ... ”
131857	131896	131897	131897	He	200	“ He ca n’t miss what he ’s never had ! Why do n’t we open it now and celebrate Mr. Weasley ’s birthday ? Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love ... ”
131958	131964	131966	131966	Slughorn	200	“ There you are then , ”
131982	131992	131966	131966	Slughorn	200	“ Well , a very happy birthday , Ralph — ”
131993	131996	131998	131998	Harry	136	“ Ron — ”
132055	132064	132047	132047	Slughorn	200	“ — and may you have many more — ”
132065	132068	132069	132069	Ron	201	“ Ron ! ”
132107	132110	132111	132111	Harry	136	“ Professor ! ”
132114	132118	132111	132111	Harry	136	“ Do something ! ”
132137	132142	132144	132144	Slughorn	200	“ What — but — ”
132250	132333	132245	132245	Ron	201	” said Fred . It was evening ; the hospital wing was quiet , the windows curtained , the lamps lit . Ron ’s was the only occupied bed . Harry , Hermione , and Ginny were sitting around him ; they had spent all day waiting outside the double doors , trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out . Madam Pomfrey had only let them enter at eight o’clock . Fred and George had arrived at ten past . “
132345	132366	132338	132338	we	2774	” said George grimly , putting down a large wrapped gift on Ron ’s bedside cabinet and sitting beside Ginny . “
132379	132383	132375	132375	he	2775	” said Fred . “
132395	132399	132385	132385	we	2774	” said George . “
132405	132412	132400	132400	You	2776	” asked Ginny , looking up . “
132421	132426	132418	132418	Zonko	368	” said Fred gloomily . “
132465	132481	132488	132488	Harry	136	” He drew up a chair beside Harry and looked at Ron ’s pale face . “
132490	132523	132488	132488	Harry	136	” Harry retold the story he had already recounted , it felt like a hundred times to Dumbledore , to McGonagall , to Madam Pomfrey , to Hermione , and to Ginny . “
132591	132592	132593	132593	Blimey	233	” “
132604	132612	132598	132598	you	233	” said George in a low voice . “
132621	132734	132598	132598	you	233	” said Harry , who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay hands on the little stone . Hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff . She had been exceptionally quiet all day . Having hurtled , white - faced , up to Harry outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened , she had taken almost no part in Harry and Ginny ’s obsessive discussion about how Ron had been poisoned , but merely stood beside them , clench - jawed and frightened - looking , until at last they had been allowed in to see him . “
132741	132746	132738	132738	Dad	227	” Fred asked Ginny . “
132774	132791	132768	132768	they	2784	” There was a pause while they all watched Ron mumble a little in his sleep . “
132800	132805	132768	132768	they	2784	” said Fred quietly . “
132808	132832	132768	132768	they	2784	” said Harry at once ; he could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again . “
132838	132839	132833	132833	Slughorn	200	” “
132856	132857	132841	132841	he	200	” “
132860	132864	132841	132841	he	200	” said Harry , “
132874	132875	132868	132868	Slughorn	200	” “
132879	132885	132868	132868	Slughorn	200	” said Fred , frowning . “
132905	132906	132890	132890	he	200	” “
132915	132919	132909	132909	Slughorn	200	” asked Ginny . “
132923	132927	132909	132909	Slughorn	200	” said Fred , “
132955	132956	132947	132949	The Chosen One	862	” “
132966	132970	132962	132964	a Death Eater	999	” said Ginny . “
132975	132980	132981	132981	He	200	” said Fred darkly . “
132989	132993	132981	132981	He	200	” said George . “
133000	133004	132981	132981	He	200	” said Ginny . “
133025	133026	133023	133023	himself	200	” “
133034	133035	133036	133036	Dumbledore	138	” “
133045	133049	133038	133038	Voldemort	179	” said Harry . “
133065	133082	133085	133085	Voldemort	179	” He thought of the memory Dumbledore had not yet been able to extract from Slughorn . “
133103	133104	133094	133094	he	200	” “
133121	133126	133106	133106	you	2790	” Ginny reminded him . “
133139	133140	133106	133106	you	2790	” “
133151	133173	133142	133143	the poisoner	2791	” said Hermione , speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though she had a bad head cold . “
133195	133196	133186	133186	he	200	” “
133203	133282	133186	133186	he	200	” croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them . They all fell silent , watching him anxiously , but after muttering incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring . The dormitory doors flew open , making them all jump : Hagrid came striding toward them , his hair rain - flecked , his bearskin coat flapping behind him , a crossbow in his hand , leaving a trail of muddy dolphin - sized footprints all over the floor . “
133290	133294	133186	133186	he	200	” he panted . “
133331	133332	133329	133329	he	363	” “
133336	133340	133341	133341	They	2795	” said Harry . “
133348	133349	133341	133341	They	2795	” “
133359	133370	133341	133341	They	2795	” said Madam Pomfrey , hurrying out of her office . “
133375	133380	133371	133371	Hagrid	177	” George pointed out . “
133385	133423	133424	133424	I	0	” said Madam Pomfrey , who seemed to have been counting Hagrid as several people due to his vastness . To cover her confusion , she hurried off to clear up his muddy footprints with her wand . “
133430	133447	133424	133424	I	0	” said Hagrid hoarsely , shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at Ron . “
133471	133472	133424	133424	I	0	” “
133481	133485	133424	133424	I	0	” said Harry . “
133491	133492	133486	133486	We	2797	” “
133508	133513	133514	133516	Firs ’ Katie	2800	” said Hagrid anxiously . “
133521	133522	133523	133523	I	0	” “
133536	133540	133541	133541	Wood	455	” said George . “
133556	133561	133541	133541	Wood	455	” said Fred fairly . “
133583	133588	133573	133573	I	0	” said Hermione quietly . “
133595	133599	133573	133573	I	0	” asked Fred . “
133649	133654	133669	133669	they	2804	” she added broodingly , “
133688	133749	133750	133750	Dumbledore	138	” Before anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement , the dormitory doors opened again and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hurried up the ward . They had done no more than satisfy themselves that Ron would make a full recovery on their last visit to the ward ; now Mrs. Weasley seized hold of Harry and hugged him very tightly . “
133762	133766	133755	133755	you	2807	” she sobbed . “
133790	133791	133785	133785	you	2807	” “
133800	133805	133796	133796	I	0	” muttered Harry awkwardly . “
133825	133834	133818	133818	I	0	” Mr. Weasley said in a constricted voice . “
133866	133921	133864	133864	Harry	136	” Harry could not think of any reply to this and was almost glad when Madam Pomfrey reminded them that there were only supposed to be six visitors around Ron ’s bed ; he and Hermione rose at once to leave and Hagrid decided to go with them , leaving Ron with his family . “
133926	133948	133864	133864	Harry	136	” growled Hagrid into his beard , as the three of them walked back along the corridor to the marble staircase . “
133979	133980	133975	133975	I	0	” “
133990	133995	133996	133996	I	0	” asked Hermione desperately . “
134010	134014	133999	133999	he	138	” said Hagrid . “
134047	134073	134040	134040	they	2812	” said Hagrid , lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder ( Harry , for good measure , checked the ceiling for Peeves ) , “
134127	134151	134121	134125	the board o ’ governors	2819	” Hagrid stopped talking as the ghost of a long - haired woman drifted serenely past , then resumed in a hoarse whisper , “
134171	134172	134121	134125	the board o ’ governors	2819	” “
134176	134183	134189	134189	their	2812	” said Hermione , looking worried . “
134195	134200	134189	134189	their	2812	” said Hagrid heavily . “
134259	134284	134253	134253	Dumbledore	138	” Hagrid stopped in his tracks , a familiar , guilty expression on what was visible of his face above his tangled black beard . “
134287	134292	134293	134293	Dumbledore	138	” said Harry quickly . “
134299	134300	134297	134297	Snape	205	” “
134307	134324	134301	134301	I	0	” said Hagrid , though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway . “
134342	134343	134344	134344	Hagrid	177	” “
134353	134358	134348	134348	Dumbledore	138	” Harry asked loudly . “
134361	134371	134348	134348	Dumbledore	138	” said Hagrid , looking both nervous and angry . “
134411	134412	134409	134409	Mag	457	” “
134427	134432	134409	134409	Mag	457	” said Harry forcefully . “
134438	134439	134440	134440	I	0	” “
134520	134521	134544	134544	Snape	205	” “
134524	134537	134544	134544	Snape	205	” Harry urged him , as Hagrid shuffled his enormous feet uneasily . “
134569	134570	134556	134556	he	205	” “
134574	134575	134576	134576	I	0	” “
134653	134668	134627	134627	he	205	” Hagrid added hastily , as Harry and Hermione exchanged looks full of meaning . “
134684	134685	134669	134674	All the Heads o ’ Houses	2830	” “
134703	134707	134701	134701	he	138	” said Harry . “
134710	134732	134701	134701	he	138	” Hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hands ; there was a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two . “
134762	134763	134736	134736	yeh’re	2832	” “
134767	134804	134736	134736	yeh’re	2832	” said Hermione tersely . They turned just in time to see the shadow of Argus Filch looming over the wall behind them before the man himself turned the corner , hunchbacked , his jowls aquiver . “
134807	134811	134736	134736	yeh’re	2832	” he wheezed . “
134823	134824	134830	134830	Filch	417	” “
134832	134837	134830	134830	Filch	417	” said Hagrid shortly . “
134847	134848	134845	134845	they	2833	” “
134856	134861	134845	134845	they	2833	” asked Filch obnoxiously . “
134877	134916	134872	134872	yeh	2835	” said Hagrid , firing up at once . There was a nasty hissing noise as Filch swelled with fury ; Mrs. Norris had arrived , unseen , and was twisting herself sinuously around Filch ’s skinny ankles . “
134920	135002	134872	134872	yeh	2835	” said Hagrid out of the corner of his mouth . Harry did not need telling twice ; he and Hermione both hurried off ; Hagrid ’s and Filch ’s raised voices echoed behind them as they ran . They passed Peeves near the turning into Gryffindor Tower , but he was streaking happily toward the source of the yelling , cackling and calling , When there ’s strife and when there ’s trouble Call on Peevsie , he ’ll make double !
135236	135243	135244	135244	Harry	136	“ There you are , Potter ! ”
135301	135312	135314	135314	McLaggen	276	“ I ’ve been waiting for you to come back , ”
135322	135356	135314	135314	McLaggen	276	“ Must ’ve fallen asleep . Look , I saw them taking Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier . Did n’t look like he ’ll be fit for next week ’s match . ”
135371	135378	135379	135379	he	136	“ Oh ... right ... Quidditch , ”
135401	135410	135379	135379	he	136	“ Yeah ... he might not make it . ”
135411	135426	135428	135428	McLaggen	276	“ Well , then , I ’ll be playing Keeper , wo n’t I ? ”
135430	135433	135435	135435	Harry	136	“ Yeah , ”
135437	135444	135435	135435	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I suppose so ... ”
135469	135472	135474	135474	McLaggen	276	“ Excellent , ”
135480	135486	135474	135474	McLaggen	276	“ So when ’s practice ? ”
135487	135498	135428	135428	McLaggen	276	“ What ? Oh ... there ’s one tomorrow evening . ”
135499	135525	135474	135474	McLaggen	276	“ Good . Listen , Potter , we should have a talk beforehand . I ’ve got some ideas on strategy you might find useful . ”
135526	135529	135531	135531	Harry	136	“ Right , ”
135534	135554	135531	135531	Harry	136	“ Well , I ’ll hear them tomorrow , then . I ’m pretty tired now ... see you ... ”
135919	135928	135912	135912	Ron	201	“ I mean , I am his girlfriend ! ”
135972	135986	135987	135987	Harry	136	“ Look , why do n’t you talk to Ron about all this ? ”
136027	136030	136019	136019	Ron	201	“ serious . ”
136031	136049	136051	136051	Lavender	310	“ Well , I would , but he ’s always asleep when I go and see him ! ”
136054	136058	136060	136060	Harry	136	“ Is he ? ”
136104	136112	136113	136113	Lavender	310	“ Is Hermione Granger still visiting him ? ”
136117	136134	136136	136136	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I think so . Well , they ’re friends , are n’t they ? ”
136139	136148	136150	136150	Lavender	310	“ Friends , do n’t make me laugh , ”
136153	136186	136150	136150	Lavender	310	“ She did n’t talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me ! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now he ’s all interesting ... ”
136187	136196	136198	136198	Harry	136	“ Would you call getting poisoned being interesting ? ”
136200	136219	136221	136221	Harry	136	“ Anyway — sorry , got to go — there ’s McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch , ”
136308	136316	136317	136317	he	136	“ So how ’s McLaggen shaping up ? ”
136334	136340	136342	136342	Harry	136	“ I ’ve told you , ”
136345	136403	136404	136404	Harry	136	“ he could be world - class and I would n’t want to keep him . He keeps trying to tell everyone what to do , he thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us . I ca n’t wait to be shot of him . And speaking of getting shot of people , ”
136417	136440	136404	136404	Harry	136	“ will you stop pretending to be asleep when Lavender comes to see you ? She ’s driving me mad as well . ”
136441	136444	136446	136446	Ron	201	“ Oh , ”
136451	136457	136446	136446	Ron	201	“ Yeah . All right . ”
136458	136475	136477	136477	Harry	136	“ If you do n’t want to go out with her anymore , just tell her , ”
136479	136493	136495	136495	Ron	201	“ Yeah ... well ... it ’s not that easy , is it ? ”
136500	136510	136511	136511	he	201	“ Hermione going to look in before the match ? ”
136515	136529	136511	136511	he	201	“ No , she ’s already gone down to the pitch with Ginny . ”
136530	136533	136535	136535	Ron	201	“ Oh , ”
136541	136559	136535	136535	Ron	201	“ Right . Well , good luck . Hope you hammer McLag — I mean , Smith . ”
136560	136565	136567	136567	Harry	136	“ I ’ll try , ”
136573	136580	136567	136567	Harry	136	“ See you after the match . ”
136676	136682	136683	136683	Harry	136	“ Where ’re you going ? ”
136686	136705	136707	136707	Malfoy	159	“ Yeah , I ’m really going to tell you , because it ’s your business , Potter , ”
136709	136741	136707	136707	Malfoy	159	“ You ’d better hurry up , they ’ll be waiting for ‘ the Chosen Captain ’ — ‘ the Boy Who Scored ’ — whatever they call you these days . ”
136863	136869	136871	136871	Ginny	222	“ Where have you been ? ”
136906	136911	136912	136912	Harry	136	“ I met Malfoy , ”
136927	136930	136912	136912	Harry	136	“ So ? ”
136931	136957	136918	136918	he	136	“ So I wanted to know how come he ’s up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is down here ... ”
136958	136965	136912	136912	Harry	136	“ Does it matter right now ? ”
136966	136980	136982	136982	Harry	136	“ Well , I ’m not likely to find out , am I ? ”
136993	136998	137004	137004	he	136	“ Come on then ! ”
137038	137042	137043	137043	McLaggen	276	“ Tricky conditions ! ”
137050	137073	137043	137043	McLaggen	276	“ Coote , Peakes , you ’ll want to fly out of the sun , so they do n’t see you coming — ”
137074	137088	137090	137090	Harry	136	“ I ’m the Captain , McLaggen , shut up giving them instructions , ”
137093	137101	137090	137090	Harry	136	“ Just get up by the goalposts ! ”
137115	137126	137127	137127	he	136	“ Make sure you do fly out of the sun , ”
137212	137223	137313	137314	the commentator	2243	“ And that ’s Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle , ”
137234	137308	137313	137314	the commentator	2243	“ He did the commentary last time , of course , and Ginny Weasley flew into him , I think probably on purpose , it looked like it . Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor , I expect he regrets that now he ’s playing them — oh , look , he ’s lost the Quaffle , Ginny took it from him , I do like her , she ’s very nice ... ”
137376	137410	137366	137366	she	237	“ . . . but now that big Hufflepuff player ’s got the Quaffle from her , I ca n’t remember his name , it ’s something like Bibble — no , Buggins — ”
137411	137416	137418	137419	Professor McGonagall	237	“ It ’s Cadwallader ! ”
137483	137504	137506	137506	Harry	136	“ McLaggen , will you pay attention to what you ’re supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone ! ”
137515	137524	137506	137506	Harry	136	“ You ’re not setting a great example ! ”
137535	137548	137550	137550	Luna	264	“ And Harry Potter ’s now having an argument with his Keeper , ”
137566	137587	137557	137561	Slytherins below in the crowd	2891	“ I do n’t think that ’ll help him find the Snitch , but maybe it ’s a clever ruse ... ”
137715	137720	137777	137777	McLaggen	276	“ Loser ’s Lurgy . ”
137721	137728	137730	137731	Professor McGonagall	237	“ Seventy - forty to Hufflepuff ! ”
137737	137743	137745	137745	Luna	264	“ Is it , already ? ”
137748	137767	137745	137745	Luna	264	“ Oh , look ! The Gryffindor Keeper ’s got hold of one of the Beater ’s bats . ”
137808	137823	137825	137825	Harry	136	“ Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goalposts ! ”
137927	137935	137937	137937	Ron	201	“ Nice of you to drop in , ”
138001	138005	138107	138108	Madam Pomfrey	292	“ What happened ? ”
138006	138010	138012	138013	Madam Pomfrey	292	“ Cracked skull , ”
138025	138055	138012	138013	Madam Pomfrey	292	“ Nothing to worry about , I mended it at once , but I ’m keeping you in overnight . You should n’t overexert yourself for a few hours . ”
138056	138066	138068	138068	Harry	136	“ I do n’t want to stay here overnight , ”
138079	138089	138068	138068	Harry	136	“ I want to find McLaggen and kill him . ”
138090	138105	138107	138108	Madam Pomfrey	292	“ I ’m afraid that would come under the heading of ‘ overexertion , ’ ”
138126	138145	138146	138146	She	292	“ You will stay here until I discharge you , Potter , or I shall call the headmaster . ”
138163	138172	138173	138173	he	136	“ D’you know how much we lost by ? ”
138180	138187	138189	138189	Ron	201	“ Well , yeah I do , ”
138192	138203	138189	138189	Ron	201	“ Final score was three hundred and twenty to sixty . ”
138204	138207	138209	138209	Harry	136	“ Brilliant , ”
138212	138223	138209	138209	Harry	136	“ Really brilliant ! When I get hold of McLaggen — ”
138224	138243	138245	138245	Ron	201	“ You do n’t want to get hold of him , he ’s the size of a troll , ”
138248	138296	138245	138245	Ron	201	“ Personally , I think there ’s a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the Prince ’s . Anyway , the rest of the team might ’ve dealt with him before you get out of here , they ’re not happy ... ”
138360	138370	138372	138372	Ron	201	“ I could hear the match commentary from here , ”
138381	138395	138374	138374	his	201	“ I hope Luna always commentates from now on ... Loser ’s Lurgy ... ”
138419	138430	138431	138431	he	201	“ Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious , ”
138476	138498	138470	138470	Ron	201	“ She reckons you only just arrived on time for the match . How come ? You left here early enough . ”
138499	138502	138504	138504	Harry	136	“ Oh ... ”
138516	138577	138578	138578	Harry	136	“ Yeah ... well , I saw Malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who did n’t look like they wanted to be with him , and that ’s the second time he ’s made sure he is n’t down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school ; he skipped the last match too , remember ? ”
138581	138596	138578	138578	Harry	136	“ Wish I ’d followed him now , the match was such a fiasco ... ”
138597	138603	138605	138605	Ron	201	“ Do n’t be stupid , ”
138608	138627	138605	138605	Ron	201	“ You could n’t have missed a Quidditch match just to follow Malfoy , you ’re the Captain ! ”
138628	138639	138641	138641	Harry	136	“ I want to know what he ’s up to , ”
138643	138666	138641	138641	Harry	136	“ And do n’t tell me it ’s all in my head , not after what I overheard between him and Snape — ”
138667	138678	138680	138680	Ron	201	“ I never said it was all in your head , ”
138695	138740	138680	138680	Ron	201	“ but there ’s no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place ! You ’re getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy , Harry . I mean , thinking about missing a match just to follow him ... ”
138741	138750	138752	138752	Harry	136	“ I want to catch him at it ! ”
138756	138771	138752	138752	Harry	136	“ I mean , where ’s he going when he disappears off the map ? ”
138772	138778	138780	138780	Ron	201	“ I dunno ... Hogsmeade ? ”
138784	138810	138780	138780	Ron	201	“ I ’ve never seen him going along any of the secret passageways on the map . I thought they were being watched now anyway ? ”
138811	138818	138820	138820	Ron	201	“ Well then , I dunno , ”
139108	139179	139180	139180	Kreacher	173	” Harry sat bolt upright , his heart pounding , his bandage turban askew . He had the solution at last : There was a way to have Malfoy followed — how could he have forgotten , why had n’t he thought of it before ? But the question was , how to call him ? What did you do ? Quietly , tentatively , Harry spoke into the darkness . “
139182	139208	139180	139180	Kreacher	173	” There was a very loud crack , and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks filled the silent room . Ron awoke with a yelp . “
139214	139231	139180	139180	Kreacher	173	” Harry pointed his wand hastily at the door of Madam Pomfrey ’s office and muttered , “
139234	139324	139180	139180	Kreacher	173	” so that she would not come running . Then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at what was going on . Two house - elves were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the dormitory , one wearing a shrunken maroon jumper and several woolly hats , the other , a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth . Then there was another loud bang , and Peeves the Poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elves . “
139332	139351	139330	139330	Potty	405	” he told Harry indignantly , pointing at the fight below , before letting out a loud cackle . “
139365	139366	139367	139367	Kreacher	173	” “
139393	139403	139384	139384	Dobby	438	” cried Dobby in a high - pitched voice . “
139409	139427	139384	139384	Dobby	438	” cried Peeves happily , now pelting bits of chalk at the elves to enrage them further . “
139432	139433	139434	139434	Kreacher	173	” “
139470	139547	139463	139466	poor Kreacher ’s mistress	2912	” Exactly what Kreacher ’s mistress would have said they did not find out , for at that moment Dobby sank his knobbly little fist into Kreacher ’s mouth and knocked out half of his teeth . Harry and Ron both leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves apart , though they continued to try and kick and punch each other , egged on by Peeves , who swooped around the lamp squealing , “
139563	139573	139549	139549	your	2913	” Harry aimed his wand at Peeves and said , “
139576	139616	139617	139618	Nice one	2914	” Peeves clutched at his throat , gulped , then swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak , owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to the roof of his mouth . “
139620	139642	139617	139618	Nice one	2914	” said Ron appreciatively , lifting Dobby into the air so that his flailing limbs no longer made contact with Kreacher . “
139653	139654	139645	139647	another Prince hex	2915	” “
139657	139671	139645	139647	another Prince hex	2915	” said Harry , twisting Kreacher ’s wizened arm into a half nelson . “
139707	139708	139698	139698	I	0	” “
139735	139751	139724	139724	Dobby	438	” said Dobby , tears now streaming down his shriveled little face onto his jumper . “
139755	139779	139780	139780	Master	2919	” said Harry , and he and Ron both released the elves , who fell to the floor but did not continue fighting . “
139784	139807	139780	139780	Master	2919	” croaked Kreacher , sinking into a bow even as he gave Harry a look that plainly wished him a painful death . “
139813	139847	139780	139780	Master	2919	” said Harry , glancing toward Madam Pomfrey ’s office door to check that the Muffliato spell was still working ; there was no sign that she had heard any of the commotion . “
139856	139857	139858	139858	Kreacher	173	” “
139865	139881	139862	139862	Master	2920	” said Kreacher , sinking so low that his lips almost touched his gnarled toes , “
139900	139901	139902	139902	Dobby	438	” “
139910	139926	139902	139902	Dobby	438	” squeaked Dobby , his tennis - ball - sized eyes still swimming in tears . “
139936	139937	139927	139927	Dobby	438	” “
139954	139958	139927	139927	Dobby	438	” said Harry . “
139970	139988	139989	139989	I	0	” Ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on Ron ’s face , Harry went on , “
140019	140020	140023	140024	Harry Potter	136	” “
140026	140039	140023	140024	Harry Potter	136	” said Dobby at once , his great eyes shining with excitement . “
140059	140060	140056	140057	Harry Potter	136	” “
140070	140075	140076	140076	Master	2923	” said Harry hastily . “
140087	140091	140092	140092	Master	2925	” croaked Kreacher . “
140110	140111	140092	140092	Master	2925	” “
140117	140132	140092	140092	Master	2925	” said Harry , foreseeing a great danger and determining to prevent it immediately . “
140180	140227	140228	140228	Master	2928	” He thought he could see Kreacher struggling to see a loophole in the instructions he had just been given and waited . After a moment or two , and to Harry ’s great satisfaction , Kreacher bowed deeply again and said , with bitter resentment , “
140255	140256	140245	140250	the servant of the Malfoy boy	2929	” “
140263	140267	140245	140250	the servant of the Malfoy boy	2929	” said Harry . “
140315	140315	140307	140307	Malfoy	159	”
140404	140411	140412	140412	he	136	“ What did they row about ? ”
140469	140475	140477	140477	Hermione	180	“ It ’s all right ! ”
140486	140489	140490	140490	She	180	“ Here ... ”
140501	140504	140490	140490	She	180	“ Reparo . ”
140535	140543	140544	140544	he	136	“ I swear they ’re getting smaller , ”
140547	140552	140554	140554	Harry	136	“ Never mind her , ”
140560	140571	140554	140554	Harry	136	“ What did Ginny and Dean row about , Hermione ? ”
140572	140586	140588	140588	Hermione	180	“ Oh , Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludger at you , ”
140590	140597	140599	140599	Ron	201	“ It must ’ve looked funny , ”
140602	140611	140613	140613	Hermione	180	“ It did n’t look funny at all ! ”
140616	140637	140613	140613	Hermione	180	“ It looked terrible and if Coote and Peakes had n’t caught Harry he could have been very badly hurt ! ”
140638	140657	140659	140659	Harry	136	“ Yeah , well , there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up over it , ”
140667	140674	140659	140659	Harry	136	“ Or are they still together ? ”
140675	140688	140690	140690	Hermione	180	“ Yes , they are — but why are you so interested ? ”
140698	140711	140712	140712	he	136	“ I just do n’t want my Quidditch team messed up again ! ”
140735	140738	140717	140717	Hermione	180	“ Harry ! ”
140750	140757	140717	140717	Hermione	180	“ Oh , hi , Luna . ”
140758	140769	140771	140771	Luna	264	“ I went to the hospital wing to find you , ”
140778	140786	140787	140787	She	264	“ But they said you ’d left ... ”
140832	140845	140827	140827	she	264	“ . . . I ’ve been told to give you this . ”
140868	140871	140872	140872	he	136	“ Tonight , ”
140884	140890	140892	140892	Ron	201	“ Nice commentary last match ! ”
140915	140927	140928	140928	she	264	“ You ’re making fun of me , are n’t you ? ”
140931	140938	140928	140928	she	264	“ Everyone says I was dreadful . ”
140939	140946	140948	140948	Ron	201	“ No , I ’m serious ! ”
140951	140968	140969	140969	he	201	“ I ca n’t remember enjoying commentary more ! What is this , by the way ? ”
140981	140989	140990	140990	she	264	“ Oh , it ’s a Gurdyroot , ”
141005	141032	140990	140990	she	264	“ You can keep it if you like , I ’ve got a few of them . They ’re really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies . ”
141047	141059	141060	141060	he	201	“ You know , she ’s grown on me , Luna , ”
141073	141087	141088	141088	He	201	“ I know she ’s insane , but it ’s in a good — ”
141108	141111	141113	141113	Ron	201	“ Hi , ”
141116	141120	141113	141113	Ron	201	“ C’m on , ”
141140	141160	141137	141137	Lavender	310	“ Why did n’t you tell me you were getting out today ? And why was she with you ? ”
141292	141299	141301	141301	Harry	136	“ Thanks a lot , Hermione , ”
141325	141341	141312	141312	he	136	“ Listen , I ’ve got to hurry or I ’ll be late for Dumbledore ... ”
141416	141419	141421	141421	Dumbledore	138	“ Enter , ”
141447	141450	141451	141451	she	301	“ Aha ! ”
141468	141486	141451	141451	she	301	“ So this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office , Dumbledore ! ”
141487	141492	141494	141494	Dumbledore	138	“ My dear Sybill , ”
141501	141534	141494	141494	Dumbledore	138	“ there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere , but Harry does have an appointment , and I really do n’t think there is any more to be said — ”
141535	141539	141541	141542	Professor Trelawney	301	“ Very well , ”
141550	141577	141578	141578	She	301	“ If you will not banish the usurping nag , so be it ... Perhaps I shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated ... ”
141610	141621	141623	141623	Dumbledore	138	“ Please close the door and sit down , Harry , ”
141666	141679	141680	141680	Harry	136	“ Professor Trelawney still is n’t happy Firenze is teaching , then ? ”
141683	141686	141688	141688	Dumbledore	138	“ No , ”
141690	141787	141688	141688	Dumbledore	138	“ Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen , never having studied the subject myself . I can not ask Firenze to return to the forest , where he is now an outcast , nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave . Between ourselves , she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle . She does not know — and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her — that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort , you see . ”
141797	141832	141788	141788	Dumbledore	138	“ But never mind my staffing problems . We have much more important matters to discuss . Firstly — have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson ? ”
141833	141836	141838	141838	Harry	136	“ Ah , ”
141889	141918	141879	141879	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions , sir , but , er , he would n’t give it to me . ”
141925	141929	141931	141931	Dumbledore	138	“ I see , ”
141960	142006	141953	141953	he	136	“ And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter , do you ? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity ? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory ? ”
142007	142010	142011	142011	Harry	136	“ Well , ”
142037	142069	142023	142023	His	136	“ Well ... the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn . I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood — ”
142070	142076	142078	142078	Dumbledore	138	“ And did that work ? ”
142080	142092	142078	142078	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , no , sir , because Ron got poisoned — ”
142093	142201	142228	142228	his	138	“ — which , naturally , made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory ; I would have expected nothing else , while your best friend was in danger . Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full recovery , however , I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you . I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is . Indeed , I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it . ”
142255	142258	142259	142259	he	138	“ Sir , ”
142266	142287	142259	142259	he	138	“ it is n’t that I was n’t bothered or anything , I ’ve just had other — other things ... ”
142288	142295	142296	142296	Dumbledore	138	“ Other things on your mind , ”
142303	142307	142296	142296	Dumbledore	138	“ I see . ”
142380	142415	142377	142377	he	136	“ Professor Dumbledore , I ’m really sorry . I should have done more ... I should have realized you would n’t have asked me to do it if it was n’t really important . ”
142416	142425	142427	142427	Dumbledore	138	“ Thank you for saying that , Harry , ”
142430	142465	142427	142427	Dumbledore	138	“ May I hope , then , that you will give this matter higher priority from now on ? There will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory . ”
142466	142481	142482	142482	he	138	“ I ’ll do it , sir , I ’ll get it from him , ”
142486	142498	142500	142500	Dumbledore	138	“ Then we shall say no more about it just now , ”
142504	142521	142500	142500	Dumbledore	138	“ but continue with our story where we left off . You remember where that was ? ”
142522	142527	142529	142529	Harry	136	“ Yes , sir , ”
142532	142569	142570	142570	he	136	“ Voldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his Uncle Morfin did it . Then he went back to Hogwarts and he asked ... he asked Professor Slughorn about Horcruxes , ”
142574	142578	142580	142580	Dumbledore	138	“ Very good , ”
142582	142617	142580	142580	Dumbledore	138	“ Now , you will remember , I hope , that I told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation ? ”
142618	142623	142500	142500	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , sir . ”
142624	142657	142658	142658	Harry	136	“ Thus far , as I hope you agree , I have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what Voldemort did until the age of seventeen ? ”
142661	142667	142669	142669	Dumbledore	138	“ But now , Harry , ”
142671	142754	142669	142669	Dumbledore	138	“ now things become murkier and stranger . If it was difficult to find evidence about the boy Riddle , it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man Voldemort . In fact , I doubt whether there is a soul alive , apart from himself , who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts . However , I have two last memories that I would like to share with you . ”
142767	142789	142755	142755	Dumbledore	138	“ I shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely . ”
142842	142866	142867	142867	he	138	“ I hope you are not tired of diving into other people ’s memories , for they are curious recollections , these two , ”
142870	142905	142867	142867	he	138	“ This first one came from a very old house - elf by the name of Hokey . Before we see what Hokey witnessed , I must quickly recount how Lord Voldemort left Hogwarts . “
143030	143031	143022	143022	Voldemort	179	” “
143037	143043	143022	143022	Voldemort	179	” Harry repeated , stunned . “
143049	143054	143022	143022	Voldemort	179	” repeated Dumbledore calmly . “
143126	143127	143128	143128	He	179	” “
143136	143144	143147	143147	he	179	” asked Harry , more amazed still . “
143162	143166	143153	143153	he	179	” said Dumbledore . “
143212	143232	143265	143265	he	179	” Harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words , for this was exactly how he felt about Hogwarts too . “
143283	143383	143265	143265	he	179	“ And thirdly , as a teacher , he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards . Perhaps he had gained the idea from Professor Slughorn , the teacher with whom he was on best terms , who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play . I do not imagine for an instant that Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts , but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground , and a place where he might begin to build himself an army . ”
143384	143395	143265	143265	he	179	“ But he did n’t get the job , sir ? ”
143396	143432	143265	143265	he	179	“ No , he did not . Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen , but invited him to reapply in a few years , if he still wished to teach . ”
143433	143443	143445	143445	Harry	136	“ How did you feel about that , sir ? ”
143448	143452	143454	143454	Dumbledore	138	“ Deeply uneasy , ”
143456	143511	143454	143454	Dumbledore	138	“ I had advised Armando against the appointment — I did not give the reasons I have given you , for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty . But I did not want Lord Voldemort back at this school , and especially not in a position of power . ”
143512	143529	143538	143538	Dumbledore	138	“ Which job did he want , sir ? What subject did he want to teach ? ”
143542	143577	143538	143538	Dumbledore	138	“ Defense Against the Dark Arts . It was being taught at the time by an old professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought , who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years . “
143696	143697	143701	143701	he	179	” “
143704	143713	143701	143701	he	179	” said Harry , unable to contain himself . “
143718	143727	143701	143701	he	179	” said Dumbledore , with a faint smile . “
143759	143789	143756	143757	Hepzibah Smith	475	” Dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand , the cork flew out , and he tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve , saying as he did so , “
143795	143910	143793	143793	Harry	136	” Harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them . He tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her , giving her the look of a melting iced cake . She was looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff , while the tiniest and oldest house - elf Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers . “
143916	143921	143922	143922	He	2982	” said Hepzibah imperiously . “
143946	143998	143922	143922	He	2982	” She tucked away her powder puff as the house - elf straightened up . The top of the elf ’s head barely reached the seat of Hepzibah ’s chair , and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga . “
144004	144023	144001	144001	I	0	” said Hepzibah , turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror . “
144028	144080	144026	144026	madam	4653	” squeaked Hokey . Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokey ’s contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question , because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion . A tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped . “
144091	144283	144284	144284	I	0	” cried Hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room , which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at least a dozen things : There were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes , cases full of gold - embossed books , shelves of orbs and celestial globes , and many flourishing potted plants in brass containers . In fact , the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory . The house - elf returned within minutes , followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as Voldemort . He was plainly dressed in a black suit ; his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed , but all of this suited him ; he looked more handsome than ever . He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over Hepzibah ’s fat little hand , brushing it with his lips . “
144289	144302	144284	144284	I	0	” he said quietly , producing a bunch of roses from nowhere . “
144312	144334	144335	144335	You	2986	” squealed old Hepzibah , though Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table . “
144356	144384	144352	144352	Hokey	472	” The house - elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes , which she set at her mistress ’s elbow . “
144390	144394	144388	144388	Tom	345	” said Hepzibah , “
144428	144436	144420	144420	I	0	” Voldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered . “
144448	144456	144457	144458	Mr. Burke	476	” she asked , batting her lashes . “
144473	144477	144482	144482	he	476	” said Voldemort . “
144491	144492	144482	144482	he	476	” “
144513	144517	144505	144505	you	345	” pouted Hepzibah . “
144526	144531	144505	144505	you	345	” said Voldemort quietly . “
144556	144557	144549	144550	Mr. Burke	476	” “
144565	144574	144560	144561	Mr. Burke	476	” said Hepzibah , waving a little hand . “
144664	144665	144666	144666	I	0	” “
144678	144690	144673	144674	Miss Hepzibah	477	” said Voldemort quietly , and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle . “
144728	144729	144732	144732	madam	4653	” “
144734	144791	144732	144732	madam	4653	” squeaked the house - elf , and Harry saw two leather boxes , one on top of the other , moving across the room as if of their own volition , though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables , pouffes , and footstools . “
144794	144820	144732	144732	madam	4653	” said Hepzibah happily , taking the boxes from the elf , laying them in her lap , and preparing to open the topmost one , “
144852	144883	144841	144841	They	2999	” She opened the lid . Harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles . “
144904	144967	144968	144969	A badger	3000	” whispered Hepzibah , and Voldemort stretched out a long - fingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings . Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes . His greedy expression was curiously mirrored on Hepzibah ’s face , except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon Voldemort ’s handsome features . “
144971	144982	144968	144969	A badger	3000	” murmured Voldemort , examining the engraving upon the cup . “
144988	144989	144990	144991	Helga Hufflepuff	479	” “
145004	145023	144990	144991	Helga Hufflepuff	479	” said Hepzibah , leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek . “
145083	145127	145073	145073	I	0	” She hooked the cup back off Voldemort ’s long forefinger and restored it gently to its box , too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed Voldemort ’s face as the cup was taken away . “
145131	145136	145073	145073	I	0	” said Hepzibah happily , “
145155	145178	145153	145153	Hokey	472	” The elf obediently took the boxed cup , and Hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap . “
145190	145194	145188	145188	Tom	345	” she whispered . “
145240	145289	145290	145290	Slytherin	389	” She slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box . There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket . Voldemort reached out his hand , without invitation this time , and held it up to the light , staring at it . “
145294	145309	145290	145290	Slytherin	389	” he said quietly , as the light played upon an ornate , serpentine S. “
145314	145334	145335	145335	I	0	” said Hepzibah , delighted , apparently , at the sight of Voldemort gazing at her locket , transfixed . “
145398	145428	145377	145396	a ragged - looking woman who seemed to have stolen it , but had no idea of its true value	3006	” There was no mistaking it this time : Voldemort ’s eyes flashed scarlet at the words , and Harry saw his knuckles whiten on the locket ’s chain . “
145468	145511	145460	145460	I	0	” She reached out to take the locket back . For a moment , Harry thought Voldemort was not going to let go of it , but then it had slid through his fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion . “
145528	145549	145522	145522	I	0	” She looked him full in the face and for the first time , Harry saw her foolish smile falter . “
145557	145558	145551	145551	you	3007	” “
145562	145567	145551	145551	you	3007	” said Voldemort quietly . “
145575	145576	145577	145577	I	0	” “
145590	145614	145577	145577	I	0	” said Hepzibah , looking unnerved , and Harry guessed that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in Voldemort ’s eyes . “
145632	145633	145577	145577	I	0	” “
145640	145678	145638	145638	Harry	136	” said Dumbledore quietly , and as the little elf bobbed away bearing the boxes , Dumbledore grasped Harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to Dumbledore ’s office . “
145689	145705	145706	145706	Hokey	472	” said Dumbledore , resuming his seat and indicating that Harry should do the same . “
145726	145727	145707	145710	the house - elf	959	” “
145731	145736	145737	145737	I	0	” said Harry angrily . “
145745	145749	145737	145737	I	0	” said Dumbledore . “
145787	145788	145769	145770	somebody else	1464	” “
145792	145793	145794	145794	She	472	” “
145820	145824	145829	145829	she	472	” said Dumbledore . “
145843	145844	145829	145829	she	472	” “
145857	145858	145852	145852	he	179	” “
145867	145871	145852	145852	he	179	” said Dumbledore . “
145887	145888	145885	145885	Hokey	472	” “
145898	145918	145893	145896	a house - elf	957	” said Harry . He had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society Hermione had set up , S.P.E.W. “
145921	145925	145893	145896	a house - elf	957	” said Dumbledore . “
145998	146134	145986	145986	Voldemort	179	“ By the time Hokey was convicted , Hepzibah ’s family had realized that two of her greatest treasures were missing . It took them a while to be sure of this , for she had many hiding places , having always guarded her collection most jealously . But before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone , the assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes , the young man who had visited Hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well , had resigned his post and vanished . His superiors had no idea where he had gone ; they were as surprised as anyone at his disappearance . And that was the last that was seen or heard of Tom Riddle for a very long time . “
146137	146141	145986	145986	Voldemort	179	” said Dumbledore , “
146266	146267	146255	146255	he	179	” “
146270	146276	146255	146255	he	179	” said Harry , frowning , “
146293	146294	146255	146255	he	179	” “
146306	146310	146255	146255	he	179	” said Dumbledore . “
146353	146354	146341	146341	he	179	” “
146359	146363	146341	146341	he	179	” said Harry , “
146372	146373	146341	146341	he	179	” “
146384	146388	146341	146341	he	179	” said Dumbledore . “
146436	146489	146490	146490	Harry	136	“ And now for the very last recollection I have to show you , at least until you manage to retrieve Professor Slughorn ’s memory for us . Ten years separate Hokey ’s memory and this one , ten years during which we can only guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing ... ”
146507	146513	146514	146514	he	138	“ Whose memory is it ? ”
146517	146520	146522	146522	Dumbledore	138	“ Mine , ”
146661	146664	146658	146658	he	138	“ Enter . ”
146816	146822	146824	146824	Dumbledore	138	“ Good evening , Tom , ”
146827	146834	146824	146824	Dumbledore	138	“ Wo n’t you sit down ? ”
146835	146839	146844	146844	he	179	“ Thank you , ”
146873	146882	146883	146883	he	179	“ I heard that you had become headmaster , ”
146899	146904	146883	146883	he	179	“ A worthy choice . ”
146905	146912	146914	146914	Dumbledore	138	“ I am glad you approve , ”
146918	146926	146914	146914	Dumbledore	138	“ May I offer you a drink ? ”
146927	146933	146935	146935	Voldemort	179	“ That would be welcome , ”
146937	146945	146935	146935	Voldemort	179	“ I have come a long way . ”
146991	147004	146982	146982	he	138	“ So , Tom ... to what do I owe the pleasure ? ”
147018	147029	147030	147030	he	179	“ They do not call me ‘ Tom ’ anymore , ”
147033	147042	147030	147030	he	179	“ These days , I am known as — ”
147043	147052	147054	147054	Dumbledore	138	“ I know what you are known as , ”
147059	147100	147101	147101	He	179	“ But to me , I ’m afraid , you will always be Tom Riddle . It is one of the irritating things about old teachers . I am afraid that they never quite forget their charges ’ youthful beginnings . ”
147161	147172	147174	147174	Voldemort	179	“ I am surprised you have remained here so long , ”
147180	147196	147174	147174	Voldemort	179	“ I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school . ”
147197	147200	147202	147202	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , ”
147207	147246	147202	147202	Dumbledore	138	“ to a wizard such as myself , there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills , helping hone young minds . If I remember correctly , you once saw the attraction of teaching too . ”
147247	147253	147255	147255	Voldemort	179	“ I see it still , ”
147257	147290	147255	147255	Voldemort	179	“ I merely wondered why you — who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry , and who have twice , I think , been offered the post of Minister — ”
147291	147301	147303	147303	Dumbledore	138	“ Three times at the last count , actually , ”
147305	147327	147303	147303	Dumbledore	138	“ But the Ministry never attracted me as a career . Again , something we have in common , I think . ”
147370	147375	147376	147376	he	138	“ I have returned , ”
147384	147470	147376	147376	he	138	“ later , perhaps , than Professor Dippet expected ... but I have returned , nevertheless , to request again what he once told me I was too young to have . I have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle , to teach . I think you must know that I have seen and done much since I left this place . I could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard . ”
147487	147505	147506	147506	he	179	“ Yes , I certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us , ”
147510	147533	147506	147506	he	179	“ Rumors of your doings have reached your old school , Tom . I should be sorry to believe half of them . ”
147543	147563	147540	147540	he	179	“ Greatness inspires envy , envy engenders spite , spite spawns lies . You must know this , Dumbledore . ”
147564	147581	147583	147583	Dumbledore	138	“ You call it ‘ greatness , ’ what you have been doing , do you ? ”
147586	147589	147591	147591	Voldemort	179	“ Certainly , ”
147601	147624	147594	147594	his	179	“ I have experimented ; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further , perhaps , than they have ever been pushed — ”
147625	147632	147633	147633	Dumbledore	138	“ Of some kinds of magic , ”
147638	147654	147633	147633	Dumbledore	138	“ Of some . Of others , you remain ... forgive me ... woefully ignorant . ”
147681	147686	147687	147687	he	179	“ The old argument , ”
147691	147718	147687	147687	he	179	“ But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic , Dumbledore . ”
147719	147730	147732	147732	Dumbledore	138	“ Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places , ”
147734	147753	147755	147755	Voldemort	179	“ Well , then , what better place to start my fresh researches than here , at Hogwarts ? ”
147757	147791	147755	147755	Voldemort	179	“ Will you let me return ? Will you let me share my knowledge with your students ? I place myself and my talents at your disposal . I am yours to command . ”
147797	147827	147794	147794	his	138	“ And what will become of those whom you command ? What will happen to those who call themselves — or so rumor has it — the Death Eaters ? ”
147856	147860	147861	147861	he	179	“ My friends , ”
147870	147881	147861	147861	he	179	“ will carry on without me , I am sure . ”
147882	147894	147896	147896	Dumbledore	138	“ I am glad to hear that you consider them friends , ”
147898	147914	147896	147896	Dumbledore	138	“ I was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants . ”
147915	147920	147922	147922	Voldemort	179	“ You are mistaken , ”
147924	147988	147922	147922	Voldemort	179	“ Then if I were to go to the Hog ’s Head tonight , I would not find a group of them — Nott , Rosier , Mulciber , Dolohov — awaiting your return ? Devoted friends indeed , to travel this far with you on a snowy night , merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post . ”
148021	148030	148015	148015	he	138	“ You are omniscient as ever , Dumbledore . ”
148031	148042	148044	148044	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh no , merely friendly with the local barmen , ”
148047	148052	148044	148044	Dumbledore	138	“ Now , Tom ... ”
148079	148108	148061	148061	himself	138	“ Let us speak openly . Why have you come here tonight , surrounded by henchmen , to request a job we both know you do not want ? ”
148114	148134	148109	148109	Voldemort	179	“ A job I do not want ? On the contrary , Dumbledore , I want it very much . ”
148135	148182	148183	148183	Voldemort	179	“ Oh , you want to come back to Hogwarts , but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen . What is it you ’re after , Tom ? Why not try an open request for once ? ”
148186	148198	148183	148183	Voldemort	179	“ If you do not want to give me a job — ”
148199	148206	148208	148208	Dumbledore	138	“ Of course I do n’t , ”
148210	148240	148208	148208	Dumbledore	138	“ And I do n’t think for a moment you expected me to . Nevertheless , you came here , you asked , you must have had a purpose . ”
148260	148267	148254	148254	his	179	“ This is your final word ? ”
148268	148272	148274	148274	Dumbledore	138	“ It is , ”
148279	148291	148274	148274	Dumbledore	138	“ Then we have nothing more to say to each other . ”
148292	148297	148299	148299	Dumbledore	138	“ No , nothing , ”
148309	148347	148306	148306	his	138	“ The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes . But I wish I could , Tom ... I wish I could ... ”
148449	148452	148454	148454	Harry	136	“ Why ? ”
148465	148478	148454	148454	Harry	136	“ Why did he come back ? Did you ever find out ? ”
148479	148484	148486	148486	Dumbledore	138	“ I have ideas , ”
148488	148495	148486	148486	Dumbledore	138	“ but no more than that . ”
148496	148502	148454	148454	Harry	136	“ What ideas , sir ? ”
148503	148521	148523	148523	Dumbledore	138	“ I shall tell you , Harry , when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn , ”
148525	148550	148523	148523	Dumbledore	138	“ When you have that last piece of the jigsaw , everything will , I hope , be clear ... to both of us . ”
148581	148601	148560	148560	Dumbledore	138	“ Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again , sir ? He did n’t say ... ”
148602	148616	148618	148618	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh , he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job , ”
148620	148661	148618	148618	Dumbledore	138	“ The aftermath of our little meeting proved that . You see , we have never been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort . ”
148740	148749	148751	148751	Hermione	180	“ You wo n’t find anything in there , ”
148759	148766	148768	148768	Harry	136	“ Do n’t start , Hermione , ”
148770	148788	148768	148768	Harry	136	“ If it had n’t been for the Prince , Ron would n’t be sitting here now . ”
148789	148804	148806	148806	Hermione	180	“ He would if you ’d just listened to Snape in our first year , ”
148820	148823	148809	148809	Harry	136	“ Sectumsempra ! ”
148833	148837	148813	148813	He	136	“ For Enemies , ”
149030	149039	149041	149041	Ron	201	“ At least you can Apparate , though ! ”
149044	149053	149041	149041	Ron	201	“ You ’ll have no trouble come July ! ”
149054	149062	149063	149063	Harry	136	“ I ’ve only done it once , ”
149156	149179	149181	149181	Hermione	180	“ I ’m telling you , the stupid Prince is n’t going to be able to help you with this , Harry ! ”
149186	149212	149181	149181	Hermione	180	“ There ’s only one way to force someone to do what you want , and that ’s the Imperius Curse , which is illegal — ”
149213	149222	149224	149224	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I know that , thanks , ”
149233	149265	149224	149224	Harry	136	“ That ’s why I ’m looking for something different . Dumbledore says Veritaserum wo n’t do it , but there might be something else , a potion or a spell ... ”
149266	149276	149278	149278	Hermione	180	“ You ’re going about it the wrong way , ”
149280	149320	149278	149278	Hermione	180	“ Only you can get the memory , Dumbledore says . That must mean you can persuade Slughorn where other people ca n’t . It ’s not a question of slipping him a potion , anyone could do that — ”
149321	149329	149331	149331	Ron	201	“ How d’you spell ‘ belligerent ’ ? ”
149344	149355	149331	149331	Ron	201	“ It ca n’t be B — U — M — ”
149356	149363	149365	149365	Hermione	180	“ No , it is n’t , ”
149374	149397	149365	149365	Hermione	180	“ And ‘ augury ’ does n’t begin O — R — G either . What kind of quill are you using ? ”
149398	149422	149331	149331	Ron	201	“ It ’s one of Fred and George ’s Spell - Check ones ... but I think the charm must be wearing off ... ”
149423	149429	149431	149431	Hermione	180	“ Yes , it must , ”
149441	149474	149431	149431	Hermione	180	“ because we were asked how we ’d deal with dementors , not ‘ Dugbogs , ’ and I do n’t remember you changing your name to ‘ Roonil Wazlib ’ either . ”
149475	149479	149481	149481	Ron	201	“ Ah no ! ”
149491	149506	149481	149481	Ron	201	“ Do n’t say I ’ll have to write the whole thing out again ! ”
149507	149517	149519	149519	Hermione	180	“ It ’s okay , we can fix it , ”
149532	149539	149541	149541	Ron	201	“ I love you , Hermione , ”
149563	149573	149554	149554	Hermione	180	“ Do n’t let Lavender hear you saying that . ”
149574	149579	149581	149581	Ron	201	“ I wo n’t , ”
149586	149598	149581	149581	Ron	201	“ Or maybe I will ... then she ’ll ditch me ... ”
149599	149613	149615	149615	Harry	136	“ Why do n’t you ditch her if you want to finish it ? ”
149617	149628	149630	149630	Ron	201	“ You have n’t ever chucked anyone , have you ? ”
149632	149638	149630	149630	Ron	201	“ You and Cho just — ”
149639	149647	149649	149649	Harry	136	“ Sort of fell apart , yeah , ”
149651	149661	149663	149663	Ron	201	“ Wish that would happen with me and Lavender , ”
149691	149719	149679	149679	her	180	“ But the more I hint I want to finish it , the tighter she holds on . It ’s like going out with the giant squid . ”
149720	149723	149725	149725	Hermione	180	“ There , ”
149738	149743	149745	149745	Ron	201	“ Thanks a million , ”
149747	149757	149745	149745	Ron	201	“ Can I borrow your quill for the conclusion ? ”
149869	149872	149866	149866	Harry	136	“ Kreacher ! ”
149886	149908	149881	149881	his	959	“ Master said he wanted regular reports on what the Malfoy boy is doing , so Kreacher has come to give — ”
149923	149933	149934	149934	he	438	“ Dobby has been helping too , Harry Potter ! ”
149943	149966	149934	149934	he	438	“ And Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is coming to see Harry Potter so they can make their reports together ! ”
149967	149972	149974	149974	Hermione	180	“ What is this ? ”
149984	149992	149993	149993	Harry	136	“ What ’s going on , Harry ? ”
150025	150036	150037	150037	he	136	“ Well ... they ’ve been following Malfoy for me , ”
150040	150045	150047	150047	Kreacher	173	“ Night and day , ”
150049	150061	150063	150063	Dobby	438	“ Dobby has not slept for a week , Harry Potter ! ”
150075	150096	150071	150071	Hermione	180	“ You have n’t slept , Dobby ? But surely , Harry , you did n’t tell him not to — ”
150097	150106	150108	150108	Harry	136	“ No , of course I did n’t , ”
150111	150130	150131	150131	he	136	“ Dobby , you can sleep , all right ? But has either of you found out anything ? ”
150142	150155	150157	150157	Kreacher	173	“ Master Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood , ”
150161	150178	150157	150157	Kreacher	173	“ His features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those of — ”
150179	150187	150189	150189	Dobby	438	“ Draco Malfoy is a bad boy ! ”
150192	150200	150189	150189	Dobby	438	“ A bad boy who — who — ”
150262	150269	150270	150270	he	438	“ Thank you , Harry Potter , ”
150273	150287	150288	150288	Harry	136	“ Dobby still finds it difficult to speak ill of his old masters ... ”
150303	150322	150292	150292	Dobby	438	“ But Kreacher should know that Draco Malfoy is not a good master to a house - elf ! ”
150323	150340	150341	150341	Harry	136	“ Yeah , we do n’t need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy , ”
150345	150358	150343	150343	Kreacher	173	“ Let ’s fast forward to where he ’s actually been going . ”
150370	150397	150359	150359	Kreacher	173	“ Master Malfoy eats in the Great Hall , he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons , he attends his classes in a variety of — ”
150398	150405	150407	150407	Harry	136	“ Dobby , you tell me , ”
150413	150424	150407	150407	Harry	136	“ Has he been going anywhere he should n’t have ? ”
150425	150431	150433	150433	Dobby	438	“ Harry Potter , sir , ”
150444	150492	150433	150433	Dobby	438	“ the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover , but he is still keen to avoid detection . He has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students , who keep watch for him while he enters — ”
150493	150499	150501	150501	Harry	136	“ The Room of Requirement ! ”
150522	150576	150517	150517	Ron	201	“ That ’s where he ’s been sneaking off to ! That ’s where he ’s doing ... whatever he ’s doing ! And I bet that ’s why he ’s been disappearing off the map — come to think of it , I ’ve never seen the Room of Requirement on there ! ”
150577	150588	150590	150590	Ron	201	“ Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there , ”
150592	150606	150608	150608	Hermione	180	“ I think it ’ll be part of the magic of the room , ”
150610	150623	150608	150608	Hermione	180	“ If you need it to be Unplottable , it will be . ”
150624	150643	150645	150645	Harry	136	“ Dobby , have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoy ’s doing ? ”
150648	150658	150660	150660	Dobby	438	“ No , Harry Potter , that is impossible , ”
150662	150669	150671	150671	Harry	136	“ No , it ’s not , ”
150675	150701	150671	150671	Harry	136	“ Malfoy got into our headquarters there last year , so I ’ll be able to get in and spy on him , no problem . ”
150702	150713	150715	150715	Hermione	180	“ But I do n’t think you will , Harry , ”
150718	150785	150715	150715	Hermione	180	“ Malfoy already knew exactly how we were using the room , did n’t he , because that stupid Marietta had blabbed . He needed the room to become the headquarters of the D.A. , so it did . But you do n’t know what the room becomes when Malfoy goes in there , so you do n’t know what to ask it to transform into . ”
150786	150795	150797	150797	Harry	136	“ There ’ll be a way around that , ”
150800	150808	150797	150797	Harry	136	“ You ’ve done brilliantly , Dobby . ”
150809	150816	150818	150818	Hermione	180	“ Kreacher ’s done well too , ”
150840	150856	150829	150829	his	173	“ The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher , Kreacher will pretend he can not hear — ”
150857	150863	150864	150864	Harry	136	“ Get out of it , ”
150879	150892	150870	150870	Kreacher	173	“ You ’d better go and get some sleep too , Dobby . ”
150893	150902	150908	150908	he	438	“ Thank you , Harry Potter , sir ! ”
150912	150918	150920	150920	Harry	136	“ How good ’s this ? ”
150938	150953	150927	150927	Hermione	180	“ We know where Malfoy ’s going ! We ’ve got him cornered now ! ”
150954	150961	150963	150963	Ron	201	“ Yeah , it ’s great , ”
151001	151020	151022	151022	Hermione	180	“ But what ’s all this about him going up there with a ‘ variety of students ’ ? ”
151024	151050	151022	151022	Hermione	180	“ How many people are in on it ? You would n’t think he ’d trust lots of them to know what he ’s doing ... ”
151051	151058	151060	151060	Harry	136	“ Yeah , that is weird , ”
151064	151092	151060	151060	Harry	136	“ I heard him telling Crabbe it was n’t Crabbe ’s business what he was doing ... so what ’s he telling all these ... all these ... ”
151106	151114	151115	151115	he	136	“ God , I ’ve been stupid , ”
151119	151151	151115	151115	he	136	“ It ’s obvious , is n’t it ? There was a great vat of it down in the dungeon ... He could ’ve nicked some any time during that lesson ... ”
151152	151156	151158	151158	Ron	201	“ Nicked what ? ”
151160	151208	151210	151210	Harry	136	“ Polyjuice Potion . He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slughorn showed us in our first Potions lesson ... There are n’t a whole variety of students standing guard for Malfoy ... it ’s just Crabbe and Goyle as usual ... Yeah , it all fits ! ”
151224	151298	151210	151210	Harry	136	“ They ’re stupid enough to do what they ’re told even if he wo n’t tell them what he ’s up to ... but he does n’t want them to be seen lurking around outside the Room of Requirement , so he ’s got them taking Polyjuice to make them look like other people ... Those two girls I saw him with when he missed Quidditch — ha ! Crabbe and Goyle ! ”
151299	151306	151308	151308	Hermione	180	“ Do you mean to say , ”
151314	151325	151308	151308	Hermione	180	“ that that little girl whose scales I repaired — ? ”
151326	151332	151334	151334	Harry	136	“ Yeah , of course ! ”
151341	151409	151334	151334	Harry	136	“ Of course ! Malfoy must ’ve been inside the room at the time , so she — what am I talking about ? — he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to come out , because there was someone there ! And there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too ! We ’ve been walking past him all the time and not realizing it ! ”
151410	151421	151423	151423	Ron	201	“ He ’s got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls ? ”
151425	151451	151423	151423	Ron	201	“ Blimey ... No wonder they do n’t look too happy these days ... I ’m surprised they do n’t tell him to stuff it ... ”
151452	151471	151473	151473	Harry	136	“ Well , they would n’t , would they , if he ’s shown them his Dark Mark ? ”
151475	151487	151489	151489	Hermione	180	“ Hmmm ... the Dark Mark we do n’t know exists , ”
151512	151517	151519	151519	Harry	136	“ We ’ll see , ”
151522	151528	151529	151529	Hermione	180	“ Yes , we will , ”
151539	151581	151583	151583	she	180	“ But , Harry , before you get all excited , I still do n’t think you ’ll be able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing what ’s there first . And I do n’t think you should forget ”
151598	151618	151583	151583	she	180	“ that what you ’re supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from Slughorn . Good night . ”
151645	151650	151640	151640	he	136	“ What d’you think ? ”
151651	151662	151664	151664	Ron	201	“ Wish I could Disapparate like a house - elf , ”
151675	151686	151664	151664	Ron	201	“ I ’d have that Apparition Test in the bag . ”
151890	151893	151894	151894	he	136	“ Look , ”
151930	151971	152023	152023	she	180	“ I have n’t forgotten about Slughorn , but I have n’t got a clue how to get that memory off him , and until I get a brain wave why should n’t I find out what Malfoy ’s doing ? ”
151972	151985	151987	151987	Hermione	180	“ I ’ve already told you , you need to persuade Slughorn , ”
151989	152021	152023	152023	she	180	“ It ’s not a question of tricking him or bewitching him , or Dumbledore could have done it in a second . Instead of messing around outside the Room of Requirement ”
152043	152058	152023	152023	she	180	“ you should go and find Slughorn and start appealing to his better nature . ”
152059	152065	152067	152067	Ron	201	“ Anyone we know — ? ”
152075	152078	152080	152080	Hermione	180	“ Yes ! ”
152093	152170	152080	152080	Hermione	180	“ But it ’s all right , he ’s not dead — it ’s Mundungus , he ’s been arrested and sent to Azkaban ! Something to do with impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary ... and someone called Octavius Pepper has vanished ... Oh , and how horrible , a nine - year - old boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents , they think he was under the Imperius Curse ... ”
152417	152448	152409	152409	he	136	” But he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall . He moved forward and gave it an experimental push . The stone remained solid and unyielding . “
152451	152456	152409	152409	he	136	” said Harry aloud . “
152465	152526	152459	152459	I	0	” He pondered for a moment then set off again , eyes closed , concentrating as hard as he could . I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly ... I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly ... After three walks past , he opened his eyes expectantly . There was no door . “
152533	152540	152459	152459	I	0	” he told the wall irritably . “
152549	152671	152672	152672	I	0	” He thought hard for several minutes before striding off once more . I need you to become the place you become for Draco Malfoy ... He did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his patrolling ; he was listening hard , as though he might hear the door pop into existence . He heard nothing , however , except the distant twittering of birds outside . He opened his eyes . There was still no door . Harry swore . Someone screamed . He looked around to see a gaggle of first years running back around the corner , apparently under the impression that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed ghost . Harry tried every variation of “
152683	152752	152672	152672	I	0	” that he could think of for a whole hour , at the end of which he was forced to concede that Hermione might have had a point : The room simply did not want to open for him . Frustrated and annoyed , he set off for Defense Against the Dark Arts , pulling off his Invisibility Cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he went . “
152758	152771	152756	152756	Potter	136	” said Snape coldly , as Harry hurried into the candlelit classroom . “
152777	152820	152756	152756	Potter	136	” Harry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the seat beside Ron ; half the class was still on its feet , taking out books and organizing their things ; he could not be much later than any of them . “
152831	152862	152825	152825	I	0	” said Snape , waving his wand carelessly , so that twenty - five scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk . “
152904	152905	152901	152902	Mr. Finnigan	492	” “
152908	152912	152906	152906	Sir	4356	” said Seamus , “
152942	152943	152939	152940	an Inferius	6087	” “
152950	152958	152939	152940	an Inferius	6087	” said Snape in a bored voice . “
152967	152968	152964	152964	people	584	” “
153006	153007	153008	153008	I	0	” “
153019	153027	153012	153012	Mundungus	215	” muttered Harry to Ron and Hermione . “
153038	153039	153033	153033	Mundungus	215	” “
153053	153073	153041	153041	Potter	136	” said Snape , pointing suddenly at the back of the room , his black eyes fixed on Harry . “
153091	153120	153079	153079	we	3086	” The whole class looked around at Harry , who hastily tried to recall what Dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn . “
153129	153133	153079	153079	we	3086	” he said . “
153139	153147	153079	153079	we	3086	” interrupted Snape , his lip curling . “
153177	153209	153212	153212	ghosts	3088	” Pansy Parkinson let out a high - pitched giggle . Several other people were smirking . Harry took a deep breath and continued calmly , though his insides were boiling , “
153232	153233	153234	153239	A five - year - old	3090	” “
153247	153251	153234	153239	A five - year - old	3090	” sneered Snape . “
153326	153327	153318	153318	Potter	136	” “
153346	153350	153331	153331	Harry	136	” said Ron . “
153407	153425	153383	153383	we	3091	” There was a ripple of laughter , instantly quelled by the look Snape gave the class . “
153432	153436	153383	153383	we	3091	” said Snape . “
153464	153465	153453	153453	he	204	” “
153468	153483	153453	153453	he	204	” whispered Hermione , grabbing Harry ’s arm as he opened his mouth furiously . “
153501	153502	153453	153453	he	204	” “
153514	153522	153453	153453	he	204	” said Snape , smirking a little , “
153534	153610	153619	153619	he	3103	” Ron was very subdued all through the class . When the bell sounded at the end of the lesson , Lavender caught up with Ron and Harry ( Hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she approached ) and abused Snape hotly for his jibe about Ron ’s Apparition , but this seemed to merely irritate Ron , and he shook her off by making a detour into the boys ’ bathroom with Harry . “
153621	153637	153619	153619	he	3103	” said Ron , after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two . “
153659	153660	153649	153649	I	0	” “
153679	153684	153649	153649	I	0	” said Harry reasonably . “
153743	153778	153734	153734	Myrtle	229	” The ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair , staring at them through thick , white , round glasses . “
153781	153786	153734	153734	Myrtle	229	” she said glumly . “
153792	153793	153734	153734	Myrtle	229	” “
153799	153810	153811	153811	Nobody	596	” said Ron , looking at her in the mirror . “
153813	153826	153827	153827	He	3109	” said Myrtle , picking moodily at a spot on her chin . “
153849	153858	153839	153839	you	229	” — she gave Harry a reproachful look — “
153881	153882	153883	153883	I	0	” “
153893	153913	153914	153914	I	0	” said Harry , who had been careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now . “
153917	153927	153914	153914	I	0	” she said , with a sulky little shrug , “
153952	153953	153940	153940	I	0	” “
153956	153960	153940	153940	I	0	” said Harry . “
153968	153973	153962	153962	I	0	” she said plaintively . “
153999	154008	153995	153995	he	3113	” And she looked hopefully toward the door . “
154018	154027	154010	154010	you	0	” said Ron , sounding rather amused now , “
154039	154040	154030	154030	he	3113	” “
154043	154058	154030	154030	he	3113	” said Myrtle defiantly , her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom . “
154095	154096	154084	154084	he	3113	” “
154106	154111	154100	154101	a boy	5007	” said Harry curiously . “
154116	154117	154112	154114	A young boy	3120	” “
154122	154141	154142	154142	I	0	” said Myrtle , her small , leaky eyes fixed on Ron , who was now definitely grinning . “
154159	154160	154151	154151	I	0	” “
154168	154175	154151	154151	I	0	” said Ron with a snort . “
154181	154218	154219	154219	You	3123	” Myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet , causing water to slop over the sides and onto the floor . Goading Myrtle seemed to have put fresh heart into Ron . “
154223	154235	154219	154219	You	3123	” he said , swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder , “
154252	154346	154347	154347	You	0	” And so the following weekend , Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight . Harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village ; he missed making trips there , and it was a particularly fine spring day , one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time . However , he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the Room of Requirement . “
154352	154370	154347	154347	You	0	” said Hermione , when he confided this plan to Ron and her in the entrance hall , “
154387	154388	154389	154389	I	0	” “
154394	154477	154389	154389	I	0	” said Harry crossly , which was perfectly true . He had lagged behind after every Potions lesson that week in an attempt to corner Slughorn , but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast that Harry had not been able to catch him . Twice , Harry had gone to his office and knocked , but received no reply , though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone . “
154514	154515	154489	154489	He	200	” “
154531	154643	154529	154529	you	0	” The short queue of people waiting to file past Filch , who was doing his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor , moved forward a few steps and Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker . He wished Ron and Hermione both luck , then turned and climbed the marble staircase again , determined , whatever Hermione said , to devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement . Once out of sight of the entrance hall , Harry pulled the Marauder ’s Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag . Having concealed himself , he tapped the map , murmured , “
154655	154852	154644	154644	I	0	” and scanned it carefully . As it was Sunday morning , nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms , the Gryffindors in one tower , the Ravenclaws in another , the Slytherins in the dungeons , and the Hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens . Here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor ... There were a few people out in the grounds ... and there , alone in the seventh - floor corridor , was Gregory Goyle . There was no sign of the Room of Requirement , but Harry was not worried about that ; if Goyle was standing guard outside it , the room was open , whether the map was aware of it or not . He therefore sprinted up the stairs , slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor , when he began to creep , very slowly , toward the very same little girl , clutching her heavy brass scales , that Hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before . He waited until he was right behind her before bending very low and whispering , “
154864	155055	154862	154862	you	3125	” Goyle gave a high - pitched scream of terror , threw the scales up into the air , and sprinted away , vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor . Laughing , Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which , he was sure , Draco Malfoy was now standing frozen , aware that someone unwelcome was out there , but not daring to make an appearance . It gave Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried . Yet this hopeful mood did not last long . Half an hour later , having tried many more variations of his request to see what Malfoy was up to , the wall was just as doorless as ever . Harry felt frustrated beyond belief ; Malfoy might be just feet away from him , and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there . Losing his patience completely , Harry ran at the wall and kicked it . “
155058	155085	155086	155086	Harry	136	” He thought he might have broken his toe ; as he clutched it and hopped on one foot , the Invisibility Cloak slipped off him . “
155088	155123	155086	155086	Harry	136	” He spun around , one - legged , and toppled over . There , to his utter astonishment , was Tonks , walking toward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor . “
155130	155153	155126	155126	you	3126	” he said , scrambling to his feet again ; why did she always have to find him lying on the floor ? “
155160	155181	155154	155154	I	0	” said Tonks . Harry thought she looked terrible : thinner than usual , her mouse - colored hair lank . “
155188	155192	155182	155182	His	138	” said Harry , “
155207	155208	155209	155209	I	0	” “
155212	155216	155209	155209	I	0	” said Tonks . “
155229	155230	155232	155232	he	138	” “
155234	155248	155232	155232	he	138	” said Harry , putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor . “
155262	155263	155259	155259	I	0	” “
155266	155270	155259	155259	I	0	” said Tonks . “
155280	155281	155273	155273	you	0	” “
155286	155302	155273	155273	you	0	” said Tonks , picking , apparently unconsciously , at the sleeve of her robe . “
155323	155324	155314	155314	I	0	” “
155338	155342	155314	155314	I	0	” said Harry . “
155351	155352	155314	155314	I	0	” “
155361	155375	155353	155354	The Prophet	234	” said Tonks , who did n’t seem to be listening to him . “
155389	155390	155383	155386	anyone in the Order	3132	” “
155401	155405	155391	155395	No one from the Order	3133	” said Harry , “
155410	155421	155408	155408	Sirius	135	” He saw that her eyes had filled with tears . “
155426	155431	155422	155422	I	0	” he muttered awkwardly . “
155442	155443	155435	155435	I	0	” “
155446	155459	155435	155435	I	0	” said Tonks blankly , as though she had not heard him . “
155470	155587	155588	155588	I	0	” And she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor , leaving Harry to stare after her . After a minute or so , he pulled the Invisibility Cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the Room of Requirement , but his heart was not in it . Finally , a hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that Ron and Hermione would soon be back for lunch made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to Malfoy who , hopefully , would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come . He found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall , already halfway through an early lunch . “
155597	155609	155588	155588	I	0	” Ron told Harry enthusiastically when he caught sight of him . “
155642	155643	155644	155645	Good one	3135	” “
155647	155651	155644	155645	Good one	3135	” said Harry . “
155659	155660	155654	155654	you	0	” “
155669	155678	155663	155663	she	180	” said Ron , before Hermione could answer . “
155729	155730	155721	155721	he	448	” “
155736	155743	155734	155734	you	0	” asked Hermione , ignoring Ron . “
155757	155758	155745	155745	you	0	” “
155761	155765	155745	155745	you	0	” said Harry . “
155777	155778	155779	155779	Tonks	210	” “
155781	155791	155794	155794	she	180	” repeated Ron and Hermione together , looking surprised . “
155803	155804	155794	155794	she	180	” “
155810	155823	155824	155824	she	180	” said Ron once Harry had finished describing his conversation with Tonks , “
155841	155842	155832	155832	her	180	” “
155849	155861	155832	155832	her	180	” said Hermione , who for some reason looked very concerned . “
155890	155891	155892	155892	I	0	” “
155897	155919	155892	155892	I	0	” said Harry tentatively . He felt strange about voicing it ; this was much more Hermione ’s territory than his . “
155937	155943	155935	155935	Sirius	135	” Hermione stared at him . “
155952	155953	155948	155948	you	0	” “
155957	155963	155948	155948	you	0	” said Harry , shrugging , “
156000	156001	155987	155987	I	0	” “
156007	156012	155987	155987	I	0	” said Hermione slowly . “
156040	156041	156046	156046	I	0	” “
156053	156067	156046	156046	I	0	” said Ron , who was now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth . “
156081	156088	156079	156079	Women	3145	” he said wisely to Harry , “
156094	156095	156089	156089	they	3145	” “
156099	156109	156110	156110	I	0	” said Hermione , coming out of her reverie , “
156144	156147	156140	156142	the Mimbulus mimbletonia	493	” Ron scowled .
156221	156232	156233	156233	Hermione	180	“ For the last time , just forget about Malfoy , ”
156316	156322	156324	156324	Hermione	180	“ It is n’t Lavender , ”
156327	156332	156334	156334	Ron	201	“ Oh , good , ”
156338	156342	156344	156345	the girl	4700	“ Harry Potter ? ”
156347	156356	156344	156345	the girl	4700	“ I was asked to give you this . ”
156357	156360	156361	156361	Harry	136	“ Thanks ... ”
156384	156401	156381	156381	he	136	“ Dumbledore said we would n’t be having any more lessons until I got the memory ! ”
156402	156414	156416	156416	Hermione	180	“ Maybe he wants to check on how you ’re doing ? ”
156570	156575	156577	156577	Harry	136	“ Look at this , ”
156585	156593	156594	156594	she	180	“ Oh , for heaven ’s sake , ”
156614	156619	156620	156620	he	201	“ He ’s mental ! ”
156624	156659	156620	156620	he	201	“ That thing told its mates to eat Harry and me ! Told them to help themselves ! And now Hagrid expects us to go down there and cry over its horrible hairy body ! ”
156660	156667	156669	156669	Hermione	180	“ It ’s not just that , ”
156671	156704	156669	156669	Hermione	180	“ He ’s asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows security ’s a million times tighter and how much trouble we ’d be in if we were caught . ”
156705	156717	156719	156719	Harry	136	“ We ’ve been down to see him by night before , ”
156721	156730	156732	156732	Hermione	180	“ Yes , but for something like this ? ”
156734	156762	156732	156732	Hermione	180	“ We ’ve risked a lot to help Hagrid out , but after all — Aragog ’s dead . If it were a question of saving him — ”
156763	156773	156775	156775	Ron	201	“ — I ’d want to go even less , ”
156778	156799	156775	156775	Ron	201	“ You did n’t meet him , Hermione . Believe me , being dead will have improved him a lot . ”
156828	156839	156841	156841	Hermione	180	“ Harry , you ca n’t be thinking of going , ”
156843	156855	156856	156856	Harry	136	“ It ’s such a pointless thing to get detention for . ”
156859	156865	156866	156866	he	136	“ Yeah , I know , ”
156869	156880	156866	156866	he	136	“ I s’pose Hagrid’ll have to bury Aragog without us . ”
156881	156887	156889	156889	Hermione	180	“ Yes , he will , ”
156894	156922	156889	156889	Hermione	180	“ Look , Potions will be almost empty this afternoon , with us all off doing our tests ... Try and soften Slughorn up a bit then ! ”
156923	156933	156935	156935	Harry	136	“ Fifty - seventh time lucky , you think ? ”
156938	156941	156943	156943	Ron	201	“ Lucky , ”
156946	156956	156943	156943	Ron	201	“ Harry , that ’s it — get lucky ! ”
156957	156962	156889	156889	Hermione	180	“ What d’you mean ? ”
156963	156969	156889	156889	Hermione	180	“ Use your lucky potion ! ”
156970	156980	156982	156982	Hermione	180	“ Ron , that ’s — that ’s it ! ”
156987	156999	157000	157000	Harry	136	“ Of course ! Why did n’t I think of it ? ”
157006	157010	157011	157011	he	136	“ Felix Felicis ? ”
157014	157025	157011	157011	he	136	“ I dunno ... I was sort of saving it ... ”
157026	157030	157032	157032	Ron	201	“ What for ? ”
157035	157048	157050	157050	Hermione	180	“ What on earth is more important than this memory , Harry ? ”
157124	157133	157135	157135	Hermione	180	“ Harry ? Are you still with us ? ”
157137	157146	157147	157147	he	136	“ Wha — ? Yeah , of course , ”
157154	157182	157147	157147	he	136	“ Well ... okay . If I ca n’t get Slughorn to talk this afternoon , I ’ll take some Felix and have another go this evening . ”
157183	157190	157192	157192	Hermione	180	“ That ’s decided , then , ”
157205	157212	157213	157213	she	180	“ Destination ... determination ... deliberation ... ”
157216	157222	157223	157223	Ron	201	“ Oh , stop that , ”
157227	157241	157223	157223	Ron	201	“ I feel sick enough as it is — quick , hide me ! ”
157242	157248	157250	157250	Hermione	180	“ It is n’t Lavender ! ”
157268	157271	157273	157273	Ron	201	“ Cool , ”
157283	157295	157273	157273	Ron	201	“ Blimey , they do n’t look happy , do they ? ”
157296	157322	157324	157324	Hermione	180	“ They ’re the Montgomery sisters and of course they do n’t look happy , did n’t you hear what happened to their little brother ? ”
157326	157344	157346	157346	Ron	201	“ I ’m losing track of what ’s happening to everyone ’s relatives , to be honest , ”
157348	157393	157346	157346	Ron	201	“ Well , their brother was attacked by a werewolf . The rumor is that their mother refused to help the Death Eaters . Anyway , the boy was only five and he died in St. Mungo ’s , they could n’t save him . ”
157394	157398	157400	157400	Harry	136	“ He died ? ”
157404	157421	157400	157400	Harry	136	“ But surely werewolves do n’t kill , they just turn you into one of them ? ”
157422	157427	157429	157429	Ron	201	“ They sometimes kill , ”
157437	157451	157429	157429	Ron	201	“ I ’ve heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away . ”
157452	157460	157462	157462	Harry	136	“ What was the werewolf ’s name ? ”
157465	157478	157480	157480	Hermione	180	“ Well , the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback , ”
157482	157501	157503	157503	Harry	136	“ I knew it — the maniac who likes attacking kids , the one Lupin told me about ! ”
157512	157523	157524	157524	she	180	“ Harry , you ’ve got to get that memory , ”
157527	157551	157524	157524	she	180	“ It ’s all about stopping Voldemort , is n’t it ? These dreadful things that are happening are all down to him ... ”
157572	157578	157579	157579	Harry	136	“ You ’ll do fine , ”
157603	157607	157579	157579	Harry	136	“ Good luck . ”
157608	157613	157615	157615	Hermione	180	“ And you too ! ”
157648	157657	157659	157659	Slughorn	200	“ All too young to Apparate just yet ? ”
157662	157668	157659	157659	Slughorn	200	“ Not turned seventeen yet ? ”
157674	157678	157680	157680	Slughorn	200	“ Ah well , ”
157683	157707	157680	157680	Slughorn	200	“ as we ’re so few , we ’ll do something fun . I want you all to brew me up something amusing ! ”
157708	157715	157717	157717	Ernie	320	“ That sounds good , sir , ”
157738	157749	157750	157750	he	159	“ What do you mean , ‘ something amusing ’ ? ”
157754	157760	157762	157762	Slughorn	200	“ Oh , surprise me , ”
157956	157963	157952	157952	Prince	330	“ An Elixir to Induce Euphoria , ”
158014	158024	158026	158026	Slughorn	200	“ Well , now , this looks absolutely wonderful , ”
158052	158129	158130	158130	Harry	136	“ Euphoria , I take it ? And what ’s that I smell ? Mmmm ... you ’ve added just a sprig of peppermint , have n’t you ? Unorthodox , but what a stroke of inspiration , Harry , of course , that would tend to counterbalance the occasional side effects of excessive singing and nose - tweaking ... I really do n’t know where you get these brain waves , my boy ... unless — ”
158147	158161	158130	158130	Harry	136	“ — it ’s just your mother ’s genes coming out in you ! ”
158162	158169	158171	158171	Harry	136	“ Oh ... yeah , maybe , ”
158231	158234	158224	158224	Slughorn	200	“ passable . ”
158247	158250	158251	158251	Harry	136	“ Sir , ”
158285	158300	158302	158302	Harry	136	“ Professor — Professor , do n’t you want to taste my po — ? ”
158345	158348	158350	158350	Hermione	180	“ Harry ! ”
158359	158365	158350	158350	Hermione	180	“ Harry , I passed ! ”
158366	158370	158371	158371	he	201	“ Well done ! ”
158374	158378	158371	158371	he	201	“ And Ron ? ”
158379	158386	158388	158388	Hermione	180	“ He — he just failed , ”
158401	158431	158391	158391	Ron	201	“ It was really unlucky , a tiny thing , the examiner just spotted that he ’d left half an eyebrow behind ... How did it go with Slughorn ? ”
158432	158436	158438	158438	Harry	136	“ No joy , ”
158445	158464	158438	158438	Harry	136	“ Bad luck , mate , but you ’ll pass next time — we can take it together . ”
158465	158471	158473	158473	Ron	201	“ Yeah , I s’pose , ”
158476	158486	158473	158473	Ron	201	“ But half an eyebrow ! Like that matters ! ”
158487	158491	158493	158493	Hermione	180	“ I know , ”
158496	158503	158493	158493	Hermione	180	“ it does seem really harsh ... ”
158545	158560	158561	158561	Ron	201	“ So , Harry — you going to use the Felix Felicis or what ? ”
158564	158573	158575	158575	Harry	136	“ Yeah , I s’pose I ’d better , ”
158577	158617	158575	158575	Harry	136	“ I do n’t reckon I ’ll need all of it , not twelve hours ’ worth , it ca n’t take all night ... I ’ll just take a mouthful . Two or three hours should do it . ”
158618	158629	158631	158631	Ron	201	“ It ’s a great feeling when you take it , ”
158634	158643	158631	158631	Ron	201	“ Like you ca n’t do anything wrong . ”
158644	158651	158653	158653	Hermione	180	“ What are you talking about ? ”
158657	158664	158653	158653	Hermione	180	“ You ’ve never taken any ! ”
158665	158678	158680	158680	Ron	201	“ Yeah , but I thought I had , did n’t I ? ”
158688	158693	158680	158680	Ron	201	“ Same difference really ... ”
158819	158825	158827	158827	Harry	136	“ Well , here goes , ”
158842	158849	158851	158851	Hermione	180	“ What does it feel like ? ”
158919	158922	158923	158923	he	136	“ Excellent , ”
158926	158940	158923	158923	he	136	“ Really excellent . Right ... I ’m going down to Hagrid ’s . ”
158941	158944	158946	158946	Ron	201	“ What ? ”
158954	158970	158972	158972	Hermione	180	“ No , Harry — you ’ve got to go and see Slughorn , remember ? ”
158974	158977	158979	158979	Harry	136	“ No , ”
158982	159002	158979	158979	Harry	136	“ I ’m going to Hagrid ’s , I ’ve got a good feeling about going to Hagrid ’s . ”
159003	159016	159018	159018	Ron	201	“ You ’ve got a good feeling about burying a giant spider ? ”
159023	159026	159028	159028	Harry	136	“ Yeah , ”
159039	159057	159028	159028	Harry	136	“ I feel like it ’s the place to be tonight , you know what I mean ? ”
159058	159061	159063	159063	Ron	201	“ No , ”
159074	159083	159085	159085	Hermione	180	“ This is Felix Felicis , I suppose ? ”
159096	159112	159085	159085	Hermione	180	“ You have n’t got another little bottle full of — I do n’t know — ”
159113	159118	159120	159120	Ron	201	“ Essence of Insanity ? ”
159143	159147	159148	159148	he	136	“ Trust me , ”
159151	159162	159164	159164	he	136	“ I know what I ’m doing ... or at least ”
159171	159175	159176	159176	He	136	“ Felix does . ”
159213	159223	159225	159226	Lavender Brown	310	“ What were you doing up there with her ? ”
159300	159310	159311	159311	she	222	“ Do n’t push me , please , Dean , ”
159317	159334	159311	159311	she	222	“ You ’re always doing that , I can get through perfectly well on my own ... ”
159627	159639	159640	159640	Slughorn	200	“ I do thank you for taking the time , Pomona , ”
159645	159661	159640	159640	Slughorn	200	“ most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight . ”
159662	159669	159671	159672	Professor Sprout	311	“ Oh , I quite agree , ”
159675	159681	159671	159672	Professor Sprout	311	“ That enough for you ? ”
159682	159687	159689	159689	Slughorn	200	“ Plenty , plenty , ”
159704	159742	159689	159689	Slughorn	200	“ This should allow for a few leaves for each of my third years , and some to spare if anybody over - stews them ... Well , good evening to you , and many thanks again ! ”
159790	159796	159781	159781	Harry	136	“ Good evening , Professor . ”
159797	159809	159811	159811	Slughorn	200	“ Merlin ’s beard , Harry , you made me jump , ”
159822	159832	159811	159811	Slughorn	200	“ How did you get out of the castle ? ”
159833	159845	159847	159847	Harry	136	“ I think Filch must ’ve forgotten to lock the doors , ”
159858	159889	159811	159811	Slughorn	200	“ I ’ll be reporting that man , he ’s more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me ... But why are you out here , Harry ? ”
159890	159899	159901	159901	Harry	136	“ Well , sir , it ’s Hagrid , ”
159919	159942	159943	159943	Slughorn	200	“ He ’s pretty upset ... But you wo n’t tell anyone , Professor ? I do n’t want trouble for him ... ”
159950	159959	159960	159960	he	200	“ Well , I ca n’t promise that , ”
159964	159990	159960	159960	he	200	“ But I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt , so I ’m sure he ca n’t be up to anything very dreadful ... ”
159991	160019	160105	160105	Slughorn	200	“ Well , it ’s this giant spider , he ’s had it for years ... It lived in the forest ... It could talk and everything — ”
160020	160031	160033	160033	Slughorn	200	“ I heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest , ”
160045	160052	160033	160033	Slughorn	200	“ It ’s true , then ? ”
160053	160056	160058	160058	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
160060	160097	160058	160058	Harry	136	“ But this one , Aragog , the first one Hagrid ever got , it died last night . He ’s devastated . He wants company while he buries it and I said I ’d go . ”
160098	160103	160105	160105	Slughorn	200	“ Touching , touching , ”
160122	160188	160189	160189	Slughorn	200	“ But acromantula venom is very valuable ... If the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out ... Of course , I would n’t want to do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset ... but if there was any way to procure some ... I mean , it ’s almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while it ’s alive ... ”
160201	160232	160189	160189	Slughorn	200	“ . . . seems an awful waste not to collect it ... might get a hundred Galleons a pint ... To be frank , my salary is not large ... ”
160244	160247	160248	160248	he	136	“ Well , ”
160257	160286	160248	160248	he	136	“ well , if you wanted to come , Professor , Hagrid would probably be really pleased ... Give Aragog a better send - off , you know ... ”
160287	160293	160295	160295	Slughorn	200	“ Yes , of course , ”
160304	160370	160371	160371	He	200	“ I tell you what , Harry , I ’ll meet you down there with a bottle or two ... We ’ll drink the poor beast ’s — well — not health — but we ’ll send it off in style , anyway , once it ’s buried . And I ’ll change my tie , this one is a little exuberant for the occasion ... ”
160390	160394	160396	160396	Hagrid	177	“ Yeh came , ”
160416	160427	160429	160429	Harry	136	“ Yeah — Ron and Hermione could n’t , though , ”
160431	160437	160429	160429	Harry	136	“ They ’re really sorry . ”
160438	160458	160459	160459	Hagrid	177	“ Don ’ — don ’ matter ... He ’d ’ve bin touched yeh’re here , though , Harry ... ”
160515	160522	160523	160523	he	136	“ Where are we burying him ? ”
160526	160530	160523	160523	he	136	“ The forest ? ”
160531	160536	160538	160538	Hagrid	177	“ Blimey , no , ”
160551	160589	160538	160538	Hagrid	177	“ The other spiders won ’ let me anywhere near their webs now Aragog ’s gone . Turns out it was on’y on his orders they didn ’ eat me ! Can yeh believe that , Harry ? ”
160594	160596	160598	160598	Harry	136	“ yes ”
160638	160653	160655	160655	Hagrid	177	“ Never bin an area o ’ the forest I couldn ’ go before ! ”
160661	160708	160658	160658	his	177	“ It wasn ’ easy , gettin ’ Aragog ’s body out o ’ there , I can tell yeh — they usually eat their dead , see ... But I wanted ter give ’ i m a nice burial ... a proper send - off ... ”
160745	160756	160715	160715	Harry	136	“ Professor Slughorn met me coming down here , Hagrid . ”
160757	160765	160767	160767	Hagrid	177	“ Not in trouble , are yeh ? ”
160774	160796	160767	160767	Hagrid	177	“ Yeh shouldn ’ be outta the castle in the evenin ’ , I know it , it ’s my fault — ”
160797	160825	160827	160827	Harry	136	“ No , no , when he heard what I was doing he said he ’d like to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too , ”
160829	160860	160827	160827	Harry	136	“ He ’s gone to change into something more suitable , I think ... and he said he ’d bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragog ’s memory ... ”
160861	160865	160867	160867	Hagrid	177	“ Did he ? ”
160875	160936	160867	160867	Hagrid	177	“ Tha ’s — tha ’s righ ’ nice of him , that is , an ’ not turnin ’ yeh in either . I ’ve never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before ... Comin ’ ter see old Aragog off , though , eh ? Well ... he ’d ’ve liked that , Aragog would ... ”
160996	161011	161025	161025	Hagrid	177	“ Are we going to bury him here , Hagrid , in your garden ? ”
161012	161023	161025	161025	Hagrid	177	“ Jus ’ beyond the pumpkin patch , I thought , ”
161031	161062	161025	161025	Hagrid	177	“ I ’ve already dug the — yeh know — grave . Jus ’ thought we ’d say a few nice things over him — happy memories , yeh know — ”

161182	161195	161180	161180	Slughorn	184	“ Sad night , sad night ... Where is the poor creature ? ”
161196	161200	161202	161202	Hagrid	177	“ Out here , ”
161208	161219	161202	161202	Hagrid	177	“ Shall we — shall we do it , then ? ”
161279	161282	161284	161284	Slughorn	184	“ Magnificent , ”
161337	161348	161350	161350	Hagrid	177	“ It ’s not ev’ryone appreciates how beau’iful they are , ”
161366	161381	161350	161350	Hagrid	177	“ I didn ’ know yeh were int’rested in creatures like Aragog , Horace . ”
161382	161393	161395	161395	Slughorn	184	“ Interested ? My dear Hagrid , I revere them , ”
161427	161437	161416	161416	Hagrid	177	“ Now ... shall we proceed to the burial ? ”
161484	161499	161501	161501	Slughorn	184	“ Of course , it ’s difficult for you , who knew him best , ”
161522	161532	161533	161533	He	184	“ Why do n’t I say a few words ? ”
161575	161641	161556	161556	he	184	“ Farewell , Aragog , king of arachnids , whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you wo n’t forget ! Though your body will decay , your spirit lingers on in the quiet , web - spun places of your forest home . May your many - eyed descendants ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained . ”
161642	161653	161655	161655	Hagrid	177	“ Tha ’ was ... tha ’ was ... beau’iful ! ”
161670	161675	161677	161677	Slughorn	184	“ There , there , ”

161798	161808	161809	161809	he	184	“ I have had it all tested for poison , ”
161834	161852	161809	161809	he	184	“ Had a house - elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert . ”
161889	161894	161896	161896	Slughorn	184	“ One for Harry ... ”
161906	161916	161918	161918	he	184	“ . . . and one for me . Well ”
161924	161928	161918	161918	he	184	“ to Aragog . ”
161929	161932	161934	161934	Harry	136	“ Aragog , ”
161988	161999	162001	162001	Hagrid	177	“ I had him from an egg , yeh know , ”
162004	162022	162001	162001	Hagrid	177	“ Tiny little thing he was when he hatched . ’ Bout the size of a Pekingese . ”
162023	162026	162028	162028	Slughorn	184	“ Sweet , ”
162030	162046	162028	162028	Slughorn	184	“ Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until ... well ... ”
162116	162125	162087	162087	he	184	“ That ’s never unicorn hair , Hagrid ? ”
162126	162131	162133	162133	Hagrid	177	“ Oh , yeah , ”
162136	162159	162133	162133	Hagrid	177	“ Gets pulled out of their tails , they catch it on branches an ’ stuff in the forest , yeh know ... ”
162160	162175	162087	162087	he	184	“ But my dear chap , do you know how much that ’s worth ? ”
162176	162194	162196	162196	Hagrid	177	“ I use it fer bindin ’ on bandages an ’ stuff if a creature gets injured , ”
162200	162211	162196	162196	Hagrid	177	“ It ’s dead useful ... very strong , see . ”
162462	162466	162468	162468	Hagrid	177	“ Harry Potter ! ”
162486	162491	162493	162493	Slughorn	184	“ Yes , indeed , ”
162498	162514	162515	162515	he	184	“ Parry Otter , the Chosen Boy Who — well — something of that sort , ”
162549	162562	162540	162540	Slughorn	184	“ To friendship ! To generosity ! To ten Galleons a hair ! ”
162596	162604	162606	162606	Hagrid	177	“ Aaargh , the good die young , ”
162628	162647	162621	162621	Slughorn	184	“ Me dad was no age ter go ... nor were yer mum an ’ dad , Harry ... ”
162672	162692	162663	162663	he	177	“ Bes ’ wiz and witchard o ’ their age I never knew ... terrible thing ... terrible thing ... ”
162739	162745	162746	162746	Hagrid	177	“ . . . terrible , ”
162767	162770	162772	162772	Slughorn	184	“ Sorry , ”
162777	162788	162772	162772	Slughorn	184	“ Ca n’t carry a tune to save my life . ”
162789	162798	162800	162800	Harry	136	“ Hagrid was n’t talking about your singing , ”
162803	162814	162800	162800	Harry	136	“ He was talking about my mum and dad dying . ”
162815	162818	162820	162820	Slughorn	184	“ Oh , ”
162827	162844	162845	162845	He	507	“ Oh dear . Yes , that was — was terrible indeed . Terrible ... terrible ... ”
162863	162877	162878	162878	he	507	“ I do n’t — do n’t suppose you remember it , Harry ? ”
162882	162895	162897	162897	Harry	136	“ No — well , I was only one when they died , ”
162914	162936	162899	162899	his	136	“ But I ’ve found out pretty much what happened since . My dad died first . Did you know that ? ”
162937	162944	162946	162946	Slughorn	184	“ I — I did n’t , ”
162952	162968	162970	162970	Harry	136	“ Yeah ... Voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his body toward my mum , ”
162995	163006	163008	163008	Harry	136	“ He told her to get out of the way , ”
163011	163031	163008	163008	Harry	136	“ He told me she need n’t have died . He only wanted me . She could have run . ”
163032	163036	163038	163038	Slughorn	184	“ Oh dear , ”
163040	163053	163038	163038	Slughorn	184	“ She could have ... she need n’t ... That ’s awful ... ”
163054	163062	163064	163064	Harry	136	“ It is , is n’t it ? ”
163075	163109	163064	163064	Harry	136	“ But she did n’t move . Dad was already dead , but she did n’t want me to go too . She tried to plead with Voldemort ... but he just laughed ... ”
163110	163115	163117	163117	Slughorn	184	“ That ’s enough ! ”
163125	163154	163117	163117	Slughorn	184	“ Really , my dear boy , enough ... I ’m an old man ... I do n’t need to hear ... I do n’t want to hear ... ”
163155	163159	163161	163161	Harry	136	“ I forgot , ”
163169	163178	163163	163164	Felix Felicis	326	“ You liked her , did n’t you ? ”
163179	163183	163185	163185	Slughorn	184	“ Liked her ? ”
163195	163223	163185	163185	Slughorn	184	“ I do n’t imagine anyone who met her would n’t have liked her ... Very brave ... Very funny ... It was the most horrible thing ... ”
163224	163233	163235	163235	Harry	136	“ But you wo n’t help her son , ”
163237	163253	163235	163235	Harry	136	“ She gave me her life , but you wo n’t give me a memory . ”
163282	163288	163289	163289	he	2686	“ Do n’t say that , ”
163292	163316	163289	163289	he	2686	“ It is n’t a question ... If it were to help you , of course ... but no purpose can be served ... ”
163317	163321	163323	163323	Harry	136	“ It can , ”
163326	163335	163323	163323	Harry	136	“ Dumbledore needs information . I need information . ”
163370	163388	163364	163364	Harry	136	“ I am the Chosen One . I have to kill him . I need that memory . ”
163402	163409	163364	163364	Harry	136	“ You are the Chosen One ? ”
163410	163416	163418	163418	Harry	136	“ Of course I am , ”
163421	163453	163418	163418	Harry	136	“ But then ... my dear boy ... you ’re asking a great deal ... you ’re asking me , in fact , to aid you in your attempt to destroy — ”
163454	163470	163364	163364	Harry	136	“ You do n’t want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily Evans ? ”
163471	163483	163418	163418	Harry	136	“ Harry , Harry , of course I do , but — ”
163484	163496	163497	163497	Slughorn	184	“ You ’re scared he ’ll find out you helped me ? ”
163505	163514	163501	163501	he	184	“ Be brave like my mother , Professor ... ”
163540	163546	163547	163547	he	184	“ I am not proud ... ”
163553	163577	163547	163547	he	184	“ I am ashamed of what — of what that memory shows ... I think I may have done great damage that day ... ”
163578	163592	163594	163594	Harry	136	“ You ’d cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory , ”
163596	163609	163594	163594	Harry	136	“ It would be a very brave and noble thing to do . ”
163782	163790	163764	163764	He	184	“ Thank you very much , Professor . ”
163791	163798	163800	163801	Professor Slughorn	200	“ You ’re a good boy , ”
163814	163836	163800	163801	Professor Slughorn	200	“ And you ’ve got her eyes ... Just do n’t think too badly of me once you ’ve seen it ... ”
163936	163946	163929	163929	her	393	“ What sort of time do you call this ? ”
163947	163962	164018	164020	the Fat Lady	2014	“ I ’m really sorry — I had to go out for something important — ”
163963	163987	163929	163929	her	393	“ Well , the password changed at midnight , so you ’ll just have to sleep in the corridor , wo n’t you ? ”
163988	163993	163995	163995	Harry	136	“ You ’re joking ! ”
163997	164007	163995	163995	Harry	136	“ Why did it have to change at midnight ? ”
164008	164016	164018	164020	the Fat Lady	2014	“ That ’s the way it is , ”
164022	164046	164018	164020	the Fat Lady	2014	“ If you ’re angry , go and take it up with the headmaster , he ’s the one who ’s tightened security . ”
164047	164050	164052	164052	Harry	136	“ Fantastic , ”
164062	164092	164052	164052	Harry	136	“ Really brilliant . Yeah , I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here , because he ’s the one who wanted me to — ”
164093	164098	164018	164020	the Fat Lady	2014	“ He is here , ”
164105	164116	164018	164020	the Fat Lady	2014	“ Professor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago . ”
164134	164148	164150	164150	Nick	300	“ I had it from the Bloody Baron , who saw him arrive , ”
164152	164175	164150	164150	Nick	300	“ He appeared , according to the Baron , to be in good spirits , though a little tired , of course . ”
164176	164181	164183	164183	Harry	136	“ Where is he ? ”
164189	164209	164183	164183	Harry	136	“ Oh , groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower , it ’s a favorite pastime of his — ”
164210	164218	164150	164150	Nick	300	“ Not the Bloody Baron — Dumbledore ! ”
164219	164226	164228	164228	Nick	300	“ Oh — in his office , ”
164230	164251	164228	164228	Nick	300	“ I believe , from what the Baron said , that he had business to attend to before turning in — ”
164252	164258	164260	164260	Harry	136	“ Yeah , he has , ”
164297	164323	164288	164295	the Fat Lady who was calling after him	3236	“ Come back ! All right , I lied ! I was annoyed you woke me up ! The password ’s still ‘ tapeworm ’ ! ”
164340	164343	164337	164337	he	136	“ toffee éclairs ”
164361	164364	164366	164366	Dumbledore	138	“ Enter , ”
164405	164411	164413	164413	Dumbledore	138	“ Good gracious , Harry , ”
164417	164428	164413	164413	Dumbledore	138	“ To what do I owe this very late pleasure ? ”
164429	164445	164446	164446	Harry	136	“ Sir — I ’ve got it . I ’ve got the memory from Slughorn . ”
164479	164499	164471	164471	his	969	“ Harry , this is spectacular news ! Very well done indeed ! I knew you could do it ! ”
164541	164545	164547	164547	Dumbledore	138	“ And now , ”
164566	164580	164581	164581	Harry	136	“ Now , at last , we shall see . Harry , quickly ... ”
164718	164730	164715	164715	Riddle	345	“ Sir , is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring ? ”
164731	164745	164747	164747	Slughorn	184	“ Tom , Tom , if I knew I could n’t tell you , ”
164763	164791	164792	164792	Riddle	345	“ I must say , I ’d like to know where you get your information , boy , more knowledgeable than half the staff , you are . ”
164805	164848	164849	164852	Several of the boys	2642	“ What with your uncanny ability to know things you should n’t , and your careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for the pineapple , by the way , you ’re quite right , it is my favorite — ”
164856	164889	164849	164852	Several of the boys	2642	“ — I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years . Fifteen , if you keep sending me pineapple , I have excellent contacts at the Ministry . ”
164929	164942	164943	164943	he	345	“ I do n’t know that politics would suit me , sir , ”
164952	164967	164943	164943	he	345	“ I do n’t have the right kind of background , for one thing . ”
165007	165010	165012	165012	Slughorn	184	“ Nonsense , ”
165015	165050	165012	165012	Slughorn	184	“ could n’t be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock , abilities like yours . No , you ’ll go far , Tom , I ’ve never been wrong about a student yet . ”
165070	165116	165066	165066	he	184	“ Good gracious , is it that time already ? You ’d better get going , boys , or we ’ll all be in trouble . Lestrange , I want your essay by tomorrow or it ’s detention . Same goes for you , Avery . ”
165161	165186	165155	165155	Riddle	345	“ Look sharp , Tom , you do n’t want to be caught out of bed out of hours , and you a prefect ... ”
165187	165197	165229	165229	his	184	“ Sir , I wanted to ask you something . ”
165198	165209	165229	165229	his	184	“ Ask away , then , m’boy , ask away ... ”
165210	165223	165224	165224	Slughorn	184	“ Sir , I wondered what you know about ... about Horcruxes ? ”
165241	165253	165229	165229	his	184	“ Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts , is it ? ”
165269	165275	165277	165277	Riddle	345	“ Not exactly , sir , ”
165279	165295	165277	165277	Riddle	345	“ I came across the term while reading and I did n’t fully understand it . ”
165296	165333	165335	165335	Slughorn	184	“ No ... well ... you ’d be hard - pushed to find a book at Hogwarts that ’ll give you details on Horcruxes , Tom , that ’s very Dark stuff , very Dark indeed , ”
165337	165390	165335	165335	Slughorn	184	“ But you obviously know all about them , sir ? I mean , a wizard like you — sorry , I mean , if you ca n’t tell me , obviously — I just knew if anyone could tell me , you could — so I just thought I ’d ask — ”
165465	165468	165470	165470	Slughorn	184	“ Well , ”
165491	165535	165470	165470	Slughorn	184	“ well , it ca n’t hurt to give you an overview , of course . Just so that you understand the term . A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul . ”
165536	165550	165552	165552	Riddle	345	“ I do n’t quite understand how that works , though , sir , ”
165567	165578	165580	165580	Slughorn	184	“ Well , you split your soul , you see , ”
165582	165632	165580	165580	Slughorn	184	“ and hide part of it in an object outside the body . Then , even if one ’s body is attacked or destroyed , one can not die , for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged . But of course , existence in such a form ... ”
165651	165678	165638	165638	Harry	136	“ I was ripped from my body , I was less than spirit , less than the meanest ghost ... but still , I was alive . ”
165679	165698	165707	165707	his	345	“ . . . few would want it , Tom , very few . Death would be preferable . ”

165729	165732	165734	165734	Slughorn	184	“ Well , ”
165737	165765	165734	165734	Slughorn	184	“ you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole . Splitting it is an act of violation , it is against nature . ”
165766	165774	165712	165712	he	345	“ But how do you do it ? ”
165775	165820	165712	165712	he	345	“ By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil . By committing murder . Killing rips the soul apart . The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage : He would encase the torn portion — ”
165821	165828	165734	165734	Slughorn	184	“ Encase ? But how — ? ”
165829	165845	165847	165847	Slughorn	184	“ There is a spell , do not ask me , I do n’t know ! ”
165860	165878	165847	165847	Slughorn	184	“ Do I look as though I have tried it — do I look like a killer ? ”
165879	165888	165890	165890	Riddle	345	“ No , sir , of course not , ”
165893	165905	165890	165890	Riddle	345	“ I ’m sorry ... I did n’t mean to offend ... ”
165906	165918	165920	165920	Slughorn	184	“ Not at all , not at all , not offended , ”
165923	165950	165920	165920	Slughorn	184	“ It ’s natural to feel some curiosity about these things ... Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic ... ”
165951	165956	165958	165958	Riddle	345	“ Yes , sir , ”
165960	166030	165958	165958	Riddle	345	“ What I do n’t understand , though — just out of curiosity — I mean , would one Horcrux be much use ? Can you only split your soul once ? Would n’t it be better , make you stronger , to have your soul in more pieces , I mean , for instance , is n’t seven the most powerfully magical number , would n’t seven — ? ”
166031	166038	166040	166040	Slughorn	184	“ Merlin ’s beard , Tom ! ”
166042	166077	166040	166040	Slughorn	184	“ Seven ! Is n’t it bad enough to think of killing one person ? And in any case ... bad enough to divide the soul ... but to rip it into seven pieces ... ”
166114	166118	166119	166119	he	184	“ Of course , ”
166122	166140	166119	166119	he	184	“ this is all hypothetical , what we ’re discussing , is n’t it ? All academic ... ”
166141	166149	166151	166151	Riddle	345	“ Yes , sir , of course , ”
166154	166212	166151	166151	Riddle	345	“ But all the same , Tom ... keep it quiet , what I ’ve told — that ’s to say , what we ’ve discussed . People would n’t like to think we ’ve been chatting about Horcruxes . It ’s a banned subject at Hogwarts , you know ... Dumbledore ’s particularly fierce about it ... ”
166213	166223	166225	166225	Riddle	345	“ I wo n’t say a word , sir , ”
166284	166290	166292	166292	Dumbledore	138	“ Thank you , Harry , ”
166295	166300	166292	166292	Dumbledore	138	“ Let us go ... ”
166328	166344	166346	166346	Dumbledore	138	“ I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time , ”
166350	166381	166346	166346	Dumbledore	138	“ It confirms the theory on which I have been working , it tells me that I am right , and also how very far there is still to go ... ”
166425	166430	166432	166432	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , Harry , ”
166434	166480	166432	166432	Dumbledore	138	“ I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard . At the same age as you are now , give or take a few months , Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal . ”
166481	166490	166492	166492	Harry	136	“ You think he succeeded then , sir ? ”
166494	166528	166492	166492	Harry	136	“ He made a Horcrux ? And that ’s why he did n’t die when he attacked me ? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere ? A bit of his soul was safe ? ”
166529	166536	166538	166538	Dumbledore	138	“ A bit ... or more , ”
166540	166645	166538	166538	Dumbledore	138	“ You heard Voldemort : What he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux , what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times , rip his soul repeatedly , so as to store it in many , separately concealed Horcruxes . No book would have given him that information . As far as I know — as far , I am sure , as Voldemort knew — no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two . ”
166660	166679	166646	166646	Dumbledore	138	“ Four years ago , I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul . ”
166680	166683	166685	166685	Harry	136	“ Where ? ”
166687	166690	166685	166685	Harry	136	“ How ? ”
166691	166700	166702	166702	Dumbledore	138	“ You handed it to me , Harry , ”
166704	166725	166702	166702	Dumbledore	138	“ The diary , Riddle ’s diary , the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets . ”
166726	166734	166736	166736	Harry	136	“ I do n’t understand , sir , ”
166738	166838	166736	166736	Harry	136	“ Well , although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the diary , what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never witnessed . A mere memory starting to act and think for itself ? A mere memory , sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen ? No , something much more sinister had lived inside that book ... a fragment of soul , I was almost sure of it . The diary had been a Horcrux . But this raised as many questions as it answered . “
166861	166862	166863	166863	I	0	” “
166869	166873	166863	166863	I	0	” said Harry . “
166951	166952	166955	166955	he	345	” “
166966	166970	166971	166971	He	345	” said Harry . “
166992	166993	166983	166983	he	345	” “
166997	167003	166983	166983	he	345	” said Dumbledore , nodding . “
167107	167169	167102	167102	you	0	“ The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me . It suggested that he must have made — or been planning to make — more Horcruxes , so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental . I did not wish to believe it , but nothing else seemed to make sense . “
167326	167327	167329	167329	he	179	” “
167341	167345	167329	167329	he	179	” said Harry . “
167368	167369	167349	167349	he	179	” “
167386	167390	167375	167375	he	179	” said Dumbledore . “
167414	167595	167398	167398	I	0	“ While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life , it must be drunk regularly , for all eternity , if the drinker is to maintain their immortality . Therefore , Voldemort would be entirely dependent on the Elixir , and if it ran out , or was contaminated , or if the Stone was stolen , he would die just like any other man . Voldemort likes to operate alone , remember . I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent , even on the Elixir , intolerable . Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part - life to which he was condemned after attacking you , but only to regain a body . Thereafter , I am convinced , he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes : He would need nothing more , if only he could regain a human form . He was already immortal , you see ... or as close to immortal as any man can be . “
167697	167698	167699	167699	He	179	” “
167704	167728	167699	167699	He	179	” said Harry , horror - struck , while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock and outrage . “
167744	167745	167746	167746	I	0	” “
167759	167764	167751	167751	you	136	” said Dumbledore calmly . “

167858	167866	167897	167897	You	0	” said Harry , a little desperately , “
167875	167876	167877	167877	You	136	” “
167895	167896	167897	167897	You	0	” “
167900	167905	167897	167897	You	0	” said Harry eagerly . “
167909	167924	167897	167897	You	0	” said Dumbledore , and he raised his blackened , burned - looking hand . “
168016	168017	168021	168021	you	136	” “
168025	168026	168021	168021	you	136	” “
168171	168210	168496	168496	Dumbledore	138	“ However , we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily . You destroyed the diary and I the ring , but if we are right in our theory of a seven - part soul , four Horcruxes remain . ”
168211	168218	168220	168220	Harry	136	“ And they could be anything ? ”
168222	168238	168220	168220	Harry	136	“ They could be old tin cans or , I dunno , empty potion bottles ... ”
168239	168348	168496	168496	Dumbledore	138	“ You are thinking of Portkeys , Harry , which must be ordinary objects , easy to overlook . But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul ? You are forgetting what I have showed you . Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies , and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history . His pride , his belief in his own superiority , his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history ; these things suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with some care , favoring objects worthy of the honor . ”
168349	168357	168496	168496	Dumbledore	138	“ The diary was n’t that special . ”
168358	168389	168220	168220	Harry	136	“ The diary , as you have said yourself , was proof that he was the Heir of Slytherin ; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance . ”
168390	168397	168399	168399	Harry	136	“ So , the other Horcruxes ? ”
168401	168413	168399	168399	Harry	136	“ Do you think you know what they are , sir ? ”
168414	168420	168422	168422	Dumbledore	138	“ I can only guess , ”
168424	168475	168422	168422	Dumbledore	138	“ For the reasons I have already given , I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that , in themselves , have a certain grandeur . I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort ’s past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him . ”
168476	168480	168482	168482	Harry	136	“ The locket ! ”
168485	168490	168482	168482	Harry	136	“ Hufflepuff ’s cup ! ”
168491	168494	168496	168496	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , ”
168500	168631	168496	168496	Dumbledore	138	“ I would be prepared to bet — perhaps not my other hand — but a couple of fingers , that they became Horcruxes three and four . The remaining two , assuming again that he created a total of six , are more of a problem , but I will hazard a guess that , having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin , he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw . Four objects from the four founders would , I am sure , have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort ’s imagination . I can not answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw ’s . I am confident , however , that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe . ”
168655	168673	168675	168675	Harry	136	“ Do you think that ’s why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts , sir ? ”
168677	168690	168675	168675	Harry	136	“ To try and find something from one of the other founders ? ”
168691	168696	168698	168698	Dumbledore	138	“ My thoughts precisely , ”
168700	168770	168698	168698	Dumbledore	138	“ But unfortunately , that does not advance us much further , for he was turned away , or so I believe , without the chance to search the school . I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders ’ objects . He definitely had two — he may have found three — that is the best we can do for now . ”
168771	168791	168793	168793	Harry	136	“ Even if he got something of Ravenclaw ’s or of Gryffindor ’s , that leaves a sixth Horcrux , ”
168800	168806	168698	168698	Dumbledore	138	“ Unless he got both ? ”
168807	168814	168816	168816	Dumbledore	138	“ I do n’t think so , ”
168818	168855	168816	168816	Dumbledore	138	“ I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is . I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake , Nagini ? ”
168856	168860	168862	168862	Harry	136	“ The snake ? ”
168866	168874	168862	168862	Harry	136	“ You can use animals as Horcruxes ? ”
168875	168885	168887	168887	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , it is inadvisable to do so , ”
168889	168949	168887	168887	Dumbledore	138	“ because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business . However , if my calculations are correct , Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents ’ house with the intention of killing you . “
169013	169111	169001	169001	he	3290	“ As we know , he failed . After an interval of some years , however , he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man , and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux . She underlines the Slytherin connection , which enhances Lord Voldemort ’s mystique ; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything ; he certainly likes to keep her close , and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her , even for a Parselmouth . ”
169112	169115	169117	169117	Harry	136	“ So , ”
169119	169160	169117	169117	Harry	136	“ the diary ’s gone , the ring ’s gone . The cup , the locket , and the snake are still intact , and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw ’s or Gryffindor ’s ? ”
169161	169171	169173	169173	Dumbledore	138	“ An admirably succinct and accurate summary , yes , ”
169179	169206	169176	169176	his	138	“ So ... are you still looking for them , sir ? Is that where you ’ve been going when you ’ve been leaving the school ? ”
169207	169210	169212	169212	Dumbledore	138	“ Correct , ”
169214	169244	169212	169212	Dumbledore	138	“ I have been looking for a very long time . I think ... perhaps ... I may be close to finding another one . There are hopeful signs . ”
169245	169251	169253	169253	Harry	136	“ And if you do , ”
169256	169269	169253	169253	Harry	136	“ can I come with you and help get rid of it ? ”
169282	169289	169270	169270	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , I think so . ”
169290	169294	169296	169296	Harry	136	“ I can ? ”
169302	169306	169308	169308	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh yes , ”
169313	169322	169308	169308	Dumbledore	138	“ I think you have earned that right . ”
169374	169391	169392	169392	Harry	136	“ Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed , sir ? Can he feel it ? ”
169399	169511	169392	169392	Harry	136	“ A very interesting question , Harry . I believe not . I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil , and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long , he does not feel as we do . Perhaps , at the point of death , he might be aware of his loss ... but he was not aware , for instance , that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy . When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers , I am told that his anger was terrible to behold . ”
169512	169526	169582	169582	he	3295	“ But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts ? ”
169527	169579	169582	169582	he	3295	“ Yes , he did , years ago , when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes , but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemort ’s say - so , and he never received it , for Voldemort vanished shortly after giving him the diary . “
169784	169796	169764	169764	I	0	” Harry sat in thought for a moment , then asked , “
169811	169812	169764	169764	I	0	” “

169971	169991	169967	169967	you	136	” said Dumbledore , who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying . “

170050	170060	170021	170021	Harry	136	” asked Harry , feeling a little let down . “

170151	170172	170121	170121	he	179	” said Dumbledore , sounding impatient now . Pointing at Harry with his black , withered hand , he said , “

170469	170497	170448	170448	he	179	” said Dumbledore , standing up and striding about the room , his glittering robes swooshing in his wake ; Harry had never seen him so agitated . “

170626	170631	170632	170632	He	179	” said Harry indignantly . “

170654	170659	170632	170632	He	179	” said Dumbledore loudly . “
170774	170854	170770	170770	he	179	“ But he knows it now . You have flitted into Lord Voldemort ’s mind without damage to yourself , but he can not possess you without enduring mortal agony , as he discovered in the Ministry . I do not think he understands why , Harry , but then , he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul , he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole . ”
170855	170860	170862	170862	Harry	136	“ But , sir , ”
170872	170896	170862	170862	Harry	136	“ it all comes to the same thing , does n’t it ? I ’ve got to try and kill him , or — ”
170897	170901	170903	170903	Dumbledore	138	“ Got to ? ”
170905	170965	170903	170903	Dumbledore	138	“ Of course you ’ve got to ! But not because of the prophecy ! Because you , yourself , will never rest until you ’ve tried ! We both know it ! Imagine , please , just for a moment , that you had never heard that prophecy ! How would you feel about Voldemort now ? Think ! ”
171026	171033	171035	171035	Harry	136	“ I ’d want him finished , ”
171038	171047	171035	171035	Harry	136	“ And I ’d want to do it . ”
171048	171054	171056	171056	Dumbledore	138	“ Of course you would ! ”
171058	171134	171056	171056	Dumbledore	138	“ You see , the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything ! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal ... In other words , you are free to choose your way , quite free to turn your back on the prophecy ! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy . He will continue to hunt you ... which makes it certain , really , that — ”
171135	171149	171151	171151	Harry	136	“ That one of us is going to end up killing the other , ”
171153	171156	171151	171151	Harry	136	“ Yes . ”
171335	171338	171340	171340	Ron	201	“ Wow , ”
171377	171396	171354	171354	his	201	“ Wow . You ’re actually going to go with Dumbledore ... and try and destroy ... wow . ”
171397	171406	171408	171408	Hermione	180	“ Ron , you ’re making it snow , ”
171464	171468	171470	171470	Ron	201	“ Oh yeah , ”
171481	171494	171495	171495	He	201	“ Sorry ... looks like we ’ve all got horrible dandruff now ... ”
171523	171528	171529	171529	he	201	“ We split up , ”
171540	171575	171529	171529	he	201	“ Last night . When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione . Obviously she could n’t see you , so she thought it had just been the two of us . ”
171576	171579	171581	171581	Harry	136	“ Ah , ”
171583	171597	171581	171581	Harry	136	“ Well — you do n’t mind it ’s over , do you ? ”
171598	171601	171602	171602	Ron	201	“ No , ”
171605	171626	171602	171602	Ron	201	“ It was pretty bad while she was yelling , but at least I did n’t have to finish it . ”
171627	171630	171635	171635	she	180	“ Coward , ”
171639	171661	171635	171635	she	180	“ Well , it was a bad night for romance all around . Ginny and Dean split up too , Harry . ”
171711	171715	171708	171708	he	136	“ How come ? ”
171716	171755	171708	171708	he	136	“ Oh , something really silly ... She said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole , like she could n’t climb in herself ... but they ’ve been a bit rocky for ages . ”
171774	171792	171794	171794	Hermione	180	“ Of course , this puts you in a bit of a dilemma , does n’t it ? ”
171796	171801	171803	171803	Harry	136	“ What d’you mean ? ”
171806	171811	171813	171813	Hermione	180	“ The Quidditch team , ”
171815	171824	171813	171813	Hermione	180	“ If Ginny and Dean are n’t speaking ... ”
171825	171831	171833	171833	Harry	136	“ Oh — oh yeah , ”
171835	171838	171840	171840	Ron	201	“ Flitwick , ”
171897	171904	171906	171907	Professor Flitwick	433	“ Now , now , boys , ”
171910	171927	171906	171907	Professor Flitwick	433	“ A little less talk , a little more action ... Let me see you try ... ”
171959	171965	171967	171968	Professor Flitwick	433	“ Yes ... for homework , ”
171988	171991	171967	171968	Professor Flitwick	433	“ practice . ”
172045	172052	172041	172041	she	180	“ It ’s a nice day . ”
172162	172173	172159	172159	Hermione	180	“ Katie ! You ’re back ! Are you okay ? ”
172193	172199	172200	172200	she	180	“ I ’m really well ! ”
172204	172250	172200	172200	she	180	“ They let me out of St. Mungo ’s on Monday , I had a couple of days at home with Mum and Dad and then came back here this morning . Leanne was just telling me about McLaggen and the last match , Harry ... ”
172251	172254	172256	172256	Harry	136	“ Yeah , ”
172258	172297	172256	172256	Harry	136	“ well , now you ’re back and Ron ’s fit , we ’ll have a decent chance of thrashing Ravenclaw , which means we could still be in the running for the Cup . Listen , Katie ... ”
172340	172357	172319	172319	He	136	“ . . . that necklace ... can you remember who gave it to you now ? ”
172358	172361	172363	172363	Katie	314	“ No , ”
172370	172401	172366	172366	her	314	“ Everyone ’s been asking me , but I have n’t got a clue . The last thing I remember was walking into the ladies ’ in the Three Broomsticks . ”
172402	172412	172414	172414	Hermione	180	“ You definitely went into the bathroom , then ? ”
172416	172427	172429	172429	Katie	314	“ Well , I know I pushed open the door , ”
172431	172489	172490	172490	She	314	“ so I suppose whoever Imperiused me was standing just behind it . After that , my memory ’s a blank until about two weeks ago in St. Mungo ’s . Listen , I ’d better go , I would n’t put it past McGonagall to give me lines even if it is my first day back ... ”
172525	172542	172544	172544	Hermione	180	“ So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace , ”
172546	172555	172544	172544	Hermione	180	“ to be in the ladies ’ bathroom . ”
172556	172568	172570	172570	Harry	136	“ Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman , ”
172572	172596	172570	172570	Harry	136	“ Do n’t forget , there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts . We know some of it got stolen ... ”
172619	172632	172634	172634	Harry	136	“ I think I ’m going to take another swig of Felix , ”
172636	172648	172634	172634	Harry	136	“ and have a go at the Room of Requirement again . ”
172649	172659	172661	172661	Hermione	180	“ That would be a complete waste of potion , ”
172681	172759	172760	172760	She	180	“ Luck can only get you so far , Harry . The situation with Slughorn was different ; you always had the ability to persuade him , you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit . Luck is n’t enough to get you through a powerful enchantment , though . Do n’t go wasting the rest of that potion ! You ’ll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him ... ”
172768	172776	172777	172777	Ron	201	“ Could n’t we make some more ? ”
172784	172803	172777	172777	Ron	201	“ It ’d be great to have a stock of it ... Have a look in the book ... ”
172823	172831	172832	172832	he	136	“ Blimey , it ’s seriously complicated , ”
172844	172859	172832	172832	he	136	“ And it takes six months ... You ’ve got to let it stew ... ”
172860	172863	172865	172865	Ron	201	“ Typical , ”
172898	172902	172904	172904	he	136	“ For Enemies , ”
173436	173440	173432	173432	Hermione	180	“ tweaking the circumstances ”
174177	174181	174184	174184	Myrtle	229	“ Do n’t , ”
174193	174208	174184	174184	Myrtle	229	“ Do n’t ... tell me what ’s wrong ... I can help you ... ”
174209	174216	174218	174218	Malfoy	159	“ No one can help me , ”
174226	174256	174220	174220	His	159	“ I ca n’t do it ... I ca n’t ... It wo n’t work ... and unless I do it soon ... he says he ’ll kill me ... ”
174380	174388	174369	174369	Malfoy	159	“ No ! No ! Stop it ! ”
174402	174407	174393	174393	her	229	“ Stop ! STOP ! ”
174463	174466	174455	174455	Malfoy	159	“ Cruci — ”
174467	174470	174472	174472	Harry	136	“ SECTUMSEMPRA ! ”
174524	174527	174529	174529	Harry	136	“ No — ”
174563	174570	174576	174576	he	136	“ No — I did n’t — ”
174608	174618	174600	174601	Moaning Myrtle	229	“ MURDER ! MURDER IN THE BATHROOM ! MURDER ! ”
174762	174792	174793	174793	He	205	“ You need the hospital wing . There may be a certain amount of scarring , but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that ... Come ... ”
174813	174825	174793	174793	He	205	“ And you , Potter ... You wait here for me . ”
174910	174913	174914	174914	he	205	“ Go , ”
174936	174945	174947	174947	Harry	136	“ I did n’t mean it to happen , ”
174961	174971	174951	174951	His	136	“ I did n’t know what that spell did . ”
174977	174985	174986	174986	he	205	“ Apparently I underestimated you , Potter , ”
174990	175007	174986	174986	he	205	“ Who would have thought you knew such Dark Magic ? Who taught you that spell ? ”
175008	175016	174951	174951	His	136	“ I — read about it somewhere . ”
175017	175020	174986	174986	he	205	“ Where ? ”
175021	175029	175030	175030	Harry	136	“ It was — a library book , ”
175034	175044	175030	175030	Harry	136	“ I ca n’t remember what it was call — ”
175045	175048	175050	175050	Snape	205	“ Liar , ”
175161	175167	175169	175169	Snape	205	“ Bring me your schoolbag , ”
175172	175191	175169	175169	Snape	205	“ and all of your schoolbooks . All of them . Bring them to me here . Now ! ”
175357	175373	175374	175374	Ron	201	“ Where ’ve you — ? Why are you soaking — ? Is that blood ? ”
175392	175398	175399	175399	Harry	136	“ I need your book , ”
175402	175414	175399	175399	Harry	136	“ Your Potions book . Quick ... give it to me ... ”
175415	175424	175399	175399	Harry	136	“ But what about the Half - Blood — ”
175425	175431	175432	175432	Ron	201	“ I ’ll explain later ! ”
176154	176170	176146	176146	he	205	“ This is your copy of Advanced Potion - Making , is it , Potter ? ”
176171	176174	176176	176176	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
176182	176195	176176	176176	Harry	136	“ You ’re quite sure of that , are you , Potter ? ”
176196	176199	176201	176201	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
176209	176227	176201	176201	Harry	136	“ This is the copy of Advanced Potion - Making that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts ? ”
176228	176231	176233	176233	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
176236	176240	176242	176242	Snape	205	“ Then why , ”
176244	176260	176242	176242	Snape	205	“ does it have the name ‘ Roonil Wazlib ’ written inside the front cover ? ”
176268	176274	176275	176275	he	136	“ That ’s my nickname , ”
176278	176282	176284	176284	Snape	205	“ Your nickname , ”
176286	176297	176299	176299	Harry	136	“ Yeah ... that ’s what my friends call me , ”
176301	176309	176311	176311	Snape	205	“ I understand what a nickname is , ”
176353	176363	176365	176365	Snape	205	“ Do you know what I think , Potter ? ”
176370	176403	176365	176365	Snape	205	“ I think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of term . What do you think , Potter ? ”
176404	176414	176416	176416	Harry	136	“ I — I do n’t agree , sir , ”
176427	176440	176442	176442	Snape	205	“ Well , we shall see how you feel after your detentions , ”
176444	176455	176442	176442	Snape	205	“ Ten o’clock Saturday morning , Potter . My office . ”
176456	176460	176462	176462	Harry	136	“ But sir ... ”
176468	176477	176462	176462	Harry	136	“ Quidditch ... the last match of the ... ”
176478	176482	176484	176484	Snape	205	“ Ten o’clock , ”
176495	176507	176509	176509	he	205	“ Poor Gryffindor ... fourth place this year , I fear ... ”
176542	176554	176556	176556	Hermione	180	“ I wo n’t say ‘ I told you so , ’ ”
176566	176572	176574	176574	Ron	201	“ Leave it , Hermione , ”
176735	176748	176756	176756	herself	180	“ I told you there was something wrong with that Prince person , ”
176758	176768	176756	176756	herself	180	“ And I was right , was n’t I ? ”
176769	176779	176781	176781	Harry	136	“ No , I do n’t think you were , ”
176908	176911	176913	176913	Hermione	180	“ Harry , ”
176915	176929	176913	176913	Hermione	180	“ how can you still stick up for that book when that spell — ”
176930	176940	176942	176942	Harry	136	“ Will you stop harping on about the book ! ”
176944	176983	176942	176942	Harry	136	“ The Prince only copied it out ! It ’s not like he was advising anyone to use it ! For all we know , he was making a note of something that had been used against him ! ”
176984	176991	176993	176993	Hermione	180	“ I do n’t believe this , ”
176995	177001	176993	176993	Hermione	180	“ You ’re actually defending — ”
177002	177011	177013	177013	Harry	136	“ I ’m not defending what I did ! ”
177016	177094	177013	177013	Harry	136	“ I wish I had n’t done it , and not just because I ’ve got about a dozen detentions . You know I would n’t ’ve used a spell like that , not even on Malfoy , but you ca n’t blame the Prince , he had n’t written ‘ try this out , it ’s really good ’ — he was just making notes for himself , was n’t he , not for anyone else ... ”
177095	177101	177103	177103	Hermione	180	“ Are you telling me , ”
177105	177115	177103	177103	Hermione	180	“ that you ’re going to go back — ? ”
177116	177127	177129	177129	Harry	136	“ And get the book ? Yeah , I am , ”
177132	177164	177129	177129	Harry	136	“ Listen , without the Prince I ’d never have won the Felix Felicis . I ’d never have known how to save Ron from poisoning , I ’d never have — ”
177165	177178	177180	177180	Hermione	180	“ — got a reputation for Potions brilliance you do n’t deserve , ”
177183	177191	177193	177193	Ginny	222	“ Give it a rest , Hermione ! ”
177208	177236	177204	177204	he	136	“ By the sound of it , Malfoy was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse , you should be glad Harry had something good up his sleeve ! ”
177237	177250	177252	177252	Hermione	180	“ Well , of course I ’m glad Harry was n’t cursed ! ”
177257	177295	177252	177252	Hermione	180	“ But you ca n’t call that Sectumsempra spell good , Ginny , look where it ’s landed him ! And I ’d have thought , seeing what this has done to your chances in the match — ”
177296	177309	177311	177311	Ginny	222	“ Oh , do n’t start acting as though you understand Quidditch , ”
177313	177320	177311	177311	Ginny	222	“ you ’ll only embarrass yourself . ”
177560	177565	177567	177567	Snape	205	“ Ah , Potter , ”
177652	177667	177669	177669	Snape	205	“ Mr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files , ”
177672	177736	177669	177669	Snape	205	“ They are the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments . Where the ink has grown faint , or the cards have suffered damage from mice , we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and , making sure that they are in alphabetical order , replace them in the boxes . You will not use magic . ”
177737	177742	177744	177744	Harry	136	“ Right , Professor , ”
177760	177767	177769	177769	Snape	205	“ I thought you could start , ”
177778	177815	177769	177769	Snape	205	“ with boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and fifty - six . You will find some familiar names in there , which should add interest to the task . Here , you see ... ”
177833	177861	177862	177862	Snape	205	“ ‘ James Potter and Sirius Black . Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey . Aubrey ’s head twice normal size . Double detention . ’ ”
177865	177889	177862	177862	Snape	205	“ It must be such a comfort to think that , though they are gone , a record of their great achievements remains ... ”
178112	178119	178120	178120	he	205	“ I think that will do , ”
178124	178141	178120	178120	he	205	“ Mark the place you have reached . You will continue at ten o’clock next Saturday . ”
178142	178147	178148	178148	Harry	136	“ Yes , sir . ”
178234	178238	178239	178239	he	136	“ Quid agis ? ”
178262	178267	178259	178259	she	2014	“ You ’ll see . ”
178305	178309	178311	178311	Ron	201	“ We won ! ”
178324	178341	178342	178342	Harry	136	“ We won ! Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty ! We won ! ”
178672	178684	178689	178689	she	222	“ You ’d think people had better things to gossip about , ”
178708	178738	178739	178739	Ron	201	“ Three dementor attacks in a week , and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it ’s true you ’ve got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest . ”
178751	178758	178747	178747	Harry	136	“ What did you tell her ? ”
178759	178769	178771	178771	Ginny	222	“ I told her it ’s a Hungarian Horntail , ”
178781	178786	178771	178771	Ginny	222	“ Much more macho . ”
178787	178790	178792	178792	Harry	136	“ Thanks , ”
178796	178807	178792	178792	Harry	136	“ And what did you tell her Ron ’s got ? ”
178808	178820	178821	178821	Ron	201	“ A Pygmy Puff , but I did n’t say where . ”
178829	178833	178834	178834	he	201	“ Watch it , ”
178844	178861	178834	178834	he	201	“ Just because I ’ve given my permission does n’t mean I ca n’t withdraw it — ”
178862	178868	178870	178870	Ginny	222	“ ‘ Your permission , ’ ”
178872	178900	178870	178870	Ginny	222	“ Since when did you give me permission to do anything ? Anyway , you said yourself you ’d rather it was Harry than Michael or Dean . ”
178901	178907	178909	178909	Ron	201	“ Yeah , I would , ”
178912	178928	178909	178909	Ron	201	“ And just as long as you do n’t start snogging each other in public — ”
178929	178952	178954	178954	Ginny	222	“ You filthy hypocrite ! What about you and Lavender , thrashing around like a pair of eels all over the place ? ”
179070	179080	179067	179067	her	180	“ I want to talk to you , Harry . ”
179081	179085	179087	179087	Harry	136	“ What about ? ”
179114	179124	179095	179095	Hermione	180	“ The so - called Half - Blood Prince . ”
179125	179131	179132	179132	he	136	“ Oh , not again , ”
179135	179142	179132	179132	he	136	“ Will you please drop it ? ”
179223	179230	179232	179232	Hermione	180	“ I ’m not dropping it , ”
179235	179265	179232	179232	Hermione	180	“ until you ’ve heard me out . Now , I ’ve been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing Dark spells — ”
179266	179276	179324	179324	she	180	“ He did n’t make a hobby of it — ”
179277	179289	179324	179324	she	180	“ He , he — who says it ’s a he ? ”
179290	179297	179299	179299	Harry	136	“ We ’ve been through this , ”
179302	179309	179299	179299	Harry	136	“ Prince , Hermione , Prince ! ”
179310	179313	179321	179321	her	180	“ Right ! ”
179348	179358	179324	179324	she	180	“ Look at that ! Look at the picture ! ”
179435	179438	179440	179440	Harry	136	“ So ? ”
179463	179474	179475	179475	They	3478	“ Her name was Eileen Prince . Prince , Harry . ”
179496	179500	179491	179491	He	136	“ No way . ”
179501	179504	179485	179485	Hermione	180	“ What ? ”
179505	179521	179485	179485	Hermione	180	“ You think she was the Half - Blood ... ? Oh , come on . ”
179522	179607	179491	179491	He	136	“ Well , why not ? Harry , there are n’t any real princes in the Wizarding world ! It ’s either a nickname , a made - up title somebody ’s given themselves , or it could be their actual name , could n’t it ? No , listen ! If , say , her father was a wizard whose surname was Prince , and her mother was a Muggle , then that would make her a ‘ half - blood Prince ’ ! ”
179608	179616	179485	179485	Hermione	180	“ Yeah , very ingenious , Hermione ... ”
179617	179632	179485	179485	Hermione	180	“ But it would ! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince ! ”
179633	179652	179491	179491	He	136	“ Listen , Hermione , I can tell it ’s not a girl . I can just tell . ”
179653	179670	179672	179672	Hermione	180	“ The truth is that you do n’t think a girl would have been clever enough , ”
179675	179694	179696	179696	Harry	136	“ How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever ? ”
179702	179741	179696	179696	Harry	136	“ It ’s the way he writes , I just know the Prince was a bloke , I can tell . This girl has n’t got anything to do with it . Where did you get this anyway ? ”
179742	179746	179748	179748	Hermione	180	“ The library , ”
179751	179779	179748	179748	Hermione	180	“ There ’s a whole collection of old Prophets up there . Well , I ’m going to find out more about Eileen Prince if I can . ”
179780	179784	179786	179786	Harry	136	“ Enjoy yourself , ”
179789	179793	179795	179795	Hermione	180	“ I will , ”
179797	179806	179807	179807	she	180	“ And the first place I ’ll look , ”
179819	179827	179828	179828	Harry	136	“ is records of old Potions awards ! ”
179845	179858	179860	179860	Ron	201	“ She ’s just never got over you outperforming her in Potions , ”
179874	179891	179860	179860	Ron	201	“ You do n’t think I ’m mad , wanting that book back , do you ? ”
179892	179897	179899	179899	Ron	201	“ ’ Course not , ”
179902	179918	179919	179919	He	201	“ He was a genius , the Prince . Anyway ... without his bezoar tip ... ”
179929	179958	179919	179919	He	201	“ I would n’t be here to discuss it , would I ? I mean , I ’m not saying that spell you used on Malfoy was great — ”
179959	179964	179966	179966	Harry	136	“ Nor am I , ”
179969	179988	179966	179966	Harry	136	“ But he healed all right , did n’t he ? Back on his feet in no time . ”
179989	179992	179994	179994	Harry	136	“ Yeah , ”
180010	180015	179994	179994	Harry	136	“ Thanks to Snape ... ”
180016	180026	180027	180027	Ron	201	“ You still got detention with Snape this Saturday ? ”
180030	180045	180047	180047	Harry	136	“ Yeah , and the Saturday after that , and the Saturday after that , ”
180049	180078	180047	180047	Harry	136	“ And he ’s hinting now that if I do n’t get all the boxes done by the end of term , we ’ll carry on next year . ”
180172	180184	180186	180186	Harry	136	“ Thanks , Jimmy ... Hey , it ’s from Dumbledore ! ”
180196	180211	180186	180186	Harry	136	“ He wants me to go to his office as quick as I can ! ”
180218	180221	180223	180223	Ron	201	“ Blimey , ”
180225	180237	180223	180223	Ron	201	“ You do n’t reckon ... he has n’t found ... ? ”
180238	180248	180250	180250	Harry	136	“ Better go and see , had n’t I ? ”
180359	180368	180351	180351	He	136	“ How — dare — you — aaaaargh ! ”
180423	180426	180427	180427	Harry	136	“ Professor — ”
180468	180474	180450	180450	She	301	“ What happened , Professor ? ”
180475	180481	180482	180482	she	301	“ You may well ask ! ”
180486	180503	180482	180482	she	301	“ I was strolling along , brooding upon certain dark portents I happen to have glimpsed ... ”
180547	180561	180450	180450	She	301	“ Professor , were you trying to get into the Room of Requirement ? ”
180562	180574	180575	180575	She	301	“ . . . omens I have been vouchsafed — what ? ”
180580	180586	180588	180588	Harry	136	“ The Room of Requirement , ”
180590	180599	180588	180588	Harry	136	“ Were you trying to get in there ? ”
180600	180613	180450	180450	She	301	“ I — well — I did n’t know students knew about — ”
180614	180621	180623	180623	Harry	136	“ Not all of them do , ”
180625	180641	180623	180623	Harry	136	“ But what happened ? You screamed ... It sounded as though you were hurt ... ”
180642	180647	180653	180653	her	301	“ I — well , ”
180669	180687	180664	180664	her	301	“ I wished to — ah — deposit certain — um — personal items in the room ... ”
180693	180697	180689	180689	she	301	“ nasty accusations . ”
180698	180701	180703	180703	Harry	136	“ Right , ”
180712	180723	180703	180703	Harry	136	“ But you could n’t get in and hide them ? ”
180754	180763	180765	180766	Professor Trelawney	301	“ Oh , I got in all right , ”
180773	180782	180765	180766	Professor Trelawney	301	“ But there was somebody already in there . ”
180783	180790	180792	180792	Harry	136	“ Somebody in — ? Who ? ”
180794	180800	180765	180766	Professor Trelawney	301	“ Who was in there ? ”
180801	180807	180809	180810	Professor Trelawney	301	“ I have no idea , ”
180824	180856	180809	180810	Professor Trelawney	301	“ I walked into the room and I heard a voice , which has never happened before in all my years of hiding — of using the room , I mean . ”
180857	180864	180765	180766	Professor Trelawney	301	“ A voice ? Saying what ? ”
180865	180876	180878	180879	Professor Trelawney	301	“ I do n’t know that it was saying anything , ”
180881	180887	180878	180879	Professor Trelawney	301	“ It was ... whooping . ”
180888	180891	180765	180766	Professor Trelawney	301	“ Whooping ? ”
180892	180895	180896	180896	she	301	“ Gleefully , ”
180906	180913	180901	180901	Harry	136	“ Was it male or female ? ”
180914	180923	180925	180926	Professor Trelawney	301	“ I would hazard a guess at male , ”
180928	180934	180925	180926	Professor Trelawney	301	“ And it sounded happy ? ”
180935	180939	180941	180942	Professor Trelawney	301	“ Very happy , ”
180945	180952	180941	180942	Professor Trelawney	301	“ As though it was celebrating ? ”
180953	180957	180901	180901	Harry	136	“ Most definitely . ”
180958	180963	180925	180926	Professor Trelawney	301	“ And then — ? ”
180964	180976	180941	180942	Professor Trelawney	301	“ And then I called out ‘ Who ’s there ? ’ ”
180977	180990	180991	180991	Harry	136	“ You could n’t have found out who it was without asking ? ”
180998	181003	181005	181006	Professor Trelawney	301	“ The Inner Eye , ”
181020	181034	181005	181006	Professor Trelawney	301	“ was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices . ”
181035	181038	181040	181040	Harry	136	“ Right , ”
181057	181067	181047	181048	Professor Trelawney	301	“ And did the voice say who was there ? ”
181068	181075	181076	181076	she	301	“ No , it did not , ”
181079	181102	181076	181076	she	301	“ Everything went pitch - black and the next thing I knew , I was being hurled headfirst out of the room ! ”
181103	181112	181114	181114	Harry	136	“ And you did n’t see that coming ? ”
181121	181136	181137	181137	She	301	“ No , I did not , as I say , it was pitch — ”
181145	181155	181157	181157	Harry	136	“ I think you ’d better tell Professor Dumbledore , ”
181159	181180	181157	181157	Harry	136	“ He ought to know Malfoy ’s celebrating — I mean , that someone threw you out of the room . ”
181197	181211	181212	181212	she	301	“ The headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me , ”
181216	181244	181212	181212	she	301	“ I am not one to press my company upon those who do not value it . If Dumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards show — ”
181255	181268	181270	181270	she	301	“ Again and again , no matter how I lay them out — ”
181280	181288	181289	181289	she	301	“ — the lightning - struck tower , ”
181292	181303	181289	181289	she	301	“ Calamity . Disaster . Coming nearer all the time ... ”
181304	181307	181309	181309	Harry	136	“ Right , ”
181312	181338	181309	181309	Harry	136	“ Well ... I still think you should tell Dumbledore about this voice , and everything going dark and being thrown out of the room ... ”
181339	181344	181345	181346	Professor Trelawney	301	“ You think so ? ”
181371	181381	181383	181383	Harry	136	“ I ’m going to see him right now , ”
181385	181399	181383	181383	Harry	136	“ I ’ve got a meeting with him . We could go together . ”
181400	181409	181411	181412	Professor Trelawney	301	“ Oh , well , in that case , ”
181446	181457	181458	181458	she	301	“ I miss having you in my classes , Harry , ”
181467	181483	181458	181458	she	301	“ You were never much of a Seer ... but you were a wonderful Object ... ”
181504	181509	181510	181510	she	301	“ I am afraid , ”
181514	181567	181510	181510	she	301	“ that the nag — I ’m sorry , the centaur — knows nothing of cartomancy . I asked him — one Seer to another — had he not , too , sensed the distant vibrations of coming catastrophe ? But he seemed to find me almost comical . Yes , comical ! ”
181591	181665	181666	181666	Harry	136	“ Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited my great - great - grandmother ’s gift . Those rumors have been bandied about by the jealous for years . You know what I say to such people , Harry ? Would Dumbledore have let me teach at this great school , put so much trust in me all these years , had I not proved myself to him ? ”
181671	181681	181684	181685	Professor Trelawney	301	“ I well remember my first interview with Dumbledore , ”
181691	181788	181684	181685	Professor Trelawney	301	“ He was deeply impressed , of course , deeply impressed ... I was staying at the Hog ’s Head , which I do not advise , incidentally — bedbugs , dear boy — but funds were low . Dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room . He questioned me ... I must confess that , at first , I thought he seemed ill - disposed toward Divination ... and I remember I was starting to feel a little odd , I had not eaten much that day ... but then ... ”
181832	181846	181809	181810	Professor Trelawney	301	“ . . . but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus Snape ! ”
181847	181850	181809	181810	Professor Trelawney	301	“ What ? ”
181851	181998	181999	181999	She	3493	“ Yes , there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open , and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with Snape , who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs , although I ’m afraid that I myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with Dumbledore — you see , he himself was seeking a job at the time , and no doubt hoped to pick up tips ! Well , after that , you know , Dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give me a job , and I could not help thinking , Harry , that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent , compared to the pushing , thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes — Harry , dear ? ”
182032	182035	182036	182036	she	3493	“ Harry ? ”
182135	182138	182140	182141	Professor Trelawney	301	“ Harry ? ”
182144	182158	182140	182141	Professor Trelawney	301	“ Harry — I thought we were going to see the headmaster together ? ”
182159	182164	182166	182166	Harry	136	“ You stay here , ”
182171	182190	182166	182166	Harry	136	“ But dear ... I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the Room of — ”
182191	182196	182197	182197	Harry	136	“ You stay here ! ”
182263	182265	182258	182260	the calm voice	3502	“ Enter ”
182319	182333	182297	182297	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , Harry , I promised that you could come with me . ”
182367	182374	182348	182348	Trelawney	301	“ Come ... with you ... ? ”
182375	182385	182297	182297	Dumbledore	138	“ Only if you wish it , of course . ”
182386	182390	182396	182396	he	136	“ If I ... ”
182411	182423	182396	182396	he	136	“ You ’ve found one ? You ’ve found a Horcrux ? ”
182424	182429	182297	182297	Dumbledore	138	“ I believe so . ”
182447	182455	182457	182457	Dumbledore	138	“ It is natural to be afraid , ”
182459	182465	182467	182467	Harry	136	“ I ’m not scared ! ”
182488	182498	182467	182467	Harry	136	“ Which Horcrux is it ? Where is it ? ”
182499	182571	182457	182457	Dumbledore	138	“ I am not sure which it is — though I think we can rule out the snake — but I believe it to be hidden in a cave on the coast many miles from here , a cave I have been trying to locate for a very long time : the cave in which Tom Riddle once terrorized two children from his orphanage on their annual trip ; you remember ? ”
182572	182575	182577	182577	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
182579	182585	182577	182577	Harry	136	“ How is it protected ? ”
182586	182601	182602	182602	Dumbledore	138	“ I do not know ; I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong . ”
182608	182647	182602	182602	Dumbledore	138	“ Harry , I promised you that you could come with me , and I stand by that promise , but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous . ”
182648	182653	182655	182655	Harry	136	“ I ’m coming , ”
182718	182725	182697	182697	Dumbledore	138	“ What has happened to you ? ”
182726	182729	182731	182731	Harry	136	“ Nothing , ”
182734	182740	182731	182731	Harry	136	“ What has upset you ? ”
182741	182747	182697	182697	Dumbledore	138	“ I ’m not upset . ”
182748	182758	182731	182731	Harry	136	“ Harry , you were never a good Occlumens — ”
182770	182773	182774	182774	he	136	“ Snape ! ”
182789	182817	182781	182781	Fawkes	332	“ Snape ’s what ’s happened ! He told Voldemort about the prophecy , it was him , he listened outside the door , Trelawney told me ! ”
182850	182859	182860	182860	he	138	“ When did you find out about this ? ”
182865	182869	182871	182871	Harry	136	“ Just now ! ”
182893	182912	182887	182887	he	136	“ AND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDEMORT TO GO AFTER MY MUM AND DAD ! ”
183020	183023	183025	183025	Dumbledore	138	“ Harry , ”
183028	183034	183025	183025	Dumbledore	138	“ Please listen to me . ”
183065	183072	183060	183060	Dumbledore	138	“ Professor Snape made a terrible — ”
183073	183092	183100	183100	Dumbledore	138	“ Do n’t tell me it was a mistake , sir , he was listening at the door ! ”
183093	183099	183100	183100	Dumbledore	138	“ Please let me finish . ”
183112	183212	183213	183213	Harry	136	“ Professor Snape made a terrible mistake . He was still in Lord Voldemort ’s employ on the night he heard the first half of Professor Trelawney ’s prophecy . Naturally , he hastened to tell his master what he had heard , for it concerned his master most deeply . But he did not know — he had no possible way of knowing — which boy Voldemort would hunt from then onward , or that the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest were people that Professor Snape knew , that they were your mother and father — ”
183222	183250	183213	183213	Harry	136	“ He hated my dad like he hated Sirius ! Have n’t you noticed , Professor , how the people Snape hates tend to end up dead ? ”
183251	183293	183380	183380	he	138	“ You have no idea of the remorse Professor Snape felt when he realized how Lord Voldemort had interpreted the prophecy , Harry . I believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he returned — ”
183294	183309	183311	183311	Harry	136	“ But he ’s a very good Occlumens , is n’t he , sir ? ”
183325	183354	183311	183311	Harry	136	“ And is n’t Voldemort convinced that Snape ’s on his side , even now ? Professor ... how can you be sure Snape ’s on our side ? ”
183383	183394	183380	183380	he	138	“ I am sure . I trust Severus Snape completely . ”
183414	183421	183422	183422	he	138	“ Well , I do n’t ! ”
183430	183451	183422	183422	he	138	“ He ’s up to something with Draco Malfoy right now , right under your nose , and you still — ”
183452	183460	183462	183462	Dumbledore	138	“ We have discussed this , Harry , ”
183471	183479	183466	183466	he	138	“ I have told you my views . ”
183480	183505	183422	183422	he	138	“ You ’re leaving the school tonight , and I ’ll bet you have n’t even considered that Snape and Malfoy might decide to — ”
183506	183510	183512	183512	Dumbledore	138	“ To what ? ”
183518	183531	183514	183514	his	138	“ What is it that you suspect them of doing , precisely ? ”
183532	183541	183543	183543	Harry	136	“ I ... they ’re up to something ! ”
183556	183615	183543	183543	Harry	136	“ Professor Trelawney was just in the Room of Requirement , trying to hide her sherry bottles , and she heard Malfoy whooping , celebrating ! He ’s trying to mend something dangerous in there and if you ask me , he ’s fixed it at last and you ’re about to just walk out of school without — ”
183616	183619	183621	183621	Dumbledore	138	“ Enough , ”
183648	183703	183640	183640	he	136	“ Do you think that I have once left the school unprotected during my absences this year ? I have not . Tonight , when I leave , there will again be additional protection in place . Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously , Harry . ”
183704	183709	183711	183711	Harry	136	“ I did n’t — ”
183723	183735	183718	183718	Dumbledore	138	“ I do not wish to discuss the matter any further . ”
183765	183775	183761	183761	Dumbledore	138	“ Do you wish to come with me tonight ? ”
183776	183779	183781	183781	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
183785	183793	183781	183781	Harry	136	“ Very well , then : Listen . ”
183803	183829	183796	183796	himself	138	“ I take you with me on one condition : that you obey any command I might give you at once , and without question . ”
183830	183834	183761	183761	Dumbledore	138	“ Of course . ”
183835	183874	183761	183761	Dumbledore	138	“ Be sure to understand me , Harry . I mean that you must follow even such orders as ‘ run , ’ ‘ hide , ’ or ‘ go back . ’ Do I have your word ? ”
183875	183883	183796	183796	himself	138	“ I — yes , of course . ”
183884	183897	183761	183761	Dumbledore	138	“ If I tell you to hide , you will do so ? ”
183898	183901	183761	183761	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes . ”
183902	183914	183796	183796	himself	138	“ If I tell you to flee , you will obey ? ”
183915	183918	183761	183761	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes . ”
183919	183939	183761	183761	Dumbledore	138	“ If I tell you to leave me and save yourself , you will do as I tell you ? ”
183940	183943	183761	183761	Dumbledore	138	“ I — ”
183944	183947	183761	183761	Dumbledore	138	“ Harry ? ”
183957	183962	183948	183948	They	3510	“ Yes , sir . ”
183963	183991	183992	183992	Dumbledore	138	“ Very good . Then I wish you to go and fetch your Invisibility Cloak and meet me in the entrance hall in five minutes ’ time . ”
184058	184064	184065	184065	Hermione	180	“ What does he want ? ”
184070	184077	184078	184078	she	180	“ Harry , are you okay ? ”
184082	184087	184089	184089	Harry	136	“ I ’m fine , ”
184154	184162	184163	184163	Harry	136	“ I ’ve got to be quick , ”
184166	184178	184180	184180	he	136	“ Dumbledore thinks I ’m getting my Invisibility Cloak . Listen ... ”
184219	184230	184231	184231	Harry	136	“ . . . so you see what this means ? ”
184237	184267	184268	184268	he	136	“ Dumbledore wo n’t be here tonight , so Malfoy ’s going to have another clear shot at whatever he ’s up to . No , listen to me ! ”
184283	184298	184299	184299	He	136	“ I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Requirement . Here — ”
184310	184398	184299	184299	He	136	“ You ’ve got to watch him and you ’ve got to watch Snape too . Use anyone else who you can rustle up from the D.A. , Hermione , those contact Galleons will still work , right ? Dumbledore says he ’s put extra protection in the school , but if Snape ’s involved , he ’ll know what Dumbledore ’s protection is , and how to avoid it — but he wo n’t be expecting you lot to be on the watch , will he ? ”
184399	184402	184406	184406	her	180	“ Harry — ”
184412	184421	184423	184423	Harry	136	“ I have n’t got time to argue , ”
184426	184432	184433	184433	He	136	“ Take this as well — ”
184442	184445	184447	184447	Ron	201	“ Thanks , ”
184449	184458	184447	184447	Ron	201	“ Er — why do I need socks ? ”
184459	184500	184506	184506	Hermione	180	“ You need what ’s wrapped in them , it ’s the Felix Felicis . Share it between yourselves and Ginny too . Say good - bye to her for me . I ’d better go , Dumbledore ’s waiting — ”
184501	184504	184506	184506	Hermione	180	“ No ! ”
184522	184543	184509	184509	Ron	201	“ We do n’t want it , you take it , who knows what you ’re going to be facing ? ”
184544	184556	184558	184558	Harry	136	“ I ’ll be fine , I ’ll be with Dumbledore , ”
184560	184584	184558	184558	Harry	136	“ I want to know you lot are okay ... Do n’t look like that , Hermione , I ’ll see you later ... ”
184634	184646	184648	184648	Dumbledore	138	“ I would like you to wear your Cloak , please , ”
184662	184670	184654	184654	Harry	136	“ Very good . Shall we go ? ”
184710	184724	184725	184725	Harry	136	“ But what will people think when they see you leaving , Professor ? ”
184735	184746	184748	184748	Dumbledore	138	“ That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink , ”
184751	184787	184748	184748	Dumbledore	138	“ I sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom , or else visit the Hog ’s Head ... or I appear to . It is as good a way as any of disguising one ’s true destination . ”
184837	184840	184842	184842	Harry	136	“ Professor , ”
184858	184864	184842	184842	Harry	136	“ will we be Apparating ? ”
184865	184868	184870	184870	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , ”
184872	184881	184870	184870	Dumbledore	138	“ You can Apparate now , I believe ? ”
184882	184885	184887	184887	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
184889	184898	184887	184887	Harry	136	“ but I have n’t got a license . ”
184926	184930	184932	184932	Dumbledore	138	“ No matter , ”
184934	184941	184932	184932	Dumbledore	138	“ I can assist you again . ”
184997	185003	185005	185006	Madam Rosmerta	171	“ — and stay out ! ”
185016	185028	185005	185006	Madam Rosmerta	171	“ Oh , hello , Albus ... You ’re out late ... ”
185029	185062	185119	185119	Dumbledore	138	“ Good evening , Rosmerta , good evening ... forgive me , I ’m off to the Hog ’s Head ... No offense , but I feel like a quieter atmosphere tonight ... ”
185106	185117	185119	185119	Dumbledore	138	“ It will not be necessary for us to enter , ”
185124	185170	185119	185119	Dumbledore	138	“ As long as nobody sees us go ... now place your hand upon my arm , Harry . There is no need to grip too hard , I am merely guiding you . On the count of three ... One ... two ... three ... ”
185375	185381	185383	185383	Dumbledore	138	“ What do you think ? ”
185404	185414	185416	185416	Harry	136	“ They brought the kids from the orphanage here ? ”
185431	185437	185439	185439	Dumbledore	138	“ Not here , precisely , ”
185441	185569	185439	185439	Dumbledore	138	“ There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us . I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves . No , I think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot . No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers , and boats can not approach the cliffs , the waters around them are too dangerous . I imagine that Riddle climbed down ; magic would have served better than ropes . And he brought two small children with him , probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them . I think the journey alone would have done it , do n’t you ? ”
185582	185599	185600	185600	Dumbledore	138	“ But his final destination — and ours — lies a little farther on . Come . ”
185673	185676	185678	185678	Dumbledore	138	“ Lumos , ”
185724	185728	185730	185730	Dumbledore	138	“ You see ? ”
185754	185765	185740	185740	Harry	136	“ You will not object to getting a little wet ? ”
185766	185769	185771	185771	Harry	136	“ No , ”
185773	185796	185771	185771	Harry	136	“ Then take off your Invisibility Cloak — there is no need for it now — and let us take the plunge . ”
186084	186092	186094	186094	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , this is the place , ”
186096	186102	186103	186103	Harry	136	“ How can you tell ? ”
186109	186115	186117	186117	Dumbledore	138	“ It has known magic , ”
186166	186177	186179	186179	Dumbledore	138	“ This is merely the antechamber , the entrance hall , ”
186186	186214	186179	186179	Dumbledore	138	“ We need to penetrate the inner place ... Now it is Lord Voldemort ’s obstacles that stand in our way , rather than those nature made ... ”
186288	186291	186292	186292	he	138	“ Here , ”
186295	186307	186292	186292	he	138	“ We go on through here . The entrance is concealed . ”
186392	186400	186402	186402	Harry	136	“ You ’ve d - done it ! ”
186434	186445	186446	186446	he	138	“ Harry , I ’m so sorry , I forgot , ”
186481	186485	186487	186487	Harry	136	“ Thank you , ”
186557	186566	186553	186553	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh , surely not . So crude . ”
186567	186574	186553	186553	Dumbledore	138	“ What is it , Professor ? ”
186575	186580	186582	186582	Dumbledore	138	“ I rather think , ”
186608	186619	186553	186553	Dumbledore	138	“ that we are required to make payment to pass . ”
186620	186623	186625	186625	Harry	136	“ Payment ? ”
186627	186637	186625	186625	Harry	136	“ You ’ve got to give the door something ? ”
186638	186641	186643	186643	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , ”
186645	186655	186643	186643	Dumbledore	138	“ Blood , if I am not much mistaken . ”
186656	186659	186625	186625	Harry	136	“ Blood ? ”
186660	186667	186669	186669	Dumbledore	138	“ I said it was crude , ”
186690	186734	186625	186625	Harry	136	“ The idea , as I am sure you will have gathered , is that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to enter . Once again , Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury . ”
186735	186747	186749	186761	Harry , who had experienced enough pain not to be keen for more	3560	“ Yeah , but still , if you can avoid it ... ”
186763	186772	186774	186774	Dumbledore	138	“ Sometimes , however , it is unavoidable , ”
186792	186795	186797	186797	Harry	136	“ Professor ! ”
186807	186816	186804	186804	his	138	“ I ’ll do it , I ’m — ”
186861	186869	186871	186871	Dumbledore	138	“ You are very kind , Harry , ”
186907	186931	186900	186900	Snape	205	“ But your blood is worth more than mine . Ah , that seems to have done the trick , does n’t it ? ”
186975	186982	186987	186987	he	138	“ After me , I think , ”
187123	187128	187130	187130	Dumbledore	138	“ Let us walk , ”
187133	187149	187150	187150	He	138	“ Be very careful not to step into the water . Stay close to me . ”
187245	187248	187249	187249	he	136	“ Professor ? ”
187253	187262	187249	187249	he	136	“ Do you think the Horcrux is here ? ”
187263	187267	187269	187269	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh yes , ”
187271	187291	187269	187269	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , I ’m sure it is . The question is , how do we get to it ? ”
187292	187306	187307	187307	Harry	136	“ We could n’t ... we could n’t just try a Summoning Charm ? ”
187340	187345	187347	187347	Dumbledore	138	“ Certainly we could , ”
187359	187367	187347	187347	Dumbledore	138	“ Why do n’t you do it ? ”
187368	187375	187376	187376	Harry	136	“ Me ? Oh ... okay ... ”
187393	187397	187384	187384	his	136	“ Accio Horcrux ! ”
187469	187474	187464	187464	he	136	“ What was that ? ”
187475	187494	187495	187495	Harry	136	“ Something , I think , that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux . ”
187531	187541	187521	187521	Harry	136	“ Did you think that would happen , sir ? ”
187542	187583	187464	187464	he	136	“ I thought something would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get our hands on the Horcrux . That was a very good idea , Harry ; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing . ”
187584	187595	187597	187597	Harry	136	“ But we do n’t know what the thing was , ”
187606	187615	187617	187617	Dumbledore	138	“ What the things are , you mean , ”
187619	187637	187617	187617	Dumbledore	138	“ I doubt very much that there is only one of them . Shall we walk on ? ”
187638	187641	187464	187464	he	136	“ Professor ? ”
187642	187647	187464	187464	he	136	“ Yes , Harry ? ”
187648	187663	187617	187617	Dumbledore	138	“ Do you think we ’re going to have to go into the lake ? ”
187664	187675	187464	187464	he	136	“ Into it ? Only if we are very unfortunate . ”
187676	187688	187464	187464	he	136	“ You do n’t think the Horcrux is at the bottom ? ”
187689	187702	187704	187704	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh no ... I think the Horcrux is in the middle . ”
187718	187734	187704	187704	Dumbledore	138	“ So we ’re going to have to cross the lake to get to it ? ”
187735	187742	187743	187743	Harry	136	“ Yes , I think so . ”
187769	187772	187777	187777	he	138	“ Aha , ”
187820	187848	187805	187805	Dumbledore	138	“ So sorry , Harry , I should have given warning . Stand back against the wall , please ; I think I have found the place . ”
187916	187919	187921	187921	Dumbledore	138	“ Oho , ”
188098	188107	188108	188108	Harry	136	“ How did you know that was there ? ”
188113	188119	188121	188121	Dumbledore	138	“ Magic always leaves traces , ”
188134	188150	188121	188121	Dumbledore	138	“ sometimes very distinctive traces . I taught Tom Riddle . I know his style . ”
188151	188159	188333	188333	Dumbledore	138	“ Is ... is this boat safe ? ”
188160	188202	188121	188121	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh yes , I think so . Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux . ”
188203	188224	188121	188121	Dumbledore	138	“ So the things in the water wo n’t do anything to us if we cross in Voldemort ’s boat ? ”
188225	188269	188121	188121	Dumbledore	138	“ I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will , at some point , realize we are not Lord Voldemort . Thus far , however , we have done well . They have allowed us to raise the boat . ”
188270	188278	188280	188280	Harry	136	“ But why have they let us ? ”
188308	188331	188333	188333	Dumbledore	138	“ Voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat , ”
188335	188388	188333	188333	Dumbledore	138	“ I think he would have been prepared to risk what was , to his mind , the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it , knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate . We shall see whether he is right . ”
188402	188429	188430	188430	Dumbledore	138	“ It does n’t look like it was built for two people . Will it hold both of us ? Will we be too heavy together ? ”
188433	188483	188430	188430	Dumbledore	138	“ Voldemort will not have cared about the weight , but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake . I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it . ”
188484	188489	188553	188553	he	138	“ But then — ? ”
188490	188536	188430	188430	Dumbledore	138	“ I do not think you will count , Harry : You are underage and unqualified . Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen - year - old to reach this place : I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine . ”
188556	188593	188553	188553	he	138	“ Voldemort ’s mistake , Harry , Voldemort ’s mistake ... Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth ... Now , you first this time , and be careful not to touch the water . ”
188768	188771	188772	188772	he	136	“ Professor ! ”
188786	188789	188772	188772	he	136	“ Harry ? ”
188790	188805	188776	188776	his	136	“ I think I saw a hand in the water — a human hand ! ”
188806	188815	188817	188817	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , I am sure you did , ”
188842	188854	188820	188820	Harry	136	“ So that thing that jumped out of the water — ? ”
188912	188919	188921	188921	Harry	136	“ There are bodies in here ! ”
188937	188940	188942	188942	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , ”
188945	188959	188942	188942	Dumbledore	138	“ but we do not need to worry about them at the moment . ”
188960	188965	188966	188966	Harry	136	“ At the moment ? ”
188980	188991	188993	188993	Dumbledore	138	“ Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us , ”
188995	189061	188993	188993	Dumbledore	138	“ There is nothing to be feared from a body , Harry , any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness . Lord Voldemort , who of course secretly fears both , disagrees . But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom . It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness , nothing more . ”
189105	189112	189113	189113	he	136	“ But one of them jumped , ”
189129	189146	189113	189113	he	136	“ When I tried to Summon the Horcrux , a body leapt out of the lake . ”
189147	189150	189152	189152	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , ”
189154	189207	189208	189208	Dumbledore	138	“ I am sure that once we take the Horcrux , we shall find them less peaceable . However , like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness , they fear light and warmth , which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise . Fire , Harry , ”
189222	189227	189229	189229	Harry	136	“ Oh ... right ... ”
189319	189323	189325	189325	Dumbledore	138	“ Nearly there , ”
189392	189400	189402	189402	Dumbledore	138	“ Careful not to touch the water , ”
189525	189530	189532	189532	Harry	136	“ What is it ? ”
189535	189541	189543	189543	Dumbledore	138	“ I am not sure , ”
189545	189556	189543	189543	Dumbledore	138	“ Something more worrisome than blood and bodies , however . ”
189586	189596	189576	189576	his	138	“ Sir , no , do n’t touch — ! ”
189597	189603	189605	189605	Dumbledore	138	“ I can not touch , ”
189610	189625	189605	189605	Dumbledore	138	“ See ? I can not approach any nearer than this . You try . ”
189678	189688	189690	189690	Dumbledore	138	“ Out of the way , please , Harry , ”
189749	189760	189736	189736	his	138	“ You think the Horcrux is in there , sir ? ”
189761	189765	189766	189766	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh yes . ”
189792	189835	189839	189839	Dumbledore	138	“ But how to reach it ? This potion can not be penetrated by hand , Vanished , parted , scooped up , or siphoned away , nor can it be Transfigured , Charmed , or otherwise made to change its nature . ”
189865	189879	189841	189841	his	138	“ I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk . ”
189880	189883	189885	189885	Harry	136	“ What ? ”
189887	189890	189885	189885	Harry	136	“ No ! ”
189891	189915	189841	189841	his	138	“ Yes , I think so : Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what lies in its depths . ”
189916	189927	189841	189841	his	138	“ But what if — what if it kills you ? ”
189928	189940	189942	189942	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh , I doubt that it would work like that , ”
189945	189960	189942	189942	Dumbledore	138	“ Lord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island . ”
189981	189984	189986	189986	Harry	136	“ Sir , ”
189995	190004	189986	189986	Harry	136	“ sir , this is Voldemort we ’re — ”
190005	190031	190034	190034	himself	138	“ I ’m sorry , Harry ; I should have said , he would not want to immediately kill the person who reached this island , ”
190036	190091	190034	190034	himself	138	“ He would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his defenses and , most importantly of all , why they were so intent upon emptying the basin . Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes . ”
190119	190122	190123	190123	he	138	“ Undoubtedly , ”
190128	190211	190123	190123	he	138	“ this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux . It might paralyze me , cause me to forget what I am here for , create so much pain I am distracted , or render me incapable in some other way . This being the case , Harry , it will be your job to make sure I keep drinking , even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth . You understand ? ”
190261	190265	190267	190267	Dumbledore	138	“ You remember , ”
190269	190280	190267	190267	Dumbledore	138	“ the condition on which I brought you with me ? ”
190301	190307	190281	190281	Harry	136	“ But what if — ? ”
190308	190324	190267	190267	Dumbledore	138	“ You swore , did you not , to follow any command I gave you ? ”
190325	190330	190281	190281	Harry	136	“ Yes , but — ”
190331	190346	190281	190281	Harry	136	“ I warned you , did I not , that there might be danger ? ”
190347	190350	190352	190352	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
190354	190357	190352	190352	Harry	136	“ but — ”
190358	190363	190365	190365	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , then , ”
190379	190385	190365	190365	Dumbledore	138	“ you have my orders . ”
190386	190396	190398	190398	Harry	136	“ Why ca n’t I drink the potion instead ? ”
190401	190416	190418	190418	Dumbledore	138	“ Because I am much older , much cleverer , and much less valuable , ”
190420	190447	190418	190418	Dumbledore	138	“ Once and for all , Harry , do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking ? ”
190448	190453	190489	190489	Dumbledore	138	“ Could n’t — ? ”
190454	190460	190489	190489	Dumbledore	138	“ Do I have it ? ”
190461	190464	190418	190418	Dumbledore	138	“ But — ”
190465	190471	190489	190489	Dumbledore	138	“ Your word , Harry . ”
190472	190480	190489	190489	Dumbledore	138	“ I — all right , but — ”
190547	190554	190540	190540	Dumbledore	138	“ Your good health , Harry . ”
190582	190585	190586	190586	he	136	“ Professor ? ”
190597	190603	190591	190591	Dumbledore	138	“ How do you feel ? ”
190677	190681	190683	190683	Harry	136	“ Professor Dumbledore ? ”
190689	190695	190685	190685	his	136	“ Can you hear me ? ”
190748	190756	190757	190757	he	136	“ Professor , can you hear me ? ”
190791	190802	190761	190761	his	136	“ I do n’t want ... Do n’t make me ... ”
190832	190844	190846	190846	Dumbledore	138	“ . . . do n’t like ... want to stop ... ”
190848	190858	190860	190860	Harry	136	“ You ... you ca n’t stop , Professor , ”
190862	190883	190860	190860	Harry	136	“ You ’ve got to keep drinking , remember ? You told me you had to keep drinking . Here ... ”
190918	190921	190922	190922	he	138	“ No ... ”
190940	190957	190922	190922	he	138	“ I do n’t want to ... I do n’t want to ... Let me go ... ”
190958	190966	190968	190968	Harry	136	“ It ’s all right , Professor , ”
190974	190984	190968	190968	Harry	136	“ It ’s all right , I ’m here — ”
190985	190994	190996	190996	Dumbledore	138	“ Make it stop , make it stop , ”
190998	191009	191011	191011	Harry	136	“ Yes ... yes , this ’ll make it stop , ”
191044	191072	191026	191026	Dumbledore	138	“ No , no , no , no , I ca n’t , I ca n’t , do n’t make me , I do n’t want to ... ”
191073	191086	191088	191088	Harry	136	“ It ’s all right , Professor , it ’s all right ! ”
191114	191145	191026	191026	Dumbledore	138	“ Nothing ’s happening to you , you ’re safe , it is n’t real , I swear it is n’t real — take this , now , take this ... ”
191177	191188	191189	191189	he	138	“ It ’s all my fault , all my fault , ”
191192	191217	191189	191189	he	138	“ Please make it stop , I know I did wrong , oh please make it stop and I ’ll never , never again ... ”
191218	191227	191228	191228	Harry	136	“ This will make it stop , Professor , ”
191275	191299	191272	191272	he	138	“ Do n’t hurt them , do n’t hurt them , please , please , it ’s my fault , hurt me instead ... ”
191300	191315	191317	191317	Harry	136	“ Here , drink this , drink this , you ’ll be all right , ”
191368	191388	191362	191362	Harry	136	“ Please , please , please , no ... not that , not that , I ’ll do anything ... ”
191389	191398	191410	191410	he	138	“ Just drink , Professor , just drink ... ”
191425	191434	191414	191414	he	138	“ No more , please , no more ... ”
191454	191468	191469	191469	He	136	“ We ’re nearly there , Professor . Drink this , drink it ... ”
191505	191529	191495	191495	Dumbledore	138	“ I want to die ! I want to die ! Make it stop , make it stop , I want to die ! ”
191530	191539	191540	191540	Dumbledore	138	“ Drink this , Professor . Drink this ... ”
191553	191557	191550	191550	he	138	“ KILL ME ! ”
191558	191565	191567	191567	Harry	136	“ This — this one will ! ”
191569	191582	191550	191550	he	138	“ Just drink this ... It ’ll be over ... all over ! ”
191610	191613	191615	191615	Harry	136	“ No ! ”
191663	191666	191668	191668	Harry	136	“ No , ”
191673	191696	191697	191697	he	136	“ no , you ’re not dead , you said it was n’t poison , wake up , wake up — Rennervate ! ”
191719	191726	191697	191697	he	136	“ Rennervate — sir — please — ”
191737	191744	191732	191732	Harry	136	“ Sir , are you — ? ”
191745	191748	191750	191750	Dumbledore	138	“ Water , ”
191752	191755	191757	191757	Harry	136	“ Water , ”
191759	191762	191763	191763	He	136	“ Yes — ”
191790	191793	191794	191794	he	136	“ Aguamenti ! ”
191843	191853	191855	191855	Harry	136	“ But I had some — wait — Aguamenti ! ”
191891	191902	191904	191904	Harry	136	“ Sir , I ’m trying , I ’m trying ! ”
191935	191942	191918	191918	he	138	“ Aguamenti — Aguamenti — AGUAMENTI ! ”
192018	192023	192024	192024	Harry	136	“ Sir — here ! ”

192794	192797	192799	192799	Harry	136	“ Sir , ”
192801	192819	192799	192799	Harry	136	“ sir , I forgot — about fire — they were coming at me and I panicked — ”
192820	192824	192826	192826	Dumbledore	138	“ Quite understandable , ”
192925	192930	192931	192931	he	138	“ I am weak ... ”
192934	192941	192943	192943	Harry	136	“ Do n’t worry , sir , ”
192960	192977	192943	192943	Harry	136	“ Do n’t worry , I ’ll get us back ... Lean on me , sir ... ”
193003	193015	193017	193017	Dumbledore	138	“ The protection was ... after all ... well - designed , ”
193020	193038	193017	193017	Dumbledore	138	“ One alone could not have done it ... You did well , very well , Harry ... ”
193039	193045	193047	193047	Harry	136	“ Do n’t talk now , ”
193064	193079	193047	193047	Harry	136	“ Save your energy , sir ... We ’ll soon be out of here ... ”
193080	193091	193017	193017	Dumbledore	138	“ The archway will have sealed again ... My knife ... ”
193092	193105	193107	193107	Harry	136	“ There ’s no need , I got cut on the rock , ”
193110	193116	193107	193107	Harry	136	“ Just tell me where ... ”
193117	193120	193121	193121	Harry	136	“ Here ... ”
193165	193176	193177	193177	Harry	136	“ It ’s going to be all right , sir , ”
193199	193216	193177	193177	Harry	136	“ We ’re nearly there ... I can Apparate us both back ... Do n’t worry ... ”
193217	193225	193227	193227	Dumbledore	138	“ I am not worried , Harry , ”
193239	193245	193229	193229	his	138	“ I am with you . ”
193405	193412	193413	193413	Harry	136	“ We did it , Professor ! ”
193431	193441	193413	193413	Harry	136	“ We did it ! We got the Horcrux ! ”
193482	193490	193466	193466	his	138	“ Sir , are you all right ? ”
193491	193497	193499	193499	Dumbledore	138	“ I ’ve been better , ”
193510	193519	193499	193499	Dumbledore	138	“ That potion ... was no health drink ... ”
193532	193553	193554	193554	He	136	“ Sir — it ’s okay , sir , you ’re going to be all right , do n’t worry — ”
193586	193602	193575	193575	he	136	“ We need to get you up to the school , sir ... Madam Pomfrey ... ”
193603	193606	193608	193608	Dumbledore	138	“ No , ”
193610	193634	193608	193608	Dumbledore	138	“ It is ... Professor Snape whom I need ... But I do not think ... I can walk very far just yet ... ”
193635	193666	193575	193575	he	136	“ Right — sir , listen — I ’m going to knock on a door , find a place you can stay — then I can run and get Madam — ”
193667	193670	193672	193672	Dumbledore	138	“ Severus , ”
193675	193680	193672	193672	Dumbledore	138	“ I need Severus ... ”
193681	193704	193575	193575	he	136	“ All right then , Snape — but I ’m going to have to leave you for a moment so I can — ”
193764	193797	193798	193798	She	171	“ I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains ! Thank goodness , thank goodness , I could n’t think what to — but what ’s wrong with Albus ? ”
193817	193822	193824	193824	Harry	136	“ He ’s hurt , ”
193826	193850	193824	193824	Harry	136	“ Madam Rosmerta , can he come into the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the school and get help for him ? ”
193851	193871	193927	193927	she	171	“ You ca n’t go up there alone ! Do n’t you realize — have n’t you seen — ? ”
193872	193880	193882	193882	Harry	136	“ If you help me support him , ”
193889	193898	193882	193882	Harry	136	“ I think we can get him inside — ”
193899	193904	193906	193906	Dumbledore	138	“ What has happened ? ”
193908	193915	193906	193906	Dumbledore	138	“ Rosmerta , what ’s wrong ? ”
193916	193925	193927	193927	she	171	“ The — the Dark Mark , Albus . ”
193993	193999	194001	194001	Dumbledore	138	“ When did it appear ? ”
194019	194043	194004	194004	his	138	“ Must have been minutes ago , it was n’t there when I put the cat out , but when I got upstairs — ”
194044	194055	194057	194057	Dumbledore	138	“ We need to return to the castle at once , ”
194059	194061	194070	194070	he	136	“ Rosmerta ”
194079	194086	194070	194070	he	136	“ we need transport — brooms — ”
194087	194097	194098	194098	she	3677	“ I ’ve got a couple behind the bar , ”
194105	194113	194098	194098	she	3677	“ Shall I run and fetch — ? ”
194114	194122	194123	194123	Harry	136	“ No , Harry can do it . ”
194130	194136	194125	194125	his	136	“ Accio Rosmerta ’s Brooms ! ”
194184	194195	194200	194200	he	138	“ Rosmerta , please send a message to the Ministry , ”
194207	194230	194231	194231	Harry	136	“ It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realized anything is wrong ... Harry , put on your Invisibility Cloak . ”
194636	194642	194643	194643	Harry	136	“ What does it mean ? ”
194663	194677	194645	194645	Dumbledore	138	“ Is it the real Mark ? Has someone definitely been — Professor ? ”
194699	194705	194707	194707	Dumbledore	138	“ Go and wake Severus , ”
194712	194745	194707	194707	Dumbledore	138	“ Tell him what has happened and bring him to me . Do nothing else , speak to nobody else , and do not remove your Cloak . I shall wait here . ”
194746	194749	194802	194802	Dumbledore	138	“ But — ”
194750	194761	194762	194762	Harry	136	“ You swore to obey me , Harry — go ! ”
194834	194837	194827	194827	somebody	1462	“ Expelliarmus ! ”
194969	194975	194959	194959	He	138	“ Good evening , Draco . ”
195000	195006	194992	194992	His	159	“ Who else is here ? ”
195007	195021	195022	195022	Harry	136	“ A question I might ask you . Or are you acting alone ? ”
195040	195043	195044	195044	he	159	“ No , ”
195047	195063	195044	195044	he	159	“ I ’ve got backup . There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight . ”
195064	195069	195071	195071	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , well , ”
195084	195101	195075	195075	Malfoy	159	“ Very good indeed . You found a way to let them in , did you ? ”
195102	195105	195107	195107	Malfoy	159	“ Yeah , ”
195113	195123	195107	195107	Malfoy	159	“ Right under your nose and you never realized ! ”
195124	195127	195129	195129	Dumbledore	138	“ Ingenious , ”
195131	195146	195129	195129	Dumbledore	138	“ Yet ... forgive me ... where are they now ? You seem unsupported . ”
195147	195184	195107	195107	Malfoy	159	“ They met some of your guards . They ’re having a fight down below . They wo n’t be long ... I came on ahead . I — I ’ve got a job to do . ”
195185	195202	195204	195204	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , then , you must get on and do it , my dear boy , ”
195265	195276	195256	195257	Albus Dumbledore	138	“ Draco , Draco , you are not a killer . ”
195277	195283	195285	195285	Malfoy	159	“ How do you know ? ”
195311	195322	195324	195324	Malfoy	159	“ You do n’t know what I ’m capable of , ”
195328	195338	195324	195324	Malfoy	159	“ You do n’t know what I ’ve done ! ”
195339	195346	195348	195348	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh yes , I do , ”
195351	195407	195348	195348	Dumbledore	138	“ You almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley . You have been trying , with increasing desperation , to kill me all year . Forgive me , Draco , but they have been feeble attempts ... So feeble , to be honest , that I wonder whether your heart has been really in it . ”
195408	195415	195417	195417	Malfoy	159	“ It has been in it ! ”
195420	195433	195417	195417	Malfoy	159	“ I ’ve been working on it all year , and tonight — ”
195456	195465	195467	195467	Dumbledore	138	“ Somebody is putting up a good fight , ”
195470	195504	195467	195467	Dumbledore	138	“ But you were saying ... yes , you have managed to introduce Death Eaters into my school , which , I admit , I thought impossible ... How did you do it ? ”
195528	195540	195542	195542	Dumbledore	138	“ Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone , ”
195544	195600	195542	195542	Dumbledore	138	“ What if your backup has been thwarted by my guard ? As you have perhaps realized , there are members of the Order of the Phoenix here tonight too . And after all , you do n’t really need help ... I have no wand at the moment ... I can not defend myself . ”
195607	195611	195613	195613	Dumbledore	138	“ I see , ”
195623	195634	195617	195617	Malfoy	159	“ You are afraid to act until they join you . ”
195635	195641	195643	195643	Malfoy	159	“ I ’m not afraid ! ”
195655	195664	195646	195646	he	159	“ It ’s you who should be scared ! ”
195665	195727	195732	195732	he	159	“ But why ? I do n’t think you will kill me , Draco . Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe ... So tell me , while we wait for your friends ... how did you smuggle them in here ? It seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it . ”
195780	195806	195777	195777	he	159	“ I had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no one ’s used for years . The one Montague got lost in last year . ”
195807	195810	195777	195777	he	159	“ Aaaah . ”
195827	195841	195819	195819	He	138	“ That was clever ... There is a pair , I take it ? ”
195842	195848	195850	195850	Malfoy	159	“ In Borgin and Burkes , ”
195852	195996	195850	195850	Malfoy	159	“ and they make a kind of passage between them . Montague told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one , he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school , and sometimes what was going on in the shop , as if the cabinet was traveling between them , but he could n’t make anyone hear him ... In the end , he managed to Apparate out , even though he ’d never passed his test . He nearly died doing it . Everyone thought it was a really good story , but I was the only one who realized what it meant — even Borgin did n’t know — I was the one who realized there could be a way into Hogwarts through the cabinets if I fixed the broken one . ”
195997	196001	196003	196003	Dumbledore	138	“ Very good , ”
196005	196045	196003	196003	Dumbledore	138	“ So the Death Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help you ... A clever plan , a very clever plan ... and , as you say , right under my nose . ”
196046	196049	196051	196051	Malfoy	159	“ Yeah , ”
196066	196072	196051	196051	Malfoy	159	“ Yeah , it was ! ”
196073	196079	196080	196080	Dumbledore	138	“ But there were times , ”
196084	196139	196080	196080	Dumbledore	138	“ were n’t there , when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the cabinet ? And you resorted to crude and badly judged measures such as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands ... poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I might drink ... ”
196140	196159	196161	196161	Malfoy	159	“ Yeah , well , you still did n’t realize who was behind that stuff , did you ? ”
196193	196203	196205	196205	Dumbledore	138	“ As a matter of fact , I did , ”
196207	196215	196205	196205	Dumbledore	138	“ I was sure it was you . ”
196216	196226	196227	196227	Malfoy	159	“ Why did n’t you stop me , then ? ”
196230	196248	196227	196227	Malfoy	159	“ I tried , Draco . Professor Snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders — ”
196249	196263	196205	196205	Dumbledore	138	“ He has n’t been doing your orders , he promised my mother — ”
196264	196279	196205	196205	Dumbledore	138	“ Of course that is what he would tell you , Draco , but — ”
196280	196305	196227	196227	Malfoy	159	“ He ’s a double agent , you stupid old man , he is n’t working for you , you just think he is ! ”
196306	196326	196205	196205	Dumbledore	138	“ We must agree to differ on that , Draco . It so happens that I trust Professor Snape — ”
196327	196338	196340	196340	Malfoy	159	“ Well , you ’re losing your grip , then ! ”
196342	196443	196340	196340	Malfoy	159	“ He ’s been offering me plenty of help — wanting all the glory for himself — wanting a bit of the action — ‘ What are you doing ? ’ ‘ Did you do the necklace , that was stupid , it could have blown everything — ’ But I have n’t told him what I ’ve been doing in the Room of Requirement , he ’s going to wake up tomorrow and it ’ll all be over and he wo n’t be the Dark Lord ’s favorite anymore , he ’ll be nothing compared to me , nothing ! ”
196444	196448	196450	196450	Dumbledore	138	“ Very gratifying , ”
196453	196496	196450	196450	Dumbledore	138	“ We all like appreciation for our own hard work , of course . But you must have had an accomplice , all the same ... someone in Hogsmeade , someone who was able to slip Katie the — the — aaaah ... ”
196514	196533	196507	196507	he	138	“ . . . of course ... Rosmerta . How long has she been under the Imperius Curse ? ”
196534	196543	196544	196544	Malfoy	159	“ Got there at last , have you ? ”
196577	196691	196571	196571	Dumbledore	138	“ So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied ? And the poisoned mead ... well , naturally , Rosmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to Slughorn , believing that it was to be my Christmas present ... Yes , very neat ... very neat ... Poor Mr. Filch would not , of course , think to check a bottle of Rosmerta ’s . Tell me , how have you been communicating with Rosmerta ? I thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored . ”
196692	196696	196698	196698	Malfoy	159	“ Enchanted coins , ”
196717	196733	196759	196759	His	159	“ I had one and she had the other and I could send her messages — ”
196734	196755	196757	196757	Dumbledore	138	“ Is n’t that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves Dumbledore ’s Army used last year ? ”
196782	196792	196794	196794	Malfoy	159	“ Yeah , I got the idea from them , ”
196801	196830	196794	196794	Malfoy	159	“ I got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood Granger as well , I heard her talking in the library about Filch not recognizing potions . ”
196831	196844	196846	196846	Dumbledore	138	“ Please do not use that offensive word in front of me , ”
196854	196871	196848	196848	Malfoy	159	“ You care about me saying ‘ Mudblood ’ when I ’m about to kill you ? ”
196872	196878	196880	196880	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , I do , ”
196900	196945	196883	196883	Harry	136	“ But as for being about to kill me , Draco , you have had several long minutes now , we are quite alone , I am more defenseless than you can have dreamed of finding me , and still you have not acted ... ”
196961	196967	196968	196968	Dumbledore	138	“ Now , about tonight , ”
196972	196996	196997	196997	he	138	“ I am a little puzzled about how it happened ... You knew that I had left the school ? But of course , ”
197003	197022	196997	196997	he	138	“ Rosmerta saw me leaving , she tipped you off using your ingenious coins , I ’m sure . ”
197023	197028	197030	197030	Malfoy	159	“ That ’s right , ”
197032	197049	197030	197030	Malfoy	159	“ But she said you were just going for a drink , you ’d be back ... ”
197050	197069	197071	197071	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , I certainly did have a drink ... and I came back ... after a fashion , ”
197073	197084	197071	197071	Dumbledore	138	“ So you decided to spring a trap for me ? ”
197085	197111	197113	197113	Malfoy	159	“ We decided to put the Dark Mark over the tower and get you to hurry up here , to see who ’d been killed , ”
197115	197120	197113	197113	Malfoy	159	“ And it worked ! ”
197121	197128	197130	197130	Dumbledore	138	“ Well ... yes and no ... ”
197132	197148	197130	197130	Dumbledore	138	“ But am I to take it , then , that nobody has been murdered ? ”
197149	197154	197156	197156	Malfoy	159	“ Someone ’s dead , ”
197172	197216	197159	197159	his	159	“ One of your people ... I do n’t know who , it was dark ... I stepped over the body ... I was supposed to be waiting up here when you got back , only your Phoenix lot got in the way ... ”
197217	197224	197226	197226	Dumbledore	138	“ Yes , they do that , ”
197292	197303	197305	197305	Dumbledore	138	“ There is little time , one way or another , ”
197307	197317	197305	197305	Dumbledore	138	“ So let us discuss your options , Draco . ”
197318	197322	197324	197324	Malfoy	159	“ My options ! ”
197327	197343	197324	197324	Malfoy	159	“ I ’m standing here with a wand — I ’m about to kill you — ”
197344	197391	197305	197305	Dumbledore	138	“ My dear boy , let us have no more pretense about that . If you were going to kill me , you would have done it when you first disarmed me , you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means . ”
197392	197400	197402	197402	Malfoy	159	“ I have n’t got any options ! ”
197412	197432	197405	197405	he	159	“ I ’ve got to do it ! He ’ll kill me ! He ’ll kill my whole family ! ”
197433	197442	197444	197444	Dumbledore	138	“ I appreciate the difficulty of your position , ”
197446	197478	197444	197444	Dumbledore	138	“ Why else do you think I have not confronted you before now ? Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realized that I suspected you . ”
197488	197516	197518	197518	Dumbledore	138	“ I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted , in case he used Legilimency against you , ”
197520	197562	197518	197518	Dumbledore	138	“ But now at last we can speak plainly to each other ... No harm has been done , you have hurt nobody , though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived ... I can help you , Draco . ”
197563	197570	197572	197572	Malfoy	159	“ No , you ca n’t , ”
197582	197604	197572	197572	Malfoy	159	“ Nobody can . He told me to do it or he ’ll kill me . I ’ve got no choice . ”
197605	197684	197685	197685	Malfoy	159	“ Come over to the right side , Draco , and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine . What is more , I can send members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise . Your father is safe at the moment in Azkaban ... When the time comes , we can protect him too ... Come over to the right side , Draco ... you are not a killer ... ”
197690	197701	197702	197702	he	138	“ But I got this far , did n’t I ? ”
197706	197742	197702	197702	he	138	“ They thought I ’d die in the attempt , but I ’m here ... and you ’re in my power ... I ’m the one with the wand ... You ’re at my mercy ... ”
197743	197748	197750	197750	Dumbledore	138	“ No , Draco , ”
197753	197767	197750	197750	Dumbledore	138	“ It is my mercy , and not yours , that matters now . ”
197870	197874	197875	197875	he	3716	“ Dumbledore cornered ! ”
197901	197916	197879	197879	he	3716	“ Dumbledore wandless , Dumbledore alone ! Well done , Draco , well done ! ”
197917	197923	197925	197925	Dumbledore	138	“ Good evening , Amycus , ”
197938	197948	197949	197950	The woman	3720	“ And you ’ve brought Alecto too ... Charming ... ”
197957	197969	197970	197970	she	3720	“ Think your little jokes’ll help you on your deathbed then ? ”
197973	197984	197986	197986	Dumbledore	138	“ Jokes ? No , no , these are manners , ”
197988	197992	197994	197999	the stranger standing nearest to Harry	3721	“ Do it , ”
198070	198077	198079	198079	Dumbledore	138	“ Is that you , Fenrir ? ”
198081	198086	198088	198089	the other	750	“ That ’s right , ”

198100	198111	198112	198112	Greyback	258	“ No , I can not say that I am . ”
198133	198145	198125	198125	he	258	“ But you know how much I like kids , Dumbledore . ”
198146	198185	198088	198089	the other	750	“ Am I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now ? This is most unusual ... You have developed a taste for human flesh that can not be satisfied once a month ? ”
198186	198191	198193	198194	Fenrir Greyback	258	“ That ’s right , ”
198196	198209	198193	198194	Fenrir Greyback	258	“ Shocks you that , does it , Dumbledore ? Frightens you ? ”
198210	198225	198227	198227	Dumbledore	138	“ Well , I can not pretend it does not disgust me a little , ”
198229	198257	198227	198227	Dumbledore	138	“ And , yes , I am a little shocked that Draco here invited you , of all people , into the school where his friends live ... ”
198258	198263	198265	198265	Malfoy	159	“ I did n’t , ”
198286	198297	198274	198274	he	159	“ I did n’t know he was going to come — ”
198298	198312	198314	198314	Greyback	258	“ I would n’t want to miss a trip to Hogwarts , Dumbledore , ”
198316	198331	198314	198314	Greyback	258	“ Not when there are throats to be ripped out ... Delicious , delicious ... ”
198349	198359	198333	198333	he	258	“ I could do you for afters , Dumbledore . ”
198360	198363	198371	198371	He	536	“ No , ”
198381	198401	198371	198371	He	536	“ We ’ve got orders . Draco ’s got to do it . Now , Draco , and quickly . ”

198474	198489	198460	198462	the lopsided man	3724	“ Look at him — what ’s happened to you , then , Dumby ? ”
198490	198501	198503	198503	Dumbledore	138	“ Oh , weaker resistance , slower reflexes , Amycus , ”
198505	198528	198503	198503	Dumbledore	138	“ Old age , in short ... One day , perhaps , it will happen to you ... if you are lucky ... ”
198529	198542	198544	198546	the Death Eater	3726	“ What ’s that mean , then , what ’s that mean ? ”
198551	198592	198544	198546	the Death Eater	3726	“ Always the same , were n’t yeh , Dumby , talking and doing nothing , nothing . I do n’t even know why the Dark Lord ’s bothering to kill yer ! Come on , Draco , do it ! ”
198610	198621	198622	198622	Harry	136	“ They ’ve blocked the stairs — Reducto ! REDUCTO ! ”
198663	198670	198672	198676	the brutal - faced man	3729	“ Now , Draco , quickly ! ”

198794	198807	198809	198810	the woman	3720	“ Draco , do it or stand aside so one of us — ”

201055	201078	201053	201053	Snape	205	“ Your father would never attack me unless it was four on one , what would you call him , I wonder ? ”
201079	201082	201028	201028	Harry	136	“ Stupe — ”
201083	201105	201107	201107	Snape	205	“ Blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed , Potter ! ”

201394	201399	201401	201401	Snape	205	“ No , Potter ! ”
201486	201538	201481	201481	he	205	“ You dare use my own spells against me , Potter ? It was I who invented them — I , the Half - Blood Prince ! And you ’d turn my inventions on me , like your filthy father , would you ? I do n’t think so ... no ! ”
201565	201570	201572	201572	Harry	136	“ Kill me then , ”
201587	201598	201572	201572	Harry	136	“ Kill me like you killed him , you coward — ”
201599	201602	201604	201604	Snape	205	“ DON’T — ”

201854	201857	201859	201859	Harry	136	“ Hagrid , ”

201989	201995	201997	201997	Harry	136	“ I ’m all right , ”

202229	202248	202250	202250	Hagrid	177	“ I was bindin ’ up a couple o ’ bowtruckle legs when I heard ’em comin ’ , ”
202260	202273	202250	202250	Hagrid	177	“ They ’ll ’ve bin burnt ter twigs , poor little things ... ”
202274	202277	202172	202172	Hagrid	177	“ Hagrid ... ”
202278	202321	202172	202172	Hagrid	177	“ But what happened , Harry ? I jus ’ saw them Death Eaters runnin ’ down from the castle , but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin’ with ’em ? Where ’s he gone — was he chasin ’ them ? ”
202322	202325	202326	202326	Harry	136	“ He ... ”
202340	202346	202328	202328	his	136	“ Hagrid , he killed ... ”
202347	202350	202352	202352	Hagrid	177	“ Killed ? ”
202360	202373	202352	202352	Hagrid	177	“ Snape killed ? What ’re yeh on abou ’ , Harry ? ”
202374	202377	202379	202379	Harry	136	“ Dumbledore , ”
202381	202387	202388	202388	Hagrid	177	“ Snape killed ... Dumbledore . ”
202408	202415	202388	202388	Hagrid	177	“ Dumbledore wha ’ , Harry ? ”
202416	202425	202352	202352	Hagrid	177	“ He ’s dead . Snape killed him ... ”
202426	202432	202434	202434	Hagrid	177	“ Don ’ say that , ”
202437	202457	202434	202434	Hagrid	177	“ Snape kill Dumbledore — don ’ be stupid , Harry . Wha ’s made yeh say tha ’ ? ”
202458	202464	202352	202352	Hagrid	177	“ I saw it happen . ”
202465	202471	202482	202482	his	177	“ Yeh couldn ’ have . ”
202472	202479	202482	202482	his	177	“ I saw it , Hagrid . ”
202520	202537	202538	202538	Hagrid	177	“ What musta happened was , Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with them Death Eaters , ”
202542	202570	202538	202538	Hagrid	177	“ I suppose he ’s got ta keep his cover . Look , let ’s get yeh back up ter the school . Come on , Harry ... ”
202788	202797	202799	202799	Hagrid	177	“ What ’re they all lookin ’ at ? ”
202821	202833	202834	202834	Hagrid	177	“ Wha ’s tha ’ , lyin ’ on the grass ? ”
202855	202887	202888	202888	Hagrid	177	“ See it , Harry ? Righ ’ at the foot o ’ the tower ? Under where the Mark ... Blimey ... yeh don ’ think someone got thrown — ? ”
203507	203508	203505	203505	Harry	136	” “
203511	203512	203505	203505	Harry	136	” “
203526	203527	203505	203505	Harry	136	” “
203530	203563	203564	203564	Harry	136	” He did not want to leave Dumbledore ’s side , he did not want to move anywhere . Hagrid ’s hand on his shoulder was trembling . Then another voice said , “
203569	203702	203564	203564	Harry	136	” A much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him upward . He obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it . Only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he realize , from a trace of flowery scent on the air , that it was Ginny who was leading him back into the castle . Incomprehensible voices battered him , sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night , but Harry and Ginny walked on , back up the steps into the entrance hall . Faces swam on the edges of Harry ’s vision , people were peering at him , whispering , wondering , and Gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase . “
203711	203715	203703	203703	We	3845	” said Ginny . “
203721	203725	203703	203703	We	3845	” said Harry . “
203732	203736	203737	203737	Everyone	4489	” said Ginny . “
203750	203770	203748	203748	everyone	4489	” Fear stirred in Harry ’s chest again : He had forgotten the inert figures he had left behind . “
203778	203779	203771	203771	Ginny	222	” “
203788	203789	203791	203793	the Dark Mark	156	” “
203803	203804	203797	203797	he	159	” “
203820	203836	203816	203816	he	159	” There was something in her voice , however , that Harry knew boded ill . “
203841	203842	203838	203838	you	222	” “
203881	203889	203867	203868	Madam Pomfrey	292	” Ginny ’s voice trembled a little . “
203916	203917	203904	203904	Greyback	258	” “
203930	203931	203932	203932	Neville	162	” “
204001	204081	203984	203984	I	0	” They had reached the hospital wing . Pushing open the doors , Harry saw Neville lying , apparently asleep , in a bed near the door . Ron , Hermione , Luna , Tonks , and Lupin were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward . At the sound of the doors opening , they all looked up . Hermione ran to Harry and hugged him ; Lupin moved forward too , looking anxious . “
204089	204090	204087	204087	Harry	136	” “
204099	204161	204097	204097	Bill	226	” Nobody answered . Harry looked over Hermione ’s shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on Bill ’s pillow , so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque . Madam Pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds with some harsh - smelling green ointment . Harry remembered how Snape had mended Malfoy ’s Sectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand . “
204173	204179	204164	204164	you	3853	” he asked the matron . “
204187	204192	204164	204164	you	3853	” said Madam Pomfrey . “
204209	204210	204212	204212	he	226	” “
204221	204247	204212	204212	he	226	” said Ron , who was gazing down into his brother ’s face as though he could somehow force him to mend just by staring . “
204265	204272	204255	204255	Bill	226	” He looked uncertainly at Lupin . “
204287	204291	204275	204275	I	0	” said Lupin , “
204331	204332	204333	204333	Dumbledore	138	” “
204343	204347	204333	204333	Dumbledore	138	” Ron said . “
204374	204375	204376	204376	Ron	201	” “
204382	204386	204378	204378	Dumbledore	138	” said Ginny . “
204389	204473	204378	204378	Dumbledore	138	” Lupin looked wildly from Ginny to Harry , as though hoping the latter might contradict her , but when Harry did not , Lupin collapsed into a chair beside Bill ’s bed , his hands over his face . Harry had never seen Lupin lose control before ; he felt as though he was intruding upon something private , indecent . He turned away and caught Ron ’s eye instead , exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what Ginny had said . “
204479	204483	204378	204378	Dumbledore	138	” whispered Tonks . “
204489	204490	204491	204491	Snape	205	” “
204495	204499	204491	204491	Snape	205	” said Harry . “
204577	204594	204568	204568	Malfoy	159	” Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth and Ron groaned . Luna ’s mouth trembled . “
204614	204638	204610	204612	The Avada Kedavra	437	” Harry could n’t go on . Madam Pomfrey burst into tears . Nobody paid her any attention except Ginny , who whispered , “
204643	204807	204808	204808	Molly	207	” Gulping , Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth , her eyes wide . Somewhere out in the darkness , a phoenix was singing in a way Harry had never heard before : a stricken lament of terrible beauty . And Harry felt , as he had felt about phoenix song before , that the music was inside him , not without : It was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows . How long they all stood there , listening , he did not know , nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning , but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and Professor McGonagall entered the ward . Like all the rest , she bore marks of the recent battle : There were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped . “
204816	204858	204859	204859	Harry	136	” she said , and the spell of the music was broken : Everyone roused themselves as though coming out of trances , turning again to look at Bill , or else to rub their own eyes , shake their heads . “
204888	204889	204890	204890	Snape	205	” “
204894	204937	204938	204938	Snape	205	” said Harry . She stared at him for a moment , then swayed alarmingly ; Madam Pomfrey , who seemed to have pulled herself together , ran forward , conjuring a chair from thin air , which she pushed under McGonagall . “
204940	204950	204938	204938	Snape	205	” repeated McGonagall faintly , falling into the chair . “
204969	204970	204971	204971	Snape	205	” “
204978	204987	204971	204971	Snape	205	” said Lupin , his voice uncharacteristically harsh . “
204993	204994	204988	204988	We	3859	” “
205004	205008	204996	204996	Dumbledore	138	” whispered Tonks . “
205023	205024	205025	205025	He	138	” “
205038	205059	205029	205029	he	138	” muttered Professor McGonagall , now dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a tartan - edged handkerchief . “
205097	205098	205099	205099	I	0	” “
205112	205116	205105	205105	Snape	205	” said Tonks . “
205120	205133	205134	205134	Snape	205	” said Harry , and they all turned to look at him . “
205177	205184	205162	205162	he	205	” They all stared at him . “
205190	205195	205196	205196	Dumbledore	138	” said Lupin incredulously . “
205209	205210	205212	205212	he	138	” “
205224	205228	205212	205212	he	138	” said Harry , “
205244	205274	205240	205240	he	138	” Nobody asked how Harry knew this . All of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock , trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened . “
205281	205299	205300	205300	My	0	” said Professor McGonagall suddenly . She looked disoriented , twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands . “
205369	205370	205359	205359	I	0	” “
205379	205384	205377	205377	Minerva	544	” said Lupin firmly . “
205402	205403	205374	205374	your	3870	” “
205422	205449	205412	205412	he	205	” asked Harry , who wanted every detail of Snape ’s duplicity and infamy , feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him , to swear vengeance . “
205459	205465	205450	205450	I	0	” said Professor McGonagall distractedly . “
205561	205562	205563	205563	I	0	” “
205566	205589	205563	205563	I	0	” said Harry , and he explained , briefly , about the pair of Vanishing Cabinets and the magical pathway they formed . “
205600	205618	205619	205619	I	0	” Almost against his will he glanced from Ron to Hermione , both of whom looked devastated . “
205625	205630	205623	205623	Harry	136	” said Ron bleakly . “
205685	205686	205687	205687	He	159	” “
205702	205706	205707	205707	He	159	” said Ginny . “
205719	205720	205721	205721	His	159	” “
205726	205730	205721	205721	His	159	” said Ron . “
205740	205741	205750	205750	he	159	” “
205744	205749	205750	205750	he	159	” Ginny went on , “
205787	205788	205773	205773	he	159	” “
205795	205800	205801	205801	Fred	217	” said Ron bitterly . “
205824	205825	205826	205826	We	3867	” “
205834	205838	205826	205826	We	3867	” said Ginny . “
205917	205918	205913	205913	they	584	” “
205921	205926	205927	205927	Ron	201	” said Lupin hoarsely , “
206017	206018	206006	206006	Gibbon	545	” “
206025	206029	206030	206030	He	159	” asked Harry . “
206050	206054	206043	206043	they	584	” said Lupin . “
206094	206095	206073	206073	he	545	” “
206110	206118	206120	206120	you	3896	” said Harry , turning to Hermione , “
206123	206124	206120	206120	you	3896	” “
206132	206142	206120	206120	you	3896	” whispered Hermione , her eyes sparkling with tears , “
206260	206261	206253	206253	he	205	” “
206264	206269	206253	206253	he	205	” Harry urged her . “
206277	206287	206288	206288	He	205	” said Hermione in a high - pitched whisper . “
206317	206339	206340	206340	We	3898	” She covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers , so that her voice was muffled . “
206395	206396	206389	206389	we	3898	” “
206403	206408	206409	206409	Hermione	180	” said Lupin firmly . “
206432	206433	206423	206423	he	205	” “
206440	206479	206481	206481	he	205	” said Harry , who was watching Snape running up the marble staircase in his mind ’s eye , his black robes billowing behind him as ever , pulling his wand from under his cloak as he ascended , “
206491	206492	206493	206493	We	3907	” “
206502	206510	206511	206511	Gibbon	545	” said Tonks in a low voice . “
206602	206603	206590	206590	Neville	162	” “
206611	206615	206590	206590	Neville	162	” said Ron , “
206642	206643	206617	206620	that massive Death Eater	3913	” “
206650	206654	206657	206657	he	205	” said Tonks , “
206661	206662	206657	206657	he	205	” “
206691	206695	206698	206698	him	205	” said Ginny . “
206712	206716	206698	206698	him	205	” said Lupin . “
206731	206732	206733	206733	He	205	” “
206743	206747	206751	206751	he	205	” whispered McGonagall . “
206784	206785	206786	206786	He	205	” “
206789	206794	206786	206786	He	205	” said Harry savagely , “
206831	206832	206826	206826	he	205	” “
206863	206867	206868	206868	We	3907	” said Lupin . “
206902	206903	206904	206904	We	3907	” “
206910	206918	206904	206904	We	3907	” said Tonks in a hollow voice . “
206963	206964	206965	206965	He	205	” “
206974	206978	206979	206979	He	205	” said Harry . “
206989	207113	206979	206979	He	205	” They all fell silent . Fawkes ’s lament was still echoing over the dark grounds outside . As the music reverberated upon the air , unbidden , unwelcome thoughts slunk into Harry ’s mind ... Had they taken Dumbledore ’s body from the foot of the tower yet ? What would happen to it next ? Where would it rest ? He clenched his fists tightly in his pockets . He could feel the small cold lump of the fake Horcrux against the knuckles of his right hand . The doors of the hospital wing burst open , making them all jump : Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were striding up the ward , Fleur just behind them , her beautiful face terrified . “
207118	207131	207116	207116	Arthur	206	” said Professor McGonagall , jumping up and hurrying to greet them . “
207137	207138	207139	207139	Bill	226	” “
207141	207160	207139	207139	Bill	226	” whispered Mrs. Weasley , darting past Professor McGonagall as she caught sight of Bill ’s mangled face . “
207165	207203	207139	207139	Bill	226	” Lupin and Tonks had got up hastily and retreated so that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could get nearer to the bed . Mrs. Weasley bent over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody forehead . “
207210	207218	207204	207204	You	0	” Mr. Weasley asked Professor McGonagall distractedly . “
207237	207238	207239	207239	We	3924	” “
207245	207255	207239	207239	We	3924	” said Professor McGonagall , looking helplessly at Lupin . “
207265	207269	207263	207263	Arthur	206	” said Lupin . “
207293	207313	207315	207315	Dumbledore	138	” Mrs. Weasley took the nasty - smelling ointment from Madam Pomfrey and began dabbing at Bill ’s wounds . “
207317	207322	207323	207323	Minerva	544	” said Mr. Weasley . “
207334	207374	207375	207375	Dumbledore	138	” As Professor McGonagall nodded , Harry felt Ginny move beside him and looked at her . Her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur , who was gazing down at Bill with a frozen expression on her face . “
207378	207407	207375	207375	Dumbledore	138	” whispered Mr. Weasley , but Mrs. Weasley had eyes only for her eldest son ; she began to sob , tears falling onto Bill ’s mutilated face . “
207452	207453	207443	207443	he	226	” “
207462	207469	207457	207457	you	3926	” said Fleur suddenly and loudly . “
207485	207498	207472	207472	you	3926	” Mrs. Weasley raised her tear - stained face , looking startled . “
207504	207505	207472	207472	you	3926	” “
207517	207521	207472	207472	you	3926	” demanded Fleur . “
207536	207537	207544	207544	I	0	” “
207546	207547	207544	207544	I	0	” “
207553	207574	207550	207550	e	226	” said Fleur , drawing herself up to her full height and throwing back her long mane of silver hair . “
207588	207589	207550	207550	e	226	” “
207598	207603	207550	207550	e	226	” said Mrs. Weasley , “
207615	207616	207617	207617	You	3926	” “
207633	207641	207617	207617	You	3926	” said Fleur , her nostrils flaring . “
207681	207742	207676	207676	I	0	” she added fiercely , pushing Mrs. Weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her . Mrs. Weasley fell back against her husband and watched Fleur mopping up Bill ’s wounds with a most curious expression upon her face . Nobody said anything ; Harry did not dare move . Like everybody else , he was waiting for the explosion . “
207749	207758	207746	207747	Auntie Muriel	390	” said Mrs. Weasley after a long pause , “
207803	207804	207784	207784	She	390	” “
207808	207813	207784	207784	She	390	” said Fleur stiffly . “
207822	207875	207814	207814	I	0	” And then , Harry did not quite see how it happened , both women were crying and hugging each other . Completely bewildered , wondering whether the world had gone mad , he turned around : Ron looked as stunned as he felt and Ginny and Hermione were exchanging startled looks . “
207879	207891	207814	207814	I	0	” said a strained voice . Tonks was glaring at Lupin . “
207911	207912	207906	207906	She	390	” “
207917	207930	207906	207906	She	390	” said Lupin , barely moving his lips and looking suddenly tense . “
207944	207945	207947	207947	I	0	” “
207958	207973	207974	207974	I	0	” said Tonks , seizing the front of Lupin ’s robes and shaking them . “
207982	208042	207974	207974	I	0	” And the meaning of Tonks ’s Patronus and her mouse - colored hair , and the reason she had come running to find Dumbledore when she had heard a rumor someone had been attacked by Greyback , all suddenly became clear to Harry ; it had not been Sirius that Tonks had fallen in love with after all . “
208052	208067	208044	208044	I	0	” said Lupin , refusing to meet her eyes , staring at the floor , “
208082	208083	208084	208084	I	0	” “
208100	208116	208098	208098	Remus	211	” said Mrs. Weasley over Fleur ’s shoulder as she patted her on the back . “
208123	208128	208117	208117	I	0	” said Lupin steadily . “
208136	208137	208129	208129	Tonks	210	” “
208143	208153	208139	208139	she	210	” said Mr. Weasley , with a small smile . “
208170	208182	208158	208158	Remus	211	” He gestured sadly at his son , lying between them . “
208193	208207	208158	208158	Remus	211	” said Lupin , avoiding everybody ’s eyes as he looked around distractedly . “
208212	208213	208214	208214	Dumbledore	138	” “
208234	208285	208214	208214	Dumbledore	138	” said Professor McGonagall curtly , just as the hospital doors opened again and Hagrid walked in . The little of his face that was not obscured by hair or beard was soaking and swollen ; he was shaking with tears , a vast , spotted handkerchief in his hand . “
208296	208300	208304	208304	him	0	” he choked . “
208347	208348	208338	208339	Professor Slughorn	200	” “
208354	208375	208352	208352	Hagrid	177	” said Professor McGonagall , standing up at once and turning to look at the group around Bill ’s bed . “
208422	208443	208413	208413	I	0	” As Hagrid nodded , turned , and shuffled out of the room again , she looked down at Harry . “
208466	208472	208474	208474	you	4397	” Harry stood up , murmured “
208478	208764	208765	208765	Harry	136	” to Ron , Hermione , and Ginny , and followed Professor McGonagall back down the ward . The corridors outside were deserted and the only sound was the distant phoenix song . It was several minutes before Harry became aware that they were not heading for Professor McGonagall ’s office , but for Dumbledore ’s , and another few seconds before he realized that of course , she had been deputy headmistress ... Apparently she was now headmistress ... so the room behind the gargoyle was now hers . In silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the circular office . He did not know what he had expected : that the room would be draped in black , perhaps , or even that Dumbledore ’s body might be lying there . In fact , it looked almost exactly as it had done when he and Dumbledore had left it mere hours previously : the silver instruments whirring and puffing on their spindle - legged tables , Gryffindor ’s sword in its glass case gleaming in the moonlight , the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the desk . But Fawkes ’s perch stood empty , he was still crying his lament to the grounds . And a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts : Dumbledore was slumbering in a golden frame over the desk , his half - moon spectacles perched upon his crooked nose , looking peaceful and untroubled . After glancing once at this portrait , Professor McGonagall made an odd movement as though steeling herself , then rounded the desk to look at Harry , her face taut and lined . “
208767	208771	208765	208765	Harry	136	” she said , “
208792	208793	208794	208794	I	0	” “
208803	208850	208851	208851	Harry	136	” said Harry . He had expected the question and had his answer ready . It had been here , in this very room , that Dumbledore had told him that he was to confide the contents of their lessons to nobody but Ron and Hermione . “
208858	208863	208851	208851	Harry	136	” said Professor McGonagall . “
208867	208871	208875	208875	he	138	” said Harry , “
208884	208891	208875	208875	he	138	” Professor McGonagall glared at him . “
208893	208904	208875	208875	he	138	” — Harry registered the renewed use of his surname — “
208926	208927	208916	208916	you	0	” “
208934	208940	208928	208928	I	0	” said Harry , shrugging . “
208955	208956	208941	208942	Professor Dumbledore	138	” “
208959	208960	208941	208942	Professor Dumbledore	138	” “
209003	209004	208984	208984	she	171	” “
209007	209059	209060	209060	Snape	205	” said Professor McGonagall incredulously , but before she could go on , there was a knock on the door behind them and Professors Sprout , Flitwick , and Slughorn traipsed into the room , followed by Hagrid , who was still weeping copiously , his huge frame trembling with grief . “
209062	209076	209077	209077	Snape	205	” ejaculated Slughorn , who looked the most shaken , pale and sweating . “
209089	209129	209130	209130	Minerva	544	” But before any of them could respond to this , a sharp voice spoke from high on the wall : A sallow - faced wizard with a short black fringe had just walked back into his empty canvas . “
209148	209149	209140	209140	he	891	” “
209155	209168	209153	209153	Everard	548	” said Professor McGonagall , and she turned quickly to her teachers . “
209183	209188	209169	209169	I	0	” she said quickly . “
209229	209230	209231	209231	I	0	” “
209244	209249	209231	209231	I	0	” said Professor Sprout . “
209272	209273	209250	209250	I	0	” “
209284	209298	209299	209299	Parents	3965	” said Slughorn , now dabbing his sweating brow with a silken handkerchief . “
209361	209362	209363	209363	I	0	” “
209366	209371	209363	209363	I	0	” said Professor McGonagall . “
209439	209440	209441	209441	We	3958	” “
209447	209477	209444	209445	the governors	3975	” said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice ; he had a large bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in Snape ’s office . “
209493	209494	209495	209495	Hagrid	177	” “
209503	209508	209497	209497	you	177	” said Professor McGonagall . “
209520	209546	209550	209550	Professor	237	” Hagrid , who had been weeping silently into his large , spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation , now raised puffy red eyes and croaked , “
209566	209567	209568	209569	Professor Dumbledore	138	” “
209575	209581	209568	209569	Professor Dumbledore	138	” said Professor McGonagall kindly , “
209586	209587	209585	209585	I.	177	” “
209595	209618	209590	209590	I	0	” said Hagrid , fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard . “
209662	209678	209655	209655	I	0	” He gulped and disappeared behind his handkerchief once more , and there was silence . “
209682	209706	209655	209655	I	0	” said Professor McGonagall , glancing out of the window at the grounds , checking to see whether the Minister was yet approaching , “
209732	209766	209712	209712	Filius	543	“ Now , as to getting students home ... there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than later . We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come tomorrow if necessary — ”
209767	209774	209776	209776	Harry	136	“ What about Dumbledore ’s funeral ? ”
209782	209785	209787	209788	Professor McGonagall	237	“ Well ... ”
209801	209822	209797	209797	her	237	“ I — I know that it was Dumbledore ’s wish to be laid to rest here , at Hogwarts — ”
209823	209835	209837	209837	Harry	136	“ Then that ’s what ’ll happen , is n’t it ? ”
209840	209848	209850	209851	Professor McGonagall	237	“ If the Ministry thinks it appropriate , ”
209853	209863	209850	209851	Professor McGonagall	237	“ No other headmaster or headmistress has ever been — ”
209864	209877	209879	209879	Hagrid	177	“ No other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school , ”
209881	209891	209893	209894	Professor Flitwick	433	“ Hogwarts should be Dumbledore ’s final resting place , ”
209896	209899	209901	209902	Professor Sprout	311	“ Absolutely , ”
209904	209910	209912	209912	Harry	136	“ And in that case , ”
209914	209934	209912	209912	Harry	136	“ you should n’t send the students home until the funeral ’s over . They ’ll want to say — ”
209952	209957	209944	209945	Professor Sprout	311	“ Good - bye . ”
209958	209962	209964	209965	Professor Flitwick	433	“ Well said , ”
209967	209989	209964	209965	Professor Flitwick	433	“ Well said indeed ! Our students should pay tribute , it is fitting . We can arrange transport home afterward . ”
209990	209993	209995	209996	Professor Sprout	311	“ Seconded , ”
209998	210004	210006	210006	Slughorn	200	“ I suppose ... yes ... ”
210023	210028	210030	210031	Professor McGonagall	237	“ He ’s coming , ”
210040	210057	210030	210031	Professor McGonagall	237	“ The Minister ... and by the looks of it , he ’s brought a delegation ... ”
210058	210065	210067	210067	Harry	136	“ Can I leave , Professor ? ”
210089	210093	210095	210096	Professor McGonagall	237	“ You may , ”
210098	210102	210103	210103	She	237	“ And quickly . ”
210188	210193	210195	210197	the Fat Lady	2014	“ Is it true ? ”
210203	210213	210195	210197	the Fat Lady	2014	“ It is really true ? Dumbledore — dead ? ”
210214	210217	210219	210219	Harry	136	“ Yes , ”
210361	210370	210372	210372	Harry	136	“ They ’re talking about closing the school , ”
210374	210380	210382	210382	Ron	201	“ Lupin said they would , ”
210389	210392	210394	210394	Ron	201	“ So ? ”
210412	210428	210403	210403	he	201	“ Did you find one ? Did you get it ? A — a Horcrux ? ”
210460	210467	210469	210469	Ron	201	“ You did n’t get it ? ”
210474	210480	210469	210469	Ron	201	“ It was n’t there ? ”
210481	210484	210486	210486	Harry	136	“ No , ”
210488	210502	210486	210486	Harry	136	“ Someone had already taken it and left a fake in its place . ”
210503	210508	210469	210469	Ron	201	“ Already taken — ? ”
210561	210564	210566	210566	Ron	201	“ R.A.B. , ”
210568	210574	210566	210566	Ron	201	“ but who was that ? ”
210575	210578	210580	210580	Harry	136	“ Dunno , ”
211139	211153	211155	211155	Fleur	224	“ . . . so eet ees lucky ’ e is marrying me , ”
211164	211179	211155	211155	Fleur	224	“ because ze British overcook their meat , I ’ ave always said this . ”
211180	211200	211202	211202	Ginny	222	“ I suppose I ’m just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her , ”
211234	211241	211243	211243	Harry	136	“ She ’s not that bad , ”
211245	211250	211251	211251	he	136	“ Ugly , though , ”
211269	211283	211262	211262	she	222	“ Well , I suppose if Mum can stand it , I can . ”
211284	211291	211292	211292	Ron	201	“ Anyone else we know died ? ”
211313	211316	211317	211317	she	180	“ No , ”
211326	211337	211317	211317	she	180	“ They ’re still looking for Snape but no sign ... ”
211338	211345	211347	211347	Harry	136	“ Of course there is n’t , ”
211359	211385	211347	211347	Harry	136	“ They wo n’t find Snape till they find Voldemort , and seeing as they ’ve never managed to do that in all this time ... ”
211386	211395	211397	211397	Ginny	222	“ I ’m going to go to bed , ”
211399	211418	211419	211419	She	222	“ I have n’t been sleeping that well since ... well ... I could do with some sleep . ”
211468	211482	211465	211465	her	180	“ Harry , I found something out this morning , in the library . ”
211483	211486	211488	211488	Harry	136	“ R.A.B. ? ”
211788	211791	211792	211792	she	180	“ No , ”
211796	211892	211792	211792	she	180	“ I ’ve been trying , Harry , but I have n’t found anything ... There are a couple of reasonably well - known wizards with those initials — Rosalind Antigone Bungs ... Rupert ‘ Axebanger ’ Brookstanton ... but they do n’t seem to fit at all . Judging by that note , the person who stole the Horcrux knew Voldemort , and I ca n’t find a shred of evidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything to do with him ... No , actually , it ’s about ... well , Snape . ”
211902	211907	211909	211909	Harry	136	“ What about him ? ”
211918	211938	211939	211939	she	180	“ Well , it ’s just that I was sort of right about the Half - Blood Prince business , ”
211943	211962	211939	211939	she	180	“ D’you have to rub it in , Hermione ? How d’you think I feel about that now ? ”
211963	211976	211977	211977	she	180	“ No — no — Harry , I did n’t mean that ! ”
211992	212017	211977	211977	she	180	“ It ’s just that I was right about Eileen Prince once owning the book . You see ... she was Snape ’s mother ! ”
212018	212029	212031	212031	Ron	201	“ I thought she was n’t much of a looker , ”
212037	212078	212033	212033	Hermione	180	“ I was going through the rest of the old Prophets and there was a tiny announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape , and then later an announcement saying that she ’d given birth to a — ”
212079	212083	212085	212085	Harry	136	“ — murderer , ”
212087	212092	212094	212094	Hermione	180	“ Well ... yes , ”
212096	212134	212094	212094	Hermione	180	“ So ... I was sort of right . Snape must have been proud of being ‘ half a Prince , ’ you see ? Tobias Snape was a Muggle from what it said in the Prophet . ”
212135	212141	212143	212143	Harry	136	“ Yeah , that fits , ”
212145	212221	212222	212222	He	136	“ He ’d play up the pure - blood side so he could get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them ... He ’s just like Voldemort . Pure - blood mother , Muggle father ... ashamed of his parentage , trying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts , gave himself an impressive new name — Lord Voldemort — the Half - Blood Prince — how could Dumbledore have missed — ? ”
212310	212328	212330	212330	Ron	201	“ I still do n’t get why he did n’t turn you in for using that book , ”
212332	212345	212330	212330	Ron	201	“ He must ’ve known where you were getting it all from . ”
212346	212350	212352	212352	Harry	136	“ He knew , ”
212355	212406	212352	212352	Harry	136	“ He knew when I used Sectumsempra . He did n’t really need Legilimency ... He might even have known before then , with Slughorn talking about how brilliant I was at Potions ... Should n’t have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard , should he ? ”
212407	212417	212330	212330	Ron	201	“ But why did n’t he turn you in ? ”
212418	212432	212434	212434	Hermione	180	“ I do n’t think he wanted to associate himself with that book , ”
212436	212499	212434	212434	Hermione	180	“ I do n’t think Dumbledore would have liked it very much if he ’d known . And even if Snape pretended it had n’t been his , Slughorn would have recognized his writing at once . Anyway , the book was left in Snape ’s old classroom , and I ’ll bet Dumbledore knew his mother was called ‘ Prince . ’ ”
212500	212510	212512	212512	Harry	136	“ I should ’ve shown the book to Dumbledore , ”
212514	212541	212512	212512	Harry	136	“ All that time he was showing me how Voldemort was evil even when he was at school , and I had proof Snape was too — ”
212542	212551	212553	212553	Hermione	180	“ ‘ Evil ’ is a strong word , ”
212556	212570	212553	212553	Hermione	180	“ You were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous ! ”
212571	212615	212512	212512	Harry	136	“ I ’m trying to say , Harry , that you ’re putting too much blame on yourself . I thought the Prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humor , but I would never have guessed he was a potential killer ... ”
212616	212629	212631	212631	Ron	201	“ None of us could ’ve guessed Snape would ... you know , ”
213190	213196	213197	213197	she	237	“ It is nearly time , ”
213200	213217	213197	213197	she	237	“ Please follow your Heads of Houses out into the grounds . Gryffindors , after me . ”
213960	213964	213966	213966	Ginny	222	“ In there , ”
214442	214446	214426	214426	he	4105	“ Nobility of spirit ”
214448	214451	214426	214426	he	4105	“ intellectual contribution ”
214453	214457	214426	214426	he	4105	“ greatness of heart ”
214490	214493	214482	214482	Dumbledore	138	“ nitwit , ”
214494	214497	214482	214482	Dumbledore	138	“ oddment , ”
214498	214501	214482	214482	Dumbledore	138	“ blubber , ”
214503	214506	214482	214482	Dumbledore	138	“ tweak , ”
215263	215267	215258	215258	she	222	“ Be careful , ”
215269	215275	215258	215258	she	222	“ Do n’t do it , ”
215312	215317	215318	215318	he	136	“ Ginny , listen ... ”
215341	215366	215367	215367	She	222	“ I ca n’t be involved with you anymore . We ’ve got to stop seeing each other . We ca n’t be together . ”
215376	215390	215367	215367	She	222	“ It ’s for some stupid , noble reason , is n’t it ? ”
215391	215413	215415	215415	Harry	136	“ It ’s been like ... like something out of someone else ’s life , these last few weeks with you , ”
215417	215436	215437	215437	She	222	“ But I ca n’t ... we ca n’t ... I ’ve got things to do alone now . ”
215448	215513	215442	215442	she	222	“ Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to . He ’s already used you as bait once , and that was just because you ’re my best friend ’s sister . Think how much danger you ’ll be in if we keep this up . He ’ll know , he ’ll find out . He ’ll try and get to me through you . ”
215514	215522	215524	215524	Ginny	222	“ What if I do n’t care ? ”
215527	215531	215533	215533	Harry	136	“ I care , ”
215535	215555	215533	215533	Harry	136	“ How do you think I ’d feel if this was your funeral ... and it was my fault ... ”
215566	215575	215576	215576	she	222	“ I never really gave up on you , ”
215579	215647	215576	215576	she	222	“ Not really . I always hoped ... Hermione told me to get on with life , maybe go out with some other people , relax a bit around you , because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room , remember ? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more — myself . ”
215648	215655	215657	215657	Harry	136	“ Smart girl , that Hermione , ”
215663	215684	215657	215657	Harry	136	“ I just wish I ’d asked you sooner . We could ’ve had ages ... months ... years maybe ... ”
215685	215697	215699	215699	Ginny	222	“ But you ’ve been too busy saving the Wizarding world , ”
215704	215747	215699	215699	Ginny	222	“ Well ... I ca n’t say I ’m surprised . I knew this would happen in the end . I knew you would n’t be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort . Maybe that ’s why I like you so much . ”
215864	215867	215868	215868	He	136	“ Harry ! ”
215888	215910	215871	215872	Rufus Scrimgeour	140	“ I ’ve been hoping to have a word ... do you mind if I walk a little way with you ? ”
215911	215914	215916	215916	Harry	136	“ No , ”
215924	215933	215935	215935	Scrimgeour	140	“ Harry , this was a dreadful tragedy , ”
215938	215977	215935	215935	Scrimgeour	140	“ I can not tell you how appalled I was to hear of it . Dumbledore was a very great wizard . We had our disagreements , as you know , but no one knows better than I — ”
215978	215984	215986	215986	Harry	136	“ What do you want ? ”
216007	216016	216017	216017	he	140	“ You are , of course , devastated , ”
216020	216050	216017	216017	he	140	“ I know that you were very close to Dumbledore . I think you may have been his favorite pupil ever . The bond between the two of you — ”
216051	216057	216058	216058	Harry	136	“ What do you want ? ”
216085	216105	216080	216080	his	140	“ The word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died . ”
216106	216110	216112	216112	Harry	136	“ Whose word ? ”
216114	216147	216112	216112	Harry	136	“ Somebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the tower after Dumbledore died . There were also two broomsticks up there . The Ministry can add two and two , Harry . ”
216148	216154	216156	216156	Harry	136	“ Glad to hear it , ”
216158	216182	216156	216156	Harry	136	“ Well , where I went with Dumbledore and what we did is my business . He did n’t want people to know . ”
216183	216192	216194	216194	Scrimgeour	140	“ Such loyalty is admirable , of course , ”
216206	216218	216194	216194	Scrimgeour	140	“ but Dumbledore is gone , Harry . He ’s gone . ”
216219	216236	216238	216238	Harry	136	“ He will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him , ”
216246	216259	216244	216244	himself	136	“ My dear boy ... even Dumbledore can not return from the — ”
216260	216282	216283	216283	Scrimgeour	140	“ I am not saying he can . You would n’t understand . But I ’ve got nothing to tell you . ”
216301	216332	216333	216333	Harry	136	“ The Ministry can offer you all sorts of protection , you know , Harry . I would be delighted to place a couple of my Aurors at your service — ”
216336	216361	216333	216333	Harry	136	“ Voldemort wants to kill me himself , and Aurors wo n’t stop him . So thanks for the offer , but no thanks . ”
216362	216365	216367	216367	Scrimgeour	140	“ So , ”
216374	216384	216369	216369	his	140	“ the request I made of you at Christmas — ”
216385	216410	216369	216369	his	140	“ What request ? Oh yeah ... the one where I tell the world what a great job you ’re doing in exchange for — ”
216411	216419	216421	216421	Scrimgeour	140	“ — for raising everyone ’s morale ! ”
216430	216436	216423	216423	Harry	136	“ Released Stan Shunpike yet ? ”
216449	216455	216446	216447	Uncle Vernon	166	“ I see you are — ”
216456	216464	216466	216466	Harry	136	“ Dumbledore ’s man through and through , ”
216468	216473	216474	216474	Scrimgeour	140	“ That ’s right . ”
216573	216579	216580	216580	Hermione	180	“ What did Scrimgeour want ? ”
216583	216591	216593	216593	Harry	136	“ Same as he wanted at Christmas , ”
216595	216614	216593	216593	Harry	136	“ Wanted me to give him inside information on Dumbledore and be the Ministry ’s new poster boy . ”
216632	216643	216626	216626	he	201	“ Look , let me go back and hit Percy ! ”
216644	216647	216648	216648	she	180	“ No , ”
216656	216664	216665	216665	Harry	136	“ It ’ll make me feel better ! ”
216686	216700	216701	216701	she	180	“ I ca n’t bear the idea that we might never come back , ”
216705	216711	216701	216701	she	180	“ How can Hogwarts close ? ”
216712	216718	216720	216720	Ron	201	“ Maybe it wo n’t , ”
216722	216770	216720	216720	Ron	201	“ We ’re not in any more danger here than we are at home , are we ? Everywhere ’s the same now . I ’d even say Hogwarts is safer , there are more wizards inside to defend the place . What d’you reckon , Harry ? ”
216771	216783	216785	216785	Harry	136	“ I ’m not coming back even if it does reopen , ”
216797	216814	216793	216793	Hermione	180	“ I knew you were going to say that . But then what will you do ? ”
216815	216833	216835	216835	Harry	136	“ I ’m going back to the Dursleys ’ once more , because Dumbledore wanted me to , ”
216837	216855	216835	216835	Harry	136	“ But it ’ll be a short visit , and then I ’ll be gone for good . ”
216856	216871	216793	216793	Hermione	180	“ But where will you go if you do n’t come back to school ? ”
216872	216884	216885	216885	Harry	136	“ I thought I might go back to Godric ’s Hollow , ”
216905	216943	216888	216888	He	136	“ For me , it started there , all of it . I ’ve just got a feeling I need to go there . And I can visit my parents ’ graves , I ’d like that . ”
216944	216949	216951	216951	Ron	201	“ And then what ? ”
216953	216971	216973	216973	Harry	136	“ Then I ’ve got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes , have n’t I ? ”
216995	217093	217094	217094	he	4146	“ That ’s what he wanted me to do , that ’s why he told me all about them . If Dumbledore was right — and I ’m sure he was — there are still four of them out there . I ’ve got to find them and destroy them , and then I ’ve got to go after the seventh bit of Voldemort ’s soul , the bit that ’s still in his body , and I ’m the one who ’s going to kill him . And if I meet Severus Snape along the way , ”
217097	217112	217094	217094	he	4146	“ so much the better for me , so much the worse for him . ”
217153	217161	217163	217163	Ron	201	“ We ’ll be there , Harry , ”
217165	217168	217163	217163	Ron	201	“ What ? ”
217169	217178	217180	217180	Ron	201	“ At your aunt and uncle ’s house , ”
217182	217195	217180	217180	Ron	201	“ And then we ’ll go with you wherever you ’re going . ”
217196	217199	217201	217201	Harry	136	“ No — ”
217227	217235	217237	217237	Hermione	180	“ You said to us once before , ”
217240	217262	217237	217237	Hermione	180	“ that there was time to turn back if we wanted to . We ’ve had time , have n’t we ? ”
217263	217271	217273	217273	Ron	201	“ We ’re with you whatever happens , ”
217275	217304	217273	217273	Ron	201	“ But mate , you ’re going to have to come round my mum and dad ’s house before we do anything else , even Godric ’s Hollow . ”
217305	217308	217237	217237	Hermione	180	“ Why ? ”
217309	217318	217319	217319	Harry	136	“ Bill and Fleur ’s wedding , remember ? ”
217344	217353	217354	217354	he	136	“ Yeah , we should n’t miss that , ”
