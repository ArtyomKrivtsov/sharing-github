13679	13765	13667	13667	Fudge	175	“ Eat , Harry , you look dead on your feet . Now then ... You will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing - up of Miss Marjorie Dursley . Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago . Miss Dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified . She has no recollection of the incident at all . So that ’s that , and no harm done . ”
13814	13829	13831	13831	Fudge	175	“ Ah , you ’re worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle ? ”
13833	13872	13831	13831	Fudge	175	“ Well , I wo n’t deny that they are extremely angry , Harry , but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays . ”
13878	13891	13892	13892	he	121	“ I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays , ”
13895	13909	13892	13892	he	121	“ and I do n’t ever want to go back to Privet Drive . ”
13910	13928	13930	13930	Fudge	175	“ Now , now , I ’m sure you ’ll feel differently once you ’ve calmed down , ”
13936	13962	13930	13930	Fudge	175	“ They are your family , after all , and I ’m sure you are fond of each other — er — very deep down . ”
13989	13995	13997	13997	Fudge	175	“ So all that remains , ”
14006	14037	13997	13997	Fudge	175	“ is to decide where you ’re going to spend the last three weeks of your vacation . I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and — ”

14081	14102	14104	14104	Fudge	175	“ Oh , my dear boy , we ’re not going to punish you for a little thing like that ! ”
14111	14131	14104	14104	Fudge	175	“ It was an accident ! We do n’t send people to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts ! ”
14150	14174	14175	14175	he	121	“ Last year , I got an official warning just because a house - elf smashed a pudding in my uncle ’s house ! ”
14181	14201	14175	14175	he	121	“ The Ministry of Magic said I ’d be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magic there ! ”
14216	14243	14210	14210	Fudge	175	“ Circumstances change , Harry ... We have to take into account ... in the present climate ... Surely you do n’t want to be expelled ? ”
14244	14251	14253	14253	Harry	121	“ Of course I do n’t , ”
14255	14266	14268	14268	Fudge	175	“ Well then , what ’s all the fuss about ? ”
14270	14293	14268	14268	Fudge	175	“ Now , have a crumpet , Harry , while I go and see if Tom ’s got a room for you . ”
14376	14384	14386	14386	Fudge	175	“ Room eleven ’s free , Harry , ”
14388	14456	14386	14386	Fudge	175	“ I think you ’ll be very comfortable . Just one thing , and I ’m sure you ’ll understand ... I do n’t want you wandering off into Muggle London , all right ? Keep to Diagon Alley . And you ’re to be back here before dark each night . Sure you ’ll understand . Tom will be keeping an eye on you for me . ”
14457	14460	14462	14462	Harry	121	“ Okay , ”
14465	14470	14462	14462	Harry	121	“ but why — ? ”
14471	14483	14485	14485	Fudge	175	“ Do n’t want to lose you again , do we ? ”
14491	14506	14485	14485	Fudge	175	“ No , no ... best we know where you are ... I mean ... ”

14561	14607	14509	14509	his	175	“ What ’s that ? Oh , you ’ve heard — well , no , not yet , but it ’s only a matter of time . The Azkaban guards have never yet failed ... and they are angrier than I ’ve ever seen them . ”
14612	14622	14608	14608	Fudge	175	“ So , I ’ll say good - bye . ”
14639	14650	14623	14623	He	175	“ Er — Minister ? Can I ask you something ? ”
14651	14654	14656	14656	Fudge	175	“ Certainly , ”
14661	14692	14623	14623	He	175	“ Well , third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade , but my aunt and uncle did n’t sign the permission form . D’you think you could — ? ”
14698	14701	14702	14702	he	175	“ Ah , ”
14705	14727	14702	14702	he	175	“ No , no , I ’m very sorry , Harry , but as I ’m not your parent or guardian — ”
14728	14737	14739	14739	Harry	121	“ But you ’re the Minister of Magic , ”
14742	14749	14739	14739	Harry	121	“ If you gave me permission — ”
14750	14764	14766	14766	Fudge	175	“ No , I ’m sorry , Harry , but rules are rules , ”
14769	14809	14766	14766	Fudge	175	“ Perhaps you ’ll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year . In fact , I think it ’s best if you do n’t ... yes ... well , I ’ll be off . Enjoy your stay , Harry . ”
14836	14846	14847	14847	he	181	“ If you ’ll follow me , Mr. Potter , ”
14850	14859	14847	14847	he	181	“ I ’ve already taken your things up ... ”
14915	14918	14919	14919	Harry	121	“ Hedwig ! ”

14949	14974	14947	14947	Tom	181	“ Arrived about five minutes after you did . If there ’s anything you need , Mr. Potter , do n’t hesitate to ask . ”

17416	17499	17411	17411	Ron	151	“ Famous Harry Potter and all that . I ’d hate to see what the Ministry’d do to me if I blew up an aunt . Mind you , they ’d have to dig me up first , because Mum would ’ve killed me . Anyway , you can ask Dad yourself this evening . We ’re staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too ! So you can come to King ’s Cross with us tomorrow ! Hermione ’s there as well ! ”
17505	17520	17500	17500	Hermione	133	“ Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things . ”
17521	17524	17526	17526	Harry	121	“ Excellent ! ”
17529	17542	17526	17526	Harry	121	“ So , have you got all your new books and stuff ? ”
17543	17548	17550	17550	Ron	151	“ Look at this , ”
17565	17591	17592	17592	He	151	“ Brand - new wand . Fourteen inches , willow , containing one unicorn tail - hair . And we ’ve got all our books — ”
17602	17622	17592	17592	He	151	“ What about those Monster Books , eh ? The assistant nearly cried when we said we wanted two . ”
17623	17631	17632	17632	Harry	121	“ What ’s all that , Hermione ? ”
17650	17666	17668	17668	Hermione	133	“ Well , I ’m taking more new subjects than you , are n’t I ? ”
17670	17693	17668	17668	Hermione	133	“ Those are my books for Arithmancy , Care of Magical Creatures , Divination , Study of Ancient Runes , Muggle Studies — ”
17694	17703	17705	17705	Ron	151	“ What are you doing Muggle Studies for ? ”
17713	17734	17708	17708	his	151	“ You ’re Muggle - born ! Your mum and dad are Muggles ! You already know all about Muggles ! ”
17735	17751	17753	17753	Hermione	133	“ But it ’ll be fascinating to study them from the Wizarding point of view , ”
17756	17771	17773	17773	Harry	121	“ Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year , Hermione ? ”
17783	17791	17792	17792	she	133	“ I ’ve still got ten Galleons , ”
17799	17823	17792	17792	she	133	“ It ’s my birthday in September , and Mum and Dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday present . ”
17824	17831	17833	17833	Ron	151	“ How about a nice book ? ”
17836	17845	17847	17847	Hermione	133	“ No , I do n’t think so , ”
17850	17870	17847	17847	Hermione	133	“ I really want an owl . I mean , Harry ’s got Hedwig and you ’ve got Errol — ”
17871	17876	17878	17878	Ron	151	“ I have n’t , ”
17880	17894	17895	17895	He	151	“ Errol ’s a family owl . All I ’ve got is Scabbers . ”
17905	17915	17916	17916	he	151	“ And I want to get him checked over , ”
17929	17939	17916	17916	he	151	“ I do n’t think Egypt agreed with him . ”
17957	17968	17970	17970	Harry	121	“ There ’s a magical creature shop just over there , ”
17981	18000	17970	17970	Harry	121	“ You could see if they ’ve got anything for Scabbers , and Hermione can get her owl . ”
18221	18227	18228	18228	he	151	“ It ’s my rat , ”
18233	18251	18228	18228	he	151	“ He ’s been a bit off - color ever since I brought him back from Egypt . ”
18252	18259	18261	18262	the witch	751	“ Bang him on the counter , ”
18354	18357	18359	18360	the witch	751	“ Hm , ”
18366	18373	18359	18360	the witch	751	“ How old is this rat ? ”
18374	18377	18379	18379	Ron	151	“ Dunno , ”
18381	18393	18379	18379	Ron	151	“ Quite old . He used to belong to my brother . ”
18394	18401	18403	18404	the witch	751	“ What powers does he have ? ”
18410	18413	18403	18404	the witch	751	“ Er — ”
18455	18466	18467	18467	she	751	“ He ’s been through the mill , this one , ”
18470	18482	18484	18484	Ron	151	“ He was like that when Percy gave him to me , ”
18487	18509	18511	18512	the witch	751	“ An ordinary common or garden rat like this ca n’t be expected to live longer than three years or so , ”
18514	18537	18511	18512	the witch	751	“ Now , if you were looking for something a bit more hard - wearing , you might like one of these — ”
18553	18558	18550	18550	Ron	151	“ Show - offs . ”
18559	18577	18579	18580	the witch	751	“ Well , if you do n’t want a replacement , you can try this rat tonic , ”
18594	18597	18599	18599	Ron	151	“ Okay , ”
18601	18607	18599	18599	Ron	151	“ How much — OUCH ! ”
18641	18648	18650	18651	the witch	751	“ NO , CROOKSHANKS , NO ! ”
18681	18684	18685	18685	Ron	151	“ Scabbers ! ”
18739	18744	18722	18722	Ron	151	“ What was that ? ”
18745	18759	18761	18761	Harry	121	“ It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger , ”
18763	18768	18722	18722	Ron	151	“ Where ’s Hermione ? ”
18769	18775	18776	18776	They	763	“ Probably getting her owl — ”
18818	18824	18826	18826	Ron	151	“ You bought that monster ? ”
18833	18842	18844	18844	Hermione	133	“ He ’s gorgeous , is n’t he ? ”
18915	18924	18926	18926	Ron	151	“ Hermione , that thing nearly scalped me ! ”
18928	18940	18942	18942	Hermione	133	“ He did n’t mean to , did you , Crookshanks ? ”
18944	18950	18952	18952	Ron	151	“ And what about Scabbers ? ”
18963	18982	18952	18952	Ron	151	“ He needs rest and relaxation ! How ’s he going to get it with that thing around ? ”
18983	18994	18996	18996	Hermione	133	“ That reminds me , you forgot your rat tonic , ”
19008	19049	18996	18996	Hermione	133	“ And stop worrying , Crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours , what ’s the problem ? Poor Crookshanks , that witch said he ’d been in there for ages ; no one wanted him . ”
19050	19055	19057	19057	Ron	151	“ I wonder why , ”
19082	19085	19086	19086	he	140	“ Harry ! ”
19095	19100	19086	19086	he	140	“ How are you ? ”
19101	19106	19108	19108	Harry	121	“ Fine , thanks , ”
19147	19157	19158	19158	he	121	“ They still have n’t caught him , then ? ”
19161	19164	19166	19167	Mr. Weasley	140	“ No , ”
19173	19198	19166	19167	Mr. Weasley	140	“ They ’ve pulled us all off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him , but no luck so far . ”
19199	19210	19212	19212	Ron	151	“ Would we get a reward if we caught him ? ”
19214	19225	19212	19212	Ron	151	“ It ’d be good to get some more money — ”
19226	19234	19236	19237	Mr. Weasley	140	“ Do n’t be ridiculous , Ron , ”
19247	19280	19236	19237	Mr. Weasley	140	“ Black ’s not going to be caught by a thirteen - year - old wizard . It ’s the Azkaban guards who ’ll get him back , you mark my words . ”
19378	19380	19372	19372	She	144	“ Hello ”
19406	19415	19397	19397	he	147	“ Harry . How nice to see you . ”
19416	19421	19423	19423	Harry	121	“ Hello , Percy , ”
19430	19437	19439	19439	Percy	147	“ I hope you ’re well ? ”
19455	19461	19439	19439	Percy	147	“ Very well , thanks — ”
19462	19465	19467	19467	Fred	148	“ Harry ! ”
19479	19489	19467	19467	Fred	148	“ Simply splendid to see you , old boy — ”
19490	19493	19495	19495	George	149	“ Marvelous , ”
19508	19512	19495	19495	George	149	“ Absolutely spiffing . ”
19516	19523	19525	19526	Mrs. Weasley	143	“ That ’s enough , now , ”
19528	19531	19533	19533	Fred	148	“ Mum ! ”
19548	19556	19536	19536	he	148	“ How really corking to see you — ”
19557	19565	19567	19568	Mrs. Weasley	143	“ I said , that ’s enough , ”
19578	19594	19595	19595	She	143	“ Hello , Harry , dear . I suppose you ’ve heard our exciting news ? ”
19609	19617	19618	19618	she	143	“ Second Head Boy in the family ! ”
19625	19629	19630	19630	Fred	148	“ And last , ”
19636	19643	19645	19646	Mrs. Weasley	143	“ I do n’t doubt that , ”
19651	19662	19645	19646	Mrs. Weasley	143	“ I notice they have n’t made you two prefects . ”
19663	19673	19675	19675	George	149	“ What do we want to be prefects for ? ”
19684	19695	19675	19675	George	149	“ It ’d take all the fun out of life . ”
19699	19711	19713	19714	Mrs. Weasley	143	“ You want to set a better example for your sister ! ”
19716	19730	19732	19732	Percy	147	“ Ginny ’s got other brothers to set her an example , Mother , ”
19735	19745	19732	19732	Percy	147	“ I ’m going up to change for dinner ... ”
19754	19764	19765	19765	he	147	“ We tried to shut him in a pyramid , ”
19769	19775	19765	19765	he	147	“ But Mum spotted us . ”
19813	19826	19828	19828	Fred	148	“ How ’re we getting to King ’s Cross tomorrow , Dad ? ”
19838	19848	19850	19851	Mr. Weasley	140	“ The Ministry ’s providing a couple of cars , ”
19859	19862	19864	19864	Percy	147	“ Why ? ”
19867	19876	19878	19878	George	149	“ It ’s because of you , Perce , ”
19881	19897	19878	19878	George	149	“ And there ’ll be little flags on the hoods , with HB on them — ”
19898	19904	19906	19906	Fred	148	“ — for Humongous Bighead , ”
19919	19929	19930	19930	Percy	147	“ Why are the Ministry providing cars , Father ? ”
19939	19950	19952	19953	Mr. Weasley	140	“ Well , as we have n’t got one anymore , ”
19955	19970	19952	19953	Mr. Weasley	140	“ — and as I work there , they ’re doing me a favor — ”
20002	20008	20010	20011	Mrs. Weasley	143	“ Good thing , too , ”
20014	20048	20010	20011	Mrs. Weasley	143	“ Do you realize how much luggage you ’ve all got between you ? A nice sight you ’d be on the Muggle Underground ... You are all packed , are n’t you ? ”
20049	20063	20065	20065	Percy	147	“ Ron has n’t put all his new things in his trunk yet , ”
20074	20083	20065	20065	Percy	147	“ He ’s dumped them on my bed . ”
20084	20106	20107	20108	Mrs. Weasley	143	“ You ’d better go and pack properly , Ron , because we wo n’t have much time in the morning , ”
20196	20213	20192	20192	Percy	147	“ It was here , on the bedside table , I took it off for polishing — ”
20214	20224	20225	20225	Ron	151	“ I have n’t touched it , all right ? ”
20229	20234	20236	20236	Harry	121	“ What ’s up ? ”
20238	20246	20248	20248	Percy	147	“ My Head Boy badge is gone , ”
20254	20262	20264	20264	Ron	151	“ So ’s Scabbers ’s rat tonic , ”
20275	20287	20264	20264	Ron	151	“ I think I might ’ve left it in the bar — ”
20288	20301	20303	20303	Percy	147	“ You ’re not going anywhere till you ’ve found my badge ! ”
20305	20317	20318	20318	Harry	121	“ I ’ll get Scabbers ’s stuff , I ’m packed , ”
20404	20414	20415	20416	Mr. Weasley	140	“ ... makes no sense not to tell him , ”
20421	20454	20415	20416	Mr. Weasley	140	“ Harry ’s got a right to know . I ’ve tried to tell Fudge , but he insists on treating Harry like a child . He ’s thirteen years old and — ”
20455	20464	20466	20467	Mrs. Weasley	143	“ Arthur , the truth would terrify him ! ”
20470	20498	20466	20467	Mrs. Weasley	143	“ Do you really want to send Harry back to school with that hanging over him ? For heaven ’s sake , he ’s happy not knowing ! ”
20499	20518	20520	20521	Mr. Weasley	140	“ I do n’t want to make him miserable , I want to put him on his guard ! ”
20523	20600	20520	20521	Mr. Weasley	140	“ You know what Harry and Ron are like , wandering off by themselves — they ’ve even ended up in the Forbidden Forest ! But Harry must n’t do that this year ! When I think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home ! If the Knight Bus had n’t picked him up , I ’m prepared to bet he would have been dead before the Ministry found him . ”
20601	20618	20466	20467	Mrs. Weasley	143	“ But he ’s not dead , he ’s fine , so what ’s the point — ”
20619	20708	20520	20521	Mr. Weasley	140	“ Molly , they say Sirius Black ’s mad , and maybe he is , but he was clever enough to escape from Azkaban , and that ’s supposed to be impossible . It ’s been a month , and no one ’s seen hide nor hair of him , and I do n’t care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet , we ’re no nearer catching Black than inventing self - spelling wands . The only thing we know for sure is what Black ’s after — ”
20709	20719	20466	20467	Mrs. Weasley	143	“ But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts . ”
20720	20742	20520	20521	Mr. Weasley	140	“ We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe . If Black can break out of Azkaban , he can break into Hogwarts . ”
20743	20756	20466	20467	Mrs. Weasley	143	“ But no one ’s really sure that Black ’s after Harry — ”
20778	20910	20772	20772	his	140	“ Molly , how many times do I have to tell you ? They did n’t report it in the press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet , but Fudge went out to Azkaban the night Black escaped . The guards told Fudge that Black ’s been talking in his sleep for a while now . Always the same words : ‘ He ’s at Hogwarts ... he ’s at Hogwarts . ’ Black is deranged , Molly , and he wants Harry dead . If you ask me , he thinks murdering Harry will bring You - Know - Who back to power . Black lost everything the night Harry stopped You - Know - Who , and he ’s had twelve years alone in Azkaban to brood on that ... ”
20929	20973	20772	20772	his	140	“ Well , Arthur , you must do what you think is right . But you ’re forgetting Albus Dumbledore . I do n’t think anything could hurt Harry at Hogwarts while Dumbledore ’s headmaster . I suppose he knows about all this ? ”
20974	21012	20772	20772	his	140	“ Of course he knows . We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds . He was n’t happy about it , but he agreed . ”
21013	21032	20772	20772	his	140	“ Not happy ? Why should n’t he be happy , if they ’re there to catch Black ? ”
21033	21043	21045	21046	Mr. Weasley	140	“ Dumbledore is n’t fond of the Azkaban guards , ”
21049	21084	21045	21046	Mr. Weasley	140	“ Nor am I , if it comes to that ... but when you ’re dealing with a wizard like Black , you sometimes have to join forces with those you ’d rather avoid . ”
21085	21091	20772	20772	his	140	“ If they save Harry — ”
21092	21104	21106	21107	Mr. Weasley	140	“ — then I will never say another word against them , ”
21110	21123	21106	21107	Mr. Weasley	140	“ It ’s late , Molly , we ’d better go up ... ”
21241	21247	21248	21248	Fred	148	“ We ’ve got it , ”
21253	21260	21248	21248	Fred	148	“ We ’ve been improving it . ”
21642	21651	21652	21652	Harry	121	“ I ’m not going to be murdered , ”
21657	21665	21667	21667	his	121	“ That ’s the spirit , dear , ”
21723	21735	21736	21736	he	151	“ The sooner we get on the train , the better , ”
21739	21769	21770	21770	Ron	151	“ At least I can get away from Percy at Hogwarts . Now he ’s accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of Penelope Clearwater . You know , ”
21773	21793	21770	21770	Ron	151	“ his girlfriend . She ’s hidden her face under the frame because her nose has gone all blotchy ... ”
21794	21803	21804	21804	Harry	121	“ I ’ve got something to tell you , ”
21878	21884	21885	21885	Ron	151	“ What were you saying ? ”
21893	21896	21897	21897	Harry	121	“ Later , ”
21974	21982	21983	21983	Hermione	133	“ It ’s all right , Crookshanks , ”
21989	21999	21983	21983	Hermione	133	“ I ’ll let you out on the train . ”
22000	22005	22007	22007	Ron	151	“ You wo n’t , ”
22009	22017	22007	22007	Ron	151	“ What about poor Scabbers , eh ? ”
22056	22061	22062	22062	he	140	“ They ’re here , ”
22065	22071	22062	22062	he	140	“ Harry , come on . ”
22112	22119	22121	22122	Mr. Weasley	140	“ In you get , Harry , ”
22274	22278	22279	22279	he	140	“ Right then , ”
22286	22310	22279	22279	he	140	“ Let ’s do this in pairs , as there are so many of us . I ’ll go through first with Harry . ”
22432	22439	22441	22441	Percy	147	“ Ah , there ’s Penelope ! ”
22593	22604	22605	22605	she	143	“ Do take care , wo n’t you , Harry ? ”
22626	22660	22618	22618	she	143	“ I ’ve made you all sandwiches ... Here you are , Ron ... no , they ’re not corned beef ... Fred ? Where ’s Fred ? Here you are , dear ... ”
22661	22664	22666	22667	Mr. Weasley	140	“ Harry , ”
22670	22677	22666	22667	Mr. Weasley	140	“ come over here a moment . ”
22701	22715	22717	22718	Mr. Weasley	140	“ There ’s something I ’ve got to tell you before you leave — ”
22725	22734	22736	22736	Harry	121	“ It ’s all right , Mr. Weasley , ”
22738	22743	22736	22736	Harry	121	“ I already know . ”
22744	22753	22689	22689	him	140	“ You know ? How could you know ? ”
22754	22775	22776	22776	Harry	121	“ I — er — I heard you and Mrs. Weasley talking last night . I could n’t help hearing , ”
22780	22783	22776	22776	Harry	121	“ Sorry — ”
22784	22800	22802	22803	Mr. Weasley	140	“ That ’s not the way I ’d have chosen for you to find out , ”
22808	22836	22689	22689	him	140	“ No — honestly , it ’s okay . This way , you have n’t broken your word to Fudge and I know what ’s going on . ”
22837	22846	22776	22776	Harry	121	“ Harry , you must be very scared — ”
22847	22852	22854	22854	Harry	121	“ I ’m not , ”
22857	22860	22861	22861	he	121	“ Really , ”
22871	22896	22865	22866	Mr. Weasley	140	“ I ’m not trying to be a hero , but seriously , Sirius Black ca n’t be worse than Voldemort , can he ? ”
22910	22943	22897	22898	Mr. Weasley	140	“ Harry , I knew you were , well , made of stronger stuff than Fudge seems to think , and I ’m obviously pleased that you ’re not scared , but — ”
22944	22947	22949	22950	Mrs. Weasley	143	“ Arthur ! ”
22962	22976	22949	22950	Mrs. Weasley	143	“ Arthur , what are you doing ? It ’s about to go ! ”
22977	22984	22986	22987	Mr. Weasley	140	“ He ’s coming , Molly ! ”
23006	23018	22990	22990	he	140	“ Listen , I want you to give me your word — ”
23019	23034	23036	23036	Harry	121	“ — that I ’ll be a good boy and stay in the castle ? ”
23039	23043	23045	23046	Mr. Weasley	140	“ Not entirely , ”
23059	23073	23045	23046	Mr. Weasley	140	“ Harry , swear to me you wo n’t go looking for Black . ”
23077	23080	23074	23074	Harry	121	“ What ? ”
23100	23106	23108	23109	Mr. Weasley	140	“ Promise me , Harry , ”
23116	23121	23108	23109	Mr. Weasley	140	“ that whatever happens — ”
23122	23137	23139	23139	Harry	121	“ Why would I go looking for someone I know wants to kill me ? ”
23142	23152	23108	23109	Mr. Weasley	140	“ Swear to me that whatever you might hear — ”
23153	23158	23160	23161	Mrs. Weasley	143	“ Arthur , quickly ! ”
23220	23230	23231	23231	Harry	121	“ I need to talk to you in private , ”
23244	23250	23252	23252	Ron	151	“ Go away , Ginny , ”
23254	23261	23263	23263	Ginny	144	“ Oh , that ’s nice , ”
23399	23406	23407	23407	Ron	151	“ Who d’you reckon he is ? ”
23428	23434	23436	23436	Hermione	133	“ Professor R. J. Lupin , ”
23440	23446	23436	23436	Hermione	133	“ How d’you know that ? ”
23447	23454	23455	23455	she	133	“ It ’s on his case , ”
23503	23509	23511	23511	Ron	151	“ Wonder what he teaches ? ”
23521	23526	23528	23528	Hermione	133	“ That ’s obvious , ”
23530	23547	23528	23528	Hermione	133	“ There ’s only one vacancy , is n’t there ? Defense Against the Dark Arts . ”
23583	23594	23596	23596	Ron	151	“ Well , I hope he ’s up to it , ”
23599	23617	23618	23618	He	151	“ He looks like one good hex would finish him off , does n’t he ? Anyway ... ”
23623	23632	23618	23618	He	151	“ What were you going to tell us ? ”
23678	23710	23671	23671	She	133	“ Sirius Black escaped to come after you ? Oh , Harry ... you ’ll have to be really , really careful . Do n’t go looking for trouble , Harry — ”
23711	23720	23722	23722	Harry	121	“ I do n’t go looking for trouble , ”
23726	23732	23722	23722	Harry	121	“ Trouble usually finds me . ”
23733	23754	23756	23756	Ron	151	“ How thick would Harry have to be , to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him ? ”
23786	23797	23799	23799	Ron	151	“ No one knows how he got out of Azkaban , ”
23802	23821	23799	23799	Ron	151	“ No one ’s ever done it before . And he was a top - security prisoner too . ”
23822	23833	23835	23835	Hermione	133	“ But they ’ll catch him , wo n’t they ? ”
23838	23854	23835	23835	Hermione	133	“ I mean , they ’ve got all the Muggles looking out for him too ... ”
23855	23861	23863	23863	Ron	151	“ What ’s that noise ? ”
23885	23895	23897	23897	Ron	151	“ It ’s coming from your trunk , Harry , ”
23940	23946	23948	23948	Hermione	133	“ Is that a Sneakoscope ? ”
23958	23971	23972	23972	Ron	151	“ Yeah ... mind you , it ’s a very cheap one , ”
23975	23995	23972	23972	Ron	151	“ It went haywire just as I was tying it to Errol ’s leg to send it to Harry . ”
23996	24006	24008	24008	Hermione	133	“ Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time ? ”
24011	24050	24008	24008	Hermione	133	“ No ! Well ... I was n’t supposed to be using Errol . You know he ’s not really up to long journeys ... but how else was I supposed to get Harry ’s present to him ? ”
24051	24059	24060	24060	Harry	121	“ Stick it back in the trunk , ”
24068	24076	24060	24060	Harry	121	“ or it ’ll wake him up . ”
24114	24123	24125	24125	Ron	151	“ We could get it checked in Hogsmeade , ”
24131	24154	24125	24125	Ron	151	“ They sell that sort of thing in Dervish and Banges , magical instruments and stuff . Fred and George told me . ”
24155	24163	24165	24165	Hermione	133	“ Do you know much about Hogsmeade ? ”
24168	24184	24165	24165	Hermione	133	“ I ’ve read it ’s the only entirely non - Muggle settlement in Britain — ”
24185	24193	24195	24195	Ron	151	“ Yeah , I think it is , ”
24203	24222	24195	24195	Ron	151	“ but that ’s not why I want to go . I just want to get inside Honeydukes ! ”
24223	24228	24230	24230	Hermione	133	“ What ’s that ? ”
24232	24238	24240	24240	Ron	151	“ It ’s this sweetshop , ”
24250	24304	24240	24240	Ron	151	“ where they ’ve got everything ... Pepper Imps — they make you smoke at the mouth — and great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted cream , and really excellent sugar quills , which you can suck in class and just look like you ’re thinking what to write next — ”
24305	24318	24319	24319	Hermione	133	“ But Hogsmeade ’s a very interesting place , is n’t it ? ”
24324	24359	24319	24319	Hermione	133	“ In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion , and the Shrieking Shack ’s supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain — ”
24360	24382	24384	24384	Ron	151	“ — and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while you ’re sucking them , ”
24404	24422	24398	24398	Hermione	133	“ Wo n’t it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade ? ”
24423	24429	24431	24431	Harry	121	“ ’ Spect it will , ”
24434	24447	24431	24431	Harry	121	“ You ’ll have to tell me when you ’ve found out . ”
24448	24453	24455	24455	Ron	151	“ What d’you mean ? ”
24457	24478	24398	24398	Hermione	133	“ I ca n’t go . The Dursleys did n’t sign my permission form , and Fudge would n’t either . ”
24483	24504	24479	24479	Ron	151	“ You ’re not allowed to come ? But — no way — McGonagall or someone will give you permission — ”
24523	24543	24398	24398	Hermione	133	“ — or we can ask Fred and George , they know every secret passage out of the castle — ”
24544	24547	24549	24549	Hermione	133	“ Ron ! ”
24552	24570	24549	24549	Hermione	133	“ I do n’t think Harry should be sneaking out of school with Black on the loose — ”
24571	24588	24590	24590	Harry	121	“ Yeah , I expect that ’s what McGonagall will say when I ask for permission , ”
24593	24601	24603	24603	Ron	151	“ But if we ’re with him , ”
24608	24614	24603	24603	Ron	151	“ Black would n’t dare — ”
24615	24625	24627	24627	Hermione	133	“ Oh , Ron , do n’t talk rubbish , ”
24629	24665	24627	24627	Hermione	133	“ Black ’s already murdered a whole bunch of people in the middle of a crowded street . Do you really think he ’s going to worry about attacking Harry just because we ’re there ? ”
24680	24688	24689	24689	Ron	151	“ Do n’t let that thing out ! ”
24728	24734	24722	24722	he	151	“ Get out of here ! ”
24735	24741	24743	24743	Hermione	133	“ Ron , do n’t ! ”
24857	24866	24867	24867	Ron	151	“ D’you think we should wake him up ? ”
24876	24887	24867	24867	Ron	151	“ He looks like he could do with some food . ”
24894	24899	24900	24900	she	133	“ Er — Professor ? ”
24903	24909	24900	24900	she	133	“ Excuse me — Professor ? ”
24915	24922	24927	24927	she	751	“ Do n’t worry , dear , ”
24937	24955	24927	24927	she	751	“ If he ’s hungry when he wakes , I ’ll be up front with the driver . ”
24956	24963	24965	24965	Ron	151	“ I suppose he is asleep ? ”
24976	24988	24968	24969	the witch	751	“ I mean — he has n’t died , has he ? ”
24989	24998	25000	25000	Hermione	133	“ No , no , he ’s breathing , ”
25188	25196	25198	25198	Malfoy	203	“ Well , look who it is , ”
25211	25217	25200	25200	his	203	“ Potty and the Weasel . ”
25224	25241	25243	25243	Malfoy	203	“ I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer , Weasley , ”
25245	25253	25243	25243	Malfoy	203	“ Did your mother die of shock ? ”
25274	25279	25281	25281	Malfoy	203	“ Who ’s that ? ”
25293	25297	25299	25299	Harry	121	“ New teacher , ”
25318	25326	25299	25299	Harry	121	“ What were you saying , Malfoy ? ”
25349	25353	25354	25354	he	203	“ C’m on , ”
25378	25392	25393	25393	he	203	“ I ’m not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year , ”
25397	25423	25393	25393	he	203	“ I mean it . If he makes one more crack about my family , I ’m going to get hold of his head and — ”
25432	25435	25437	25437	Hermione	133	“ Ron , ”
25444	25448	25437	25437	Hermione	133	“ be careful ... ”
25515	25522	25524	25524	Ron	151	“ We must be nearly there , ”
25554	25557	25559	25559	Ron	151	“ Great , ”
25575	25588	25559	25559	Ron	151	“ I ’m starving . I want to get to the feast ... ”
25589	25597	25602	25602	her	133	“ We ca n’t be there yet , ”
25605	25612	25559	25559	Ron	151	“ So why ’re we stopping ? ”
25716	25722	25724	25724	Ron	151	“ What ’s going on ? ”
25731	25734	25736	25736	Hermione	133	“ Ouch ! ”
25738	25746	25736	25736	Hermione	133	“ Ron , that was my foot ! ”
25756	25764	25747	25747	Harry	121	“ D’you think we ’ve broken down ? ”
25765	25768	25783	25783	Ron	151	“ Dunno ... ”
25796	25804	25805	25805	Ron	151	“ There ’s something moving out there , ”
25808	25816	25805	25805	Ron	151	“ I think people are coming aboard ... ”
25831	25846	25823	25823	someone	581	“ Sorry — d’you know what ’s going on ? — Ouch — sorry — ”
25847	25852	25854	25854	Harry	121	“ Hullo , Neville , ”
25869	25880	25823	25823	someone	581	“ Harry ? Is that you ? What ’s happening ? ”
25881	25888	25823	25823	someone	581	“ No idea — sit down — ”
25908	25923	25925	25925	Hermione	133	“ I ’m going to go and ask the driver what ’s going on , ”
25953	25958	25931	25931	her	133	“ Who ’s that ? ”
25959	25964	25931	25931	her	133	“ Who ’s that ? ”
25965	25968	25931	25931	her	133	“ Ginny ? ”
25969	25972	25931	25931	her	133	“ Hermione ? ”
25973	25979	25931	25931	her	133	“ What are you doing ? ”
25980	25987	25931	25931	her	133	“ I was looking for Ron — ”
25988	25995	25931	25931	her	133	“ Come in and sit down — ”
25996	26000	26002	26002	Harry	121	“ Not here ! ”
26005	26010	26002	26002	Harry	121	“ I ’m here ! ”
26011	26014	26016	26016	Neville	170	“ Ouch ! ”
26018	26021	25931	25931	her	133	“ Quiet ! ”
26094	26100	26101	26101	he	199	“ Stay where you are , ”
26422	26432	26433	26433	Someone	581	“ Harry ! Harry ! Are you all right ? ”
26439	26444	26433	26433	Someone	581	“ W - what ? ”
26546	26551	26552	26552	Ron	151	“ Are you okay ? ”
26556	26559	26561	26561	Harry	121	“ Yeah , ”
26575	26589	26569	26571	The hooded creature	917	“ What happened ? Where ’s that — that thing ? Who screamed ? ”
26590	26595	26597	26597	Ron	151	“ No one screamed , ”
26622	26628	26610	26610	Ginny	144	“ But I heard screaming — ”
26649	26652	26653	26653	he	199	“ Here , ”
26665	26673	26653	26653	he	199	“ Eat it . It ’ll help . ”
26684	26690	26691	26691	he	121	“ What was that thing ? ”
26695	26699	26701	26701	Lupin	199	“ A dementor , ”
26712	26720	26701	26701	Lupin	199	“ One of the dementors of Azkaban . ”
26741	26744	26745	26745	he	199	“ Eat , ”
26748	26764	26745	26745	he	199	“ It ’ll help . I need to speak to the driver , excuse me ... ”
26775	26785	26787	26787	Hermione	133	“ Are you sure you ’re okay , Harry ? ”
26793	26803	26805	26805	Harry	121	“ I do n’t get it ... What happened ? ”
26814	26850	26765	26765	He	199	“ Well — that thing — the dementor — stood there and looked around ( I mean , I think it did , I could n’t see its face ) — and you — you — ”
26851	26862	26864	26864	Ron	151	“ I thought you were having a fit or something , ”
26871	26887	26864	26864	Ron	151	“ You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching — ”
26888	26908	26910	26910	Hermione	133	“ And Professor Lupin stepped over you , and walked toward the dementor , and pulled out his wand , ”
26912	26966	26910	26910	Hermione	133	“ and he said , ‘ None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks . Go . ’ But the dementor did n’t move , so Lupin muttered something , and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it , and it turned around and sort of glided away ... ”
26967	26972	26974	26974	Neville	170	“ It was horrible , ”
26983	26996	26974	26974	Neville	170	“ Did you feel how cold it got when it came in ? ”
26997	27002	27004	27004	Ron	151	“ I felt weird , ”
27011	27020	27004	27004	Ron	151	“ Like I ’d never be cheerful again ... ”
27053	27066	27068	27068	Harry	121	“ But did n’t any of you — fall off your seats ? ”
27071	27074	27076	27076	Ron	151	“ No , ”
27084	27093	27076	27076	Ron	151	“ Ginny was shaking like mad , though ... ”
27163	27174	27146	27146	He	199	“ I have n’t poisoned that chocolate , you know ... ”
27197	27207	27209	27210	Professor Lupin	199	“ We ’ll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes , ”
27212	27220	27209	27210	Professor Lupin	199	“ Are you all right , Harry ? ”
27232	27235	27236	27236	he	121	“ Fine , ”
27308	27315	27368	27368	Hagrid	309	“ Firs ’ years this way ! ”
27359	27367	27368	27368	Hagrid	309	“ All righ ’ , you three ? ”
27645	27661	27631	27631	Harry	121	“ You fainted , Potter ? Is Longbottom telling the truth ? You actually fainted ? ”
27689	27695	27697	27697	Ron	151	“ Shove off , Malfoy , ”
27704	27713	27715	27715	Malfoy	203	“ Did you faint as well , Weasley ? ”
27718	27730	27715	27715	Malfoy	203	“ Did the scary old dementor frighten you too , Weasley ? ”
27731	27737	27782	27782	his	203	“ Is there a problem ? ”
27788	27797	27785	27785	he	203	“ Oh , no — er — Professor , ”
27911	27923	27952	27952	She	202	“ Potter ! Granger ! I want to see you both ! ”
28006	28025	28026	28026	she	202	“ There ’s no need to look so worried — I just want a word in my office , ”
28030	28037	28026	28026	she	202	“ Move along there , Weasley . ”
28108	28128	28098	28098	She	202	“ Professor Lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train , Potter . ”
28185	28190	28191	28191	he	121	“ I ’m fine , ”
28194	28201	28191	28191	he	121	“ I do n’t need anything — ”
28202	28212	28214	28215	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ Oh , it ’s you , is it ? ”
28228	28239	28214	28215	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ I suppose you ’ve been doing something dangerous again ? ”
28240	28248	28250	28251	Professor McGonagall	202	“ It was a dementor , Poppy , ”
28265	28272	28273	28273	she	208	“ Setting dementors around a school , ”
28286	28322	28273	28273	she	208	“ He wo n’t be the last one who collapses . Yes , he ’s all clammy . Terrible things , they are , and the effect they have on people who are already delicate — ”
28323	28329	28331	28331	Harry	121	“ I ’m not delicate ! ”
28334	28341	28343	28344	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ Of course you ’re not , ”
28352	28358	28360	28361	Professor McGonagall	202	“ What does he need ? ”
28364	28378	28360	28361	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Bed rest ? Should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing ? ”
28379	28384	28386	28386	Harry	121	“ I ’m fine ! ”
28411	28425	28427	28428	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ Well , he should have some chocolate , at the very least , ”
28441	28448	28450	28450	Harry	121	“ I ’ve already had some , ”
28452	28467	28450	28450	Harry	121	“ Professor Lupin gave me some . He gave it to all of us . ”
28468	28474	28476	28477	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ Did he , now ? ”
28480	28498	28476	28477	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ So we ’ve finally got a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies ? ”
28499	28510	28511	28512	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Are you sure you feel all right , Potter ? ”
28516	28519	28521	28521	Harry	121	“ Yes , ”
28523	28554	28476	28477	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ Very well . Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with Miss Granger about her course schedule , then we can go down to the feast together . ”
28689	28692	28694	28694	Hermione	133	“ Oh , ”
28697	28704	28694	28694	Hermione	133	“ we ’ve missed the Sorting ! ”
28831	28838	28839	28839	he	121	“ What was all that about ? ”
28962	28965	28967	28967	Dumbledore	213	“ Welcome ! ”
28976	29024	28967	28967	Dumbledore	213	“ Welcome to another year at Hogwarts ! I have a few things to say to you all , and as one of them is very serious , I think it best to get it out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast ... ”
29032	29070	29027	29027	his	213	“ As you will all be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express , our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of Azkaban , who are here on Ministry of Magic business . ”
29094	29105	29106	29106	Dumbledore	213	“ They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds , ”
29109	29147	29148	29148	he	213	“ and while they are with us , I must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission . Dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises — or even Invisibility Cloaks , ”
29161	29221	29222	29222	he	213	“ It is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses . I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you . I look to the prefects , and our new Head Boy and Girl , to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors , ”
29267	29273	29274	29274	he	213	“ On a happier note , ”
29277	29313	29274	29274	he	213	“ I am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year . First , Professor Lupin , who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher . ”
29360	29365	29366	29366	Ron	151	“ Look at Snape ! ”
29456	29464	29465	29465	Dumbledore	213	“ As to our second new appointment , ”
29477	29551	29465	29465	Dumbledore	213	“ Well , I am sorry to tell you that Professor Kettleburn , our Care of Magical Creatures teacher , retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs . However , I am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid , who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties . ”
29618	29624	29625	29625	Ron	151	“ We should ’ve known ! ”
29632	29643	29625	29625	Ron	151	“ Who else would have assigned us a biting book ? ”
29677	29688	29690	29690	Dumbledore	213	“ Well , I think that ’s everything of importance , ”
29692	29698	29690	29690	Dumbledore	213	“ Let the feast begin ! ”
29872	29877	29878	29878	Hermione	133	“ Congratulations , Hagrid ! ”
29888	29895	29897	29897	Hagrid	309	“ All down ter you three , ”
29913	29946	29907	29907	he	309	“ Can ’ believe it ... great man , Dumbledore ... came straight down to me hut after Professor Kettleburn said he ’d had enough ... It ’s what I always wanted ... ”
30018	30021	30008	30014	a fat lady in a pink dress	1014	“ Password ? ”
30022	30029	30030	30030	Percy	147	“ Coming through , coming through ! ”
30037	30047	30030	30030	Percy	147	“ The new password ’s ‘ Fortuna Major ’ ! ”
30048	30052	30058	30058	He	170	“ Oh no , ”
30197	30201	30203	30203	Hermione	133	“ Ignore him , ”
30211	30222	30203	30203	Hermione	133	“ Just ignore him , it ’s not worth it ... ”
30223	30228	30230	30231	Pansy Parkinson	217	“ Hey , Potter ! ”
30243	30255	30230	30231	Pansy Parkinson	217	“ Potter ! The dementors are coming , Potter ! Woooooooo ! ”
30271	30279	30281	30281	George	149	“ New third - year course schedules , ”
30287	30296	30281	30281	George	149	“ What ’s up with you , Harry ? ”
30297	30300	30302	30302	Ron	151	“ Malfoy , ”
30334	30339	30340	30340	he	151	“ That little git , ”
30344	30376	30340	30340	he	151	“ He was n’t so cocky last night when the dementors were down at our end of the train . Came running into our compartment , did n’t he , Fred ? ”
30377	30382	30384	30384	Fred	148	“ Nearly wet himself , ”
30393	30401	30403	30403	George	149	“ I was n’t too happy myself , ”
30405	30414	30403	30403	George	149	“ They ’re horrible things , those dementors ... ”
30415	30426	30428	30428	Fred	148	“ Sort of freeze your insides , do n’t they ? ”
30430	30442	30444	30444	Harry	121	“ You did n’t pass out , though , did you ? ”
30450	30456	30458	30458	George	149	“ Forget it , Harry , ”
30461	30517	30458	30458	George	149	“ Dad had to go out to Azkaban one time , remember , Fred ? And he said it was the worst place he ’d ever been , he came back all weak and shaking ... They suck the happiness out of a place , dementors . Most of the prisoners go mad in there . ”
30518	30534	30536	30536	Fred	148	“ Anyway , we ’ll see how happy Malfoy looks after our first Quidditch match , ”
30538	30551	30536	30536	Fred	148	“ Gryffindor versus Slytherin , first game of the season , remember ? ”
30595	30608	30609	30609	she	133	“ Ooh , good , we ’re starting some new subjects today , ”
30613	30616	30618	30618	Ron	151	“ Hermione , ”
30628	30656	30622	30622	he	151	“ they ’ve messed up your schedule . Look — they ’ve got you down for about ten subjects a day . There is n’t enough time . ”
30657	30671	30704	30704	Ron	151	“ I ’ll manage . I ’ve fixed it all with Professor McGonagall . ”
30672	30676	30678	30678	Ron	151	“ But look , ”
30682	30702	30678	30678	Ron	151	“ see this morning ? Nine o’clock , Divination . And underneath , nine o’clock , Muggle Studies . And ”
30713	30754	30704	30704	Ron	151	“ look — underneath that , Arithmancy , nine o’clock . I mean , I know you ’re good , Hermione , but no one ’s that good . How ’re you supposed to be in three classes at once ? ”
30755	30761	30763	30763	Hermione	133	“ Do n’t be silly , ”
30766	30779	30763	30763	Hermione	133	“ Of course I wo n’t be in three classes at once . ”
30780	30785	30704	30704	Ron	151	“ Well , then — ”
30786	30791	30793	30793	Hermione	133	“ Pass the marmalade , ”
30795	30798	30704	30704	Ron	151	“ But — ”
30799	30817	30818	30818	Hermione	133	“ Oh , Ron , what ’s it to you if my schedule ’s a bit full ? ”
30821	30835	30818	30818	Hermione	133	“ I told you , I ’ve fixed it all with Professor McGonagall . ”
30864	30869	30870	30870	he	309	“ All righ ’ ? ”
30883	30918	30870	30870	he	309	“ Yer in my firs ’ ever lesson ! Right after lunch ! Bin up since five gettin ’ everythin ’ ready ... Hope it ’s okay ... Me , a teacher ... hones’ly ... ”
30937	30946	30948	30948	Ron	151	“ Wonder what he ’s been getting ready ? ”
30979	31006	30973	30973	Ron	151	“ We ’d better go , look , Divination ’s at the top of North Tower . It ’ll take us ten minutes to get there ... ”
31093	31107	31108	31108	Ron	151	“ There ’s — got — to — be — a — shortcut , ”
31144	31152	31154	31154	Hermione	133	“ I think it ’s this way , ”
31165	31170	31172	31172	Ron	151	“ Ca n’t be , ”
31174	31194	31172	31172	Ron	151	“ That ’s south , look , you can see a bit of the lake out of the window ... ”
31286	31289	31290	31290	he	1039	“ Aha ! ”
31301	31331	31296	31296	Ron	151	“ What villains are these , that trespass upon my private lands ! Come to scorn at my fall , perchance ? Draw , you knaves , you dogs ! ”
31385	31391	31393	31393	Harry	121	“ Are you all right ? ”
31401	31414	31393	31393	Harry	121	“ Get back , you scurvy braggart ! Back , you rogue ! ”
31478	31481	31483	31483	Harry	121	“ Listen , ”
31493	31512	31483	31483	Harry	121	“ we ’re looking for the North Tower . You do n’t know the way , do you ? ”
31513	31517	31518	31519	The knight	1042	“ A quest ! ”
31535	31559	31527	31527	He	1042	“ Come follow me , dear friends , and we shall find our goal , or else shall perish bravely in the charge ! ”
31583	31598	31560	31560	He	1042	“ On foot then , good sirs and gentle lady ! On ! On ! ”
31646	31659	31661	31662	the knight	1042	“ Be of stout heart , the worst is yet to come ! ”
31731	31734	31736	31737	the knight	1042	“ Farewell ! ”
31752	31779	31736	31737	the knight	1042	“ Farewell , my comrades - in - arms ! If ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew , call upon Sir Cadogan ! ”
31780	31788	31790	31790	Ron	151	“ Yeah , we ’ll call you , ”
31796	31804	31790	31790	Ron	151	“ if we ever need someone mental . ”
31858	31867	31868	31868	Harry	121	“ ‘ Sybill Trelawney , Divination teacher , ’ ”
31871	31881	31868	31868	Harry	121	“ How ’re we supposed to get up there ? ”
31910	31914	31916	31916	Ron	151	“ After you , ”
32110	32115	32116	32116	Ron	151	“ Where is she ? ”
32136	32139	32092	32092	Ron	151	“ Welcome , ”
32143	32156	32092	32092	Ron	151	“ How nice to see you in the physical world at last . ”
32230	32238	32239	32239	she	222	“ Sit , my children , sit , ”
32268	32273	32275	32276	Professor Trelawney	222	“ Welcome to Divination , ”
32292	32327	32275	32276	Professor Trelawney	222	“ My name is Professor Trelawney . You may not have seen me before . I find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner Eye . ”
32345	32401	32336	32337	Professor Trelawney	222	“ So you have chosen to study Divination , the most difficult of all magical arts . I must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight , there is very little I will be able to teach you . Books can take you only so far in this field ... ”
32434	32468	32469	32470	Professor Trelawney	222	“ Many witches and wizards , talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings , are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future , ”
32486	32499	32500	32500	she	222	“ It is a Gift granted to few . You , boy , ”
32513	32519	32500	32500	she	222	“ Is your grandmother well ? ”
32520	32525	32527	32527	Neville	170	“ I think so , ”
32530	32544	32546	32547	Professor Trelawney	222	“ I would n’t be so sure if I were you , dear , ”
32566	32606	32607	32607	she	222	“ We will be covering the basic methods of Divination this year . The first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves . Next term we shall progress to palmistry . By the way , my dear , ”
32614	32622	32607	32607	she	222	“ beware a red - haired man . ”
32645	32651	32652	32653	Professor Trelawney	222	“ In the second term , ”
32657	32712	32652	32653	Professor Trelawney	222	“ we shall progress to the crystal ball — if we have finished with fire omens , that is . Unfortunately , classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu . I myself will lose my voice . And around Easter , one of our number will leave us forever . ”
32729	32735	32736	32736	she	222	“ I wonder , dear , ”
32752	32763	32736	32736	she	222	“ if you could pass me the largest silver teapot ? ”
32793	32818	32736	32736	she	222	“ Thank you , my dear . Incidentally , that thing you are dreading — it will happen on Friday the sixteenth of October . ”
32822	32936	32938	32938	she	222	“ Now , I want you all to divide into pairs . Collect a teacup from the shelf , come to me , and I will fill it . Then sit down and drink , drink until only the dregs remain . Swill these around the cup three times with the left hand , then turn the cup upside down on its saucer , wait for the last of the tea to drain away , then give your cup to your partner to read . You will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of Unfogging the Future . I shall move among you , helping and instructing . Oh , and dear ”
32951	32984	32938	32938	she	222	“ after you ’ve broken your first cup , would you be so kind as to select one of the blue - patterned ones ? I ’m rather attached to the pink . ”
33020	33040	33006	33007	Professor Trelawney	222	“ One of the blue ones , then , dear , if you would n’t mind ... thank you ... ”
33085	33088	33090	33090	Ron	151	“ Right , ”
33103	33111	33090	33090	Ron	151	“ What can you see in mine ? ”
33112	33120	33122	33122	Harry	121	“ A load of soggy brown stuff , ”
33139	33157	33158	33159	Professor Trelawney	222	“ Broaden your minds , my dears , and allow your eyes to see past the mundane ! ”
33172	33184	33185	33185	He	121	“ Right , you ’ve got a crooked sort of cross ... ”
33191	33241	33185	33185	He	121	“ That means you ’re going to have ‘ trials and suffering ’ — sorry about that — but there ’s a thing that could be the sun ... hang on ... that means ‘ great happiness ’ ... so you ’re going to suffer but be very happy ... ”
33242	33255	33257	33257	Ron	151	“ You need your Inner Eye tested , if you ask me , ”
33275	33279	33280	33280	Ron	151	“ My turn ... ”
33293	33305	33306	33306	he	151	“ There ’s a blob a bit like a bowler hat , ”
33309	33322	33306	33306	he	151	“ Maybe you ’re going to work for the Ministry of Magic ... ”
33332	33347	33348	33348	He	121	“ But this way it looks more like an acorn ... What ’s that ? ”
33357	33381	33382	33382	he	121	“ ‘ A windfall , unexpected gold . ’ Excellent , you can lend me some ... and there ’s a thing here , ”
33388	33414	33382	33382	he	121	“ that looks like an animal ... yeah , if that was its head ... it looks like a hippo ... no , a sheep ... ”
33428	33437	33438	33438	she	222	“ Let me see that , my dear , ”
33472	33485	33438	33438	she	222	“ The falcon ... my dear , you have a deadly enemy . ”
33486	33492	33494	33494	Hermione	133	“ But everyone knows that , ”
33506	33512	33514	33514	Hermione	133	“ Well , they do , ”
33516	33528	33514	33514	Hermione	133	“ Everybody knows about Harry and You - Know - Who . ”
33579	33597	33565	33565	her	222	“ The club ... an attack . Dear , dear , this is not a happy cup ... ”
33598	33607	33609	33609	Ron	151	“ I thought that was a bowler hat , ”
33612	33624	33565	33565	her	222	“ The skull ... danger in your path , my dear ... ”
33683	33710	33679	33679	her	222	“ My dear boy ... my poor , dear boy ... no ... it is kinder not to say ... no ... do n’t ask me ... ”
33711	33718	33720	33721	Dean Thomas	181	“ What is it , Professor ? ”
33760	33764	33765	33766	Professor Trelawney	222	“ My dear , ”
33773	33779	33765	33766	Professor Trelawney	222	“ you have the Grim . ”
33780	33784	33786	33786	Harry	121	“ The what ? ”
33827	33837	33839	33840	Professor Trelawney	222	“ The Grim , my dear , the Grim ! ”
33851	33877	33839	33840	Professor Trelawney	222	“ The giant , spectral dog that haunts churchyards ! My dear boy , it is an omen — the worst omen — of death ! ”
33941	33952	33953	33953	she	133	“ I do n’t think it looks like a Grim , ”
33965	33996	33957	33958	Professor Trelawney	222	“ You ’ll forgive me for saying so , my dear , but I perceive very little aura around you . Very little receptivity to the resonances of the future . ”
34008	34019	34020	34020	he	187	“ It looks like a Grim if you do this , ”
34029	34040	34041	34041	he	187	“ but it looks more like a donkey from here , ”
34049	34065	34067	34067	Harry	121	“ When you ’ve all finished deciding whether I ’m going to die or not ! ”
34085	34097	34102	34102	her	222	“ I think we will leave the lesson here for today , ”
34106	34115	34102	34102	her	222	“ Yes ... please pack away your things ... ”
34145	34151	34153	34154	Professor Trelawney	222	“ Until we meet again , ”
34157	34167	34169	34169	she	222	“ fair fortune be yours . Oh , and dear ”
34174	34193	34169	34169	she	222	“ you ’ll be late next time , so mind you work extra - hard to catch up . ”
34342	34353	34355	34356	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Really , what has got into you all today ? ”
34374	34396	34361	34361	herself	202	“ Not that it matters , but that ’s the first time my transformation ’s not got applause from a class . ”
34415	34439	34412	34412	her	133	“ Please , Professor , we ’ve just had our first Divination class , and we were reading the tea leaves , and — ”
34440	34446	34448	34449	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Ah , of course , ”
34454	34479	34448	34449	Professor McGonagall	202	“ There is no need to say any more , Miss Granger . Tell me , which of you will be dying this year ? ”
34485	34488	34490	34490	Harry	121	“ Me , ”
34494	34498	34500	34501	Professor McGonagall	202	“ I see , ”
34510	34573	34506	34506	her	202	“ Then you should know , Potter , that Sybill Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school . None of them has died yet . Seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class . If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my colleagues — ”
34596	34633	34589	34589	She	202	“ Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic . I shall not conceal from you that I have very little patience with it . True Seers are very rare , and Professor Trelawney — ”
34652	34693	34634	34634	She	202	“ You look in excellent health to me , Potter , so you will excuse me if I do n’t let you off homework today . I assure you that if you die , you need not hand it in . ”
34746	34754	34743	34743	Lavender	225	“ But what about Neville ’s cup ? ”
34774	34780	34782	34782	Hermione	133	“ Ron , cheer up , ”
34792	34800	34782	34782	Hermione	133	“ You heard what Professor McGonagall said . ”
34817	34820	34821	34821	he	151	“ Harry , ”
34831	34845	34821	34821	he	151	“ you have n’t seen a great black dog anywhere , have you ? ”
34846	34852	34854	34854	Harry	121	“ Yeah , I have , ”
34856	34868	34854	34854	Harry	121	“ I saw one the night I left the Dursleys ’ . ”
34878	34883	34885	34885	Hermione	133	“ Probably a stray , ”
34899	34916	34917	34917	he	151	“ Hermione , if Harry ’s seen a Grim , that ’s — that ’s bad , ”
34920	34939	34917	34917	he	151	“ My — my uncle Bilius saw one and — and he died twenty - four hours later ! ”
34940	34943	34945	34945	Hermione	133	“ Coincidence , ”
34954	34965	34967	34967	Ron	151	“ You do n’t know what you ’re talking about ! ”
34974	34985	34967	34967	Ron	151	“ Grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards ! ”
34986	34993	34995	34995	Hermione	133	“ There you are , then , ”
35001	35055	34995	34995	Hermione	133	“ They see the Grim and die of fright . The Grim ’s not an omen , it ’s the cause of death ! And Harry ’s still with us because he ’s not stupid enough to see one and think , right , well , I ’d better kick the bucket then ! ”
35083	35091	35092	35092	she	133	“ I think Divination seems very woolly , ”
35100	35111	35092	35092	she	133	“ A lot of guesswork , if you ask me . ”
35112	35124	35126	35126	Ron	151	“ There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup ! ”
35129	35147	35149	35149	Hermione	133	“ You did n’t seem quite so confident when you were telling Harry it was a sheep , ”
35152	35177	35178	35178	He	151	“ Professor Trelawney said you did n’t have the right aura ! You just do n’t like being bad at something for a change ! ”
35204	35249	35250	35250	She	133	“ If being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves , I ’m not sure I ’ll be studying it much longer ! That lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy class ! ”
35264	35271	35272	35272	he	151	“ What ’s she talking about ? ”
35277	35288	35272	35272	he	151	“ She has n’t been to an Arithmancy class yet . ”
35461	35472	35473	35473	he	309	“ C’m on , now , get a move on ! ”
35480	35503	35473	35473	he	309	“ Got a real treat for yeh today ! Great lesson comin ’ up ! Everyone here ? Right , follow me ! ”
35568	35577	35578	35578	he	309	“ Everyone gather ’ round the fence here ! ”
35581	35606	35578	35578	he	309	“ That ’s it — make sure yeh can see — now , firs ’ thing yeh’ll want ter do is open yer books — ”
35607	35610	35618	35619	Draco Malfoy	203	“ How ? ”
35621	35624	35626	35626	Hagrid	309	“ Eh ? ”
35628	35636	35637	35637	Malfoy	203	“ How do we open our books ? ”
35696	35710	35712	35712	Hagrid	309	“ Hasn ’ — hasn ’ anyone bin able ter open their books ? ”
35724	35731	35733	35733	Hagrid	309	“ Yeh’ve got ter stroke ’em , ”
35747	35750	35733	35733	Hagrid	309	“ Look — ”
35797	35807	35808	35808	Malfoy	203	“ Oh , how silly we ’ve all been ! ”
35811	35824	35808	35808	Malfoy	203	“ We should have stroked them ! Why did n’t we guess ! ”
35825	35834	35835	35835	Hagrid	309	“ I — I thought they were funny , ”
35841	35847	35849	35849	Malfoy	203	“ Oh , tremendously funny ! ”
35851	35866	35849	35849	Malfoy	203	“ Really witty , giving us books that try and rip our hands off ! ”
35867	35873	35875	35875	Harry	121	“ Shut up , Malfoy , ”
35894	35899	35901	35901	Hagrid	309	“ Righ ’ then , ”
35911	35946	35901	35901	Hagrid	309	“ so — so yeh’ve got yer books an ’ — an ’ — now yeh need the Magical Creatures . Yeah . So I ’ll go an ’ get ’em . Hang on ... ”
35960	35971	35973	35973	Malfoy	203	“ God , this place is going to the dogs , ”
35976	35992	35973	35973	Malfoy	203	“ That oaf teaching classes , my father’ll have a fit when I tell him — ”
35993	35999	36000	36000	Harry	121	“ Shut up , Malfoy , ”
36003	36015	35973	35973	Malfoy	203	“ Careful , Potter , there ’s a dementor behind you — ”
36016	36019	36021	36022	Lavender Brown	225	“ Oooooooh ! ”
36155	36161	36162	36162	he	309	“ Gee up , there ! ”
36196	36199	36200	36200	Hagrid	309	“ Hippogriffs ! ”
36210	36217	36200	36200	Hagrid	309	“ Beau’iful , aren ’ they ? ”
36284	36287	36289	36289	Hagrid	309	“ So , ”
36299	36310	36292	36292	his	309	“ if yeh wan ’ ter come a bit nearer — ”
36332	36351	36353	36353	Hagrid	309	“ Now , firs ’ thing yeh got ta know abou ’ hippogriffs is , they ’re proud , ”
36355	36378	36353	36353	Hagrid	309	“ Easily offended , hippogriffs are . Do n’t never insult one , ’cause it might be the last thing yeh do . ”
36411	36425	36426	36426	Hagrid	309	“ Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs ’ move , ”
36429	36487	36426	36426	Hagrid	309	“ It ’s polite , see ? Yeh walk toward him , and yeh bow , an ’ yeh wait . If he bows back , yeh’re allowed ter touch him . If he doesn ’ bow , then get away from him sharpish , ’cause those talons hurt . Right — who wants ter go first ? ”
36532	36536	36538	36538	Hagrid	309	“ No one ? ”
36545	36551	36553	36553	Harry	121	“ I ’ll do it , ”
36572	36584	36567	36567	Lavender	225	“ Oooh , no , Harry , remember your tea leaves ! ”
36596	36602	36604	36604	Hagrid	309	“ Good man , Harry ! ”
36606	36620	36604	36604	Hagrid	309	“ Right then — let ’s see how yeh get on with Buckbeak . ”
36667	36674	36676	36676	Hagrid	309	“ Easy , now , Harry , ”
36679	36702	36676	36676	Hagrid	309	“ Yeh’ve got eye contact , now try not ter blink ... Hippogriffs don ’ trust yeh if yeh blink too much ... ”
36737	36742	36744	36744	Hagrid	309	“ Tha ’s it , ”
36746	36757	36744	36744	Hagrid	309	“ Tha ’s it , Harry ... now , bow ... ”
36805	36808	36810	36810	Hagrid	309	“ Ah , ”

36856	36862	36864	36864	Hagrid	309	“ Well done , Harry ! ”

37001	37014	37016	37016	Hagrid	309	“ Yeh climb up there , jus ’ behind the wing joint , ”
37018	37038	37016	37016	Hagrid	309	“ an ’ mind yeh don ’ pull any of his feathers out , he won ’ like that ... ”
37080	37086	37088	37088	Hagrid	309	“ Go on , then ! ”
37293	37299	37301	37301	Hagrid	309	“ Good work , Harry ! ”
37313	37322	37310	37310	Goyle	205	“ Okay , who else wants a go ? ”
37417	37423	37424	37424	Malfoy	203	“ This is very easy , ”
37435	37461	37462	37462	he	121	“ I knew it must have been , if Potter could do it ... I bet you ’re not dangerous at all , are you ? ”
37468	37477	37462	37462	he	121	“ Are you , you great ugly brute ? ”
37528	37533	37534	37534	Malfoy	203	“ I ’m dying ! ”
37541	37555	37534	37534	Malfoy	203	“ I ’m dying , look at me ! It ’s killed me ! ”
37556	37562	37564	37564	Hagrid	309	“ Yer not dyin ’ ! ”

37656	37664	37666	37667	Pansy Parkinson	217	“ They should fire him straight away ! ”
37674	37681	37683	37684	Dean Thomas	181	“ It was Malfoy ’s fault ! ”
37706	37717	37719	37719	Pansy	217	“ I ’m going to see if he ’s okay ! ”
37763	37772	37774	37774	Hermione	133	“ D’you think he ’ll be all right ? ”
37777	37793	37795	37795	Harry	121	“ ’ Course he will . Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second , ”
37809	37830	37832	37832	Ron	151	“ That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid ’s first class , though , was n’t it ? ”
37837	37847	37832	37832	Ron	151	“ Trust Malfoy to mess things up for him ... ”
37872	37882	37884	37884	Hermione	133	“ They would n’t fire him , would they ? ”
37897	37903	37905	37905	Ron	151	“ They ’d better not , ”
37952	37968	37970	37970	Ron	151	“ Well , you ca n’t say it was n’t an interesting first day back , ”
38012	38023	38024	38024	Harry	121	“ There ’s a light on in Hagrid ’s window , ”
38034	38053	38028	38028	Ron	151	“ If we hurried , we could go down and see him . It ’s still quite early ... ”
38054	38060	38061	38061	Hermione	133	“ I do n’t know , ”
38073	38083	38084	38084	he	121	“ I ’m allowed to walk across the grounds , ”
38088	38102	38084	38084	he	121	“ Sirius Black has n’t got past the dementors here , has he ? ”
38171	38174	38163	38163	they	1154	“ C’min . ”
38240	38248	38249	38249	he	309	“ ’ Spect it ’s a record , ”
38258	38275	38249	38249	he	309	“ Don ’ reckon they ’ve ever had a teacher who lasted on’y a day before . ”
38276	38285	38287	38287	Hermione	133	“ You have n’t been fired , Hagrid ! ”
38289	38293	38295	38295	Hagrid	309	“ Not yet , ”
38309	38325	38295	38295	Hagrid	309	“ But ’s only a matter o ’ time , i’n’t it , after Malfoy ... ”
38326	38331	38333	38333	Ron	151	“ How is he ? ”
38340	38349	38333	38333	Ron	151	“ It was n’t serious , was it ? ”
38350	38359	38361	38361	Hagrid	309	“ Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could , ”
38364	38382	38361	38361	Hagrid	309	“ but he ’s sayin ’ it ’s still agony ... covered in bandages ... moanin ’ ... ”
38383	38389	38391	38391	Harry	121	“ He ’s faking it , ”
38395	38421	38391	38391	Harry	121	“ Madam Pomfrey can mend anything . She regrew half my bones last year . Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it ’s worth . ”
38422	38433	38435	38435	Hagrid	309	“ School gov’nors have bin told , o ’ course , ”
38438	38474	38435	38435	Hagrid	309	“ They reckon I started too big . Shoulda left hippogriffs fer later ... done flobberworms or summat ... Jus ’ thought it ’d make a good firs ’ lesson ... ’S all my fault ... ”
38475	38485	38487	38487	Hermione	133	“ It ’s all Malfoy ’s fault , Hagrid ! ”
38490	38495	38497	38497	Harry	121	“ We ’re witnesses , ”
38499	38528	38497	38497	Harry	121	“ You said hippogriffs attack if you insult them . It ’s Malfoy ’s problem that he was n’t listening . We ’ll tell Dumbledore what really happened . ”
38529	38544	38546	38546	Ron	151	“ Yeah , do n’t worry , Hagrid , we ’ll back you up , ”
38579	38591	38593	38593	Hermione	133	“ I think you ’ve had enough to drink , Hagrid , ”
38610	38618	38620	38620	Hagrid	309	“ Ar , maybe she ’s right , ”
38657	38663	38665	38665	Harry	121	“ What ’s he done ? ”
38677	38686	38688	38688	Hermione	133	“ Stuck his head in the water barrel , ”
38715	38720	38721	38721	he	309	“ Tha ’s better , ”
38735	38753	38721	38721	he	309	“ Listen , it was good of yeh ter come an ’ see me , I really — ”
38772	38782	38783	38783	he	309	“ WHAT D’YEH THINK YOU’RE DOIN ’ , EH ? ”

38837	38841	38842	38842	Hagrid	309	“ C’m on ! ”

38944	38951	38953	38954	Pansy Parkinson	217	“ How is it , Draco ? ”
38956	38962	38953	38954	Pansy Parkinson	217	“ Does it hurt much ? ”
38963	38966	38968	38968	Malfoy	203	“ Yeah , ”
38993	39000	39002	39003	Professor Snape	264	“ Settle down , settle down , ”
39019	39022	39014	39014	Snape	264	“ settle down ”
39106	39109	39110	39110	Malfoy	203	“ Sir , ”
39113	39131	39110	39110	Malfoy	203	“ sir , I ’ll need help cutting up these daisy roots , because of my arm — ”
39132	39143	39145	39145	Snape	264	“ Weasley , cut up Malfoy ’s roots for him , ”
39155	39164	39165	39165	he	151	“ There ’s nothing wrong with your arm , ”
39176	39189	39170	39170	Malfoy	203	“ Weasley , you heard Professor Snape ; cut up these roots . ”
39217	39220	39222	39222	Malfoy	203	“ Professor , ”
39224	39233	39222	39222	Malfoy	203	“ Weasley ’s mutilating my roots , sir . ”
39263	39271	39241	39241	his	264	“ Change roots with Malfoy , Weasley . ”
39272	39278	39241	39241	his	264	“ But , sir — ! ”
39298	39301	39303	39303	Snape	264	“ Now , ”
39330	39342	39344	39344	Malfoy	203	“ And , sir , I ’ll need this shrivelfig skinned , ”
39353	39363	39365	39365	Snape	264	“ Potter , you can skin Malfoy ’s shrivelfig , ”
39431	39438	39439	39439	he	203	“ Seen your pal Hagrid lately ? ”
39444	39450	39452	39452	Ron	151	“ None of your business , ”
39459	39472	39474	39474	Malfoy	203	“ I ’m afraid he wo n’t be a teacher much longer , ”
39482	39492	39474	39474	Malfoy	203	“ Father ’s not very happy about my injury — ”
39493	39508	39510	39510	Ron	151	“ Keep talking , Malfoy , and I ’ll give you a real injury , ”
39512	39546	39548	39548	he	151	“ — he ’s complained to the school governors . And to the Ministry of Magic . Father ’s got a lot of influence , you know . And a lasting injury like this ”
39556	39568	39548	39548	he	151	“ who knows if my arm’ll ever be the same again ? ”
39569	39580	39582	39582	Harry	121	“ So that ’s why you ’re putting it on , ”
39597	39605	39582	39582	Harry	121	“ To try to get Hagrid fired . ”
39606	39609	39611	39611	Malfoy	203	“ Well , ”
39620	39640	39611	39611	Malfoy	203	“ partly , Potter . But there are other benefits too . Weasley , slice my caterpillars for me . ”
39696	39701	39703	39703	Snape	264	“ Orange , Longbottom , ”
39724	39786	39703	39703	Snape	264	“ Orange . Tell me , boy , does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours ? Did n’t you hear me say , quite clearly , that only one rat spleen was needed ? Did n’t I state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice ? What do I have to do to make you understand , Longbottom ? ”
39805	39810	39812	39812	Hermione	133	“ Please , sir , ”
39814	39825	39812	39812	Hermione	133	“ please , I could help Neville put it right — ”
39826	39840	39842	39842	Snape	264	“ I do n’t remember asking you to show off , Miss Granger , ”
39853	39889	39846	39846	Hermione	133	“ Longbottom , at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens . Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly . ”
39900	39904	39905	39905	he	170	“ Help me ! ”
39910	39915	39917	39918	Seamus Finnigan	187	“ Hey , Harry , ”
39929	39947	39917	39918	Seamus Finnigan	187	“ have you heard ? Daily Prophet this morning — they reckon Sirius Black ’s been sighted . ”
39948	39951	39953	39953	Harry	121	“ Where ? ”
39973	39980	39982	39982	Seamus	187	“ Not too far from here , ”
39988	40042	39982	39982	Seamus	187	“ It was a Muggle who saw him . ’ Course , she did n’t really understand . The Muggles think he ’s just an ordinary criminal , do n’t they ? So she phoned the telephone hot line . By the time the Ministry of Magic got there , he was gone . ”
40043	40051	40052	40052	Ron	151	“ Not too far from here ... , ”
40069	40079	40065	40065	Malfoy	203	“ What , Malfoy ? Need something else skinned ? ”
40101	40114	40095	40095	He	151	“ Thinking of trying to catch Black single - handed , Potter ? ”
40115	40122	40124	40124	Harry	121	“ Yeah , that ’s right , ”
40138	40147	40148	40148	he	151	“ Of course , if it was me , ”
40152	40182	40148	40148	he	151	“ I ’d have done something before now . I would n’t be staying in school like a good boy , I ’d be out there looking for him . ”
40183	40192	40194	40194	Ron	151	“ What are you talking about , Malfoy ? ”
40197	40205	40207	40207	Malfoy	203	“ Do n’t you know , Potter ? ”
40214	40218	40209	40209	his	203	“ Know what ? ”
40228	40238	40239	40239	he	151	“ Maybe you ’d rather not risk your neck , ”
40242	40272	40239	40239	he	151	“ Want to leave it to the dementors , do you ? But if it was me , I ’d want revenge . I ’d hunt him down myself . ”
40273	40280	40282	40282	Harry	121	“ What are you talking about ? ”
40292	40328	40289	40289	Snape	264	“ You should have finished adding your ingredients by now ; this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk , so clear away while it simmers and then we ’ll test Longbottom ’s ... ”
40390	40396	40397	40397	Harry	121	“ What did Malfoy mean ? ”
40418	40437	40402	40402	he	151	“ Why would I want revenge on Black ? He has n’t done anything to me — yet . ”
40438	40445	40447	40447	Ron	151	“ He ’s making it up , ”
40450	40461	40447	40447	Ron	151	“ He ’s trying to make you do something stupid ... ”
40483	40489	40491	40491	Snape	264	“ Everyone gather ’ round , ”
40498	40547	40491	40491	Snape	264	“ and watch what happens to Longbottom ’s toad . If he has managed to produce a Shrinking Solution , it will shrink to a tadpole . If , as I do n’t doubt , he has done it wrong , his toad is likely to be poisoned . ”
40663	40669	40671	40671	Snape	264	“ Five points from Gryffindor , ”
40681	40696	40671	40671	Snape	264	“ I told you not to help him , Miss Granger . Class dismissed . ”
40728	40759	40722	40722	Ron	151	“ Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was all right ! Why did n’t you lie , Hermione ? You should ’ve said Neville did it all by himself ! ”
40769	40774	40765	40765	Ron	151	“ Where is she ? ”
40806	40813	40815	40815	Ron	151	“ She was right behind us , ”
40836	40841	40843	40843	Harry	121	“ There she is , ”
40875	40882	40884	40884	Ron	151	“ How did you do that ? ”
40886	40889	40891	40891	Hermione	133	“ What ? ”
40896	40920	40954	40954	Harry	121	“ One minute you were right behind us , the next moment , you were back at the bottom of the stairs again . ”
40921	40924	40925	40925	Hermione	133	“ What ? ”
40930	40944	40925	40925	Hermione	133	“ Oh — I had to go back for something . Oh no — ”
40976	40987	40988	40988	Ron	151	“ Why are you carrying all these around with you ? ”
40992	41002	41004	41004	Hermione	133	“ You know how many subjects I ’m taking , ”
41007	41018	41004	41004	Hermione	133	“ Could n’t hold these for me , could you ? ”
41019	41022	41023	41023	Ron	151	“ But — ”
41039	41061	41023	41023	Ron	151	“ You have n’t got any of these subjects today . It ’s only Defense Against the Dark Arts this afternoon . ”
41062	41066	41072	41072	she	133	“ Oh yes , ”
41085	41099	41100	41100	she	133	“ I hope there ’s something good for lunch , I ’m starving , ”
41112	41124	41125	41125	Ron	151	“ D’you get the feeling Hermione ’s not telling us something ? ”
41213	41217	41218	41218	he	199	“ Good afternoon , ”
41221	41249	41218	41218	he	199	“ Would you please put all your books back in your bags . Today ’s will be a practical lesson . You will need only your wands . ”
41302	41306	41308	41309	Professor Lupin	199	“ Right then , ”
41316	41323	41308	41309	Professor Lupin	199	“ If you ’d follow me . ”
41408	41414	41415	41415	Peeves	242	“ Loony , loopy Lupin , ”
41418	41429	41415	41415	Peeves	242	“ Loony , loopy Lupin , loony , loopy Lupin — ”
41471	41488	41489	41489	he	199	“ I ’d take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you , Peeves , ”
41493	41507	41489	41489	he	199	“ Mr. Filch wo n’t be able to get in to his brooms . ”
41567	41575	41576	41576	he	199	“ This is a useful little spell , ”
41584	41589	41576	41576	he	199	“ Please watch closely . ”
41600	41603	41590	41590	He	199	“ Waddiwasi ! ”
41644	41649	41651	41652	Dean Thomas	181	“ Cool , sir ! ”
41656	41662	41664	41665	Professor Lupin	199	“ Thank you , Dean , ”
41673	41678	41668	41668	his	199	“ Shall we proceed ? ”
41711	41716	41718	41719	Professor Lupin	199	“ Inside , please , ”
41800	41814	41797	41797	Snape	264	“ Leave it open , Lupin . I ’d rather not witness this . ”
41844	41884	41836	41836	he	264	“ Possibly no one ’s warned you , Lupin , but this class contains Neville Longbottom . I would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult . Not unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear . ”
41924	41941	41942	41942	he	199	“ I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation , ”
41945	41956	41942	41942	he	199	“ and I am sure he will perform it admirably . ”
41984	41989	41991	41992	Professor Lupin	199	“ Now , then , ”
42042	42048	42050	42051	Professor Lupin	199	“ Nothing to worry about , ”
42063	42071	42054	42056	a few people	1214	“ There ’s a boggart in there . ”
42105	42113	42115	42116	Professor Lupin	199	“ Boggarts like dark , enclosed spaces , ”
42118	42186	42115	42116	Professor Lupin	199	“ Wardrobes , the gap beneath beds , the cupboards under sinks — I once met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock . This one moved in yesterday afternoon , and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice . So , the first question we must ask ourselves is , what is a boggart ? ”
42193	42201	42202	42202	she	133	“ It ’s a shape - shifter , ”
42205	42220	42202	42202	she	133	“ It can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most . ”
42221	42230	42232	42233	Professor Lupin	199	“ Could n’t have put it better myself , ”
42239	42306	42308	42309	Professor Lupin	199	“ So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form . He does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door . Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone , but when I let him out , he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears . This means , ”
42311	42342	42308	42309	Professor Lupin	199	“ choosing to ignore Neville ’s small sputter of terror , that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin . Have you spotted it , Harry ? ”
42383	42404	42414	42414	Hermione	133	“ Er — because there are so many of us , it wo n’t know what shape it should be ? ”
42405	42408	42410	42411	Professor Lupin	199	“ Precisely , ”
42425	42551	42416	42416	her	133	“ It ’s always best to have company when you ’re dealing with a boggart . He becomes confused . Which should he become , a headless corpse or a flesh - eating slug ? I once saw a boggart make that very mistake — tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug . Not remotely frightening . The charm that repels a boggart is simple , yet it requires force of mind . You see , the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter . What you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing . We will practice the charm without wands first . After me , please ... Riddikulus ! ”
42552	42555	42557	42559	the class together	1216	“ Riddikulus ! ”
42561	42564	42566	42567	Professor Lupin	199	“ Good , ”
42569	42604	42566	42567	Professor Lupin	199	“ Very good . But that was the easy part , I ’m afraid . You see , the word alone is not enough . And this is where you come in , Neville . ”
42629	42634	42636	42637	Professor Lupin	199	“ Right , Neville , ”
42639	42659	42636	42637	Professor Lupin	199	“ First things first : What would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world ? ”
42671	42681	42683	42684	Professor Lupin	199	“ Did n’t catch that , Neville , sorry , ”
42711	42715	42687	42687	Neville	170	“ Professor Snape . ”
42733	42749	42725	42726	Professor Lupin	199	“ Professor Snape ... hmmm ... Neville , I believe you live with your grandmother ? ”
42750	42755	42757	42757	Neville	170	“ Er — yes , ”
42760	42775	42757	42757	Neville	170	“ But — I do n’t want the boggart to turn into her either . ”
42776	42785	42787	42788	Professor Lupin	199	“ No , no , you misunderstand me , ”
42793	42810	42787	42788	Professor Lupin	199	“ I wonder , could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears ? ”
42818	42853	42811	42811	Neville	170	“ Well ... always the same hat . A tall one with a stuffed vulture on top . And a long dress ... green , normally ... and sometimes a fox - fur scarf . ”
42854	42859	42861	42862	Professor Lupin	199	“ And a handbag ? ”
42864	42870	42872	42872	Neville	170	“ A big red one , ”
42874	42878	42880	42881	Professor Lupin	199	“ Right then , ”
42883	42904	42880	42881	Professor Lupin	199	“ Can you picture those clothes very clearly , Neville ? Can you see them in your mind ’s eye ? ”
42905	42908	42910	42910	Neville	170	“ Yes , ”
42920	42945	42947	42947	Lupin	199	“ When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe , Neville , and sees you , it will assume the form of Professor Snape , ”
42949	43003	42947	42947	Lupin	199	“ And you will raise your wand — thus — and cry ‘ Riddikulus ’ — and concentrate hard on your grandmother ’s clothes . If all goes well , Professor Boggart Snape will be forced into that vulture - topped hat , and that green dress , with that big red handbag . ”
43018	43039	43041	43042	Professor Lupin	199	“ If Neville is successful , the boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn , ”
43044	43077	43041	43042	Professor Lupin	199	“ I would like all of you to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most , and imagine how you might force it to look comical ... ”
43197	43203	43191	43191	Ron	151	“ Take its legs off . ”
43221	43225	43227	43228	Professor Lupin	199	“ Everyone ready ? ”
43272	43282	43284	43285	Professor Lupin	199	“ Neville , we ’re going to back away , ”
43287	43319	43284	43285	Professor Lupin	199	“ Let you have a clear field , all right ? I ’ll call the next person forward ... Everyone back , now , so Neville can get a clear shot — ”
43359	43368	43370	43371	Professor Lupin	199	“ On the count of three , Neville , ”
43386	43395	43376	43376	his	199	“ One — two — three — now ! ”
43459	43466	43468	43468	Neville	170	“ R - R - Riddikulus ! ”
43531	43536	43527	43528	Professor Lupin	199	“ Parvati ! Forward ! ”
43595	43598	43600	43600	Parvati	223	“ Riddikulus ! ”
43625	43628	43630	43631	Professor Lupin	199	“ Seamus ! ”
43696	43699	43701	43701	Seamus	187	“ Riddikulus ! ”
43761	43766	43768	43768	Lupin	199	“ It ’s confused ! ”
43770	43778	43768	43768	Lupin	199	“ We ’re getting there ! Dean ! ”
43806	43809	43811	43811	Dean	181	“ Riddikulus ! ”
43827	43835	43887	43887	Ron	151	“ Excellent ! Ron , you next ! ”
43882	43885	43887	43887	Ron	151	“ Riddikulus ! ”
43931	43934	43936	43937	Professor Lupin	199	“ Here ! ”
43985	43988	43980	43980	Lupin	199	“ Riddikulus ! ”
43994	44004	44006	44006	Lupin	199	“ Forward , Neville , and finish him off ! ”
44032	44035	44036	44036	he	170	“ Riddikulus ! ”
44059	44062	44036	44036	he	170	“ Ha ! ”
44084	44087	44089	44090	Professor Lupin	199	“ Excellent ! ”
44098	44141	44089	44090	Professor Lupin	199	“ Excellent , Neville . Well done , everyone ... Let me see ... five points to Gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart — ten for Neville because he did it twice ... and five each to Hermione and Harry . ”
44142	44150	44152	44152	Harry	121	“ But I did n’t do anything , ”
44154	44171	44172	44172	Lupin	199	“ You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class , Harry , ”
44176	44212	44172	44172	Lupin	199	“ Very well , everyone , an excellent lesson . Homework , kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it for me ... to be handed in on Monday . That will be all . ”
44284	44293	44295	44295	Seamus	187	“ Did you see me take that banshee ? ”
44297	44302	44304	44304	Dean	181	“ And the hand ! ”
44311	44318	44266	44266	he	121	“ And Snape in that hat ! ”
44319	44324	44295	44295	Seamus	187	“ And my mummy ! ”
44325	44337	44339	44339	Lavender	225	“ I wonder why Professor Lupin ’s frightened of crystal balls ? ”
44342	44362	44364	44364	Ron	151	“ That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson we ’ve ever had , was n’t it ? ”
44380	44389	44391	44391	Hermione	133	“ He seems like a very good teacher , ”
44394	44408	44391	44391	Hermione	133	“ But I wish I could have had a turn with the boggart — ”
44409	44418	44420	44420	Ron	151	“ What would it have been for you ? ”
44424	44437	44420	44420	Ron	151	“ A piece of homework that only got nine out of ten ? ”
44474	44483	44484	44484	Malfoy	203	“ Look at the state of his robes , ”
44496	44506	44484	44484	Malfoy	203	“ He dresses like our old house - elf . ”
44893	44902	44904	44904	Ron	151	“ Why would anyone bother looking after them ? ”
45166	45183	45184	45184	he	250	“ This is our last chance — my last chance — to win the Quidditch Cup , ”
45197	45251	45184	45184	he	250	“ I ’ll be leaving at the end of this year . I ’ll never get another shot at it . Gryffindor has n’t won for seven years now . Okay , so we ’ve had the worst luck in the world — injuries — then the tournament getting called off last year ... ”
45267	45288	45289	45289	he	250	“ But we also know we ’ve got the best — ruddy — team — in — the — school , ”
45309	45317	45289	45289	he	250	“ We ’ve got three superb Chasers . ”
45331	45339	45318	45318	Wood	250	“ We ’ve got two unbeatable Beaters . ”
45340	45351	45353	45353	Fred	148	“ Stop it , Oliver , you ’re embarrassing us , ”
45363	45380	45381	45381	Wood	250	“ And we ’ve got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match ! ”
45394	45398	45399	45399	he	250	“ And me , ”
45405	45416	45418	45418	George	149	“ We think you ’re very good too , Oliver , ”
45420	45425	45427	45427	Fred	148	“ Spanking good Keeper , ”
45429	45434	45435	45435	Wood	250	“ The point is , ”
45443	45502	45440	45440	his	250	“ the Quidditch Cup should have had our name on it these last two years . Ever since Harry joined the team , I ’ve thought the thing was in the bag . But we have n’t got it , and this year ’s the last chance we ’ll get to finally see our name on the thing ... ”
45515	45524	45526	45526	Fred	148	“ Oliver , this year ’s our year , ”
45528	45536	45538	45538	Angelina	252	“ We ’ll do it , Oliver ! ”
45540	45543	45545	45545	Harry	121	“ Definitely , ”
45631	45636	45637	45637	he	121	“ What ’s happened ? ”
45663	45668	45670	45670	Ron	151	“ First Hogsmeade weekend , ”
45686	45693	45670	45670	Ron	151	“ End of October . Halloween . ”
45694	45697	45699	45699	Fred	148	“ Excellent , ”
45710	45726	45699	45699	Fred	148	“ I need to visit Zonko ’s . I ’m nearly out of Stink Pellets . ”
45749	45764	45765	45765	she	133	“ Harry , I ’m sure you ’ll be able to go next time , ”
45768	45784	45765	45765	she	133	“ They ’re bound to catch Black soon . He ’s been sighted once already . ”
45785	45797	45799	45799	Ron	151	“ Black ’s not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade , ”
45801	45822	45799	45799	Ron	151	“ Ask McGonagall if you can go this time , Harry . The next one might not be for ages — ”
45823	45826	45828	45828	Hermione	133	“ Ron ! ”
45830	45839	45828	45828	Hermione	133	“ Harry ’s supposed to stay in school — ”
45840	45852	45854	45854	Ron	151	“ He ca n’t be the only third year left behind , ”
45856	45865	45854	45854	Ron	151	“ Ask McGonagall , go on , Harry — ”
45866	45874	45876	45876	Harry	121	“ Yeah , I think I will , ”
45912	45924	45926	45926	Ron	151	“ Does he have to eat that in front of us ? ”
45930	45942	45944	45944	Hermione	133	“ Clever Crookshanks , did you catch that all by yourself ? ”
45961	45972	45974	45974	Ron	151	“ Just keep him over there , that ’s all , ”
45984	45994	45974	45974	Ron	151	“ I ’ve got Scabbers asleep in my bag . ”
46037	46047	46049	46049	Ron	151	“ You can copy mine , if you like , ”
46105	46108	46109	46109	Ron	151	“ OY ! ”
46130	46138	46116	46116	Crookshanks	254	“ GET OFF , YOU STUPID ANIMAL ! ”
46158	46166	46168	46168	Hermione	133	“ Ron , do n’t hurt him ! ”
46198	46203	46204	46204	Ron	151	“ CATCH THAT CAT ! ”
46316	46321	46322	46322	he	151	“ Look at him ! ”
46335	46350	46322	46322	he	151	“ He ’s skin and bone ! You keep that cat away from him ! ”
46351	46360	46364	46364	her	133	“ Crookshanks does n’t understand it ’s wrong ! ”
46368	46376	46364	46364	her	133	“ All cats chase rats , Ron ! ”
46377	46386	46388	46388	Ron	151	“ There ’s something funny about that animal ! ”
46404	46416	46388	46388	Ron	151	“ It heard me say that Scabbers was in my bag ! ”
46417	46423	46425	46425	Hermione	133	“ Oh , what rubbish , ”
46428	46441	46425	46425	Hermione	133	“ Crookshanks could smell him , Ron , how else d’you think — ”
46442	46452	46454	46454	Ron	151	“ That cat ’s got it in for Scabbers ! ”
46468	46480	46454	46454	Ron	151	“ And Scabbers was here first , and he ’s ill ! ”
46537	46542	46543	46543	Hermione	133	“ How ’s Scabbers ? ”
46565	46578	46580	46580	Ron	151	“ He ’s hiding at the bottom of my bed , shaking , ”
46594	46601	46603	46604	Professor Sprout	256	“ Careful , Weasley , careful ! ”
46707	46715	46720	46720	she	133	“ What ’s the matter , Lavender ? ”
46732	46742	46743	46743	Parvati	223	“ She got a letter from home this morning , ”
46746	46762	46743	46743	Parvati	223	“ It ’s her rabbit , Binky . He ’s been killed by a fox . ”
46763	46766	46768	46768	Hermione	133	“ Oh , ”
46770	46777	46768	46768	Hermione	133	“ I ’m sorry , Lavender . ”
46778	46784	46786	46786	Lavender	225	“ I should have known ! ”
46789	46797	46786	46786	Lavender	225	“ You know what day it is ? ”
46798	46801	46768	46768	Hermione	133	“ Er — ”
46802	46835	46786	46786	Lavender	225	“ The sixteenth of October ! ‘ That thing you ’re dreading , it will happen on the sixteenth of October ! ’ Remember ? She was right , she was right ! ”
46858	46871	46855	46855	she	133	“ You — you were dreading Binky being killed by a fox ? ”
46872	46881	46883	46883	Lavender	225	“ Well , not necessarily by a fox , ”
46893	46906	46855	46855	she	133	“ but I was obviously dreading him dying , was n’t I ? ”
46907	46910	46912	46912	Hermione	133	“ Oh , ”
46920	46927	46914	46914	She	133	“ Was Binky an old rabbit ? ”
46928	46933	46935	46935	Lavender	225	“ N - no ! ”
46937	46946	46935	46935	Lavender	225	“ H - he was only a baby ! ”
46956	46967	46969	46969	Hermione	133	“ But then , why would you dread him dying ? ”
46976	46984	46986	46986	Hermione	133	“ Well , look at it logically , ”
46996	47016	47018	47018	Lavender	225	“ I mean , Binky did n’t even die today , did he ? Lavender just got the news today ”
47022	47041	47018	47018	Lavender	225	“ and she ca n’t have been dreading it , because it ’s come as a real shock — ”
47042	47050	47052	47052	Ron	151	“ Do n’t mind Hermione , Lavender , ”
47055	47068	47052	47052	Ron	151	“ she does n’t think other people ’s pets matter very much . ”
47159	47165	47166	47166	she	202	“ One moment , please ! ”
47175	47208	47166	47166	she	202	“ As you ’re all in my House , you should hand Hogsmeade permission forms to me before Halloween . No form , no visiting the village , so do n’t forget ! ”
47215	47228	47166	47166	she	202	“ Please , Professor , I — I think I ’ve lost — ”
47229	47240	47242	47243	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Your grandmother sent yours to me directly , Longbottom , ”
47245	47264	47242	47243	Professor McGonagall	202	“ She seemed to think it was safer . Well , that ’s all , you may leave . ”
47265	47270	47271	47271	Ron	151	“ Ask her now , ”
47276	47281	47282	47282	Hermione	133	“ Oh , but — ”
47285	47292	47294	47294	Ron	151	“ Go for it , Harry , ”
47317	47322	47349	47350	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Yes , Potter ? ”
47329	47345	47346	47346	he	121	“ Professor , my aunt and uncle — er — forgot to sign my form , ”
47364	47393	47349	47350	Professor McGonagall	202	“ So — er — d’you think it would be all right — I mean , will it be okay if I — if I go to Hogsmeade ? ”
47406	47414	47415	47415	she	202	“ I ’m afraid not , Potter , ”
47418	47438	47415	47415	she	202	“ You heard what I said . No form , no visiting the village . That ’s the rule . ”
47439	47469	47470	47470	Harry	121	“ But — Professor , my aunt and uncle — you know , they ’re Muggles , they do n’t really understand about — about Hogwarts forms and stuff , ”
47482	47490	47474	47474	Ron	151	“ If you said I could go — ”
47491	47499	47501	47502	Professor McGonagall	202	“ But I do n’t say so , ”
47515	47529	47530	47530	She	202	“ The form clearly states that the parent or guardian must give permission . ”
47549	47578	47542	47542	her	202	“ I ’m sorry , Potter , but that ’s my final word . You had better hurry , or you ’ll be late for your next lesson . ”
47602	47610	47599	47599	Hermione	133	“ all - for - the - best ”
47646	47653	47655	47655	Ron	151	“ There ’s always the feast , ”
47665	47677	47655	47655	Ron	151	“ You know , the Halloween feast , in the evening . ”
47678	47681	47683	47683	Harry	121	“ Yeah , ”
47686	47689	47683	47683	Harry	121	“ great . ”
47817	47843	47844	47844	he	147	“ They make a fuss about Hogsmeade , but I assure you , Harry , it ’s not all it ’s cracked up to be , ”
47848	47894	47844	47844	he	147	“ All right , the sweetshop ’s rather good , and Zonko ’s Joke Shop ’s frankly dangerous , and yes , the Shrieking Shack ’s always worth a visit , but really , Harry , apart from that , you ’re not missing anything . ”
47922	47934	47936	47936	Hermione	133	“ We ’ll bring you lots of sweets back from Honeydukes , ”
47944	47949	47951	47951	Ron	151	“ Yeah , loads , ”
47971	47978	47980	47980	Harry	121	“ Do n’t worry about me , ”
47991	48005	47980	47980	Harry	121	“ I ’ll see you at the feast . Have a good time . ”
48056	48062	48064	48064	Malfoy	203	“ Staying here , Potter ? ”
48076	48083	48064	48064	Malfoy	203	“ Scared of passing the dementors ? ”
48108	48111	48113	48115	the Fat Lady	1317	“ Password ? ”
48123	48127	48129	48129	Harry	121	“ Fortuna Major , ”
48176	48185	48186	48186	It	1320	“ Harry ! Harry ! Hi , Harry ! ”
48211	48225	48227	48227	Colin	263	“ Are n’t you going to Hogsmeade , Harry ? Why not ? Hey ”
48235	48250	48227	48227	Colin	263	“ you can come and sit with us , if you like , Harry ! ”
48251	48260	48262	48262	Harry	121	“ Er — no , thanks , Colin , ”
48285	48304	48262	48262	Harry	121	“ I — I ’ve got to go to the library , got to get some work done . ”
48327	48336	48337	48339	the Fat Lady	1317	“ What was the point waking me up ? ”
48397	48403	48404	48404	Filch	244	“ What are you doing ? ”
48408	48411	48413	48413	Harry	121	“ Nothing , ”
48416	48419	48421	48421	Filch	244	“ Nothing ! ”
48428	48463	48421	48421	Filch	244	“ A likely story ! Sneaking around on your own — why are n’t you in Hogsmeade buying Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms like the rest of your nasty little friends ? ”
48467	48480	48482	48482	Filch	244	“ Well , get back to your common room where you belong ! ”
48539	48542	48570	48570	Lupin	199	“ Harry ? ”
48562	48568	48570	48570	Lupin	199	“ What are you doing ? ”
48581	48588	48570	48570	Lupin	199	“ Where are Ron and Hermione ? ”
48589	48592	48594	48594	Harry	121	“ Hogsmeade , ”
48604	48607	48609	48609	Lupin	199	“ Ah , ”
48618	48639	48611	48611	He	199	“ Why do n’t you come in ? I ’ve just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson . ”
48640	48644	48646	48646	Harry	121	“ A what ? ”
48692	48696	48698	48698	Lupin	199	“ Water demon , ”
48705	48741	48698	48698	Lupin	199	“ We should n’t have much difficulty with him , not after the kappas . The trick is to break his grip . You notice the abnormally long fingers ? Strong , but very brittle . ”
48761	48766	48767	48767	Lupin	199	“ Cup of tea ? ”
48776	48785	48767	48767	Lupin	199	“ I was just thinking of making one . ”
48786	48790	48792	48792	Harry	121	“ All right , ”
48813	48817	48819	48819	Lupin	199	“ Sit down , ”
48829	48851	48819	48819	Lupin	199	“ I ’ve only got teabags , I ’m afraid — but I daresay you ’ve had enough of tea leaves ? ”
48863	48871	48872	48872	Harry	121	“ How did you know about that ? ”
48875	48881	48883	48883	Lupin	199	“ Professor McGonagall told me , ”
48893	48902	48883	48883	Lupin	199	“ You ’re not worried , are you ? ”
48903	48906	48908	48908	Harry	121	“ No , ”
48976	48983	48973	48973	Lupin	199	“ Anything worrying you , Harry ? ”
48984	48987	48988	48988	Harry	121	“ No , ”
49007	49010	49011	49011	he	121	“ Yes , ”
49024	49034	49011	49011	he	121	“ You know that day we fought the boggart ? ”
49035	49038	49040	49040	Lupin	199	“ Yes , ”
49043	49053	49055	49055	Harry	121	“ Why did n’t you let me fight it ? ”
49063	49074	49075	49075	he	199	“ I would have thought that was obvious , Harry , ”
49101	49104	49105	49105	he	199	“ Why ? ”
49109	49112	49114	49114	Lupin	199	“ Well , ”
49119	49138	49114	49114	Lupin	199	“ I assumed that if the boggart faced you , it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort . ”
49181	49188	49190	49190	Lupin	199	“ Clearly , I was wrong , ”
49197	49223	49190	49190	Lupin	199	“ But I did n’t think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialize in the staffroom . I imagined that people would panic . ”
49224	49228	49230	49230	Harry	121	“ But then , ”
49233	49241	49230	49230	Harry	121	“ I — I remembered those dementors . ”
49242	49246	49248	49248	Lupin	199	“ I see , ”
49251	49260	49248	49248	Lupin	199	“ Well , well ... I ’m impressed . ”
49274	49293	49261	49261	He	199	“ That suggests that what you fear most of all is — fear . Very wise , Harry . ”
49311	49329	49331	49331	Lupin	199	“ So you ’ve been thinking that I did n’t believe you capable of fighting the boggart ? ”
49334	49339	49341	49341	Harry	121	“ Well ... yeah , ”
49351	49360	49343	49343	He	121	“ Professor Lupin , you know the dementors — ”
49371	49375	49377	49377	Lupin	199	“ Come in , ”
49412	49417	49419	49419	Lupin	199	“ Ah , Severus , ”
49423	49439	49419	49419	Lupin	199	“ Thanks very much . Could you leave it here on the desk for me ? ”
49455	49464	49466	49466	Lupin	199	“ I was just showing Harry my grindylow , ”
49474	49477	49479	49479	Snape	264	“ Fascinating , ”
49486	49495	49479	49479	Snape	264	“ You should drink that directly , Lupin . ”
49496	49504	49506	49506	Lupin	199	“ Yes , yes , I will , ”
49508	49515	49516	49516	Snape	264	“ I made an entire cauldronful , ”
49519	49525	49516	49516	Snape	264	“ If you need more . ”
49526	49541	49479	49479	Snape	264	“ I should probably take some again tomorrow . Thanks very much , Severus . ”
49542	49547	49549	49549	Snape	264	“ Not at all , ”
49585	49597	49598	49598	he	199	“ Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me , ”
49601	49619	49620	49620	He	199	“ I have never been much of a potion - brewer and this one is particularly complex . ”
49629	49636	49637	49637	he	199	“ Pity sugar makes it useless , ”
49646	49650	49651	49651	Harry	121	“ Why — ? ”
49664	49675	49676	49676	he	199	“ I ’ve been feeling a bit off - color , ”
49679	49712	49676	49676	he	199	“ This potion is the only thing that helps . I am very lucky to be working alongside Professor Snape ; there are n’t many wizards who are up to making it . ”
49733	49744	49745	49745	he	199	“ Professor Snape ’s very interested in the Dark Arts , ”
49749	49752	49754	49754	Lupin	199	“ Really ? ”
49768	49773	49774	49774	Harry	121	“ Some people reckon — ”
49782	49800	49774	49774	Harry	121	“ some people reckon he ’d do anything to get the Defense Against the Dark Arts job . ”
49810	49813	49814	49814	he	199	“ Disgusting , ”
49817	49839	49814	49814	he	199	“ Well , Harry , I ’d better get back to work . I ’ll see you at the feast later . ”
49840	49843	49845	49845	Harry	121	“ Right , ”
49860	49865	49867	49867	Ron	151	“ There you go , ”
49869	49879	49867	49867	Ron	151	“ We got as much as we could carry . ”
49929	49932	49934	49934	Harry	121	“ Thanks , ”
49946	49957	49934	49934	Harry	121	“ What ’s Hogsmeade like ? Where did you go ? ”
49996	50029	49966	49966	Dervish	265	“ The post office , Harry ! About two hundred owls , all sitting on shelves , all color - coded depending on how fast you want your letter to get there ! ”
50030	50054	49966	49966	Dervish	265	“ Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge ; they were giving out free samples , there ’s a bit , look — ”
50055	50074	49966	49966	Dervish	265	“ We think we saw an ogre , honestly , they get all sorts at the Three Broomsticks — ”
50075	50090	49966	49966	Dervish	265	“ Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer , really warms you up — ”
50091	50097	50099	50099	Hermione	133	“ What did you do ? ”
50104	50112	50099	50099	Hermione	133	“ Did you get any work done ? ”
50113	50116	50118	50118	Harry	121	“ No , ”
50120	50138	50118	50118	Harry	121	“ Lupin made me a cup of tea in his office . And then Snape came in ... ”
50153	50158	50159	50159	he	151	“ Lupin drank it ? ”
50162	50167	50159	50159	he	151	“ Is he mad ? ”
50173	50191	50192	50192	They	1341	“ We ’d better go down , you know , the feast’ll be starting in five minutes ... ”
50207	50214	50216	50216	Hermione	133	“ But if he — you know ”
50225	50247	50218	50218	her	133	“ if he was trying to — to poison Lupin — he would n’t have done it in front of Harry . ”
50248	50253	50255	50255	Harry	121	“ Yeah , maybe , ”
50483	50492	50469	50469	Malfoy	203	“ The dementors send their love , Potter ! ”
50536	50544	50546	50546	Ron	151	“ Why is n’t anyone going in ? ”
50566	50573	50575	50575	Percy	147	“ Let me through , please , ”
50588	50612	50580	50580	he	147	“ What ’s the holdup here ? You ca n’t all have forgotten the password — excuse me , I ’m Head Boy — ”
50649	50657	50640	50640	Percy	147	“ Somebody get Professor Dumbledore . Quick . ”
50672	50678	50680	50680	Ginny	144	“ What ’s going on ? ”
50726	50731	50732	50732	Hermione	133	“ Oh , my — ”
50800	50807	50809	50809	Dumbledore	213	“ We need to find her , ”
50811	50837	50809	50809	Dumbledore	213	“ Professor McGonagall , please go to Mr. Filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the Fat Lady . ”
50838	50844	50850	50850	It	1359	“ You ’ll be lucky ! ”
50877	50885	50887	50887	Dumbledore	213	“ What do you mean , Peeves ? ”
50919	50963	50964	50964	he	242	“ Ashamed , Your Headship , sir . Does n’t want to be seen . She ’s a horrible mess . Saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor , sir , dodging between the trees . Crying something dreadful , ”
50968	50972	50973	50973	he	242	“ Poor thing , ”
50977	50985	50987	50987	Dumbledore	213	“ Did she say who did it ? ”
50990	50996	50998	50998	Peeves	242	“ Oh yes , Professorhead , ”
51013	51029	51030	51030	Peeves	242	“ He got very angry when she would n’t let him in , you see . ”
51043	51054	51039	51039	his	242	“ Nasty temper he ’s got , that Sirius Black . ”
51091	51106	51107	51108	Professor Dumbledore	213	“ The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough search of the castle , ”
51123	51177	51178	51178	he	213	“ I ’m afraid that , for your own safety , you will have to spend the night here . I want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and Girl in charge . Any disturbance should be reported to me immediately , ”
51191	51200	51181	51181	Percy	147	“ Send word with one of the ghosts . ”
51214	51224	51201	51202	Professor Dumbledore	213	“ Oh , yes , you ’ll be needing ... ”
51265	51269	51278	51278	him	213	“ Sleep well , ”
51302	51309	51311	51311	Percy	147	“ Everyone into their sleeping bags ! ”
51313	51329	51311	51311	Percy	147	“ Come on , now , no more talking ! Lights out in ten minutes ! ”
51330	51334	51335	51335	Ron	151	“ C’m on , ”
51354	51365	51366	51366	Hermione	133	“ Do you think Black ’s still in the castle ? ”
51370	51378	51380	51380	Ron	151	“ Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be , ”
51382	51394	51396	51396	Hermione	133	“ It ’s very lucky he picked tonight , you know , ”
51415	51426	51396	51396	Hermione	133	“ The one night we were n’t in the tower ... ”
51427	51442	51444	51444	Ron	151	“ I reckon he ’s lost track of time , being on the run , ”
51446	51463	51444	51444	Ron	151	“ Did n’t realize it was Halloween . Otherwise he ’d have come bursting in here . ”
51480	51487	51471	51471	people	2741	“ How did he get in ? ”
51488	51496	51498	51499	a Ravenclaw	271	“ Maybe he knows how to Apparate , ”
51505	51516	51498	51499	a Ravenclaw	271	“ Just appear out of thin air , you know . ”
51517	51523	51525	51528	a Hufflepuff fifth year	1376	“ Disguised himself , probably , ”
51530	51537	51539	51540	Dean Thomas	181	“ He could ’ve flown in , ”
51542	51561	51563	51563	Hermione	133	“ Honestly , am I the only person who ’s ever bothered to read Hogwarts : A History ? ”
51570	51573	51575	51575	Ron	151	“ Probably , ”
51577	51580	51575	51575	Ron	151	“ Why ? ”
51581	51595	51597	51597	Hermione	133	“ Because the castle ’s protected by more than walls , you know , ”
51599	51671	51597	51597	Hermione	133	“ There are all sorts of enchantments on it , to stop people entering by stealth . You ca n’t just Apparate in here . And I ’d like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors . They ’re guarding every single entrance to the grounds . They ’d have seen him fly in too . And Filch knows all the secret passages , they ’ll have them covered ... ”
51672	51680	51681	51681	Percy	147	“ The lights are going out now ! ”
51684	51697	51681	51681	Percy	147	“ I want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking ! ”
51857	51865	51867	51867	Percy	147	“ Any sign of him , Professor ? ”
51872	51879	52003	52003	Snape	264	“ No . All well here ? ”
51880	51887	51851	51851	Dumbledore	213	“ Everything under control , sir . ”
51888	51923	52003	52003	Snape	264	“ Good . There ’s no point moving them all now . I ’ve found a temporary guardian for the Gryffindor portrait hole . You ’ll be able to move them back in tomorrow . ”
51924	51932	51851	51851	Dumbledore	213	“ And the Fat Lady , sir ? ”
51933	51981	52003	52003	Snape	264	“ Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor . Apparently she refused to let Black in without the password , so he attacked . She ’s still very distressed , but once she ’s calmed down , I ’ll have Mr. Filch restore her . ”
51997	52000	52003	52003	Snape	264	“ Headmaster ? ”
52013	52040	52005	52005	Harry	121	“ The whole of the third floor has been searched . He ’s not there . And Filch has done the dungeons ; nothing there either . ”
52041	52056	51982	51982	Harry	121	“ What about the Astronomy Tower ? Professor Trelawney ’s room ? The Owlery ? ”
52057	52061	52005	52005	Harry	121	“ All searched ... ”
52062	52077	51982	51982	Harry	121	“ Very well , Severus . I did n’t really expect Black to linger . ”
52078	52092	52094	52094	Snape	264	“ Have you any theory as to how he got in , Professor ? ”
52111	52125	52096	52096	Harry	121	“ Many , Severus , each of them as unlikely as the next . ”
52168	52188	52190	52190	Snape	264	“ You remember the conversation we had , Headmaster , just before — ah — the start of term ? ”
52210	52216	52218	52218	Dumbledore	213	“ I do , Severus , ”
52230	52257	52227	52227	his	213	“ It seems — almost impossible — that Black could have entered the school without inside help . I did express my concerns when you appointed — ”
52258	52276	52278	52278	Dumbledore	213	“ I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped Black enter it , ”
52298	52307	52309	52309	Dumbledore	213	“ I must go down to the dementors , ”
52311	52324	52309	52309	Dumbledore	213	“ I said I would inform them when our search was complete . ”
52325	52335	52337	52337	Percy	147	“ Did n’t they want to help , sir ? ”
52339	52343	52345	52345	Dumbledore	213	“ Oh yes , ”
52348	52367	52345	52345	Dumbledore	213	“ But I ’m afraid no dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while I am headmaster . ”
52429	52436	52437	52437	Ron	151	“ What was all that about ? ”
52557	52564	52566	52567	Seamus Finnigan	187	“ He ’s a complete lunatic , ”
52572	52580	52566	52567	Seamus Finnigan	187	“ Ca n’t we get anyone else ? ”
52581	52591	52593	52593	Percy	147	“ None of the other pictures wanted the job , ”
52595	52616	52593	52593	Percy	147	“ Frightened of what happened to the Fat Lady . Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer . ”
52701	52715	52716	52716	she	202	“ There ’s no point hiding it from you any longer , Potter , ”
52724	52740	52716	52716	she	202	“ I know this will come as a shock to you , but Sirius Black — ”
52741	52749	52751	52751	Harry	121	“ I know he ’s after me , ”
52754	52773	52751	52751	Harry	121	“ I heard Ron ’s dad telling his mum . Mr. Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic . ”
52794	52846	52781	52781	She	202	“ I see ! Well , in that case , Potter , you ’ll understand why I do n’t think it ’s a good idea for you to be practicing Quidditch in the evenings . Out on the field with only your team members , it ’s very exposed , Potter — ”
52847	52857	52859	52859	Harry	121	“ We ’ve got our first match on Saturday ! ”
52863	52872	52859	52859	Harry	121	“ I ’ve got to train , Professor ! ”
52918	52921	52881	52881	she	202	“ Hmm ... ”
52943	52989	52922	52923	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Well ... goodness knows , I ’d like to see us win the Cup at last ... but all the same , Potter ... I ’d be happier if a teacher were present . I ’ll ask Madam Hooch to oversee your training sessions . ”
53040	53047	53048	53048	he	250	“ We ’re not playing Slytherin ! ”
53056	53071	53048	53048	he	250	“ Flint ’s just been to see me . We ’re playing Hufflepuff instead . ”
53072	53075	53077	53081	the rest of the team	1401	“ Why ? ”
53083	53097	53099	53099	Wood	250	“ Flint ’s excuse is that their Seeker ’s arm ’s still injured , ”
53106	53133	53099	53099	Wood	250	“ But it ’s obvious why they ’re doing it . Do n’t want to play in this weather . Think it ’ll damage their chances ... ”
53158	53168	53170	53170	Harry	121	“ There ’s nothing wrong with Malfoy ’s arm ! ”
53173	53179	53170	53170	Harry	121	“ He ’s faking it ! ”
53180	53192	53194	53194	Wood	250	“ I know that , but we ca n’t prove it , ”
53197	53237	53194	53194	Wood	250	“ And we ’ve been practicing all those moves assuming we ’re playing Slytherin , and instead it ’s Hufflepuff , and their style ’s quite different . They ’ve got a new Captain and Seeker , Cedric Diggory — ”
53247	53250	53252	53252	Wood	250	“ What ? ”
53260	53275	53277	53277	Angelina	252	“ He ’s that tall , good - looking one , is n’t he ? ”
53279	53284	53286	53286	Katie	253	“ Strong and silent , ”
53295	53311	53313	53313	Fred	148	“ He ’s only silent because he ’s too thick to string two words together , ”
53316	53350	53313	53313	Fred	148	“ I do n’t know why you ’re worried , Oliver , Hufflepuff is a pushover . Last time we played them , Harry caught the Snitch in about five minutes , remember ? ”
53351	53360	53361	53361	Wood	250	“ We were playing in completely different conditions ! ”
53369	53419	53364	53364	his	250	“ Diggory ’s put a very strong side together ! He ’s an excellent Seeker ! I was afraid you ’d take it like this ! We must n’t relax ! We must keep our focus ! Slytherin is trying to wrong - foot us ! We must win ! ”
53420	53426	53428	53428	Fred	148	“ Oliver , calm down ! ”
53434	53444	53428	53428	Fred	148	“ We ’re taking Hufflepuff very seriously . Seriously . ”
53497	53510	53511	53511	he	203	“ Ah , if only my arm was feeling a bit better ! ”
53590	53610	53585	53585	Wood	250	“ Diggory ’s got a very fast swerve , Harry , so you might want to try looping him — ”
53634	53645	53665	53665	Snape	264	“ Sorry I ’m late , Professor Lupin , I — ”
53667	53692	53665	53665	Snape	264	“ This lesson began ten minutes ago , Potter , so I think we ’ll make it ten points from Gryffindor . Sit down . ”
53699	53705	53706	53706	he	121	“ Where ’s Professor Lupin ? ”
53709	53721	53723	53723	Snape	264	“ He says he is feeling too ill to teach today , ”
53729	53739	53723	53723	Snape	264	“ I believe I told you to sit down ? ”
53747	53754	53755	53755	Snape	264	“ What ’s wrong with him ? ”
53761	53767	53768	53768	he	264	“ Nothing life - threatening , ”
53779	53803	53768	53768	he	264	“ Five more points from Gryffindor , and if I have to ask you to sit down again , it will be fifty . ”
53821	53846	53814	53814	Snape	264	“ As I was saying before Potter interrupted , Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far — ”
53847	53865	53867	53867	Hermione	133	“ Please , sir , we ’ve done boggarts , Red Caps , kappas , and grindylows , ”
53870	53879	53867	53867	Hermione	133	“ and we ’re just about to start — ”
53880	53884	53886	53886	Snape	264	“ Be quiet , ”
53889	53909	53886	53886	Snape	264	“ I did not ask for information . I was merely commenting on Professor Lupin ’s lack of organization . ”
53910	53926	53928	53929	Dean Thomas	181	“ He ’s the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we ’ve ever had , ”
53953	53986	53946	53946	Snape	264	“ You are easily satisfied . Lupin is hardly overtaxing you — I would expect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and grindylows . Today we shall discuss — ”
54010	54014	54016	54016	Snape	264	“ — werewolves , ”
54018	54023	54031	54031	herself	133	“ But , sir , ”
54033	54050	54031	54031	herself	133	“ we ’re not supposed to do werewolves yet , we ’re due to start hinkypunks — ”
54051	54055	54057	54057	Snape	264	“ Miss Granger , ”
54065	54093	54057	54057	Snape	264	“ I was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson , not you . And I am telling you all to turn to page 394 . ”
54099	54106	54094	54094	He	264	“ All of you ! Now ! ”
54123	54141	54143	54143	Snape	264	“ Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf ? ”
54171	54174	54175	54175	Snape	264	“ Anyone ? ”
54187	54205	54181	54181	His	264	“ Are you telling me that Professor Lupin has n’t even taught you the basic distinction between — ”
54206	54211	54213	54213	Parvati	223	“ We told you , ”
54216	54232	54213	54213	Parvati	223	“ we have n’t got as far as werewolves yet , we ’re still on — ”
54233	54236	54238	54238	Snape	264	“ Silence ! ”
54240	54286	54238	54238	Snape	264	“ Well , well , well , I never thought I ’d meet a third - year class who would n’t even recognize a werewolf when they saw one . I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very behind you all are ... ”
54287	54292	54294	54294	Hermione	133	“ Please , sir , ”
54304	54323	54294	54294	Hermione	133	“ the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways . The snout of the werewolf — ”
54324	54340	54342	54342	Snape	264	“ That is the second time you have spoken out of turn , Miss Granger , ”
54345	54361	54342	54342	Snape	264	“ Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know - it - all . ”
54444	54467	54422	54422	Ron	151	“ You asked us a question and she knows the answer ! Why ask if you do n’t want to be told ? ”
54491	54496	54497	54497	Snape	264	“ Detention , Weasley , ”
54509	54532	54497	54497	Snape	264	“ And if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again , you will be very sorry indeed . ”
54578	54613	54557	54557	Snape	264	“ Very poorly explained ... That is incorrect , the kappa is more commonly found in Mongolia ... Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten ? I would n’t have given it three ... ”
54626	54690	54621	54621	Snape	264	“ You will each write an essay , to be handed in to me , on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves . I want two rolls of parchment on the subject , and I want them by Monday morning . It is time somebody took this class in hand . Weasley , stay behind , we need to arrange your detention . ”
54723	54750	54751	54751	Harry	121	“ Snape ’s never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers , even if he did want the job , ”
54756	54776	54751	54751	Harry	121	“ Why ’s he got it in for Lupin ? D’you think this is all because of the boggart ? ”
54777	54783	54785	54785	Hermione	133	“ I do n’t know , ”
54788	54799	54785	54785	Hermione	133	“ But I really hope Professor Lupin gets better soon ... ”
54814	54819	54822	54822	he	151	“ D’you know what that ”
54830	54833	54822	54822	he	151	“ Ron ! ”
54836	54858	54859	54859	He	151	“ is making me do ? I ’ve got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing . Without magic ! ”
54868	54891	54859	54859	He	151	“ Why could n’t Black have hidden in Snape ’s office , eh ? He could have finished him off for us ! ”
54955	54963	54965	54965	Harry	121	“ What did you do that for ? ”
55144	55156	55157	55157	Harry	121	“ You know , I reckon Ron was right about you , ”
55162	55180	55181	55181	he	121	“ There are plenty of mice around this place — go and chase them . Go on , ”
55194	55199	55181	55181	he	121	“ Leave Scabbers alone . ”
55351	55360	55362	55363	Sir Cadogan	220	“ Stand and fight , you mangy cur ! ”
55365	55371	55372	55372	Harry	121	“ Oh , shut up , ”
55405	55415	55417	55417	Wood	250	“ It ’s going to be a tough one , ”
55425	55431	55433	55433	Alicia	251	“ Stop worrying , Oliver , ”
55436	55446	55433	55433	Alicia	251	“ we do n’t mind a bit of rain . ”
55702	55707	55708	55708	He	121	“ Mount your brooms . ”
56001	56009	56010	56010	Wood	250	“ I called for time - out ! ”
56016	56023	56010	56010	Wood	250	“ Come on , under here — ”
56050	56056	56037	56037	Harry	121	“ What ’s the score ? ”
56057	56064	56066	56066	Wood	250	“ We ’re fifty points up , ”
56068	56085	56066	56066	Wood	250	“ but unless we get the Snitch soon , we ’ll be playing into the night . ”
56086	56096	56097	56097	Harry	121	“ I ’ve got no chance with these on , ”
56131	56147	56116	56116	she	133	“ I ’ve had an idea , Harry ! Give me your glasses , quick ! ”
56171	56174	56166	56166	her	133	“ Impervius ! ”
56175	56178	56179	56179	she	133	“ There ! ”
56188	56194	56179	56179	she	133	“ They ’ll repel water ! ”
56205	56208	56209	56209	he	250	“ Brilliant ! ”
56221	56232	56209	56209	he	250	“ Okay , team , let ’s go for it ! ”
56430	56433	56435	56435	Wood	250	“ Harry ! ”
56444	56450	56435	56435	Wood	250	“ Harry , behind you ! ”
56502	56506	56507	56507	he	121	“ Come on ! ”
56519	56522	56507	56507	he	121	“ Faster ! ”
56679	56690	56676	56677	a woman	1473	“ Not Harry , not Harry , please not Harry ! ”
56691	56704	56676	56677	a woman	1473	“ Stand aside , you silly girl ... stand aside , now ... ”
56705	56719	56676	56677	a woman	1473	“ Not Harry , please no , take me , kill me instead — ”
56770	56782	56760	56760	He	121	“ Not Harry ! Please ... have mercy ... have mercy ... ”
56800	56808	56789	56790	the woman	1474	“ Lucky the ground was so soft . ”
56809	56818	56789	56790	the woman	1474	“ I thought he was dead for sure . ”
56819	56829	56789	56790	the woman	1474	“ But he did n’t even break his glasses . ”
56890	56904	56919	56919	Harry	121	“ That was the scariest thing I ’ve ever seen in my life . ”
56972	56975	56977	56977	Fred	148	“ Harry ! ”
56987	56993	56977	56977	Fred	148	“ How ’re you feeling ? ”
57019	57023	57024	57024	he	121	“ What happened ? ”
57035	57040	57042	57042	Fred	148	“ You fell off , ”
57044	57054	57042	57042	Fred	148	“ Must ’ve been — what — fifty feet ? ”
57055	57062	57064	57064	Alicia	251	“ We thought you ’d died , ”
57084	57089	57091	57091	Harry	121	“ But the match , ”
57093	57103	57091	57091	Harry	121	“ What happened ? Are we doing a replay ? ”
57119	57126	57091	57091	Harry	121	“ We did n’t — lose ? ”
57127	57133	57135	57135	George	149	“ Diggory got the Snitch , ”
57137	57185	57135	57135	George	149	“ Just after you fell . He did n’t realize what had happened . When he looked back and saw you on the ground , he tried to call it off . Wanted a rematch . But they won fair and square ... even Wood admits it . ”
57186	57191	57193	57193	Harry	121	“ Where is Wood ? ”
57202	57208	57210	57210	Fred	148	“ Still in the showers , ”
57212	57222	57210	57210	Fred	148	“ We think he ’s trying to drown himself . ”
57246	57260	57237	57237	Fred	148	“ C’m on , Harry , you ’ve never missed the Snitch before . ”
57261	57274	57276	57276	George	149	“ There had to be one time you did n’t get it , ”
57278	57285	57287	57287	Fred	148	“ It ’s not over yet , ”
57289	57312	57287	57287	Fred	148	“ We lost by a hundred points , right ? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin ... ”
57313	57325	57327	57327	George	149	“ Hufflepuff’ll have to lose by at least two hundred points , ”
57329	57336	57287	57287	Fred	148	“ But if they beat Ravenclaw ... ”
57337	57353	57287	57287	Fred	148	“ No way , Ravenclaw is too good . But if Slytherin loses against Hufflepuff ... ”
57354	57370	57287	57287	Fred	148	“ It all depends on the points — a margin of a hundred either way — ”
57417	57426	57427	57427	Fred	148	“ We ’ll come and see you later , ”
57431	57451	57427	57427	Fred	148	“ Do n’t beat yourself up , Harry , you ’re still the best Seeker we ’ve ever had . ”
57483	57489	57490	57490	Hermione	133	“ Dumbledore was really angry , ”
57497	57568	57490	57490	Hermione	133	“ I ’ve never seen him like that before . He ran onto the field as you fell , waved his wand , and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground . Then he whirled his wand at the dementors . Shot silver stuff at them . They left the stadium right away ... He was furious they ’d come onto the grounds . We heard him — ”
57569	57578	57580	57580	Ron	151	“ Then he magicked you onto a stretcher , ”
57582	57599	57580	57580	Ron	151	“ And walked up to school with you floating on it . Everyone thought you were ... ”
57654	57661	57640	57640	he	121	“ Did someone get my Nimbus ? ”
57671	57674	57662	57662	Ron	151	“ Er — ”
57675	57678	57680	57680	Harry	121	“ What ? ”
57689	57702	57704	57704	Hermione	133	“ Well ... when you fell off , it got blown away , ”
57707	57710	57662	57662	Ron	151	“ And ? ”
57711	57729	57662	57662	Ron	151	“ And it hit — it hit — oh , Harry — it hit the Whomping Willow . ”
57753	57756	57757	57757	he	121	“ And ? ”
57764	57773	57775	57775	Ron	151	“ Well , you know the Whomping Willow , ”
57777	57787	57775	57775	Ron	151	“ It — it does n’t like being hit . ”
57788	57800	57802	57802	Hermione	133	“ Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around , ”
58457	58474	58476	58476	Ron	151	“ If Snape ’s teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again , I ’m skiving off , ”
58487	58496	58476	58476	Ron	151	“ Check who ’s in there , Hermione . ”
58504	58509	58497	58497	Hermione	133	“ It ’s okay ! ”
58578	58597	58559	58559	they	1056	“ It ’s not fair , he was only filling in , why should he give us homework ? ”
58598	58607	58559	58559	they	1056	“ We do n’t know anything about werewolves — ”
58608	58615	58559	58559	they	1056	“ — two rolls of parchment ! ”
58616	58629	58630	58630	Lupin	199	“ Did you tell Professor Snape we have n’t covered them yet ? ”
58642	58653	58559	58559	they	1056	“ Yes , but he said we were really behind — ”
58654	58661	58559	58559	they	1056	“ — he would n’t listen — ”
58662	58669	58559	58559	they	1056	“ — two rolls of parchment ! ”
58682	58703	58559	58559	they	1056	“ Do n’t worry . I ’ll speak to Professor Snape . You do n’t have to do the essay . ”
58704	58708	58710	58710	Hermione	133	“ Oh no , ”
58716	58723	58710	58710	Hermione	133	“ I ’ve already finished it ! ”
58768	58774	58776	58777	Professor Lupin	199	“ Lures travelers into bogs , ”
58783	58803	58776	58777	Professor Lupin	199	“ You notice the lantern dangling from his hand ? Hops ahead — people follow the light — then — ”
58837	58844	58845	58845	Lupin	199	“ Wait a moment , Harry , ”
58848	58855	58845	58845	Lupin	199	“ I ’d like a word . ”
58872	58879	58881	58881	Lupin	199	“ I heard about the match , ”
58897	58914	58881	58881	Lupin	199	“ and I ’m sorry about your broomstick . Is there any chance of fixing it ? ”
58915	58918	58920	58920	Harry	121	“ No , ”
58922	58930	58920	58920	Harry	121	“ The tree smashed it to bits . ”
58934	58996	58931	58931	Lupin	199	“ They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at Hogwarts . People used to play a game , trying to get near enough to touch the trunk . In the end , a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye , and we were forbidden to go near it . No broomstick would have a chance . ”
58997	59006	59008	59008	Harry	121	“ Did you hear about the dementors too ? ”
59018	59067	59012	59012	Lupin	199	“ Yes , I did . I do n’t think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that angry . They have been growing restless for some time ... furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds ... I suppose they were the reason you fell ? ”
59068	59071	59073	59073	Harry	121	“ Yes , ”
59095	59111	59093	59093	himself	121	“ Why ? Why do they affect me like that ? Am I just — ? ”
59112	59121	59129	59129	he	199	“ It has nothing to do with weakness , ”
59136	59159	59129	59129	he	199	“ The dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others do n’t have . ”
59183	59324	59354	59354	Lupin	199	“ Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth . They infest the darkest , filthiest places , they glory in decay and despair , they drain peace , hope , and happiness out of the air around them . Even Muggles feel their presence , though they ca n’t see them . Get too near a dementor and every good feeling , every happy memory will be sucked out of you . If it can , the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself ... soulless and evil . You ’ll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life . And the worst that happened to you , Harry , is enough to make anyone fall off their broom . You have nothing to feel ashamed of . ”
59325	59332	59333	59333	Harry	121	“ When they get near me — ”
59344	59353	59333	59333	Harry	121	“ I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum . ”
59385	59396	59398	59398	Harry	121	“ Why did they have to come to the match ? ”
59401	59407	59409	59409	Lupin	199	“ They ’re getting hungry , ”
59419	59470	59409	59409	Lupin	199	“ Dumbledore wo n’t let them into the school , so their supply of human prey has dried up ... I do n’t think they could resist the large crowd around the Quidditch field . All that excitement ... emotions running high ... it was their idea of a feast . ”
59471	59477	59478	59478	Harry	121	“ Azkaban must be terrible , ”
59485	59540	59409	59409	Lupin	199	“ The fortress is set on a tiny island , way out to sea , but they do n’t need walls and water to keep the prisoners in , not when they ’re all trapped inside their own heads , incapable of a single cheerful thought . Most of them go mad within weeks . ”
59541	59549	59550	59550	Harry	121	“ But Sirius Black escaped from them , ”
59554	59559	59550	59550	Harry	121	“ He got away ... ”
59577	59580	59581	59581	he	199	“ Yes , ”
59587	59625	59581	59581	he	199	“ Black must have found a way to fight them . I would n’t have believed it possible ... Dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long ... ”
59626	59637	59639	59639	Harry	121	“ You made that dementor on the train back off , ”
59642	59652	59654	59654	Lupin	199	“ There are — certain defenses one can use , ”
59656	59680	59654	59654	Lupin	199	“ But there was only one dementor on the train . The more there are , the more difficult it becomes to resist . ”
59681	59685	59687	59687	Harry	121	“ What defenses ? ”
59691	59697	59687	59687	Harry	121	“ Can you teach me ? ”
59698	59717	59654	59654	Lupin	199	“ I do n’t pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors , Harry ... quite the contrary ... ”
59718	59738	59687	59687	Harry	121	“ But if the dementors come to another Quidditch match , I need to be able to fight them — ”
59752	59798	59739	59739	Lupin	199	“ Well ... all right . I ’ll try and help . But it ’ll have to wait until next term , I ’m afraid . I have a lot to do before the holidays . I chose a very inconvenient time to fall ill . ”
60088	60098	60100	60100	Hermione	133	“ We can do all our Christmas shopping there ! ”
60102	60115	60100	60100	Hermione	133	“ Mum and Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes ! ”
60250	60255	60342	60342	He	121	“ Psst — Harry ! ”
60289	60295	60297	60297	Harry	121	“ What are you doing ? ”
60300	60310	60297	60297	Harry	121	“ How come you ’re not going to Hogsmeade ? ”
60311	60327	60329	60329	Fred	148	“ We ’ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go , ”
60336	60341	60329	60329	Fred	148	“ Come in here ... ”
60381	60390	60391	60391	he	121	“ Early Christmas present for you , Harry , ”
60446	60454	60431	60431	Harry	121	“ What ’s that supposed to be ? ”
60455	60467	60469	60469	George	149	“ This , Harry , is the secret of our success , ”
60476	60487	60489	60489	Fred	148	“ It ’s a wrench , giving it to you , ”
60491	60505	60489	60489	Fred	148	“ but we decided last night , your need ’s greater than ours . ”
60506	60515	60517	60517	George	149	“ Anyway , we know it by heart , ”
60519	60534	60517	60517	George	149	“ We bequeath it to you . We do n’t really need it anymore . ”
60535	60548	60550	60550	Harry	121	“ And what do I need with a bit of old parchment ? ”
60552	60559	60561	60561	Fred	148	“ A bit of old parchment ! ”
60577	60582	60561	60561	Fred	148	“ Explain , George . ”
60583	60603	60604	60604	Harry	121	“ Well ... when we were in our first year , Harry — young , carefree , and innocent — ”
60618	60639	60604	60604	Harry	121	“ — well , more innocent than we are now — we got into a spot of bother with Filch . ”
60640	60657	60604	60604	Harry	121	“ We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason — ”
60658	60675	60604	60604	Harry	121	“ So he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual — ”
60676	60680	60604	60604	Harry	121	“ — detention — ”
60681	60685	60604	60604	Harry	121	“ — disembowelment — ”
60686	60708	60604	60604	Harry	121	“ — and we could n’t help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked Confiscated and Highly Dangerous . ”
60709	60715	60717	60717	Harry	121	“ Do n’t tell me — ”
60723	60732	60734	60734	Fred	148	“ Well , what would you ’ve done ? ”
60736	60756	60734	60734	Fred	148	“ George caused a diversion by dropping another Dungbomb , I whipped the drawer open and grabbed — this . ”
60757	60770	60772	60772	George	149	“ It ’s not as bad as it sounds , you know , ”
60774	60805	60772	60772	George	149	“ We do n’t reckon Filch ever found out how to work it . He probably suspected what it was , though , or he would n’t have confiscated it . ”
60806	60815	60734	60734	Fred	148	“ And you know how to work it ? ”
60816	60820	60822	60822	Fred	148	“ Oh yes , ”
60826	60842	60822	60822	Fred	148	“ This little beauty ’s taught us more than all the teachers in this school . ”
60843	60850	60852	60852	Harry	121	“ You ’re winding me up , ”
60863	60869	60871	60871	George	149	“ Oh , are we ? ”
60887	60899	60873	60873	He	1536	“ I solemnly swear that I am up to no good . ”
61112	61117	61119	61119	Fred	148	“ Right into Hogsmeade , ”
61129	61143	61145	61145	he	121	“ There are seven in all . Now , Filch knows about these four ”
61150	61266	61145	61145	he	121	“ but we ’re sure we ’re the only ones who know about these . Do n’t bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor . We used it until last winter , but it ’s caved in — completely blocked . And we do n’t reckon anyone ’s ever used this one , because the Whomping Willow ’s planted right over the entrance . But this one here , this one leads right into the cellar of Honeydukes . We ’ve used it loads of times . And as you might ’ve noticed , the entrance is right outside this room , through that one - eyed old crone ’s hump . ”
61267	61277	61279	61279	George	149	“ Moony , Wormtail , Padfoot , and Prongs , ”
61288	61295	61279	61279	George	149	“ We owe them so much . ”
61296	61310	61312	61312	Fred	148	“ Noble men , working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers , ”
61315	61318	61320	61320	George	149	“ Right , ”
61323	61336	61320	61320	George	149	“ Do n’t forget to wipe it after you ’ve used it — ”
61337	61345	61346	61346	Fred	148	“ — or anyone can read it , ”
61350	61369	61320	61320	George	149	“ Just tap it again and say , ‘ Mischief managed ! ’ And it ’ll go blank . ”
61370	61376	61378	61378	Fred	148	“ So , young Harry , ”
61387	61393	61378	61378	Fred	148	“ mind you behave yourself . ”
61394	61400	61402	61402	George	149	“ See you in Honeydukes , ”
61770	61773	61728	61728	his	121	“ Dissendium . ”
61774	61777	61778	61778	Harry	121	“ Dissendium ! ”
61873	61876	61865	61865	He	121	“ Lumos ! ”
61909	61913	61892	61892	He	121	“ Mischief managed ! ”
62242	62260	62262	62263	a woman	1473	“ And get another box of Jelly Slugs , dear , they ’ve nearly cleaned us out — ”
62500	62503	62491	62491	Ron	151	“ Special Effects ”
62541	62548	62491	62491	Ron	151	“ Breathe fire for your friends ! ”
62554	62562	62551	62552	Ice Mice	292	“ Hear your teeth chatter and squeak ! ”
62571	62578	62551	62552	Ice Mice	292	“ Hop realistically in the stomach ! ”
62640	62661	62662	62662	Hermione	133	“ Ugh , no , Harry wo n’t want one of those , they ’re for vampires , I expect , ”
62666	62671	62673	62673	Ron	151	“ How about these ? ”
62686	62690	62692	62692	Harry	121	“ Definitely not , ”
62700	62703	62705	62705	Hermione	133	“ Harry ! ”
62707	62721	62705	62705	Hermione	133	“ What are you doing here ? How — how did you — ? ”
62722	62725	62727	62727	Ron	151	“ Wow ! ”
62733	62740	62727	62727	Ron	151	“ you ’ve learned to Apparate ! ”
62741	62748	62750	62750	Harry	121	“ ’ Course I have n’t , ”
62776	62788	62790	62790	Ron	151	“ How come Fred and George never gave it to me ! ”
62794	62800	62790	62790	Ron	151	“ I ’m their brother ! ”
62801	62811	62813	62813	Hermione	133	“ But Harry is n’t going to keep it ! ”
62822	62840	62813	62813	Hermione	133	“ He ’s going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall , are n’t you , Harry ? ”
62841	62848	62850	62850	Harry	121	“ No , I ’m not ! ”
62852	62857	62859	62859	Ron	151	“ Are you mad ? ”
62865	62872	62859	62859	Ron	151	“ Hand in something that good ? ”
62873	62900	62813	62813	Hermione	133	“ If I hand it in , I ’ll have to say where I got it ! Filch would know Fred and George had nicked it ! ”
62901	62908	62909	62909	Hermione	133	“ But what about Sirius Black ? ”
62912	62937	62909	62909	Hermione	133	“ He could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle ! The teachers have got to know ! ”
62938	62949	62951	62951	Harry	121	“ He ca n’t be getting in through a passage , ”
62954	63054	62951	62951	Harry	121	“ There are seven secret tunnels on the map , right ? Fred and George reckon Filch already knows about four of them . And of the other three — one of them ’s caved in , so no one can get through it . One of them ’s got the Whomping Willow planted over the entrance , so you ca n’t get out of it . And the one I just came through — well — it ’s really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar , so unless he knew it was there ... ”
63165	63168	63170	63170	Ron	151	“ See ? ”
63173	63217	63170	63170	Ron	151	“ I ’d like to see Black try and break into Honeydukes with dementors swarming all over the village . Anyway , Hermione , the Honeydukes owners would hear a break - in , would n’t they ? They live over the shop ! ”
63218	63225	63226	63226	Hermione	133	“ Yes , but — but — ”
63236	63286	63226	63226	Hermione	133	“ Look , Harry still should n’t be coming into Hogsmeade . He has n’t got a signed form ! If anyone finds out , he ’ll be in so much trouble ! And it ’s not nightfall yet — what if Sirius Black turns up today ? Now ? ”
63287	63298	63300	63300	Ron	151	“ He ’d have a job spotting Harry in this , ”
63314	63329	63300	63300	Ron	151	“ Come on , Hermione , it ’s Christmas . Harry deserves a break . ”
63339	63347	63348	63348	Harry	121	“ Are you going to report me ? ”
63354	63366	63332	63332	her	133	“ Oh — of course not — but honestly , Harry — ”
63367	63375	63377	63377	Ron	151	“ Seen the Fizzing Whizbees , Harry ? ”
63389	63429	63430	63430	Ron	151	“ And the Jelly Slugs ? And the Acid Pops ? Fred gave me one of those when I was seven — it burnt a hole right through my tongue . I remember Mum walloping him with her broomstick . ”
63439	63456	63430	63430	Ron	151	“ Reckon Fred’d take a bit of Cockroach Cluster if I told him they were peanuts ? ”
63554	63561	63546	63546	Ron	151	“ That ’s the post office — ”
63562	63569	63590	63590	his	151	“ Zonko ’s is up there — ”
63570	63580	63546	63546	Ron	151	“ We could go up to the Shrieking Shack — ”
63581	63586	63588	63588	Ron	151	“ Tell you what , ”
63594	63606	63588	63588	Ron	151	“ shall we go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks ? ”
63673	63679	63681	63681	Ron	151	“ That ’s Madam Rosmerta , ”
63683	63693	63694	63694	he	151	“ I ’ll get the drinks , shall I ? ”
63753	63757	63758	63758	he	151	“ Merry Christmas ! ”
63942	63945	63939	63939	Hermione	133	“ Mobiliarbus ! ”
64041	64046	64036	64037	a woman	1473	“ A small gillywater — ”
64047	64050	64052	64053	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Mine , ”
64057	64064	64036	64037	a woman	1473	“ Four pints of mulled mead — ”
64065	64070	64072	64072	Hagrid	309	“ Ta , Rosmerta , ”
64074	64085	64036	64037	a woman	1473	“ A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella — ”
64086	64089	64091	64092	Professor Flitwick	211	“ Mmm ! ”
64098	64110	64036	64037	a woman	1473	“ So you ’ll be the red currant rum , Minister . ”
64111	64119	64121	64121	Fudge	175	“ Thank you , Rosmerta , m’dear , ”
64125	64149	64121	64121	Fudge	175	“ Lovely to see you again , I must say . Have one yourself , wo n’t you ? Come and join us ... ”
64150	64160	64036	64037	a woman	1473	“ Well , thank you very much , Minister . ”
64239	64254	64256	64257	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ So , what brings you to this neck of the woods , Minister ? ”
64291	64314	64284	64284	he	121	“ What else , m’dear , but Sirius Black ? I daresay you heard what happened up at the school at Halloween ? ”
64315	64322	64324	64325	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ I did hear a rumor , ”
64327	64337	64339	64340	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Did you tell the whole pub , Hagrid ? ”
64343	64356	64358	64359	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ Do you think Black ’s still in the area , Minister ? ”
64361	64368	64370	64370	Fudge	175	“ I ’m sure of it , ”
64373	64385	64387	64388	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ You know that the dementors have searched my pub twice ? ”
64397	64413	64394	64394	her	1614	“ Scared all my customers away ... It ’s very bad for business , Minister . ”
64414	64430	64432	64432	Fudge	175	“ Rosmerta , m’dear , I do n’t like them any more than you do , ”
64435	64472	64432	64432	Fudge	175	“ Necessary precaution ... unfortunate , but there you are ... I ’ve just met some of them . They ’re in a fury against Dumbledore — he wo n’t let them inside the castle grounds . ”
64473	64479	64481	64482	Professor McGonagall	202	“ I should think not , ”
64485	64498	64481	64482	Professor McGonagall	202	“ How are we supposed to teach with those horrors floating around ? ”
64499	64504	64506	64508	tiny Professor Flitwick	211	“ Hear , hear ! ”
64520	64525	64527	64527	Fudge	175	“ All the same , ”
64529	64551	64527	64527	Fudge	175	“ they are here to protect you all from something much worse ... We all know what Black ’s capable of ... ”
64552	64564	64566	64567	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ Do you know , I still have trouble believing it , ”
64570	64631	64566	64567	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ Of all the people to go over to the Dark Side , Sirius Black was the last I ’d have thought ... I mean , I remember him when he was a boy at Hogwarts . If you ’d told me then what he was going to become , I ’d have said you ’d had too much mead . ”
64632	64644	64646	64646	Fudge	175	“ You do n’t know the half of it , Rosmerta , ”
64649	64659	64646	64646	Fudge	175	“ The worst he did is n’t widely known . ”
64660	64664	64669	64669	her	1615	“ The worst ? ”
64675	64687	64669	64669	her	1615	“ Worse than murdering all those poor people , you mean ? ”
64688	64693	64695	64695	Fudge	175	“ I certainly do , ”
64697	64710	64669	64669	her	1615	“ I ca n’t believe that . What could possibly be worse ? ”
64711	64722	64724	64725	Professor McGonagall	202	“ You say you remember him at Hogwarts , Rosmerta , ”
64727	64737	64724	64725	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Do you remember who his best friend was ? ”
64738	64741	64743	64744	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ Naturally , ”
64751	64792	64743	64744	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ Never saw one without the other , did you ? The number of times I had them in here — ooh , they used to make me laugh . Quite the double act , Sirius Black and James Potter ! ”
64806	64809	64811	64812	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Precisely , ”
64814	64853	64811	64812	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Black and Potter . Ringleaders of their little gang . Both very bright , of course — exceptionally bright , in fact — but I do n’t think we ’ve ever had such a pair of troublemakers — ”
64854	64858	64860	64860	Hagrid	309	“ I dunno , ”
64862	64876	64860	64860	Hagrid	309	“ Fred and George Weasley could give ’em a run fer their money . ”
64877	64888	64891	64892	Professor Flitwick	211	“ You ’d have thought Black and Potter were brothers ! ”
64894	64897	64891	64892	Professor Flitwick	211	“ Inseparable ! ”
64898	64904	64906	64906	Fudge	175	“ Of course they were , ”
64908	64960	64906	64906	Fudge	175	“ Potter trusted Black beyond all his other friends . Nothing changed when they left school . Black was best man when James married Lily . Then they named him godfather to Harry . Harry has no idea , of course . You can imagine how the idea would torment him . ”
64961	64977	64979	64980	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ Because Black turned out to be in league with You - Know - Who ? ”
64982	64990	64991	64991	Fudge	175	“ Worse even than that , m’dear ... ”
65004	65100	64993	64993	his	175	“ Not many people are aware that the Potters knew You - Know - Who was after them . Dumbledore , who was of course working tirelessly against You - Know - Who , had a number of useful spies . One of them tipped him off , and he alerted James and Lily at once . He advised them to go into hiding . Well , of course , You - Know - Who was n’t an easy person to hide from . Dumbledore told them that their best chance was the Fidelius Charm . ”
65101	65107	65109	65110	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ How does that work ? ”
65122	65128	65129	65129	he	1616	“ An immensely complex spell , ”
65133	65231	65129	65129	he	1616	“ involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single , living soul . The information is hidden inside the chosen person , or Secret - Keeper , and is henceforth impossible to find — unless , of course , the Secret - Keeper chooses to divulge it . As long as the Secret - Keeper refused to speak , You - Know - Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them , not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting - room window ! ”
65232	65243	65245	65246	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ So Black was the Potters ’ Secret - Keeper ? ”
65248	65251	65253	65254	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Naturally , ”
65256	65303	65253	65254	Professor McGonagall	202	“ James Potter told Dumbledore that Black would die rather than tell where they were , that Black was planning to go into hiding himself ... and yet , Dumbledore remained worried . I remember him offering to be the Potters ’ Secret - Keeper himself . ”
65304	65309	65311	65312	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ He suspected Black ? ”
65314	65337	65339	65340	Professor McGonagall	202	“ He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keeping You - Know - Who informed of their movements , ”
65343	65374	65339	65340	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Indeed , he had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to You - Know - Who . ”
65375	65384	65253	65254	Professor McGonagall	202	“ But James Potter insisted on using Black ? ”
65385	65389	65391	65391	Fudge	175	“ He did , ”
65394	65409	65391	65391	Fudge	175	“ And then , barely a week after the Fidelius Charm had been performed — ”
65410	65415	65417	65418	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ Black betrayed them ? ”
65420	65538	65253	65254	Professor McGonagall	202	“ He did indeed . Black was tired of his double - agent role , he was ready to declare his support openly for You - Know - Who , and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the Potters ’ death . But , as we all know , You - Know - Who met his downfall in little Harry Potter . Powers gone , horribly weakened , he fled . And this left Black in a very nasty position indeed . His master had fallen at the very moment when he , Black , had shown his true colors as a traitor . He had no choice but to run for it — ”
65539	65546	65547	65547	Hagrid	309	“ Filthy , stinkin ’ turncoat ! ”
65559	65562	65564	65565	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Shh ! ”
65567	65572	65574	65574	Hagrid	309	“ I met him ! ”
65576	65730	65731	65731	Hagrid	309	“ I musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people ! It was me what rescued Harry from Lily an ’ James ’s house after they was killed ! Jus ’ got him outta the ruins , poor little thing , with a great slash across his forehead , an ’ his parents dead ... an ’ Sirius Black turns up , on that flyin ’ motorbike he used ter ride . Never occurred ter me what he was doin’ there . I didn ’ know he ’d bin Lily an ’ James ’s Secret - Keeper . Thought he ’d jus ’ heard the news o ’ You - Know - Who ’s attack an ’ come ter see what he could do . White an ’ shakin ’ , he was . An ’ yeh know what I did ? I COMFORTED THE MURDERIN ’ TRAITOR ! ”
65734	65739	65741	65742	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Hagrid , please ! ”
65744	65750	65741	65742	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Keep your voice down ! ”
65751	66014	66065	66065	Fudge	175	“ How was I ter know he wasn ’ upset abou ’ Lily an ’ James ? It was You - Know - Who he cared abou ’ ! An ’ then he says , ‘ Give Harry ter me , Hagrid , I ’m his godfather , I ’ll look after him — ’ Ha ! But I ’d had me orders from Dumbledore , an ’ I told Black no , Dumbledore said Harry was ter go ter his aunt an ’ uncle ’s . Black argued , but in the end he gave in . Told me ter take his motorbike ter get Harry there . ‘ I wo n’t need it anymore , ’ he says . I shoulda known there was somethin’ fishy goin’ on then . He loved that motorbike , what was he givin ’ it ter me for ? Why wouldn ’ he need it anymore ? Fact was , it was too easy ter trace . Dumbledore knew he ’d bin the Potters ’ Secret - Keeper . Black knew he was goin’ ter have ter run fer it that night , knew it was a matter o ’ hours before the Ministry was after him . But what if I ’d given Harry to him , eh ? I bet he ’d ’ve pitched him off the bike halfway out ter sea . His bes ’ friends ’ son ! But when a wizard goes over ter the Dark Side , there ’s nothin’ and no one that matters to ’em anymore ... ”
66031	66054	66024	66025	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ But he did n’t manage to disappear , did he ? The Ministry of Magic caught up with him next day ! ”
66055	66063	66065	66065	Fudge	175	“ Alas , if only we had , ”
66068	66116	66065	66065	Fudge	175	“ It was not we who found him . It was little Peter Pettigrew — another of the Potters ’ friends . Maddened by grief , no doubt , and knowing that Black had been the Potters ’ Secret - Keeper , he went after Black himself . ”
66117	66134	66136	66137	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ Pettigrew ... that fat little boy who was always tagging around after them at Hogwarts ? ”
66139	66147	66149	66150	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Hero - worshipped Black and Potter , ”
66152	66183	66184	66184	She	202	“ Never quite in their league , talent - wise . I was often rather sharp with him . You can imagine how I — how I regret that now ... ”
66195	66202	66204	66204	Fudge	175	“ There , now , Minerva , ”
66207	66275	66204	66204	Fudge	175	“ Pettigrew died a hero ’s death . Eyewitnesses — Muggles , of course , we wiped their memories later — told us how Pettigrew cornered Black . They say he was sobbing , ‘ Lily and James , Sirius ! How could you ? ’ And then he went for his wand . Well , of course , Black was quicker . Blew Pettigrew to smithereens ... ”
66285	66307	66276	66277	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Stupid boy ... foolish boy ... he was always hopeless at dueling ... should have left it to the Ministry ... ”
66308	66344	66345	66345	Hagrid	309	“ I tell yeh , if I ’d got ter Black before little Pettigrew did , I would n’t ’ve messed around with wands — I ’d ’ve ripped him limb — from — limb , ”
66348	66361	66363	66363	Fudge	175	“ You do n’t know what you ’re talking about , Hagrid , ”
66366	66490	66363	66363	Fudge	175	“ Nobody but trained Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad would have stood a chance against Black once he was cornered . I was Junior Minister in the Department of Magical Catastrophes at the time , and I was one of the first on the scene after Black murdered all those people . I — I will never forget it . I still dream about it sometimes . A crater in the middle of the street , so deep it had cracked the sewer below . Bodies everywhere . Muggles screaming . And Black standing there laughing , with what was left of Pettigrew in front of him ... a heap of bloodstained robes and a few — a few fragments — ”
66507	66517	66519	66519	Fudge	175	“ Well , there you have it , Rosmerta , ”
66522	66566	66519	66519	Fudge	175	“ Black was taken away by twenty members of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad and Pettigrew received the Order of Merlin , First Class , which I think was some comfort to his poor mother . Black ’s been in Azkaban ever since . ”
66575	66585	66567	66568	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ Is it true he ’s mad , Minister ? ”
66586	66596	66598	66598	Fudge	175	“ I wish I could say that he was , ”
66601	66765	66598	66598	Fudge	175	“ I certainly believe his master ’s defeat unhinged him for a while . The murder of Pettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man — cruel ... pointless . Yet I met Black on my last inspection of Azkaban . You know , most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark ; there ’s no sense in them ... but I was shocked at how normal Black seemed . He spoke quite rationally to me . It was unnerving . You ’d have thought he was merely bored — asked if I ’d finished with my newspaper , cool as you please , said he missed doing the crossword . Yes , I was astounded at how little effect the dementors seemed to be having on him — and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place , you know . Dementors outside his door day and night . ”
66766	66779	66781	66782	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ But what do you think he ’s broken out to do ? ”
66784	66805	66781	66782	Madam Rosmerta	296	“ Good gracious , Minister , he is n’t trying to rejoin You - Know - Who , is he ? ”
66806	66818	66820	66820	Fudge	175	“ I daresay that is his — er — eventual plan , ”
66823	66871	66820	66820	Fudge	175	“ But we hope to catch Black long before that . I must say , You - Know - Who alone and friendless is one thing ... but give him back his most devoted servant , and I shudder to think how quickly he ’ll rise again ... ”
66889	66913	66915	66916	Professor McGonagall	202	“ You know , Cornelius , if you ’re dining with the headmaster , we ’d better head back up to the castle , ”
66979	66982	66974	66975	the teachers	1009	“ Harry ? ”
67512	67515	67517	67517	Ron	151	“ Harry ? ”
67643	67661	67621	67621	He	121	“ It has happened , my Lord ... the Potters have made me their Secret - Keeper ... ”
67686	67695	67621	67621	He	121	“ Harry , you — you look terrible . ”
67757	67762	67764	67764	Harry	121	“ Where is everyone ? ”
67766	67780	67782	67782	Ron	151	“ Gone ! It ’s the first day of the holidays , remember ? ”
67788	67807	67782	67782	Ron	151	“ It ’s nearly lunchtime ; I was going to come and wake you up in a minute . ”
67842	67853	67854	67854	Hermione	133	“ You really do n’t look well , you know , ”
67863	67868	67870	67870	Harry	121	“ I ’m fine , ”
67872	67877	67879	67879	Hermione	133	“ Harry , listen , ”
67887	67912	67885	67885	Ron	151	“ you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday . But the thing is , you must n’t go doing anything stupid . ”
67913	67917	67919	67919	Harry	121	“ Like what ? ”
67921	67929	67931	67931	Ron	151	“ Like trying to go after Black , ”
67954	67964	67966	67966	Hermione	133	“ You wo n’t , will you , Harry ? ”
67968	67977	67979	67979	Ron	151	“ Because Black ’s not worth dying for , ”
67995	68012	68013	68013	Ron	151	“ D’you know what I see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me ? ”
68023	68084	68015	68015	Hermione	133	“ I can hear my mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort . And if you ’d heard your mum screaming like that , just about to be killed , you would n’t forget it in a hurry . And if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent Voldemort after her — ”
68085	68093	68095	68095	Hermione	133	“ There ’s nothing you can do ! ”
68100	68120	68095	68095	Hermione	133	“ The dementors will catch Black and he ’ll go back to Azkaban and — and serve him right ! ”
68121	68153	68015	68015	Hermione	133	“ You heard what Fudge said . Black is n’t affected by Azkaban like normal people are . It ’s not a punishment for him like it is for the others . ”
68154	68161	68163	68163	Ron	151	“ So what are you saying ? ”
68169	68180	68163	68163	Ron	151	“ You want to — to kill Black or something ? ”
68181	68187	68189	68189	Hermione	133	“ Do n’t be silly , ”
68195	68209	68189	68189	Hermione	133	“ Harry does n’t want to kill anyone , do you , Harry ? ”
68252	68256	68257	68257	he	151	“ Malfoy knows , ”
68261	68290	68257	68257	he	151	“ Remember what he said to me in Potions ? ‘ If it was me , I ’d hunt him down myself ... I ’d want revenge . ’ ”
68291	68304	68306	68306	Ron	151	“ You ’re going to take Malfoy ’s advice instead of ours ? ”
68309	68370	68306	68306	Ron	151	“ Listen ... you know what Pettigrew ’s mother got back after Black had finished with him ? Dad told me — the Order of Merlin , First Class , and Pettigrew ’s finger in a box . That was the biggest bit of him they could find . Black ’s a madman , Harry , and he ’s dangerous — ”
68371	68380	68382	68382	Harry	121	“ Malfoy ’s dad must have told him , ”
68387	68397	68382	68382	Harry	121	“ He was right in Voldemort ’s inner circle — ”
68398	68409	68411	68411	Ron	151	“ Say You - Know - Who , will you ? ”
68414	68428	68382	68382	Harry	121	“ — so obviously , the Malfoys knew Black was working for Voldemort — ”
68429	68469	68382	68382	Harry	121	“ — and Malfoy’d love to see you blown into about a million pieces , like Pettigrew ! Get a grip . Malfoy ’s just hoping you ’ll get yourself killed before he has to play you at Quidditch . ”
68470	68475	68477	68477	Hermione	133	“ Harry , please , ”
68486	68560	68477	68477	Hermione	133	“ please be sensible . Black did a terrible , terrible thing , but d - don’t put yourself in danger , it ’s what Black wants ... Oh , Harry , you ’d be playing right into Black ’s hands if you went looking for him . Your mum and dad would n’t want you to get hurt , would they ? They ’d never want you to go looking for Black ! ”
68561	68584	68586	68586	Harry	121	“ I ’ll never know what they ’d have wanted , because thanks to Black , I ’ve never spoken to them , ”
68608	68611	68613	68613	Ron	151	“ Look , ”
68624	68654	68613	68613	Ron	151	“ it ’s the holidays ! It ’s nearly Christmas ! Let ’s — let ’s go down and see Hagrid . We have n’t visited him for ages ! ”
68655	68658	68660	68660	Hermione	133	“ No ! ”
68663	68675	68660	68660	Hermione	133	“ Harry is n’t supposed to leave the castle , Ron — ”
68676	68683	68685	68685	Harry	121	“ Yeah , let ’s go , ”
68690	68711	68685	68685	Harry	121	“ and I can ask him how come he never mentioned Black when he told me all about my parents ! ”
68727	68737	68738	68738	he	151	“ Or we could have a game of chess , ”
68742	68751	68738	68738	he	151	“ or Gobstones . Percy left a set — ”
68752	68760	68762	68762	Harry	121	“ No , let ’s visit Hagrid , ”
68781	68792	68738	68738	he	151	“ Stand and fight , you yellow - bellied mongrels ! ”
68876	68885	68887	68887	Hermione	133	“ He ’s not out , is he ? ”
68904	68911	68912	68912	he	151	“ There ’s a weird noise , ”
68915	68922	68912	68912	he	151	“ Listen — is that Fang ? ”
68947	68957	68959	68959	Ron	151	“ Think we ’d better go and get someone ? ”
68962	68965	68967	68967	Harry	121	“ Hagrid ! ”
68973	68981	68967	68967	Harry	121	“ Hagrid , are you in there ? ”
69016	69020	69021	69021	he	309	“ Yeh’ve heard ? ”
69114	69121	69123	69123	Hermione	133	“ Hagrid , what is it ? ”
69140	69147	69127	69127	Harry	121	“ What ’s this , Hagrid ? ”
69169	69173	69154	69154	he	309	“ Dear Mr. Hagrid ,
69209	69209	69197	69198	Professor Dumbledore	213	”
69210	69220	69222	69222	Ron	151	“ Well , that ’s okay then , Hagrid ! ”
69349	69352	69354	69354	Ron	151	“ Oh , ”
69356	69376	69354	69354	Ron	151	“ But you said Buckbeak is n’t a bad hippogriff , Hagrid . I bet he ’ll get off — ”
69377	69395	69397	69397	Hagrid	309	“ Yeh don ’ know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o ’ Dangerous Creatures ! ”
69406	69417	69397	69397	Hagrid	309	“ They ’ve got it in fer interestin ’ creatures ! ”
69459	69473	69475	69475	Hagrid	309	“ I couldn ’ leave him tied up out there in the snow ! ”
69477	69486	69475	69475	Hagrid	309	“ All on his own ! At Christmas . ”
69511	69514	69509	69509	he	309	“ interesting creatures ”
69519	69523	69509	69509	he	309	“ terrifying monsters . ”
69555	69569	69571	69571	Hermione	133	“ You ’ll have to put up a good strong defense , Hagrid , ”
69585	69596	69571	69571	Hermione	133	“ I ’m sure you can prove Buckbeak is safe . ”
69597	69604	69606	69606	Hagrid	309	“ Wo n’t make no diff’rence ! ”
69608	69637	69606	69606	Hagrid	309	“ Them Disposal devils , they ’re all in Lucius Malfoy ’s pocket ! Scared o ’ him ! An ’ if I lose the case , Buckbeak — ”
69662	69669	69671	69671	Harry	121	“ What about Dumbledore , Hagrid ? ”
69673	69683	69685	69685	Hagrid	309	“ He ’s done more’n enough fer me already , ”
69687	69711	69685	69685	Hagrid	309	“ Got enough on his plate what with keepin ’ them dementors outta the castle , an ’ Sirius Black lurkin ’ around — ”
69758	69763	69764	69764	he	121	“ Listen , Hagrid , ”
69767	69792	69764	69764	he	121	“ you ca n’t give up . Hermione ’s right , you just need a good defense . You can call us as witnesses — ”
69793	69808	69810	69810	Hermione	133	“ I ’m sure I ’ve read about a case of hippogriff - baiting , ”
69813	69836	69810	69810	Hermione	133	“ where the hippogriff got off . I ’ll look it up for you , Hagrid , and see exactly what happened . ”
69853	69864	69866	69866	Ron	151	“ Er — shall I make a cup of tea ? ”
69873	69885	69886	69886	Ron	151	“ It ’s what my mum does whenever someone ’s upset , ”
69927	69946	69912	69912	Hagrid	309	“ Yer right . I can ’ afford to go ter pieces . Got ta pull meself together ... ”
69966	69974	69976	69976	Hagrid	309	“ I ’ve not bin meself lately , ”
69991	70006	69976	69976	Hagrid	309	“ Worried abou ’ Buckbeak , an ’ no one likin ’ me classes — ”
70007	70013	70015	70015	Hermione	133	“ We do like them ! ”
70019	70026	70028	70028	Ron	151	“ Yeah , they ’re great ! ”
70037	70045	70028	70028	Ron	151	“ Er — how are the flobberworms ? ”
70046	70049	70051	70051	Hagrid	309	“ Dead , ”
70054	70059	70051	70051	Hagrid	309	“ Too much lettuce . ”
70060	70064	70066	70066	Ron	151	“ Oh no ! ”
70072	70086	70088	70088	Hagrid	309	“ An ’ them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an ’ all , ”
70095	70120	70088	70088	Hagrid	309	“ Got ta walk past ’em ev’ry time I want a drink in the Three Broomsticks . ’S like bein ’ back in Azkaban — ”
70161	70170	70157	70157	Hermione	133	“ Is it awful in there , Hagrid ? ”
70171	70176	70178	70178	Hagrid	309	“ Yeh’ve no idea , ”
70181	70225	70178	70178	Hagrid	309	“ Never bin anywhere like it . Thought I was goin’ mad . Kep ’ goin’ over horrible stuff in me mind ... the day I got expelled from Hogwarts ... day me dad died ... day I had ter let Norbert go ... ”
70247	70333	70157	70157	Hermione	133	“ Yeh can ’ really remember who yeh are after a while . An ’ yeh can ’ see the point o ’ livin ’ at all . I used ter hope I ’d jus ’ die in me sleep ... When they let me out , it was like bein ’ born again , ev’rythin ’ came floodin ’ back , it was the bes ’ feelin ’ in the world . Mind , the dementors were n’t keen on lettin ’ me go . ”
70334	70340	70342	70342	Hermione	133	“ But you were innocent ! ”
70347	70401	70344	70344	Hagrid	309	“ Think that matters to them ? They don ’ care . Long as they ’ve got a couple o ’ hundred humans stuck there with ’em , so they can leech all the happiness out of ’em , they don ’ give a damn who ’s guilty an ’ who ’s not . ”
70419	70468	70415	70415	he	309	“ Thought o ’ jus ’ letting Buckbeak go ... tryin ’ ter make him fly away ... but how d’yeh explain ter a hippogriff it ’s got ta go inter hidin ’ ? An ’ — an ’ I ’m scared o ’ breakin ’ the law ... ”
70482	70494	70469	70469	He	309	“ I don ’ ever want ter go back ter Azkaban . ”
70620	70651	70614	70614	they	952	“ Here ’s something ... there was a case in 1722 ... but the hippogriff was convicted — ugh , look what they did to it , that ’s disgusting — ”
70652	70690	70583	70583	Buckbeak	236	“ This might help , look — a manticore savaged someone in 1296 , and they let the manticore off — oh — no , that was only because everyone was too scared to go near it ... ”
70821	70826	70814	70814	Ron	151	“ Oi ! Presents ! ”
70870	70886	70859	70859	Ron	151	“ Another sweater from Mum ... maroon again ... see if you ’ve got one . ”
70945	70950	70952	70952	Ron	151	“ What ’s that ? ”
70968	70971	70952	70952	Ron	151	“ Dunno ... ”
71005	71012	71013	71013	he	151	“ I do n’t believe it , ”
71105	71112	71114	71114	Ron	151	“ Who sent it to you ? ”
71120	71130	71132	71132	Harry	121	“ Look and see if there ’s a card , ”
71142	71155	71134	71134	Ron	151	“ Nothing ! Blimey , who ’d spend that much on you ? ”
71156	71159	71161	71161	Harry	121	“ Well , ”
71166	71176	71161	71161	Harry	121	“ I ’m betting it was n’t the Dursleys . ”
71177	71184	71186	71186	Ron	151	“ I bet it was Dumbledore , ”
71202	71211	71186	71186	Ron	151	“ He sent you the Invisibility Cloak anonymously ... ”
71212	71221	71223	71223	Harry	121	“ That was my dad ’s , though , ”
71225	71255	71223	71223	Harry	121	“ Dumbledore was just passing it on to me . He would n’t spend hundreds of Galleons on me . He ca n’t go giving students stuff like this — ”
71256	71269	71271	71271	Ron	151	“ That ’s why he would n’t say it was from him ! ”
71273	71288	71271	71271	Ron	151	“ In case some git like Malfoy said it was favoritism . Hey , Harry ”
71298	71327	71290	71290	Ron	151	“ Malfoy ! Wait till he sees you on this ! He ’ll be sick as a pig ! This is an international standard broom , this is ! ”
71328	71335	71336	71336	Harry	121	“ I ca n’t believe this , ”
71364	71368	71355	71355	his	151	“ Who — ? ”
71369	71373	71375	71375	Ron	151	“ I know , ”
71380	71391	71375	71375	Ron	151	“ I know who it could ’ve been — Lupin ! ”
71392	71395	71397	71397	Harry	121	“ What ? ”
71405	71428	71403	71403	himself	121	“ Lupin ? Listen , if he had this much gold , he ’d be able to buy himself some new robes . ”
71429	71437	71439	71439	Ron	151	“ Yeah , but he likes you , ”
71441	71471	71439	71439	Ron	151	“ And he was away when your Nimbus got smashed , and he might ’ve heard about it and decided to visit Diagon Alley and get this for you — ”
71472	71481	71483	71483	Harry	121	“ What d’you mean , he was away ? ”
71485	71497	71483	71483	Harry	121	“ He was ill when I was playing in that match . ”
71498	71509	71511	71511	Ron	151	“ Well , he was n’t in the hospital wing , ”
71513	71530	71511	71511	Ron	151	“ I was there , cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from Snape , remember ? ”
71536	71547	71531	71531	Harry	121	“ I ca n’t see Lupin affording something like this . ”
71548	71556	71531	71531	Harry	121	“ What ’re you two laughing about ? ”
71587	71595	71597	71597	Ron	151	“ Do n’t bring him in here ! ”
71641	71651	71622	71622	She	133	“ Oh , Harry ! Who sent you that ? ”
71652	71656	71658	71658	Harry	121	“ No idea , ”
71660	71671	71658	71658	Harry	121	“ There was n’t a card or anything with it . ”
71703	71711	71713	71713	Ron	151	“ What ’s the matter with you ? ”
71715	71721	71723	71723	Hermione	133	“ I do n’t know , ”
71726	71755	71723	71723	Hermione	133	“ but it ’s a bit odd , is n’t it ? I mean , this is supposed to be quite a good broom , is n’t it ? ”
71760	71771	71772	71772	he	151	“ It ’s the best broom there is , Hermione , ”
71775	71784	71756	71756	Ron	151	“ So it must ’ve been really expensive ... ”
71785	71798	71800	71800	Ron	151	“ Probably cost more than all the Slytherins ’ brooms put together , ”
71803	71826	71828	71828	Hermione	133	“ Well ... who ’d send Harry something as expensive as that , and not even tell him they ’d sent it ? ”
71830	71834	71836	71836	Ron	151	“ Who cares ? ”
71839	71855	71836	71836	Ron	151	“ Listen , Harry , can I have a go on it ? Can I ? ”
71856	71869	71871	71871	Hermione	133	“ I do n’t think anyone should ride that broom just yet ! ”
71881	71897	71899	71899	Ron	151	“ What d’you think Harry ’s going to do with it — sweep the floor ? ”
71920	71931	71932	71932	Ron	151	“ GET — HIM — OUT — OF — HERE ! ”
72031	72037	72038	72038	Harry	121	“ I forgot about that ! ”
72049	72061	72038	72038	Harry	121	“ I never wear those socks if I can help it ... ”
72079	72092	72094	72094	Ron	151	“ You ’d better take that cat out of here , Hermione , ”
72106	72115	72116	72116	he	121	“ Ca n’t you shut that thing up ? ”
72223	72234	72235	72235	Harry	121	“ He ’s not looking too good , is he ? ”
72238	72243	72245	72245	Ron	151	“ It ’s stress ! ”
72247	72261	72245	72245	Ron	151	“ He ’d be fine if that big stupid furball left him alone ! ”
72552	72556	72558	72558	Dumbledore	315	“ Merry Christmas ! ”
72570	72594	72565	72565	Hermione	133	“ As there are so few of us , it seemed foolish to use the House tables ... Sit down , sit down ! ”
72613	72616	72618	72618	Dumbledore	315	“ Crackers ! ”
72703	72707	72708	72708	he	264	“ Dig in ! ”
72774	72783	72785	72785	Dumbledore	315	“ Sybill , this is a pleasant surprise ! ”
72790	72799	72801	72802	Professor Trelawney	222	“ I have been crystal gazing , Headmaster , ”
72811	72858	72804	72804	her	222	“ and to my astonishment , I saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you . Who am I to refuse the promptings of fate ? I at once hastened from my tower , and I do beg you to forgive my lateness ... ”
72859	72864	72866	72866	Dumbledore	315	“ Certainly , certainly , ”
72872	72881	72866	72866	Dumbledore	315	“ Let me draw you up a chair — ”
72942	72985	72933	72933	she	222	“ I dare not , Headmaster ! If I join the table , we shall be thirteen ! Nothing could be more unlucky ! Never forget that when thirteen dine together , the first to rise will be the first to die ! ”
72986	72994	72996	72997	Professor McGonagall	202	“ We ’ll risk it , Sybill , ”
73000	73012	72996	72997	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Do sit down , the turkey ’s getting stone cold . ”
73053	73058	73042	73043	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Tripe , Sybill ? ”
73076	73084	73068	73068	she	222	“ But where is dear Professor Lupin ? ”
73085	73096	73098	73098	Dumbledore	315	“ I ’m afraid the poor fellow is ill again , ”
73108	73119	73098	73098	Dumbledore	315	“ Most unfortunate that it should happen on Christmas Day . ”
73120	73130	73132	73133	Professor McGonagall	202	“ But surely you already knew that , Sybill ? ”
73149	73156	73157	73157	she	202	“ Certainly I knew , Minerva , ”
73161	73198	73157	73157	she	202	“ But one does not parade the fact that one is All - Knowing . I frequently act as though I am not possessed of the Inner Eye , so as not to make others nervous . ”
73199	73206	73208	73209	Professor McGonagall	202	“ That explains a great deal , ”
73224	73272	73212	73213	Professor Trelawney	222	“ If you must know , Minerva , I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will not be with us for very long . He seems aware , himself , that his time is short . He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him — ”
73273	73277	73279	73280	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Imagine that , ”
73283	73287	73289	73289	Dumbledore	315	“ I doubt , ”
73312	73333	73307	73308	Professor Trelawney	222	“ that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger . Severus , you ’ve made the potion for him again ? ”
73334	73339	73341	73341	Snape	264	“ Yes , Headmaster , ”
73343	73346	73348	73348	Dumbledore	315	“ Good , ”
73350	73376	73348	73348	Dumbledore	315	“ Then he should be up and about in no time ... Derek , have you had any of these chipolatas ? They ’re excellent . ”
73446	73460	73442	73442	she	1711	“ My dears ! Which of you left his seat first ? Which ? ”
73461	73464	73466	73466	Ron	151	“ Dunno , ”
73473	73482	73484	73485	Professor McGonagall	202	“ I doubt it will make much difference , ”
73488	73509	73484	73485	Professor McGonagall	202	“ unless a mad axe - man is waiting outside the doors to slaughter the first into the entrance hall . ”
73520	73523	73524	73524	Harry	121	“ Coming ? ”
73529	73532	73533	73533	Hermione	133	“ No , ”
73536	73546	73533	73533	Hermione	133	“ I want a quick word with Professor McGonagall . ”
73547	73560	73562	73562	Ron	151	“ Probably trying to see if she can take any more classes , ”
73629	73638	73615	73615	He	220	“ Merry — hic — Christmas ! Password ? ”
73639	73643	73645	73645	Ron	151	“ Scurvy cur , ”
73647	73656	73658	73659	Sir Cadogan	220	“ And the same to you , sir ! ”
73825	73834	73836	73837	Professor McGonagall	202	“ So that ’s it , is it ? ”
73851	73868	73836	73837	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Miss Granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick , Potter . ”
73895	73899	73901	73902	Professor McGonagall	202	“ May I ? ”
73932	73954	73921	73921	She	202	“ Hmm . And there was no note at all , Potter ? No card ? No message of any kind ? ”
73955	73958	73960	73960	Harry	121	“ No , ”
73963	73968	73970	73971	Professor McGonagall	202	“ I see ... , ”
73973	73988	73970	73971	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Well , I ’m afraid I will have to take this , Potter . ”
73989	73994	73996	73996	Harry	121	“ W - what ? ”
74003	74006	73996	73996	Harry	121	“ Why ? ”
74007	74017	74019	74020	Professor McGonagall	202	“ It will need to be checked for jinxes , ”
74022	74044	74019	74020	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Of course , I ’m no expert , but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it down — ”
74045	74050	74052	74052	Ron	151	“ Strip it down ? ”
74061	74072	74074	74075	Professor McGonagall	202	“ It should n’t take more than a few weeks , ”
74077	74093	74074	74075	Professor McGonagall	202	“ You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx - free . ”
74094	74102	74104	74104	Harry	121	“ There ’s nothing wrong with it ! ”
74111	74116	74104	74104	Harry	121	“ Honestly , Professor — ”
74117	74126	74128	74129	Professor McGonagall	202	“ You ca n’t know that , Potter , ”
74134	74174	74128	74129	Professor McGonagall	202	“ not until you ’ve flown it , at any rate , and I ’m afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with . I shall keep you informed . ”
74223	74233	74215	74215	Ron	151	“ What did you go running to McGonagall for ? ”
74256	74280	74240	74240	She	133	“ Because I thought — and Professor McGonagall agrees with me — that that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black ! ”
74486	74492	74493	74493	he	250	“ Had a good Christmas ? ”
74516	74557	74505	74505	he	250	“ I ’ve been doing some thinking over Christmas , Harry . After the last match , you know . If the dementors come to the next one ... I mean ... we ca n’t afford you to — well — ”
74565	74572	74574	74574	Harry	121	“ I ’m working on it , ”
74577	74607	74574	74574	Harry	121	“ Professor Lupin said he ’d train me to ward off the dementors . We should be starting this week . He said he ’d have time after Christmas . ”
74608	74611	74613	74613	Wood	250	“ Ah , ”
74619	74648	74613	74613	Wood	250	“ Well , in that case — I really did n’t want to lose you as Seeker , Harry . And have you ordered a new broom yet ? ”
74649	74652	74654	74654	Harry	121	“ No , ”
74656	74680	74613	74613	Wood	250	“ What ! You ’d better get a move on , you know — you ca n’t ride that Shooting Star against Ravenclaw ! ”
74681	74689	74691	74691	Ron	151	“ He got a Firebolt for Christmas , ”
74693	74707	74613	74613	Wood	250	“ A Firebolt ? No ! Seriously ? A — a real Firebolt ? ”
74708	74716	74718	74718	Harry	121	“ Do n’t get excited , Oliver , ”
74721	74733	74735	74735	he	250	“ I have n’t got it anymore . It was confiscated . ”
74749	74758	74613	74613	Wood	250	“ Jinxed ? How could it be jinxed ? ”
74759	74763	74764	74764	Harry	121	“ Sirius Black , ”
74768	74786	74764	74764	Harry	121	“ He ’s supposed to be after me . So McGonagall reckons he might have sent it . ”
74803	74843	74800	74800	Wood	250	“ But Black could n’t have bought a Firebolt ! He ’s on the run ! The whole country ’s on the lookout for him ! How could he just walk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a broomstick ? ”
74844	74848	74850	74850	Harry	121	“ I know , ”
74852	74862	74850	74850	Harry	121	“ but McGonagall still wants to strip it down — ”
74867	74878	74879	74879	he	250	“ I ’ll go and talk to her , Harry , ”
74882	74922	74879	74879	he	250	“ I ’ll make her see reason ... A Firebolt ... a real Firebolt , on our team ... She wants Gryffindor to win as much as we do ... I ’ll make her see sense . A Firebolt ... ”
75076	75080	75082	75082	Lupin	199	“ Ah yes , ”
75097	75149	75085	75085	Harry	121	“ Let me see ... how about eight o’clock on Thursday evening ? The History of Magic classroom should be large enough ... I ’ll have to think carefully about how we ’re going to do this ... We ca n’t bring a real dementor into the castle to practice on ... ”
75150	75159	75161	75161	Ron	151	“ Still looks ill , does n’t he ? ”
75173	75183	75161	75161	Ron	151	“ What d’you reckon ’s the matter with him ? ”
75190	75192	75085	75085	Harry	121	“ tuh ”
75229	75239	75241	75241	Ron	151	“ And what are you tutting at us for ? ”
75244	75247	75249	75249	Hermione	133	“ Nothing , ”
75263	75269	75271	75271	Ron	151	“ Yes , you were , ”
75273	75287	75271	75271	Ron	151	“ I said I wonder what ’s wrong with Lupin , and you — ”
75288	75296	75298	75298	Hermione	133	“ Well , is n’t it obvious ? ”
75307	75320	75322	75322	Ron	151	“ If you do n’t want to tell us , do n’t , ”
75324	75327	75333	75333	she	133	“ Fine , ”
75337	75343	75345	75345	Ron	151	“ She does n’t know , ”
75352	75366	75345	75345	Ron	151	“ She ’s just trying to get us to talk to her again . ”
75429	75434	75436	75436	Harry	121	“ What ’s that ? ”
75438	75442	75444	75444	Lupin	199	“ Another boggart , ”
75451	75537	75444	75444	Lupin	199	“ I ’ve been combing the castle ever since Tuesday , and very luckily , I found this one lurking inside Mr. Filch ’s filing cabinet . It ’s the nearest we ’ll get to a real dementor . The boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you , so we ’ll be able to practice on him . I can store him in my office when we ’re not using him ; there ’s a cupboard under my desk he ’ll like . ”
75538	75541	75543	75543	Harry	121	“ Okay , ”
75572	75575	75576	75577	Professor Lupin	199	“ So ... ”
75594	75625	75581	75581	his	199	“ The spell I am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic , Harry — well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level . It is called the Patronus Charm . ”
75626	75632	75634	75634	Harry	121	“ How does it work ? ”
75637	75651	75653	75653	Lupin	199	“ Well , when it works correctly , it conjures up a Patronus , ”
75655	75678	75653	75653	Lupin	199	“ which is a kind of anti - dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor . ”
75702	75779	75698	75699	Professor Lupin	199	“ The Patronus is a kind of positive force , a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon — hope , happiness , the desire to survive — but it can not feel despair , as real humans can , so the dementors ca n’t hurt it . But I must warn you , Harry , that the charm might be too advanced for you . Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it . ”
75780	75788	75790	75790	Harry	121	“ What does a Patronus look like ? ”
75793	75805	75698	75699	Professor Lupin	199	“ Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it . ”
75806	75814	75698	75699	Professor Lupin	199	“ And how do you conjure it ? ”
75815	75842	75698	75699	Professor Lupin	199	“ With an incantation , which will work only if you are concentrating , with all your might , on a single , very happy memory . ”
75885	75888	75889	75889	he	121	“ Right , ”
75908	75914	75917	75917	his	199	“ The incantation is this — ”
75920	75924	75917	75917	his	199	“ Expecto Patronum ! ”
75925	75929	75930	75930	Harry	121	“ Expecto Patronum , ”
75936	75940	75930	75930	Harry	121	“ Expecto Patronum . ”
75941	75949	75917	75917	his	199	“ Concentrating hard on your happy memory ? ”
75950	75955	75957	75957	Harry	121	“ Oh — yeah — ”
75970	75986	75957	75957	Harry	121	“ Expecto Patrono — no , Patronum — sorry — Expecto Patronum , Expecto Patronum — ”
76007	76013	76015	76015	Harry	121	“ Did you see that ? ”
76018	76022	76015	76015	Harry	121	“ Something happened ! ”
76023	76027	76029	76029	Lupin	199	“ Very good , ”
76033	76046	76029	76029	Lupin	199	“ Right , then — ready to try it on a dementor ? ”
76047	76050	76051	76051	Harry	121	“ Yes , ”
76196	76200	76201	76201	Harry	121	“ Expecto Patronum ! ”
76204	76210	76201	76201	Harry	121	“ Expecto Patronum ! Expecto — ”
76244	76258	76230	76231	his mother	1394	“ Not Harry ! Not Harry ! Please — I ’ll do anything — ”
76259	76268	76230	76231	his mother	1394	“ Stand aside . Stand aside , girl ! ”
76269	76272	76230	76231	his mother	1394	“ Harry ! ”
76307	76310	76311	76311	he	121	“ Sorry , ”
76326	76332	76334	76334	Lupin	199	“ Are you all right ? ”
76336	76339	76340	76340	Harry	121	“ Yes ... ”
76354	76357	76358	76358	Lupin	199	“ Here — ”
76365	76397	76358	76358	Lupin	199	“ Eat this before we try again . I did n’t expect you to do it your first time ; in fact , I would have been astounded if you had . ”
76398	76404	76405	76405	Harry	121	“ It ’s getting worse , ”
76415	76429	76405	76405	Harry	121	“ I could hear her louder that time — and him — Voldemort — ”
76436	76453	76358	76358	Lupin	199	“ Harry , if you do n’t want to continue , I will more than understand — ”
76454	76458	76460	76460	Harry	121	“ I do ! ”
76474	76513	76460	76460	Harry	121	“ I ’ve got to ! What if the dementors turn up at our match against Ravenclaw ? I ca n’t afford to fall off again . If we lose this game we ’ve lost the Quidditch Cup ! ”
76514	76520	76522	76522	Lupin	199	“ All right then ... , ”
76524	76555	76522	76522	Lupin	199	“ You might want to select another memory , a happy memory , I mean , to concentrate on ... That one does n’t seem to have been strong enough ... ”
76597	76600	76602	76602	Lupin	199	“ Ready ? ”
76609	76612	76614	76614	Harry	121	“ Ready , ”
76644	76647	76649	76649	Lupin	199	“ Go ! ”
76683	76687	76688	76688	Harry	121	“ Expecto Patronum ! ”
76691	76698	76688	76688	Harry	121	“ Expecto Patronum ! Expecto Pat — ”
76729	76751	76720	76721	a man	1751	“ Lily , take Harry and go ! It ’s him ! Go ! Run ! I ’ll hold him off — ”
76774	76782	76755	76755	someone	581	“ Harry ! Harry ... wake up ... ”
76811	76817	76818	76818	Harry	121	“ I heard my dad , ”
76821	76851	76818	76818	Harry	121	“ That ’s the first time I ’ve ever heard him — he tried to take on Voldemort himself , to give my mum time to run for it ... ”
76897	76902	76904	76904	Lupin	199	“ You heard James ? ”
76910	76913	76904	76904	Lupin	199	“ Yeah ... ”
76921	76934	76917	76917	Harry	121	“ Why — you did n’t know my dad , did you ? ”
76935	76947	76949	76949	Lupin	199	“ I — I did , as a matter of fact , ”
76951	76987	76949	76949	Lupin	199	“ We were friends at Hogwarts . Listen , Harry — perhaps we should leave it here for tonight . This charm is ridiculously advanced ... I should n’t have suggested putting you through this ... ”
76988	76991	76993	76993	Harry	121	“ No ! ”
77000	77026	76995	76995	He	121	“ I ’ll have one more go ! I ’m not thinking of happy enough things , that ’s what it is ... Hang on ... ”
77120	77123	77125	77125	Lupin	199	“ Ready ? ”
77140	77149	77131	77131	he	199	“ Concentrating hard ? All right — go ! ”
77178	77182	77183	77183	Harry	121	“ EXPECTO PATRONUM ! ”
77186	77193	77183	77183	Harry	121	“ EXPECTO PATRONUM ! EXPECTO PATRONUM ! ”
77293	77296	77298	77298	Lupin	199	“ Riddikulus ! ”
77377	77380	77381	77381	Lupin	199	“ Excellent ! ”
77391	77402	77381	77381	Lupin	199	“ Excellent , Harry ! That was definitely a start ! ”
77403	77415	77437	77437	He	199	“ Can we have another go ? Just one more go ? ”
77416	77420	77422	77422	Lupin	199	“ Not now , ”
77425	77436	77422	77422	Lupin	199	“ You ’ve had enough for one night . Here — ”
77449	77468	77437	77437	He	199	“ Eat the lot , or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood . Same time next week ? ”
77469	77472	77474	77474	Harry	121	“ Okay , ”
77507	77511	77512	77512	he	121	“ Professor Lupin ? ”
77515	77531	77512	77512	he	121	“ If you knew my dad , you must ’ve known Sirius Black as well . ”
77537	77544	77545	77545	he	199	“ What gives you that idea ? ”
77549	77565	77566	77566	Lupin	199	“ Nothing — I mean , I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too ... ”
77571	77578	77579	77579	he	199	“ Yes , I knew him , ”
77583	77603	77579	77579	he	199	“ Or I thought I did . You ’d better be off , Harry , it ’s getting late . ”
77738	77743	77744	77744	he	121	“ They ’re dead , ”
77749	77780	77744	77744	he	121	“ They ’re dead and listening to echoes of them wo n’t bring them back . You ’d better get a grip on yourself if you want that Quidditch Cup . ”
77973	77980	77981	77981	Ron	151	“ How ’s she doing it ? ”
78015	78019	77981	77981	Ron	151	“ Doing what ? ”
78020	78027	78028	78028	Ron	151	“ Getting to all her classes ! ”
78031	78111	78028	78028	Ron	151	“ I heard her talking to Professor Vector , that Arithmancy witch , this morning . They were going on about yesterday ’s lesson , but Hermione ca n’t ’ve been there , because she was with us in Care of Magical Creatures ! And Ernie Macmillan told me she ’s never missed a Muggle Studies class , but half of them are at the same time as Divination , and she ’s never missed one of them either ! ”
78157	78237	78238	78238	Wood	250	“ Bad news , Harry . I ’ve just been to see Professor McGonagall about the Firebolt . She — er — got a bit shirty with me . Told me I ’d got my priorities wrong . Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup than I do about you staying alive . Just because I told her I did n’t care if it threw you off , as long as you caught the Snitch first . ”
78245	78279	78280	78280	He	250	“ Honestly , the way she was yelling at me ... you ’d think I ’d said something terrible ... Then I asked her how much longer she was going to keep it ... ”
78293	78343	78280	78280	He	250	“ ‘ As long as necessary , Wood ’ ... I reckon it ’s time you ordered a new broom , Harry . There ’s an order form at the back of Which Broomstick ... you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand and One , like Malfoy ’s got . ”
78344	78355	78357	78357	Harry	121	“ I ’m not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good , ”
78426	78439	78440	78441	Professor McGonagall	202	“ No , Potter , you ca n’t have it back yet , ”
78458	78500	78440	78441	Professor McGonagall	202	“ We ’ve checked for most of the usual curses , but Professor Flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex . I shall tell you once we ’ve finished checking it . Now , please stop badgering me . ”
78603	78612	78614	78615	Professor Lupin	199	“ You ’re expecting too much of yourself , ”
78624	78653	78614	78615	Professor Lupin	199	“ For a thirteen - year - old wizard , even an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement . You are n’t passing out anymore , are you ? ”
78654	78668	78670	78670	Harry	121	“ I thought a Patronus would — charge the dementors down or something , ”
78673	78678	78670	78670	Harry	121	“ Make them disappear — ”
78679	78687	78689	78689	Lupin	199	“ The true Patronus does do that , ”
78691	78738	78689	78689	Lupin	199	“ But you ’ve achieved a great deal in a very short space of time . If the dementors put in an appearance at your next Quidditch match , you will be able to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the ground . ”
78739	78752	78754	78754	Harry	121	“ You said it ’s harder if there are loads of them , ”
78756	78764	78766	78766	Lupin	199	“ I have complete confidence in you , ”
78770	78793	78766	78766	Lupin	199	“ Here — you ’ve earned a drink — something from the Three Broomsticks . You wo n’t have tried it before — ”
78803	78806	78808	78808	Harry	121	“ Butterbeer ! ”
78813	78821	78808	78808	Harry	121	“ Yeah , I like that stuff ! ”
78827	78840	78841	78841	Harry	121	“ Oh — Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade , ”
78845	78849	78851	78851	Lupin	199	“ I see , ”
78860	78887	78888	78888	he	199	“ Well — let ’s drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw ! Not that I ’m supposed to take sides , as a teacher ... , ”
78911	78920	78900	78900	Harry	121	“ What ’s under a dementor ’s hood ? ”
78928	78964	78921	78922	Professor Lupin	199	“ Hmmm ... well , the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us . You see , the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weapon . ”
78965	78970	78921	78922	Professor Lupin	199	“ What ’s that ? ”
78971	78980	78982	78982	Lupin	199	“ They call it the Dementor ’s Kiss , ”
78990	79035	78982	78982	Lupin	199	“ It ’s what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly . I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there , because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and — and suck out his soul . ”
79045	79052	78921	78922	Professor Lupin	199	“ What — they kill — ? ”
79053	79057	79059	79059	Lupin	199	“ Oh no , ”
79061	79134	79059	79059	Lupin	199	“ Much worse than that . You can exist without your soul , you know , as long as your brain and heart are still working . But you ’ll have no sense of self anymore , no memory , no ... anything . There ’s no chance at all of recovery . You ’ll just — exist . As an empty shell . And your soul is gone forever ... lost . ”
79145	79179	79135	79135	Lupin	199	“ It ’s the fate that awaits Sirius Black . It was in the Daily Prophet this morning . The Ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find him . ”
79207	79212	79213	79213	he	121	“ He deserves it , ”
79217	79222	79224	79224	Lupin	199	“ You think so ? ”
79227	79236	79224	79224	Lupin	199	“ Do you really think anyone deserves that ? ”
79237	79240	79242	79242	Harry	121	“ Yes , ”
79245	79252	79242	79242	Harry	121	“ For ... for some things ... ”
79383	79393	79460	79460	She	202	“ Do watch where you ’re going , Potter ! ”
79394	79399	79460	79460	She	202	“ Sorry , Professor — ”
79400	79454	79460	79460	She	202	“ I ’ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room . Well , here it is , we ’ve done everything we could think of , and there does n’t seem to be anything wrong with it at all . You ’ve got a very good friend somewhere , Potter ... ”
79475	79482	79483	79483	Harry	121	“ I can have it back ? ”
79487	79490	79483	79483	Harry	121	“ Seriously ? ”
79491	79494	79500	79500	she	202	“ Seriously , ”
79505	79567	79500	79500	she	202	“ I daresay you ’ll need to get the feel of it before Saturday ’s match , wo n’t you ? And Potter — do try and win , wo n’t you ? Or we ’ll be out of the running for the eighth year in a row , as Professor Snape was kind enough to remind me only last night ... ”
79599	79621	79588	79588	Ron	151	“ She gave it to you ? Excellent ! Listen , can I still have a go on it ? Tomorrow ? ”
79622	79628	79630	79630	Harry	121	“ Yeah ... anything ... , ”
79643	79662	79630	79630	Harry	121	“ You know what — we should make up with Hermione ... She was only trying to help ... ”
79663	79669	79671	79671	Ron	151	“ Yeah , all right , ”
79673	79688	79671	79671	Ron	151	“ She ’s in the common room now — working , for a change — ”
79715	79721	79722	79722	Neville	170	“ I wrote them down ! ”
79727	79736	79722	79722	Neville	170	“ But I must ’ve dropped them somewhere ! ”
79737	79742	79744	79745	Sir Cadogan	220	“ A likely tale ! ”
79754	79781	79752	79752	Ron	151	“ Good even , my fine young yeomen ! Come clap this loon in irons . He is trying to force entry to the chambers within ! ”
79782	79788	79790	79790	Ron	151	“ Oh , shut up , ”
79800	79807	79808	79808	Neville	170	“ I ’ve lost the passwords ! ”
79813	79848	79808	79808	Neville	170	“ I made him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week , because he keeps changing them , and now I do n’t know what I ’ve done with them ! ”
79849	79852	79854	79854	Harry	121	“ Oddsbodikins , ”
79901	79910	79808	79808	Neville	170	“ Where ’d you get it , Harry ? ”
79911	79920	79895	79895	people	2741	“ Will you let me have a go ? ”
79921	79930	79808	79808	Neville	170	“ Have you ridden it yet , Harry ? ”
79931	79944	79895	79895	people	2741	“ Ravenclaw’ll have no chance , they ’re all on Cleansweep Sevens ! ”
79945	79954	79808	79808	Neville	170	“ Can I just hold it , Harry ? ”
80023	80029	80031	80031	Harry	121	“ I got it back , ”
80042	80055	80057	80057	Ron	151	“ See , Hermione ? There was n’t anything wrong with it ! ”
80059	80067	80069	80069	Hermione	133	“ Well — there might have been ! ”
80071	80085	80069	80069	Hermione	133	“ I mean , at least you know now that it ’s safe ! ”
80086	80093	80095	80095	Harry	121	“ Yeah , I suppose so , ”
80097	80105	80095	80095	Harry	121	“ I ’d better put it upstairs — ”
80106	80112	80114	80114	Ron	151	“ I ’ll take it ! ”
80117	80128	80114	80114	Ron	151	“ I ’ve got to give Scabbers his rat tonic . ”
80154	80162	80163	80163	Harry	121	“ Can I sit down , then ? ”
80167	80172	80174	80174	Hermione	133	“ I suppose so , ”
80215	80221	80186	80186	Harry	121	“ Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity ”
80235	80245	80246	80246	Harry	121	“ How are you getting through all this stuff ? ”
80250	80261	80263	80263	Hermione	133	“ Oh , well — you know — working hard , ”
80280	80292	80293	80293	Harry	121	“ Why do n’t you just drop a couple of subjects ? ”
80308	80315	80317	80317	Hermione	133	“ I could n’t do that ! ”
80322	80327	80329	80329	Harry	121	“ Arithmancy looks terrible , ”
80341	80349	80351	80351	Hermione	133	“ Oh no , it ’s wonderful ! ”
80354	80364	80351	80351	Hermione	133	“ It ’s my favorite subject ! It ’s — ”
80432	80435	80436	80436	he	151	“ LOOK ! ”
80446	80449	80450	80450	he	151	“ LOOK ! ”
80460	80466	80450	80450	he	151	“ Ron , what — ? ”
80467	80474	80436	80436	he	151	“ SCABBERS ! LOOK ! SCABBERS ! ”
80509	80512	80513	80513	Ron	151	“ BLOOD ! ”
80520	80534	80513	80513	Ron	151	“ HE ’S GONE ! AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR ? ”
80535	80540	80542	80542	Hermione	133	“ N - no , ”
80751	80763	80764	80764	she	133	“ Okay , side with Ron , I knew you would ! ”
80768	80802	80764	80764	she	133	“ First the Firebolt , now Scabbers , everything ’s my fault , is n’t it ! Just leave me alone , Harry , I ’ve got a lot of work to do ! ”
80815	80830	80832	80832	Fred	148	“ Come on , Ron , you were always saying how boring Scabbers was , ”
80835	80873	80832	80832	Fred	148	“ And he ’s been off - color for ages , he was wasting away . It was probably better for him to snuff it quickly — one swallow — he probably did n’t feel a thing . ”
80874	80877	80879	80879	Ginny	144	“ Fred ! ”
80882	80898	80900	80900	George	149	“ All he did was eat and sleep , Ron , you said it yourself , ”
80902	80910	80911	80911	Ron	151	“ He bit Goyle for us once ! ”
80915	80920	80911	80911	Ron	151	“ Remember , Harry ? ”
80921	80928	80930	80930	Harry	121	“ Yeah , that ’s true , ”
80932	80937	80939	80939	Fred	148	“ His finest hour , ”
80948	80990	80939	80939	Fred	148	“ Let the scar on Goyle ’s finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory . Oh , come on , Ron , get yourself down to Hogsmeade and buy a new rat , what ’s the point of moaning ? ”
81049	81063	81104	81104	She	275	“ Great ! Can I try and shoot a few goals on it ? ”
81122	81207	81104	81104	She	275	“ Look at the balance on it ! If the Nimbus series has a fault , it ’s a slight list to the tail end — you often find they develop a drag after a few years . They ’ve updated the handle too , a bit slimmer than the Cleansweeps , reminds me of the old Silver Arrows — a pity they ’ve stopped making them . I learned to fly on one , and a very fine old broom it was too ... ”
81221	81242	81218	81218	Wood	250	“ Er — Madam Hooch ? Is it okay if Harry has the Firebolt back ? We need to practice ... ”
81243	81256	81258	81259	Madam Hooch	275	“ Oh — right — here you are , then , Potter , ”
81261	81270	81258	81259	Madam Hooch	275	“ I ’ll sit over here with Weasley ... ”
81299	81348	81349	81349	Wood	250	“ Harry , I ’ve just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker . It ’s Cho Chang . She ’s a fourth year , and she ’s pretty good ... I really hoped she would n’t be fit , she ’s had some problems with injuries ... ”
81365	81391	81392	81392	He	250	“ On the other hand , she rides a Comet Two Sixty , which is going to look like a joke next to the Firebolt . ”
81406	81415	81392	81392	He	250	“ Okay , everyone , let ’s go — ”
81521	81531	81532	81532	Wood	250	“ Harry , I ’m letting the Snitch out ! ”
81682	81695	81697	81697	Wood	250	“ I ca n’t see what ’s going to stop us tomorrow ! ”
81699	81717	81697	81697	Wood	250	“ Not unless — Harry , you ’ve sorted out your dementor problem , have n’t you ? ”
81718	81721	81723	81723	Harry	121	“ Yeah , ”
81736	81751	81753	81753	Fred	148	“ The dementors wo n’t turn up again , Oliver . Dumbledore’d go ballistic , ”
81756	81764	81766	81766	Wood	250	“ Well , let ’s hope not , ”
81768	81788	81766	81766	Wood	250	“ Anyway — good work , everyone . Let ’s get back to the tower ... turn in early — ”
81789	81806	81807	81807	Harry	121	“ I ’m staying out for a bit ; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt , ”
81853	81858	81860	81860	Harry	121	“ Here you go , ”
82008	82014	82016	82016	Ron	151	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
82029	82032	82021	82021	Ron	151	“ Lumos ! ”
82065	82071	82072	82072	Ron	151	“ Get out of here ! ”
82108	82111	82112	82112	Ron	151	“ See ? ”
82122	82145	82112	82112	Ron	151	“ She ’s still letting him wander about wherever he wants — probably washing down Scabbers with a couple of birds now ... ”
82298	82305	82307	82307	Ron	151	“ Did you see his face ? ”
82315	82326	82307	82307	Ron	151	“ He ca n’t believe it ! This is brilliant ! ”
82341	82348	82349	82349	he	151	“ Put it here , Harry , ”
82422	82432	82437	82437	she	1830	“ Now , now , Penny , no sabotage ! ”
82443	82453	82454	82454	he	147	“ Penelope and I have got a bet on , ”
82459	82469	82454	82454	he	147	“ Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match ! ”
82487	82495	82497	82497	Percy	147	“ Harry — make sure you win , ”
82504	82520	82497	82497	Percy	147	“ I have n’t got ten Galleons . Yes , I ’m coming , Penny ! ”
82534	82544	82561	82561	Crabbe	204	“ Sure you can manage that broom , Potter ? ”
82568	82574	82576	82576	Harry	121	“ Yeah , reckon so , ”
82579	82590	82592	82592	Malfoy	203	“ Got plenty of special features , has n’t it ? ”
82598	82617	82592	82592	Malfoy	203	“ Shame it does n’t come with a parachute — in case you get too near a dementor . ”
82623	82637	82639	82639	Harry	121	“ Pity you ca n’t attach an extra arm to yours , Malfoy , ”
82641	82651	82639	82639	Harry	121	“ Then it could catch the Snitch for you . ”
82839	82849	82851	82851	Wood	250	“ You know what we ’ve got to do , ”
82861	82892	82851	82851	Wood	250	“ If we lose this match , we ’re out of the running . Just — just fly like you did in practice yesterday , and we ’ll be okay ! ”
83001	83009	83010	83011	Madam Hooch	275	“ Wood , Davies , shake hands , ”
83024	83039	83016	83016	Wood	250	“ Mount your brooms ... on my whistle ... three — two — one — ”
83092	83140	83058	83058	he	121	“ They ’re off , and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor . According to Which Broomstick , the Firebolt ’s going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this year ’s World Championship — ”
83141	83157	83159	83160	Professor McGonagall	202	“ Jordan , would you mind telling us what ’s going on in the match ? ”
83164	83194	83058	83058	he	121	“ Right you are , Professor — just giving a bit of background information — the Firebolt , incidentally , has a built - in auto - brake and — ”
83195	83198	83249	83249	she	253	“ Jordan ! ”
83199	83214	83058	83058	he	121	“ Okay , okay , Gryffindor in possession , Katie Bell heading for goal ... ”
83261	83269	83270	83270	Fred	148	“ Show her your acceleration , Harry ! ”
83425	83427	83380	83381	a Bludger	1453	“ Ooooooh ”
83475	83528	83449	83449	his	1863	“ Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero , and look at that Firebolt go ! Potter ’s really putting it through its paces now , see it turn — Chang ’s Comet is just no match for it , the Firebolt ’s precision - balance is really noticeable in these long — ”
83529	83546	83449	83449	his	1863	“ JORDAN ! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS ? GET ON WITH THE COMMENTARY ! ”
83639	83651	83652	83652	Wood	250	“ HARRY , THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN ! ”
83662	83673	83652	83652	Wood	250	“ KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO ! ”
83843	83846	83848	83848	Cho	328	“ Oh ! ”
83900	83904	83892	83892	he	121	“ Expecto Patronum ! ”
84029	84035	84036	84036	Wood	250	“ That ’s my boy ! ”
84124	84127	84128	84128	Ron	151	“ Yes ! ”
84139	84144	84128	84128	Ron	151	“ Yes ! Yes ! ”
84145	84151	84153	84153	Percy	147	“ Well done , Harry ! ”
84158	84171	84153	84153	Percy	147	“ Ten Galleons to me ! Must find Penelope , excuse me — ”
84172	84179	84181	84182	Seamus Finnigan	187	“ Good for you , Harry ! ”
84184	84188	84190	84190	Hagrid	309	“ Ruddy brilliant ! ”
84199	84206	84153	84153	Percy	147	“ That was quite some Patronus , ”
84230	84240	84241	84241	Harry	121	“ The dementors did n’t affect me at all ! ”
84245	84253	84241	84241	Harry	121	“ I did n’t feel a thing ! ”
84254	84267	84269	84270	Professor Lupin	199	“ That would be because they — er — were n’t dementors , ”
84272	84277	84269	84270	Professor Lupin	199	“ Come and see — ”
84297	84306	84308	84308	Lupin	199	“ You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright , ”
84382	84387	84388	84388	she	1885	“ An unworthy trick ! ”
84392	84437	84388	84388	she	1885	“ A low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker ! Detention for all of you , and fifty points from Slytherin ! I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore about this , make no mistake ! Ah , here he comes now ! ”
84491	84497	84499	84499	George	149	“ Come on , Harry ! ”
84506	84515	84499	84499	George	149	“ Party ! Gryffindor common room , now ! ”
84516	84519	84521	84521	Harry	121	“ Right , ”
84614	84621	84623	84624	Angelina Johnson	252	“ How did you do that ? ”
84635	84650	84651	84651	Fred	148	“ With a little help from Moony , Wormtail , Padfoot , and Prongs , ”
84715	84724	84725	84725	he	121	“ Did you even come to the match ? ”
84729	84735	84737	84737	Hermione	133	“ Of course I did , ”
84750	84776	84737	84737	Hermione	133	“ And I ’m very glad we won , and I think you did really well , but I need to read this by Monday . ”
84777	84789	84790	84790	Harry	121	“ Come on , Hermione , come and have some food , ”
84812	84833	84835	84835	Hermione	133	“ I ca n’t , Harry . I ’ve still got four hundred and twenty - two pages to read ! ”
84842	84845	84835	84835	Hermione	133	“ Anyway ... ”
84853	84863	84846	84846	She	133	“ He does n’t want me to join in . ”
84880	84906	84872	84872	Ron	151	“ If Scabbers had n’t just been eaten , he could have had some of those Fudge Flies . He used to really like them — ”
84948	84957	84958	84958	Harry	121	“ Ca n’t you give her a break ? ”
84963	84966	84968	84968	Ron	151	“ No , ”
84971	85005	84968	84968	Ron	151	“ If she just acted like she was sorry — but she ’ll never admit she ’s wrong , Hermione . She ’s still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation or something . ”
85202	85207	85193	85193	he	121	“ AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH ! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ! ”
85254	85260	85242	85243	Seamus Finnigan	187	“ What ’s going on ? ”
85319	85329	85316	85316	his	151	“ Black ! Sirius Black ! With a knife ! ”
85330	85333	85296	85296	Ron	151	“ What ? ”
85334	85348	85316	85316	his	151	“ Here ! Just now ! Slashed the curtains ! Woke me up ! ”
85349	85359	85361	85361	Dean	181	“ You sure you were n’t dreaming , Ron ? ”
85363	85377	85316	85316	his	151	“ Look at the curtains ! I tell you , he was here ! ”
85412	85416	85316	85316	his	151	“ Who shouted ? ”
85417	85423	85316	85316	his	151	“ What ’re you doing ? ”
85450	85461	85316	85316	his	151	“ Are you sure you were n’t dreaming , Ron ? ”
85462	85472	85316	85316	his	151	“ I ’m telling you , I saw him ! ”
85473	85480	85316	85316	his	151	“ What ’s all the noise ? ”
85481	85491	85316	85316	his	151	“ Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed ! ”
85517	85525	85527	85528	Fred Weasley	148	“ Excellent , are we carrying on ? ”
85531	85536	85538	85538	Percy	147	“ Everyone back upstairs ! ”
85558	85564	85566	85566	Ron	151	“ Perce — Sirius Black ! ”
85569	85582	85566	85566	Ron	151	“ In our dormitory ! With a knife ! Woke me up ! ”
85590	85593	85595	85595	Percy	147	“ Nonsense ! ”
85600	85614	85595	85595	Percy	147	“ You had too much to eat , Ron — had a nightmare — ”
85615	85621	85644	85644	she	202	“ I ’m telling you — ”
85622	85631	85595	85595	Percy	147	“ Now , really , enough ’s enough ! ”
85654	85678	85637	85637	She	202	“ I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match , but this is getting ridiculous ! Percy , I expected better of you ! ”
85679	85689	85691	85691	Percy	147	“ I certainly did n’t authorize this , Professor ! ”
85698	85719	85694	85694	himself	147	“ I was just telling them all to get back to bed ! My brother Ron here had a nightmare — ”
85720	85726	85727	85727	Ron	151	“ IT WASN’T A NIGHTMARE ! ”
85730	85749	85727	85727	Ron	151	“ PROFESSOR , I WOKE UP , AND SIRIUS BLACK WAS STANDING OVER ME , HOLDING A KNIFE ! ”
85756	85775	85754	85754	him	151	“ Do n’t be ridiculous , Weasley , how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait hole ? ”
85776	85780	85782	85782	Ron	151	“ Ask him ! ”
85797	85804	85782	85782	Ron	151	“ Ask him if he saw — ”
85830	85844	85754	85754	him	151	“ Sir Cadogan , did you just let a man enter Gryffindor Tower ? ”
85845	85851	85853	85854	Sir Cadogan	220	“ Certainly , good lady ! ”
85870	85876	85878	85879	Professor McGonagall	202	“ You — you did ? ”
85881	85888	85878	85879	Professor McGonagall	202	“ But — but the password ! ”
85889	85894	85896	85897	Sir Cadogan	220	“ He had ’em ! ”
85900	85919	85896	85897	Sir Cadogan	220	“ Had the whole week ’s , my lady ! Read ’em off a little piece of paper ! ”
85941	85945	85946	85946	she	202	“ Which person , ”
85953	85970	85949	85949	her	202	“ which abysmally foolish person wrote down this week ’s passwords and left them lying around ? ”
86264	86272	86273	86273	Harry	121	“ D’you reckon we should tell someone ? ”
86277	86288	86290	86290	Ron	151	“ We know he ’s not coming in through Honeydukes , ”
86293	86306	86290	86290	Ron	151	“ We ’d ’ve heard if the shop had been broken into . ”
86403	86511	86512	86512	Ron	151	“ ... I was asleep , and I heard this ripping noise , and I thought it was in my dream , you know ? But then there was this draft ... I woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down ... I rolled over ... and I saw him standing over me ... like a skeleton , with loads of filthy hair ... holding this great long knife , must ’ve been twelve inches ... and he looked at me , and I looked at him , and then I yelled , and he scampered . Why , though ? ”
86534	86540	86512	86512	Ron	151	“ Why did he run ? ”
86599	86624	86626	86626	Harry	121	“ He must ’ve known he ’d have a job getting back out of the castle once you ’d yelled and woken people up , ”
86629	86655	86626	86626	Harry	121	“ He ’d ’ve had to kill the whole House to get back through the portrait hole ... then he would ’ve met the teachers ... ”
86838	86845	86846	86846	Ron	151	“ Run for it , Neville , ”
86958	86967	86946	86946	Hedwig	134	“ Ouch ! Oh — thanks , Hedwig . ”
86989	86994	86968	86968	Harry	121	“ Dear Harry and Ron ,
87037	87037	87035	87035	Hagrid	309	”
87038	87048	87050	87050	Ron	151	“ He probably wants to hear all about Black ! ”
87089	87095	87097	87097	Ron	151	“ All right , Hagrid ! ”
87099	87112	87097	87097	Ron	151	“ S’pose you want to hear about Saturday night , do you ? ”
87113	87123	87125	87125	Hagrid	309	“ I ’ve already heard all abou ’ it , ”
87136	87139	87141	87141	Ron	151	“ Oh , ”
87226	87234	87236	87236	Harry	121	“ What are they for , Hagrid ? ”
87238	87253	87255	87255	Hagrid	309	“ Buckbeak ’s case against the Committee fer the Disposal o ’ Dangerous Creatures , ”
87257	87282	87255	87255	Hagrid	309	“ This Friday . Him an ’ me’ll be goin’ down ter London together . I ’ve booked two beds on the Knight Bus ... ”
87378	87388	87390	87390	Hagrid	309	“ I got somethin’ ter discuss with you two , ”
87401	87404	87406	87406	Harry	121	“ What ? ”
87408	87411	87413	87413	Hagrid	309	“ Hermione , ”
87415	87420	87422	87422	Ron	151	“ What about her ? ”
87424	87481	87503	87503	Hagrid	309	“ She ’s in a righ ’ state , that ’s what . She ’s bin comin ’ down ter visit me a lot since Chris’mas . Bin feelin ’ lonely . Firs ’ yeh weren ’ talking to her because o ’ the Firebolt , now yer not talkin ’ to her because her cat — ”
87482	87487	87488	87488	Ron	151	“ — ate Scabbers ! ”
87492	87502	87503	87503	Hagrid	309	“ Because her cat acted like all cats do , ”
87507	87582	87503	87503	Hagrid	309	“ She ’s cried a fair few times , yeh know . Goin’ through a rough time at the moment . Bitten off more’n she can chew , if yeh ask me , all the work she ’s tryin ’ ter do . Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak ’s case , mind ... She ’s found some really good stuff fer me ... reckon he ’ll stand a good chance now ... ”
87583	87595	87596	87596	Harry	121	“ Hagrid , we should ’ve helped as well — sorry — ”
87600	87608	87610	87610	Hagrid	309	“ I ’m not blamin ’ yeh ! ”
87618	87671	87610	87610	Hagrid	309	“ Gawd knows yeh’ve had enough ter be gettin ’ on with . I ’ve seen yeh practicin ’ Quidditch ev’ry hour o ’ the day an ’ night — but I got ta tell yeh , I thought you two’d value yer friend more’n broomsticks or rats . Tha ’s all . ”
87679	87717	87789	87789	him	309	“ Really upset , she was , when Black nearly stabbed yeh , Ron . She ’s got her heart in the right place , Hermione has , an ’ you two not talkin ’ to her — ”
87718	87736	87737	87737	Ron	151	“ If she ’d just get rid of that cat , I ’d speak to her again ! ”
87741	87766	87737	87737	Ron	151	“ But she ’s still sticking up for it ! It ’s a maniac , and she wo n’t hear a word against it ! ”
87767	87783	87785	87785	Hagrid	309	“ Ah , well , people can be a bit stupid abou ’ their pets , ”
87851	87857	87859	87859	Ron	151	“ Hogsmeade , next weekend ! ”
87871	87876	87877	87877	he	151	“ What d’you reckon ? ”
87889	87903	87904	87904	Harry	121	“ Well , Filch has n’t done anything about the passage into Honeydukes ... ”
87911	87914	87877	87877	he	151	“ Harry ! ”
87955	87974	87976	87976	Hermione	133	“ Harry , if you go into Hogsmeade again ... I ’ll tell Professor McGonagall about that map ! ”
87978	87987	87989	87989	Ron	151	“ Can you hear someone talking , Harry ? ”
87996	88025	88053	88053	Hermione	133	“ Ron , how can you let him go with you ? After what Sirius Black nearly did to you ! I mean it , I ’ll tell — ”
88026	88037	88039	88039	Ron	151	“ So now you ’re trying to get Harry expelled ! ”
88042	88052	88039	88039	Ron	151	“ Have n’t you done enough damage this year ? ”
88098	88104	88105	88105	Ron	151	“ So how about it ? ”
88117	88141	88105	88105	Ron	151	“ Come on , last time we went you did n’t see anything . You have n’t even been inside Zonko ’s yet ! ”
88155	88158	88159	88159	he	121	“ Okay , ”
88162	88173	88159	88159	he	121	“ But I ’m taking the Invisibility Cloak this time . ”
88248	88252	88253	88253	Harry	121	“ ’ Bye ! ”
88258	88266	88253	88253	Harry	121	“ See you when you get back ! ”
88339	88342	88330	88330	Harry	121	“ Dissendium ! ”
88365	88378	88359	88359	Neville	170	“ Harry ! I forgot you were n’t going to Hogsmeade either ! ”
88379	88384	88386	88386	Harry	121	“ Hi , Neville , ”
88403	88410	88386	88386	Harry	121	“ What are you up to ? ”
88411	88414	88416	88416	Neville	170	“ Nothing , ”
88418	88426	88416	88416	Neville	170	“ Want a game of Exploding Snap ? ”
88427	88449	88386	88386	Harry	121	“ Er — not now — I was going to go to the library and do that vampire essay for Lupin — ”
88450	88457	88459	88459	Neville	170	“ I ’ll come with you ! ”
88462	88470	88459	88459	Neville	170	“ I have n’t done it either ! ”
88471	88488	88386	88386	Harry	121	“ Er — hang on — yeah , I forgot , I finished it last night ! ”
88489	88497	88499	88499	Neville	170	“ Great , you can help me ! ”
88506	88528	88499	88499	Neville	170	“ I do n’t understand that thing about the garlic at all — do they have to eat it , or — ”
88555	88564	88566	88566	Snape	264	“ And what are you two doing here ? ”
88580	88587	88566	88566	Snape	264	“ An odd place to meet — ”
88617	88625	88627	88627	Harry	121	“ We ’re not — meeting here , ”
88629	88636	88627	88627	Harry	121	“ We just — met here . ”
88637	88640	88642	88642	Snape	264	“ Indeed ? ”
88644	88683	88642	88642	Snape	264	“ You have a habit of turning up in unexpected places , Potter , and you are very rarely there for no reason ... I suggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower , where you belong . ”
88886	88891	88892	88892	he	121	“ It ’s me , ”
88895	88900	88901	88901	Ron	151	“ What kept you ? ”
88904	88910	88901	88901	Ron	151	“ Snape was hanging around ... ”
88919	88924	88925	88925	Ron	151	“ Where are you ? ”
88936	88946	88933	88933	his	151	“ Are you still there ? This feels weird ... ”
89005	89009	88992	88992	them	1983	“ Local Deliveries Only ”
89195	89203	89205	89205	Ron	151	“ Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it , ”
89218	89258	89205	89205	Ron	151	“ I asked Nearly Headless Nick ... he says he ’s heard a very rough crowd lives here . No one can get in . Fred and George tried , obviously , but all the entrances are sealed shut ... ”
89316	89353	89312	89312	Malfoy	310	“ ... should have an owl from Father any time now . He had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm ... about how I could n’t use it for three months ... ”
89359	89399	89356	89356	Goyle	205	“ I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself ... ‘ There ’s no ’ arm in ’ i m , ’ onest — ’ ... that hippogriff ’s as good as dead — ”
89416	89424	89407	89407	His	151	“ What are you doing , Weasley ? ”
89435	89471	89425	89425	Malfoy	310	“ Suppose you ’d love to live here , would n’t you , Weasley ? Dreaming about having your own bedroom ? I heard your family all sleep in one room — is that true ? ”
89488	89494	89495	89495	he	121	“ Leave him to me , ”
89537	89546	89547	89547	Malfoy	310	“ We were just discussing your friend Hagrid , ”
89552	89584	89547	89547	Malfoy	310	“ Just trying to imagine what he ’s saying to the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures . D’you think he ’ll cry when they cut off his hippogriff ’s — ”
89609	89614	89635	89635	Crabbe	204	“ What the — ? ”
89657	89666	89649	89649	Malfoy	310	“ What was that ? Who did that ? ”
89667	89677	89679	89679	Ron	151	“ Very haunted up here , is n’t it ? ”
89766	89773	89778	89778	his	310	“ It came from over there ! ”
89914	89917	89918	89918	he	310	“ AAARGH ! ”
89962	89965	89966	89966	Ron	151	“ Harry ! ”
89982	90006	89966	89966	Ron	151	“ you ’d better run for it ! If Malfoy tells anyone — you ’d better get back to the castle , quick — ”
90007	90012	90014	90014	Harry	121	“ See you later , ”
90279	90282	90283	90283	he	264	“ So , ”
90322	90329	90331	90331	Snape	264	“ Come with me , Potter , ”
90423	90426	90428	90428	Snape	264	“ Sit , ”
90440	90456	90458	90458	Snape	264	“ Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story , Potter , ”
90466	90487	90460	90460	Harry	121	“ He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack when he ran into Weasley — apparently alone . ”
90495	90531	90548	90548	Snape	264	“ Mr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to Weasley , when a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head . How do you think that could have happened ? ”
90539	90547	90532	90532	Harry	121	“ I do n’t know , Professor . ”
90575	90595	90532	90532	Harry	121	“ Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition . Can you imagine what it might have been , Potter ? ”
90596	90599	90601	90601	Harry	121	“ No , ”
90610	90622	90532	90532	Harry	121	“ It was your head , Potter . Floating in midair . ”
90629	90639	90641	90641	Harry	121	“ Maybe he ’d better go to Madam Pomfrey , ”
90643	90651	90641	90641	Harry	121	“ If he ’s seeing things like — ”
90652	90665	90667	90667	Snape	264	“ What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade , Potter ? ”
90670	90691	90667	90667	Snape	264	“ Your head is not allowed in Hogsmeade . No part of your body has permission to be in Hogsmeade . ”
90692	90697	90699	90699	Harry	121	“ I know that , ”
90712	90721	90699	90699	Harry	121	“ It sounds like Malfoy ’s having hallucin — ”
90722	90729	90731	90731	Snape	264	“ Malfoy is not having hallucinations , ”
90757	90772	90734	90734	he	264	“ If your head was in Hogsmeade , so was the rest of you . ”
90773	90782	90784	90784	Harry	121	“ I ’ve been up in Gryffindor Tower , ”
90786	90791	90784	90784	Harry	121	“ Like you told — ”
90792	90798	90734	90734	he	264	“ Can anyone confirm that ? ”
90815	90818	90819	90819	he	264	“ So , ”
90826	90882	90819	90819	he	264	“ Everyone from the Minister of Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black . But famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself . Let the ordinary people worry about his safety ! Famous Harry Potter goes where he wants to , with no thought for the consequences . ”
90913	90924	90925	90925	Snape	264	“ How extraordinarily like your father you are , Potter , ”
90933	90980	90925	90925	Snape	264	“ He too was exceedingly arrogant . A small amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too . Strutting around the place with his friends and admirers ... The resemblance between you is uncanny . ”
90981	90988	90990	90990	Harry	121	“ My dad did n’t strut , ”
90998	91003	90990	90990	Harry	121	“ And neither do I. ”
91004	91016	91017	91017	Snape	264	“ Your father did n’t set much store by rules either , ”
91032	91051	91017	91017	Snape	264	“ Rules were for lesser mortals , not Quidditch Cup - winners . His head was so swollen — ”
91052	91056	91025	91025	his	264	“ SHUT UP ! ”
91101	91111	91088	91088	Snape	264	“ What did you say to me , Potter ? ”
91112	91123	91124	91124	Harry	121	“ I told you to shut up about my dad ! ”
91127	91159	91124	91124	Harry	121	“ I know the truth , all right ? He saved your life ! Dumbledore told me ! You would n’t even be here if it was n’t for my dad ! ”
91172	91189	91190	91190	he	264	“ And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life ? ”
91193	91209	91190	91190	he	264	“ Or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious Potter ’s delicate ears ? ”
91239	91258	91259	91259	he	264	“ I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father , Potter , ”
91269	91352	91259	91259	he	264	“ Have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism ? Then let me correct you — your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father had n’t got cold feet at the last moment . There was nothing brave about what he did . He was saving his own skin as much as mine . Had their joke succeeded , he would have been expelled from Hogwarts . ”
91362	91370	91371	91371	he	264	“ Turn out your pockets , Potter ! ”
91388	91408	91353	91353	Snape	264	“ Turn out your pockets , or we go straight to the headmaster ! Pull them out , Potter ! ”
91437	91444	91446	91446	Harry	121	“ Ron gave them to me , ”
91463	91474	91459	91459	Snape	264	“ He — brought them back from Hogsmeade last time — ”
91475	91497	91498	91498	Snape	264	“ Indeed ? And you ’ve been carrying them around ever since ? How very touching ... and what is this ? ”
91517	91523	91524	91524	he	121	“ Spare bit of parchment , ”
91540	91554	91555	91555	he	264	“ Surely you do n’t need such a very old piece of parchment ? ”
91558	91569	91555	91555	he	264	“ Why do n’t I just — throw this away ? ”
91577	91580	91581	91581	Harry	121	“ No ! ”
91585	91588	91590	91590	Snape	264	“ So ! ”
91597	91636	91592	91592	his	264	“ Is this another treasured gift from Mr. Weasley ? Or is it — something else ? A letter , perhaps , written in invisible ink ? Or — instructions to get into Hogsmeade without passing the dementors ? ”
91645	91655	91656	91656	he	264	“ Let me see , let me see ... , ”
91672	91677	91678	91678	he	264	“ Reveal your secret ! ”
91701	91705	91706	91706	Snape	264	“ Show yourself ! ”
91726	91745	91746	91746	Snape	264	“ Professor Severus Snape , master of this school , commands you to yield the information you conceal ! ”
91776	91802	91753	91753	his	264	“ Mr. Moony presents his compliments to Professor Snape , and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other people ’s business . ”
91831	91852	91803	91803	Snape	264	“ Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony , and would like to add that Professor Snape is an ugly git . ”
91873	91892	91960	91960	He	264	“ Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor . ”
91914	91934	91960	91960	He	264	“ Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day , and advises him to wash his hair , the slimeball . ”
91943	91947	91949	91949	Snape	264	“ So ... , ”
91952	91959	91949	91949	Snape	264	“ We ’ll see about this ... ”
91987	91990	91991	91991	Snape	264	“ Lupin ! ”
91997	92003	91991	91991	Snape	264	“ I want a word ! ”
92044	92050	92052	92052	Lupin	199	“ You called , Severus ? ”
92055	92060	92062	92062	Snape	264	“ I certainly did , ”
92077	92093	92062	92062	Snape	264	“ I have just asked Potter to empty his pockets . He was carrying this . ”
92129	92132	92134	92134	Snape	264	“ Well ? ”
92157	92160	92162	92162	Snape	264	“ Well ? ”
92165	92197	92162	92162	Snape	264	“ This parchment is plainly full of Dark Magic . This is supposed to be your area of expertise , Lupin . Where do you imagine Potter got such a thing ? ”
92220	92226	92227	92227	he	264	“ Full of Dark Magic ? ”
92231	92277	92227	92227	he	264	“ Do you really think so , Severus ? It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it . Childish , but surely not dangerous ? I imagine Harry got it from a joke shop — ”
92278	92281	92283	92283	Snape	264	“ Indeed ? ”
92293	92323	92285	92285	His	264	“ You think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing ? You do n’t think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers ? ”
92341	92354	92355	92355	he	264	“ You mean , by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people ? ”
92358	92369	92355	92355	he	264	“ Harry , do you know any of these men ? ”
92370	92373	92375	92375	Harry	121	“ No , ”
92378	92384	92386	92386	Lupin	199	“ You see , Severus ? ”
92393	92403	92386	92386	Lupin	199	“ It looks like a Zonko product to me — ”
92442	92453	92454	92454	he	151	“ I — gave — Harry — that — stuff , ”
92457	92470	92454	92454	he	151	“ Bought — it ... in Zonko ’s ... ages — ago ... ”
92471	92474	92476	92476	Lupin	199	“ Well ! ”
92487	92506	92507	92507	He	199	“ That seems to clear that up ! Severus , I ’ll take this back , shall I ? ”
92518	92541	92507	92507	He	199	“ Harry , Ron , come with me , I need a word about my vampire essay — excuse us , Severus — ”
92579	92584	92608	92608	his	199	“ Professor , I — ”
92585	92594	92596	92596	Lupin	199	“ I do n’t want to hear explanations , ”
92611	92637	92638	92638	he	199	“ I happen to know that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago . Yes , I know it ’s a map , ”
92647	92704	92638	92638	he	199	“ I do n’t want to know how it fell into your possession . I am , however , astounded that you did n’t hand it in . Particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around . And I ca n’t let you have it back , Harry . ”
92719	92732	92785	92785	He	199	“ Why did Snape think I ’d got it from the manufacturers ? ”
92733	92737	92738	92738	Lupin	199	“ Because ... , ”
92741	92762	92738	92738	Lupin	199	“ because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school . They ’d think it extremely entertaining . ”
92763	92769	92771	92771	Harry	121	“ Do you know them ? ”
92775	92780	92781	92781	he	199	“ We ’ve met , ”
92796	92875	92876	92876	He	199	“ Do n’t expect me to cover up for you again , Harry . I can not make you take Sirius Black seriously . But I would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you . Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive , Harry . A poor way to repay them — gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks . ”
92938	92944	92946	92946	Ron	151	“ It ’s my fault , ”
92949	92971	92946	92946	Ron	151	“ I persuaded you to go . Lupin ’s right , it was stupid , we should n’t ’ve done it — ”
93019	93027	93029	93029	Ron	151	“ Come to have a good gloat ? ”
93039	93050	93029	93029	Ron	151	“ Or have you just been to tell on us ? ”
93051	93054	93056	93056	Hermione	133	“ No , ”
93072	93093	93058	93058	She	133	“ I just thought you ought to know ... Hagrid lost his case . Buckbeak is going to be executed . ”
93094	93102	93103	93103	Hermione	133	“ He — he sent me this , ”
93139	93142	93178	93178	Hagrid	309	“ Dear Hermione ,
93180	93180	93178	93178	Hagrid	309	”
93181	93188	93190	93190	Harry	121	“ They ca n’t do this , ”
93192	93202	93190	93190	Harry	121	“ They ca n’t . Buckbeak is n’t dangerous . ”
93203	93214	93216	93216	Hermione	133	“ Malfoy ’s dad ’s frightened the Committee into it , ”
93222	93269	93216	93216	Hermione	133	“ You know what he ’s like . They ’re a bunch of doddery old fools , and they were scared . There ’ll be an appeal , though , there always is . Only I ca n’t see any hope ... .Nothing will have changed . ”
93270	93276	93278	93278	Ron	151	“ Yeah , it will , ”
93281	93301	93278	93278	Ron	151	“ You wo n’t have to do all the work alone this time , Hermione . I ’ll help . ”
93302	93307	93216	93216	Hermione	133	“ Oh , Ron ! ”
93344	93358	93359	93359	she	133	“ Ron , I ’m really , really sorry about Scabbers ... . , ”
93362	93371	93373	93373	Ron	151	“ Oh — well — he was old , ”
93386	93408	93373	93373	Ron	151	“ And he was a bit useless . You never know , Mum and Dad might get me an owl now . ”
93466	93534	93457	93457	He	151	“ S’all my fault . Got all tongue - tied . They was all sittin ’ there in black robes an ’ I kep ’ droppin ’ me notes and forgettin ’ all them dates yeh looked up fer me , Hermione . An ’ then Lucius Malfoy stood up an ’ said his bit , and the Committee jus ’ did exac’ly what he told ’em ... ”
93535	93542	93544	93544	Ron	151	“ There ’s still the appeal ! ”
93547	93560	93544	93544	Ron	151	“ Do n’t give up yet , we ’re working on it ! ”
93598	93604	93606	93606	Hagrid	309	“ S’no good , Ron , ”
93615	93653	93606	93606	Hagrid	309	“ That Committee ’s in Lucius Malfoy ’s pocket . I ’m jus ’ gon na make sure the rest o ’ Beaky ’s time is the happiest he ’s ever had . I owe him that ... ”
93671	93677	93664	93664	his	309	“ Look at him blubber ! ”
93695	93705	93707	93707	Malfoy	310	“ Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic ? ”
93709	93719	93707	93707	Malfoy	310	“ And he ’s supposed to be our teacher ! ”
93773	93788	93769	93769	her	133	“ Do n’t you dare call Hagrid pathetic , you foul — you evil — ”
93789	93792	93794	93794	Ron	151	“ Hermione ! ”
93810	93816	93798	93798	he	151	“ Get off , Ron ! ”
93839	93843	93844	93844	Malfoy	310	“ C’m on , ”
93865	93868	93869	93869	Ron	151	“ Hermione ! ”
93879	93892	93893	93893	Hermione	133	“ Harry , you ’d better beat him in the Quidditch final ! ”
93897	93913	93893	93893	Hermione	133	“ You just better had , because I ca n’t stand it if Slytherin wins ! ”
93914	93921	93923	93923	Ron	151	“ We ’re due in Charms , ”
93930	93936	93923	93923	Ron	151	“ We ’d better go . ”
93949	93956	93958	93959	Professor Flitwick	211	“ You ’re late , boys ! ”
93968	93992	93962	93962	Harry	121	“ Come along , quickly , wands out , we ’re experimenting with Cheering Charms today , we ’ve already divided into pairs — ”
94013	94019	94008	94008	Ron	151	“ Where ’s Hermione gone ? ”
94049	94054	94056	94056	Harry	121	“ That ’s weird , ”
94062	94074	94056	94056	Harry	121	“ Maybe — maybe she went to the bathroom or something ? ”
94084	94097	94099	94099	Ron	151	“ She could ’ve done with a Cheering Charm on her too , ”
94164	94175	94176	94176	Ron	151	“ You do n’t think Malfoy did something to her ? ”
94200	94202	94194	94196	the Fat Lady	268	“ Flibbertigibbet ”
94251	94256	94258	94258	Hermione	133	“ W - what ? ”
94269	94285	94258	94258	Hermione	133	“ Is it time to go ? W - which lesson have we got now ? ”
94286	94298	94300	94300	Harry	121	“ Divination , but it ’s not for another twenty minutes , ”
94302	94313	94300	94300	Harry	121	“ Hermione , why did n’t you come to Charms ? ”
94314	94320	94321	94321	Hermione	133	“ What ? Oh no ! ”
94324	94332	94321	94321	Hermione	133	“ I forgot to go to Charms ! ”
94333	94340	94342	94342	Harry	121	“ But how could you forget ? ”
94344	94357	94342	94342	Harry	121	“ You were with us till we were right outside the classroom ! ”
94358	94365	94366	94366	Hermione	133	“ I do n’t believe it ! ”
94369	94393	94366	94366	Hermione	133	“ Was Professor Flitwick angry ? Oh , it was Malfoy , I was thinking about him and I lost track of things ! ”
94394	94401	94403	94403	Ron	151	“ You know what , Hermione ? ”
94420	94436	94403	94403	Ron	151	“ I reckon you ’re cracking up . You ’re trying to do too much . ”
94437	94444	94446	94446	Hermione	133	“ No , I ’m not ! ”
94463	94493	94446	94446	Hermione	133	“ I just made a mistake , that ’s all ! I ’d better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry ... I ’ll see you in Divination ! ”
94516	94542	94494	94494	Hermione	133	“ I ca n’t believe I missed Cheering Charms ! And I bet they come up in our exams ; Professor Flitwick hinted they might ! ”
94586	94599	94600	94600	Ron	151	“ I thought we were n’t starting crystal balls until next term , ”
94619	94631	94632	94632	Harry	121	“ Do n’t complain , this means we ’ve finished palmistry , ”
94636	94652	94632	94632	Harry	121	“ I was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my hands . ”
94653	94659	94668	94669	Professor Trelawney	222	“ Good day to you ! ”
94699	94716	94718	94719	Professor Trelawney	222	“ I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned , ”
94732	94758	94718	94719	Professor Trelawney	222	“ The fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb , and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice . ”
94762	94788	94789	94789	she	133	“ Well , honestly ... ‘ the fates have informed her ’ ... who sets the exam ? She does ! What an amazing prediction ! ”
94838	94847	94848	94848	she	222	“ Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art , ”
94852	94885	94848	94848	she	222	“ I do not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb ’s infinite depths . We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes ”
94906	94937	94896	94896	his	151	“ so as to clear the Inner Eye and the superconscious . Perhaps , if we are lucky , some of you will See before the end of the class . ”
94969	94973	94991	94991	Hermione	133	“ This is stupid ”
94995	95000	95001	95001	Harry	121	“ Seen anything yet ? ”
95015	95026	95028	95028	Ron	151	“ Yeah , there ’s a burn on this table , ”
95032	95039	95028	95028	Ron	151	“ Someone ’s spilled their candle . ”
95040	95049	95050	95050	Hermione	133	“ This is such a waste of time , ”
95053	95070	95050	95050	Hermione	133	“ I could be practicing something useful . I could be catching up on Cheering Charms — ”
95076	95092	95093	95093	she	133	“ Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their Orb ? ”
95102	95109	95110	95110	Ron	151	“ I do n’t need help , ”
95113	95131	95110	95110	Ron	151	“ It ’s obvious what this means . There ’s going to be loads of fog tonight . ”
95140	95145	95147	95148	Professor Trelawney	222	“ Now , really ! ”
95165	95173	95174	95174	She	133	“ You are disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations ! ”
95200	95206	95207	95208	Professor Trelawney	222	“ There is something here ! ”
95229	95238	95212	95212	her	222	“ Something moving ... but what is it ? ”
95267	95272	95273	95274	Professor Trelawney	222	“ My dear ... , ”
95282	95306	95273	95274	Professor Trelawney	222	“ It is here , plainer than ever before ... my dear , stalking toward you , growing ever closer ... the Gr — ”
95307	95315	95317	95317	Hermione	133	“ Oh , for goodness ’ sake ! ”
95320	95327	95317	95317	Hermione	133	“ Not that ridiculous Grim again ! ”
95364	95418	95353	95354	Professor Trelawney	222	“ I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class , my dear , it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of Divination requires . Indeed , I do n’t remember ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane . ”

98658	98740	98645	98647	the Slytherin Beaters	357	“ Too bad , boys ! You ’ll need to get up earlier than that to beat a Firebolt ! And it ’s Gryffindor in possession again , as Johnson takes the Quaffle — Flint alongside her — poke him in the eye , Angelina ! — it was a joke , Professor , it was a joke — oh no — Flint in possession , Flint flying toward the Gryffindor goalposts , come on now , Wood , save — ! ”

100383	100386	100387	100387	Ron	151	“ Hermione ? ”
100402	100416	100392	100392	she	133	“ Er — are you sure you ’ve copied down these times right ? ”
100417	100420	100422	100422	Hermione	133	“ What ? ”
100433	100441	100422	100422	Hermione	133	“ Yes , of course I have . ”
100442	100460	100462	100462	Harry	121	“ Is there any point asking how you ’re going to sit for two exams at once ? ”
100464	100467	100469	100469	Hermione	133	“ No , ”
100472	100485	100469	100469	Hermione	133	“ Have either of you seen my copy of Numerology and Grammatica ? ”
100486	100501	100503	100503	Ron	151	“ Oh , yeah , I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading , ”
100549	100555	100557	100557	Harry	121	“ It ’s from Hagrid , ”
100564	100576	100557	100557	Harry	121	“ Buckbeak ’s appeal — it ’s set for the sixth . ”
100577	100587	100589	100589	Hermione	133	“ That ’s the day we finish our exams , ”
100599	100610	100612	100612	Harry	121	“ And they ’re coming up here to do it , ”
100620	100633	100612	100612	Harry	121	“ Someone from the Ministry of Magic and — and an executioner . ”
100640	100660	100634	100634	Hermione	133	“ They ’re bringing the executioner to the appeal ! But that sounds as though they ’ve already decided ! ”
100661	100667	100669	100669	Harry	121	“ Yeah , it does , ”
100672	100677	100678	100678	Ron	151	“ They ca n’t ! ”
100681	100701	100678	100678	Ron	151	“ I ’ve spent ages reading up on stuff for him ; they ca n’t just ignore it all ! ”
100935	100949	100996	100996	Hermione	133	“ Mine still had a spout for a tail , what a nightmare ... ”
100950	100959	100996	100996	Hermione	133	“ Were the tortoises supposed to breathe steam ? ”
100960	100978	100996	100996	Hermione	133	“ It still had a willow - patterned shell , d’you think that ’ll count against me ? ”
101194	101203	101204	101204	Hagrid	309	“ Beaky ’s gettin ’ a bit depressed , ”
101223	101246	101204	101204	Hagrid	309	“ Bin cooped up too long . But still ... we ’ll know day after tomorrow — one way or the other — ”
101496	101501	101502	101502	Lupin	199	“ Excellent , Harry , ”
101514	101518	101505	101505	Harry	121	“ Full marks . ”
101585	101588	101590	101590	Lupin	199	“ Hermione ! ”
101594	101600	101590	101590	Lupin	199	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
101601	101609	101610	101610	Hermione	133	“ P - P - Professor McGonagall ! ”
101618	101628	101610	101610	Hermione	133	“ Sh - she said I ’d failed everything ! ”
101719	101725	101726	101726	he	175	“ Hello there , Harry ! ”
101729	101741	101726	101726	he	175	“ Just had an exam , I expect ? Nearly finished ? ”
101742	101745	101747	101747	Harry	121	“ Yes , ”
101770	101774	101776	101776	Fudge	175	“ Lovely day , ”
101785	101790	101776	101776	Fudge	175	“ Pity ... pity ... ”
101800	101850	101791	101791	He	175	“ I ’m here on an unpleasant mission , Harry . The Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff . As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black situation , I was asked to step in . ”
101851	101861	101862	101862	Ron	151	“ Does that mean the appeal ’s already happened ? ”
101868	101880	101882	101882	Fudge	175	“ No , no , it ’s scheduled for this afternoon , ”
101889	101902	101904	101904	Ron	151	“ Then you might not have to witness an execution at all ! ”
101907	101914	101904	101904	Ron	151	“ The hippogriff might get off ! ”
101990	102012	101974	101977	the very old wizard	2205	“ Dear , dear , I ’m getting too old for this ... Two o’clock , is n’t it , Fudge ? ”
102069	102076	102078	102078	Ron	151	“ Why ’d you stop me ? ”
102089	102108	102078	102078	Ron	151	“ Did you see them ? They ’ve even got the axe ready ! This is n’t justice ! ”
102109	102131	102136	102136	she	133	“ Ron , your dad works for the Ministry , you ca n’t go saying things like that to his boss ! ”
102142	102166	102136	102136	she	133	“ As long as Hagrid keeps his head this time , and argues his case properly , they ca n’t possibly execute Buckbeak ... ”
102299	102307	102308	102308	Neville	170	“ She ’s seeing us all separately , ”
102341	102354	102355	102355	he	170	“ Have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball ? ”
102360	102363	102365	102365	Ron	151	“ Nope , ”
102420	102430	102413	102417	the rest of the class	1082	“ What did she ask ? Was it okay ? ”
102438	102460	102464	102464	he	170	“ She says the crystal ball ’s told her that if I tell you , I ’ll have a horrible accident ! ”
102482	102487	102489	102489	Ron	151	“ That ’s convenient , ”
102491	102505	102507	102507	he	151	“ You know , I ’m starting to think Hermione was right about her ”
102516	102524	102507	102507	he	151	“ she ’s a right old fraud . ”
102525	102528	102530	102530	Harry	121	“ Yeah , ”
102544	102551	102530	102530	Harry	121	“ Wish she ’d hurry up ... ”
102562	102576	102577	102577	she	223	“ She says I ’ve got all the makings of a true Seer , ”
102583	102595	102577	102577	she	223	“ I saw loads of stuff ... Well , good luck ! ”
102606	102610	102622	102622	Ron	151	“ Ronald Weasley , ”
102693	102699	102700	102700	Harry	121	“ How ’d it go ? ”
102707	102710	102712	102712	Ron	151	“ Rubbish , ”
102714	102737	102712	102712	Ron	151	“ Could n’t see a thing , so I made some stuff up . Do n’t think she was convinced , though ... ”
102738	102746	102747	102747	Harry	121	“ Meet you in the common room , ”
102756	102760	102750	102751	Professor Trelawney	222	“ Harry Potter ! ”
102812	102819	102820	102820	she	222	“ Good day , my dear , ”
102824	102849	102820	102820	she	222	“ If you would kindly gaze into the Orb ... Take your time , now ... then tell me what you see within it ... ”
102882	102885	102886	102887	Professor Trelawney	222	“ Well ? ”
102891	102897	102886	102887	Professor Trelawney	222	“ What do you see ? ”
102932	102935	102937	102937	Harry	121	“ Er — ”
102939	102946	102937	102937	Harry	121	“ a dark shape ... um ... ”
102947	102953	102955	102956	Professor Trelawney	222	“ What does it resemble ? ”
102958	102963	102955	102956	Professor Trelawney	222	“ Think , now ... ”
102975	102979	102980	102980	he	121	“ A hippogriff , ”
102984	102987	102989	102990	Professor Trelawney	222	“ Indeed ! ”
103002	103037	102989	102990	Professor Trelawney	222	“ My boy , you may well be seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid ’s trouble with the Ministry of Magic ! Look closer ... Does the hippogriff appear to ... have its head ? ”
103038	103041	103043	103043	Harry	121	“ Yes , ”
103046	103051	103052	103053	Professor Trelawney	222	“ Are you sure ? ”
103057	103087	103052	103053	Professor Trelawney	222	“ Are you quite sure , dear ? You do n’t see it writhing on the ground , perhaps , and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it ? ”
103088	103091	103093	103093	Harry	121	“ No ! ”
103101	103109	103052	103053	Professor Trelawney	222	“ No blood ? No weeping Hagrid ? ”
103110	103113	103115	103115	Harry	121	“ No ! ”
103130	103141	103115	103115	Harry	121	“ It looks fine , it ’s — flying away ... ”
103146	103172	103052	103053	Professor Trelawney	222	“ Well , dear , I think we ’ll leave it there ... A little disappointing ... but I ’m sure you did your best . ”
103199	103205	103052	103053	Professor Trelawney	222	“ IT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT . ”
103228	103233	103235	103235	Harry	121	“ S - sorry ? ”
103303	103382	103287	103288	Professor Trelawney	222	“ THE DARK LORD LIES ALONE AND FRIENDLESS , ABANDONED BY HIS FOLLOWERS . HIS SERVANT HAS BEEN CHAINED THESE TWELVE YEARS . TONIGHT , BEFORE MIDNIGHT ... THE SERVANT WILL BREAK FREE AND SET OUT TO REJOIN HIS MASTER . THE DARK LORD WILL RISE AGAIN WITH HIS SERVANT ’S AID , GREATER AND MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER BEFORE . TONIGHT ... BEFORE MIDNIGHT ... THE SERVANT ... WILL SET OUT ... TO REJOIN ... HIS MASTER ... ”
103414	103423	103424	103424	she	222	“ I ’m so sorry , dear boy , ”

109917	109924	109925	109925	Hermione	133	“ I did n’t tell anyone ! ”
109928	109937	109925	109925	Hermione	133	“ I ’ve been covering up for you — ”
109938	109947	109948	109948	Lupin	199	“ Hermione , listen to me , please ! ”
109951	109956	109948	109948	Lupin	199	“ I can explain — ”
109975	109980	109981	109981	he	121	“ I trusted you , ”
109993	110004	109981	109981	he	121	“ and all the time you ’ve been his friend ! ”
110005	110010	110012	110012	Lupin	199	“ You ’re wrong , ”
110014	110032	110012	110012	Lupin	199	“ I have n’t been Sirius ’s friend , but I am now — Let me explain ... ”
110033	110036	110037	110037	Hermione	133	“ NO ! ”
110040	110069	110037	110037	Hermione	133	“ Harry , do n’t trust him , he ’s been helping Black get into the castle , he wants you dead too — he ’s a werewolf ! ”
110093	110105	110106	110106	he	199	“ Not at all up to your usual standard , Hermione , ”
110109	110139	110106	110106	he	199	“ Only one out of three , I ’m afraid . I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle and I certainly do n’t want Harry dead ... ”
110148	110160	110211	110211	he	199	“ But I wo n’t deny that I am a werewolf . ”
110191	110199	110188	110188	Ron	151	“ Get away from me , werewolf ! ”
110218	110225	110211	110211	he	199	“ How long have you known ? ”
110226	110229	110230	110230	Hermione	133	“ Ages , ”
110233	110242	110230	110230	Hermione	133	“ Since I did Professor Snape ’s essay ... ”
110243	110249	110251	110251	Lupin	199	“ He ’ll be delighted , ”
110254	110302	110251	110251	Lupin	199	“ He assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant ... Did you check the lunar chart and realize that I was always ill at the full moon ? Or did you realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me ? ”
110303	110306	110307	110307	Hermione	133	“ Both , ”
110316	110332	110251	110251	Lupin	199	“ You ’re the cleverest witch of your age I ’ve ever met , Hermione . ”
110333	110338	110339	110339	Hermione	133	“ I ’m not , ”
110342	110360	110339	110339	Hermione	133	“ If I ’d been a bit cleverer , I ’d have told everyone what you are ! ”
110361	110367	110369	110369	Lupin	199	“ But they already know , ”
110371	110379	110369	110369	Lupin	199	“ At least , the staff do . ”
110380	110392	110393	110393	Ron	151	“ Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf ? ”
110396	110401	110393	110393	Ron	151	“ Is he mad ? ”
110402	110410	110412	110412	Lupin	199	“ Some of the staff thought so , ”
110414	110430	110412	110412	Lupin	199	“ He had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that I ’m trustworthy — ”
110431	110437	110438	110438	Harry	121	“ AND HE WAS WRONG ! ”
110441	110450	110451	110451	He	121	“ YOU’VE BEEN HELPING HIM ALL THE TIME ! ”
110504	110512	110514	110514	Lupin	199	“ I have not been helping Sirius , ”
110516	110531	110514	110514	Lupin	199	“ If you ’ll give me a chance , I ’ll explain . Look — ”
110558	110561	110563	110563	Lupin	199	“ There , ”
110574	110588	110563	110563	Lupin	199	“ You ’re armed , we ’re not . Now will you listen ? ”
110602	110611	110612	110612	he	121	“ If you have n’t been helping him , ”
110622	110631	110612	110612	he	121	“ how did you know he was here ? ”
110632	110636	110638	110638	Lupin	199	“ The map , ”
110640	110654	110638	110638	Lupin	199	“ The Marauder ’s Map . I was in my office examining it — ”
110655	110663	110664	110664	Harry	121	“ You know how to work it ? ”
110668	110678	110680	110680	Lupin	199	“ Of course I know how to work it , ”
110687	110708	110683	110683	his	199	“ I helped write it . I ’m Moony — that was my friends ’ nickname for me at school . ”
110709	110714	110638	110638	Lupin	199	“ You wrote — ? ”
110715	110767	110683	110683	his	199	“ The important thing is , I was watching it carefully this evening , because I had an idea that you , Ron , and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed . And I was right , was n’t I ? ”
110790	110804	110638	110638	Lupin	199	“ You might have been wearing your father ’s old Cloak , Harry — ”
110805	110813	110638	110638	Lupin	199	“ How d’you know about the Cloak ? ”
110814	110827	110829	110829	Lupin	199	“ The number of times I saw James disappearing under it ... , ”
110837	110898	110829	110829	Lupin	199	“ The point is , even if you ’re wearing an Invisibility Cloak , you still show up on the Marauder ’s Map . I watched you cross the grounds and enter Hagrid ’s hut . Twenty minutes later , you left Hagrid , and set off back toward the castle . But you were now accompanied by somebody else . ”
110899	110902	110904	110904	Harry	121	“ What ? ”
110906	110913	110904	110904	Harry	121	“ No , we were n’t ! ”
110914	110922	110924	110924	Lupin	199	“ I could n’t believe my eyes , ”
110935	110951	110924	110924	Lupin	199	“ I thought the map must be malfunctioning . How could he be with you ? ”
110952	110959	110961	110961	Harry	121	“ No one was with us ! ”
110963	111000	111026	111026	He	199	“ And then I saw another dot , moving fast toward you , labeled Sirius Black ... I saw him collide with you ; I watched as he pulled two of you into the Whomping Willow — ”
111001	111006	111007	111007	Ron	151	“ One of us ! ”
111011	111016	111018	111018	Lupin	199	“ No , Ron , ”
111020	111025	111018	111018	Lupin	199	“ Two of you . ”
111038	111051	111052	111052	he	199	“ Do you think I could have a look at the rat ? ”
111056	111059	111061	111061	Ron	151	“ What ? ”
111063	111073	111061	111061	Ron	151	“ What ’s Scabbers got to do with it ? ”
111074	111077	111079	111079	Lupin	199	“ Everything , ”
111081	111089	111079	111079	Lupin	199	“ Could I see him , please ? ”
111154	111157	111158	111158	Ron	151	“ What ? ”
111171	111182	111158	111158	Ron	151	“ What ’s my rat got to do with anything ? ”
111183	111190	111192	111193	Sirius Black	155	“ That ’s not a rat , ”
111196	111208	111192	111193	Sirius Black	155	“ What d’you mean — of course Scabbers is a rat — ”
111209	111216	111218	111218	Lupin	199	“ No , he ’s not , ”
111221	111227	111218	111218	Lupin	199	“ He ’s a wizard . ”
111228	111235	111237	111237	Black	155	“ Scabber 's is an Animagus , ”
111239	111247	111237	111237	Black	155	“ by the name of Peter Pettigrew . ”
111271	111277	111264	111264	Ron	151	“ You ’re both mental . ”
111278	111281	111283	111283	Hermione	133	“ Ridiculous ! ”
111286	111292	111294	111294	Harry	121	“ Peter Pettigrew ’s dead ! ”
111296	111304	111305	111305	He	121	“ He killed him twelve years ago ! ”
111315	111320	111321	111321	Black	155	“ I meant to , ”
111329	111345	111324	111324	his	155	“ but little Peter got the better of me ... not this time , though ! ”
111373	111378	111379	111379	Lupin	199	“ Sirius , NO ! ”
111393	111416	111383	111383	himself	199	“ WAIT ! You ca n’t do it just like that — they need to understand — we ’ve got to explain — ”
111417	111423	111425	111425	Black	155	“ We can explain afterwards ! ”
111466	111482	111483	111483	Lupin	199	“ They ’ve — got — a — right — to — know — everything ! ”
111492	111523	111483	111483	Lupin	199	“ Ron ’s kept him as a pet ! There are parts of it even I do n’t understand ! And Harry — you owe Harry the truth , Sirius ! ”
111553	111559	111560	111560	Black	155	“ All right , then , ”
111571	111596	111560	111560	Black	155	“ Tell them whatever you like . But make it quick , Remus . I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for ... ”
111597	111606	111608	111608	Ron	151	“ You ’re nutters , both of you , ”
111620	111632	111608	111608	Ron	151	“ I ’ve had enough of this . I ’m off . ”
111656	111667	111668	111668	he	199	“ You ’re going to hear me out , Ron , ”
111672	111684	111668	111668	he	199	“ Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen . ”
111685	111695	111696	111696	Ron	151	“ HE ’S NOT PETER , HE ’S SCABBERS ! ”
111745	111754	111755	111755	he	121	“ There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die , ”
111758	111766	111755	111755	he	121	“ A whole street full of them ... ”
111767	111778	111780	111780	Black	155	“ They did n’t see what they thought they saw ! ”
111792	111799	111801	111801	Lupin	199	“ Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter , ”
111805	111837	111801	111801	Lupin	199	“ I believed it myself — until I saw the map tonight . Because the Marauder ’s Map never lies ... Peter ’s alive . Ron ’s holding him , Harry . ”
111923	111947	111897	111897	Hermione	133	“ But Professor Lupin ... Scabbers ca n’t be Pettigrew ... it just ca n’t be true , you know it ca n’t ... ”
111948	111956	111957	111957	Lupin	199	“ Why ca n’t it be true ? ”
111981	112079	111897	111897	Hermione	133	“ Because ... because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus . We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall . And I looked them up when I did my homework — the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals ; there ’s a register showing what animal they become , and their markings and things ... and I went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register , and there have been only seven Animagi this century , and Pettigrew ’s name was n’t on the list — ”
112103	112109	112110	112110	he	199	“ Right again , Hermione ! ”
112113	112131	112110	112110	he	199	“ But the Ministry never knew that there used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts . ”
112132	112150	112152	112152	Black	155	“ If you ’re going to tell them the story , get a move on , Remus , ”
112164	112180	112152	112152	Black	155	“ I ’ve waited twelve years , I ’m not going to wait much longer . ”
112181	112195	112197	112197	Lupin	199	“ All right ... but you ’ll need to help me , Sirius , ”
112199	112207	112197	112197	Lupin	199	“ I only know how it began ... ”
112251	112256	112240	112240	Lupin	199	“ No one there ... ”
112257	112263	112265	112265	Ron	151	“ This place is haunted ! ”
112267	112272	112274	112274	Lupin	199	“ It ’s not , ”
112286	112308	112274	112274	Lupin	199	“ The Shrieking Shack was never haunted ... The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me . ”
112327	112364	112309	112309	He	199	“ That ’s where all of this starts — with my becoming a werewolf . None of this could have happened if I had n’t been bitten ... and if I had n’t been so foolhardy ... ”
112380	112383	112384	112384	She	133	“ Shh ! ”
112391	112565	112566	112566	Lupin	199	“ I was a very small boy when I received the bite . My parents tried everything , but in those days there was no cure . The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery . It makes me safe , you see . As long as I take it in the week preceding the full moon , I keep my mind when I transform ... I am able to curl up in my office , a harmless wolf , and wait for the moon to wane again . Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered , however , I became a fully fledged monster once a month . It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts . Other parents were n’t likely to want their children exposed to me . But then Dumbledore became headmaster , and he was sympathetic . He said that as long as we took certain precautions , there was no reason I should n’t come to school ... ”
112575	112611	112566	112566	Lupin	199	“ I told you , months ago , that the Whomping Willow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts . The truth is that it was planted because I came to Hogwarts . This house ”
112620	112673	112613	112613	Lupin	199	“ the tunnel that leads to it — they were built for my use . Once a month , I was smuggled out of the castle , into this place , to transform . The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while I was dangerous . ”
112710	112951	112707	112707	Lupin	199	“ My transformations in those days were — were terrible . It is very painful to turn into a werewolf . I was separated from humans to bite , so I bit and scratched myself instead . The villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits . Dumbledore encouraged the rumor ... Even now , when the house has been silent for years , the villagers do n’t dare approach it ... But apart from my transformations , I was happier than I had ever been in my life . For the first time ever , I had friends , three great friends . Sirius Black , Peter Pettigrew ... and , of course , your father , James Potter . Now , my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared once a month . I made up all sorts of stories . I told them my mother was ill , and that I had to go home to see her ... I was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what I was . But of course , they , like you , Hermione , worked out the truth ... And they did n’t desert me at all . Instead , they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable , but the best times of my life . They became Animagi . ”
112952	112957	112959	112959	Harry	121	“ My dad too ? ”
112963	112968	112970	112970	Lupin	199	“ Yes , indeed , ”
112972	113067	112970	112970	Lupin	199	“ It took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it . Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school , and lucky they were , because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong — one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it . Peter needed all the help he could get from James and Sirius . Finally , in our fifth year , they managed it . They could each turn into a different animal at will . ”
113068	113076	113078	113078	Hermione	133	“ But how did that help you ? ”
113083	113101	113103	113103	Lupin	199	“ They could n’t keep me company as humans , so they kept me company as animals , ”
113105	113194	113103	113103	Lupin	199	“ A werewolf is only a danger to people . They sneaked out of the castle every month under James ’s Invisibility Cloak . They transformed ... Peter , as the smallest , could slip beneath the Willow ’s attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it . They would then slip down the tunnel and join me . Under their influence , I became less dangerous . My body was still wolfish , but my mind seemed to become less so while I was with them . ”
113195	113201	113203	113203	Black	155	“ Hurry up , Remus , ”
113220	113338	113217	113217	his	155	“ I ’m getting there , Sirius , I ’m getting there ... well , highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform . Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night . Sirius and James transformed into such large animals , they were able to keep a werewolf in check . I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did ... And that ’s how we came to write the Marauder ’s Map , and sign it with our nicknames . Sirius is Padfoot . Peter is Wormtail . James was Prongs . ”
113339	113346	113347	113347	Harry	121	“ What sort of animal — ? ”
113356	113386	113351	113351	Hermione	133	“ That was still really dangerous ! Running around in the dark with a werewolf ! What if you ’d given the others the slip , and bitten somebody ? ”
113387	113395	113397	113397	Lupin	199	“ A thought that still haunts me , ”
113400	113522	113397	113397	Lupin	199	“ And there were near misses , many of them . We laughed about them afterwards . We were young , thoughtless — carried away with our own cleverness . I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore ’s trust , of course ... he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so , and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others ’ safety . He never knew I had led three fellow students into becoming Animagi illegally . But I always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month ’s adventure . And I have n’t changed ... ”
113539	113697	113536	113536	his	199	“ All this year , I have been battling with myself , wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus . But I did n’t do it . Why ? Because I was too cowardly . It would have meant admitting that I ’d betrayed his trust while I was at school , admitting that I ’d led others along with me ... and Dumbledore ’s trust has meant everything to me . He let me into Hogwarts as a boy , and he gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life , unable to find paid work because of what I am . And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using Dark Arts he learned from Voldemort , that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it ... so , in a way , Snape ’s been right about me all along . ”
113698	113701	113703	113703	Black	155	“ Snape ? ”
113723	113733	113703	113703	Black	155	“ What ’s Snape got to do with it ? ”
113734	113741	113743	113743	Lupin	199	“ He ’s here , Sirius , ”
113746	113754	113755	113755	He	199	“ He ’s teaching here as well . ”
113766	113790	113793	113793	Lupin	199	“ Professor Snape was at school with us . He fought very hard against my appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job ”
113795	113837	113793	113793	Lupin	199	“ He has been telling Dumbledore all year that I am not to be trusted . He has his reasons ... you see , Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him , a trick which involved me — ”
113844	113850	113851	113851	he	155	“ It served him right , ”
113854	113875	113851	113851	he	155	“ Sneaking around , trying to find out what we were up to ... hoping he could get us expelled ... ”
113876	113888	113889	113889	Lupin	199	“ Severus was very interested in where I went every month , ”
113898	114096	113896	113896	Hermione	133	“ We were in the same year , you know , and we — er — did n’t like each other very much . He especially disliked James . Jealous , I think , of James ’s talent on the Quidditch field ... anyway , Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform . Sirius thought it would be — er — amusing , to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick , and he ’d be able to get in after me . Well , of course , Snape tried it — if he ’d got as far as this house , he ’d have met a fully grown werewolf — but your father , who ’d heard what Sirius had done , went after Snape and pulled him back , at great risk to his life ... Snape glimpsed me , though , at the end of the tunnel . He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody , but from that time on he knew what I was ... ”
114097	114108	114110	114110	Harry	121	“ So that ’s why Snape does n’t like you , ”
114113	114124	114110	114110	Harry	121	“ because he thought you were in on the joke ? ”
114125	114130	113896	113896	Hermione	133	“ That ’s right , ”
114178	114190	114192	114192	Snape	264	“ I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow , ”
114211	114221	114192	114192	Snape	264	“ Very useful , Potter , I thank you ... ”
114236	114250	114251	114251	he	264	“ You ’re wondering , perhaps , how I knew you were here ? ”
114258	114330	114251	114251	he	264	“ I ’ve just been to your office , Lupin . You forgot to take your potion tonight , so I took a gobletful along . And very lucky I did ... lucky for me , I mean . Lying on your desk was a certain map . One glance at it told me all I needed to know . I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight . ”
114331	114334	114335	114335	Lupin	199	“ Severus — ”
114343	114390	114339	114339	Snape	264	“ I ’ve told the headmaster again and again that you ’re helping your old friend Black into the castle , Lupin , and here ’s the proof . Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout — ”
114391	114400	114402	114402	Lupin	199	“ Severus , you ’re making a mistake , ”
114405	114424	114402	114402	Lupin	199	“ You have n’t heard everything — I can explain — Sirius is not here to kill Harry — ”
114425	114432	114434	114434	Snape	264	“ Two more for Azkaban tonight , ”
114442	114471	114434	114434	Snape	264	“ I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this ... He was quite convinced you were harmless , you know , Lupin ... a tame werewolf — ”
114472	114476	114478	114478	Lupin	199	“ You fool , ”
114481	114495	114478	114478	Lupin	199	“ Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside Azkaban ? ”
114557	114563	114564	114564	he	264	“ Give me a reason , ”
114567	114582	114564	114564	he	264	“ Give me a reason to do it , and I swear I will . ”
114662	114686	114643	114643	Hermione	133	“ Professor Snape — it — it would n’t hurt to hear what they ’ve got to say , w - would it ? ”
114687	114700	114701	114701	Snape	264	“ Miss Granger , you are already facing suspension from this school , ”
114704	114739	114701	114701	Snape	264	“ You , Potter , and Weasley are out - of - bounds , in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf . For once in your life , hold your tongue . ”
114740	114750	114643	114643	Hermione	133	“ But if — if there was a mistake — ”
114751	114759	114760	114760	Snape	264	“ KEEP QUIET , YOU STUPID GIRL ! ”
114768	114777	114760	114760	Snape	264	“ DON’T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND ! ”
114803	114809	114810	114810	Snape	264	“ Vengeance is very sweet , ”
114815	114828	114810	114810	Snape	264	“ How I hoped I would be the one to catch you ... ”
114829	114839	114840	114840	Black	155	“ The joke ’s on you again , Severus , ”
114843	114856	114858	114858	he	264	“ As long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle ”
114865	114871	114858	114858	he	264	“ I ’ll come quietly ... ”
114872	114878	114880	114880	Snape	264	“ Up to the castle ? ”
114883	114935	114880	114880	Snape	264	“ I do n’t think we need to go that far . All I have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the Willow . They ’ll be very pleased to see you , Black ... pleased enough to give you a little Kiss , I daresay ... ”
114948	114959	114960	114960	he	264	“ You — you ’ve got to hear me out , ”
114963	114972	114960	114960	he	264	“ The rat — look at the rat — ”
114995	115003	115004	115004	he	264	“ Come on , all of you , ”
115026	115044	115007	115007	He	264	“ I ’ll drag the werewolf . Perhaps the dementors will have a Kiss for him too — ”
115066	115082	115084	115084	Snape	264	“ Get out of the way , Potter , you ’re in enough trouble already , ”
115086	115098	115084	115084	Snape	264	“ If I had n’t been here to save your skin — ”
115099	115113	115114	115114	Harry	121	“ Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year , ”
115117	115151	115114	115114	Harry	121	“ I ’ve been alone with him loads of times , having defense lessons against the dementors . If he was helping Black , why did n’t he just finish me off then ? ”
115152	115167	115169	115169	Snape	264	“ Do n’t ask me to fathom the way a werewolf ’s mind works , ”
115171	115180	115169	115169	Snape	264	“ Get out of the way , Potter . ”
115181	115185	115186	115186	Harry	121	“ YOU’RE PATHETIC ! ”
115189	115205	115186	115186	Harry	121	“ JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT SCHOOL YOU WON’T EVEN LISTEN — ”
115206	115218	115219	115219	Snape	264	“ SILENCE ! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT ! ”
115227	115304	115219	115219	Snape	264	“ Like father , like son , Potter ! I have just saved your neck ; you should be thanking me on bended knee ! You would have been well served if he ’d killed you ! You ’d have died like your father , too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black — now get out of the way , or I will make you . GET OUT OF THE WAY , POTTER ! ”
115331	115334	115335	115335	he	121	“ Expelliarmus ! ”
115434	115442	115444	115444	Black	155	“ You should n’t have done that , ”
115450	115459	115444	115444	Black	155	“ You should have left him to me ... ”
115482	115494	115495	115495	Hermione	133	“ We attacked a teacher ... We attacked a teacher ... , ”
115507	115520	115495	115495	Hermione	133	“ Oh , we ’re going to be in so much trouble — ”
115551	115557	115558	115558	he	199	“ Thank you , Harry , ”
115561	115571	115572	115572	Harry	121	“ I ’m still not saying I believe you , ”
115575	115586	115588	115588	Black	155	“ Then it ’s time we offered you some proof , ”
115590	115601	115588	115588	Black	155	“ You , boy — give me Peter . Now . ”
115610	115615	115616	115616	he	151	“ Come off it , ”
115620	115642	115616	115616	he	151	“ Are you trying to say he broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers ? I mean ... ”
115653	115689	115643	115643	He	151	“ Okay , say Pettigrew could turn into a rat — there are millions of rats — how ’s he supposed to know which one he ’s after if he was locked up in Azkaban ? ”
115690	115702	115704	115704	Lupin	199	“ You know , Sirius , that ’s a fair question , ”
115713	115723	115704	115704	Lupin	199	“ How did you find out where he was ? ”
115786	115793	115794	115794	Lupin	199	“ How did you get this ? ”
115800	115803	115805	115805	Black	155	“ Fudge , ”
115807	115872	115805	115805	Black	155	“ When he came to inspect Azkaban last year , he gave me his paper . And there was Peter , on the front page ... on this boy ’s shoulder ... I knew him at once ... how many times had I seen him transform ? And the caption said the boy would be going back to Hogwarts ... to where Harry was ... ”
115873	115877	115879	115879	Lupin	199	“ My God , ”
115895	115900	115879	115879	Lupin	199	“ His front paw ... ”
115901	115906	115908	115908	Ron	151	“ What about it ? ”
115911	115919	115921	115921	Black	155	“ He ’s got a toe missing , ”
115923	115927	115928	115928	Lupin	199	“ Of course , ”
115931	115944	115928	115928	Lupin	199	“ So simple ... so brilliant ... he cut it off himself ? ”
115945	115951	115953	115953	Black	155	“ Just before he transformed , ”
115955	116016	115953	115953	Black	155	“ When I cornered him , he yelled for the whole street to hear that I ’d betrayed Lily and James . Then , before I could curse him , he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back , killed everyone within twenty feet of himself — and sped down into the sewer with the other rats ... ”
116017	116026	116028	116028	Lupin	199	“ Did n’t you ever hear , Ron ? ”
116030	116042	116028	116028	Lupin	199	“ The biggest bit of Peter they found was his finger . ”
116043	116068	115953	115953	Black	155	“ Look , Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something ! He ’s been in my family for ages , right — ”
116069	116076	116078	116078	Lupin	199	“ Twelve years , in fact , ”
116080	116093	116078	116078	Lupin	199	“ Did n’t you ever wonder why he was living so long ? ”
116094	116106	116108	116108	Ron	151	“ We — we ’ve been taking good care of him ! ”
116110	116124	116126	116126	Lupin	199	“ Not looking too good at the moment , though , is he ? ”
116128	116148	116126	116126	Lupin	199	“ I ’d guess he ’s been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the loose again ... ”
116149	116159	116161	116161	Ron	151	“ He ’s been scared of that mad cat ! ”
116211	116218	116220	116220	Black	155	“ This cat is n’t mad , ”
116236	116302	116223	116223	He	155	“ He ’s the most intelligent of his kind I ’ve ever met . He recognized Peter for what he was right away . And when he met me , he knew I was no dog . It was a while before he trusted me ... Finally , I managed to communicate to him what I was after , and he ’s been helping me ... ”
116303	116309	116311	116311	Hermione	133	“ What do you mean ? ”
116313	116352	116223	116223	He	155	“ He tried to bring Peter to me , but could n’t ... so he stole the passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me ... As I understand it , he took them from a boy ’s bedside table ... ”
116376	116391	116393	116393	Black	155	“ But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it ... ”
116395	116433	116393	116393	Black	155	“ This cat — Crookshanks , did you call him ? — told me Peter had left blood on the sheets ... I supposed he bit himself ... Well , faking his own death had worked once ... ”
116442	116451	116452	116452	he	121	“ And why did he fake his death ? ”
116456	116472	116452	116452	he	121	“ Because he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parents ! ”
116473	116476	116478	116478	Lupin	199	“ No , ”
116480	116483	116478	116478	Lupin	199	“ Harry — ”
116484	116495	116452	116452	he	121	“ And now you ’ve come to finish him off ! ”
116496	116502	116504	116504	Black	155	“ Yes , I have , ”
116513	116523	116524	116524	Harry	121	“ Then I should ’ve let Snape take you ! ”
116527	116530	116532	116532	Lupin	199	“ Harry , ”
116535	116583	116532	116532	Lupin	199	“ do n’t you see ? All this time we ’ve thought Sirius betrayed your parents , and Peter tracked him down — but it was the other way around , do n’t you see ? Peter betrayed your mother and father — Sirius tracked Peter down — ”
116584	116590	116591	116591	Harry	121	“ THAT ’S NOT TRUE ! ”
116594	116616	116591	116591	Harry	121	“ HE WAS THEIR SECRET - KEEPER ! HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU TURNED UP . HE SAID HE KILLED THEM ! ”
116636	116646	116647	116647	Black	155	“ Harry ... I as good as killed them , ”
116650	116775	116647	116647	Black	155	“ I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment , persuaded them to use him as Secret - Keeper instead of me ... I ’m to blame , I know it ... The night they died , I ’d arranged to check on Peter , make sure he was still safe , but when I arrived at his hiding place , he ’d gone . Yet there was no sign of a struggle . It did n’t feel right . I was scared . I set out for your parents ’ house straightaway . And when I saw their house , destroyed , and their bodies ... I realized what Peter must ’ve done ... what I ’d done ... ”
116784	116789	116791	116791	Lupin	199	“ Enough of this , ”
116808	116827	116800	116800	his	199	“ There ’s one certain way to prove what really happened . Ron , give me that rat . ”
116828	116844	116845	116845	Ron	151	“ What are you going to do with him if I give him to you ? ”
116850	116857	116859	116859	Lupin	199	“ Force him to show himself , ”
116861	116875	116859	116859	Lupin	199	“ If he really is a rat , it wo n’t hurt him . ”
116913	116918	116920	116920	Lupin	199	“ Ready , Sirius ? ”
116954	116957	116958	116958	he	155	“ Together ? ”
116962	116967	116969	116969	Lupin	199	“ I think so , ”
116984	116997	116969	116969	Lupin	199	“ On the count of three . One — two — THREE ! ”
117218	117225	117227	117227	Lupin	199	“ Well , hello , Peter , ”
117242	117249	117227	117227	Lupin	199	“ Long time , no see . ”
117250	117259	117261	117261	Pettigrew	301	“ S - Sirius , R - Remus . ”
117276	117284	117269	117269	his	301	“ My friends ... my old friends ... ”
117317	117356	117311	117311	his	199	“ We ’ve been having a little chat , Peter , about what happened the night Lily and James died . You might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed — ”
117357	117360	117362	117362	Pettigrew	301	“ Remus , ”
117378	117397	117362	117362	Pettigrew	301	“ you do n’t believe him , do you ... ? He tried to kill me , Remus ... ”
117398	117404	117406	117406	Lupin	199	“ So we ’ve heard , ”
117411	117434	117406	117406	Lupin	199	“ I ’d like to clear up one or two little matters with you , Peter , if you ’d be so — ”
117435	117446	117447	117447	Pettigrew	301	“ He ’s come to try and kill me again ! ”
117471	117496	117459	117459	he	155	“ He killed Lily and James and now he ’s going to kill me too ... You ’ve got to help me , Remus ... ”
117517	117536	117538	117538	Lupin	199	“ No one ’s going to try and kill you until we ’ve sorted a few things out , ”
117540	117545	117547	117547	Pettigrew	301	“ Sorted things out ? ”
117570	117598	117547	117547	Pettigrew	301	“ I knew he ’d come after me ! I knew he ’d be back for me ! I ’ve been waiting for this for twelve years ! ”
117599	117611	117613	117613	Lupin	199	“ You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban ? ”
117619	117628	117613	117613	Lupin	199	“ When nobody has ever done it before ? ”
117629	117644	117645	117645	Pettigrew	301	“ He ’s got Dark powers the rest of us can only dream of ! ”
117649	117678	117645	117645	Pettigrew	301	“ How else did he get out of there ? I suppose He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named taught him a few tricks ! ”
117695	117702	117703	117703	he	155	“ Voldemort , teach me tricks ? ”
117718	117730	117732	117732	Black	155	“ What , scared to hear your old master ’s name ? ”
117734	117755	117732	117732	Black	155	“ I do n’t blame you , Peter . His lot are n’t very happy with you , are they ? ”
117756	117766	117768	117768	Pettigrew	301	“ Do n’t know what you mean , Sirius — ”
117785	117797	117799	117799	Black	155	“ You have n’t been hiding from me for twelve years , ”
117801	117927	117799	117799	Black	155	“ You ’ve been hiding from Voldemort ’s old supporters . I heard things in Azkaban , Peter ... They all think you ’re dead , or you ’d have to answer to them ... I ’ve heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep . Sounds like they think the double - crosser double - crossed them . Voldemort went to the Potters ’ on your information ... and Voldemort met his downfall there . And not all Voldemort ’s supporters ended up in Azkaban , did they ? There are still plenty out here , biding their time , pretending they ’ve seen the error of their ways ... If they ever got wind that you were still alive , Peter — ”
117928	117940	117942	117942	Pettigrew	301	“ Do n’t know ... what you ’re talking about ... , ”
117963	117975	117950	117950	He	301	“ You do n’t believe this — this madness , Remus — ”
117976	118002	118004	118004	Lupin	199	“ I must admit , Peter , I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat , ”
118007	118013	118015	118015	Pettigrew	301	“ Innocent , but scared ! ”
118017	118045	118015	118015	Pettigrew	301	“ If Voldemort ’s supporters were after me , it was because I put one of their best men in Azkaban — the spy , Sirius Black ! ”
118051	118056	118057	118057	he	155	“ How dare you , ”
118072	118146	118057	118057	he	155	“ I , a spy for Voldemort ? When did I ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself ? But you , Peter — I ’ll never understand why I did n’t see you were the spy from the start . You always liked big friends who ’d look after you , did n’t you ? It used to be us ... me and Remus ... and James ... ”
118160	118185	118153	118153	he	301	“ Me , a spy ... must be out of your mind ... never ... do n’t know how you can say such a — ”
118186	118201	118202	118202	Black	155	“ Lily and James only made you Secret - Keeper because I suggested it , ”
118214	118270	118208	118208	Pettigrew	301	“ I thought it was the perfect plan ... a bluff ... Voldemort would be sure to come after me , would never dream they ’d use a weak , talentless thing like you ... It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life , telling Voldemort you could hand him the Potters . ”
118280	118284	118271	118271	Pettigrew	301	“ far - fetched ”
118286	118289	118271	118271	Pettigrew	301	“ lunacy , ”
118320	118324	118326	118326	Hermione	133	“ Professor Lupin ? ”
118329	118337	118326	118326	Hermione	133	“ Can — can I say something ? ”
118338	118343	118345	118345	Lupin	199	“ Certainly , Hermione , ”
118348	118395	118326	118326	Hermione	133	“ Well — Scabbers — I mean , this — this man — he ’s been sleeping in Harry ’s dormitory for three years . If he ’s working for You - Know - Who , how come he never tried to hurt Harry before now ? ”
118396	118399	118401	118401	Pettigrew	301	“ There ! ”
118412	118436	118408	118408	his	301	“ Thank you ! You see , Remus ? I have never hurt a hair of Harry ’s head ! Why should I ? ”
118437	118444	118446	118446	Black	155	“ I ’ll tell you why , ”
118448	118583	118446	118446	Black	155	“ Because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you . Voldemort ’s been in hiding for twelve years , they say he ’s half dead . You were n’t about to commit murder right under Albus Dumbledore ’s nose , for a wreck of a wizard who ’d lost all of his power , were you ? You ’d want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him , would n’t you ? Why else did you find a wizard family to take you in ? Keeping an ear out for news , were n’t you , Peter ? Just in case your old protector regained strength , and it was safe to rejoin him ... ”
118604	118612	118614	118614	Hermione	133	“ Er — Mr. Black — Sirius ? ”
118640	118667	118697	118697	Black	155	“ If you do n’t mind me asking , how — how did you get out of Azkaban , if you did n’t use Dark Magic ? ”
118668	118672	118674	118674	Pettigrew	301	“ Thank you ! ”
118681	118688	118674	118674	Pettigrew	301	“ Exactly ! Precisely what I — ”
118722	118732	118733	118733	he	155	“ I do n’t know how I did it , ”
118737	118819	118820	118820	He	155	“ I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent . That was n’t a happy thought , so the dementors could n’t suck it out of me ... but it kept me sane and knowing who I am ... helped me keep my powers ... so when it all became ... too much ... I could transform in my cell ... become a dog . Dementors ca n’t see , you know ... ”
118823	118942	118820	118820	He	155	“ They feel their way toward people by sensing their emotions ... They could tell that my feelings were less — less human , less complex when I was a dog ... but they thought , of course , that I was losing my mind like everyone else in there , so it did n’t trouble them . But I was weak , very weak , and I had no hope of driving them away from me without a wand ... But then I saw Peter in that picture ... I realized he was at Hogwarts with Harry ... perfectly positioned to act , if one hint reached his ears that the Dark Side was gathering strength again ... ”
118963	119033	118946	118946	his	301	“ ... ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies ... and to deliver the last Potter to them . If he gave them Harry , who ’d dare say he ’d betrayed Lord Voldemort ? He ’d be welcomed back with honors ... So you see , I had to do something . I was the only one who knew Peter was still alive ... ”
119044	119068	119041	119042	Mrs. Weasley	143	“ The guards say he ’s been talking in his sleep ... always the same words ... ‘ He ’s at Hogwarts . ’ ”
119069	119222	119223	119223	He	2340	“ It was as if someone had lit a fire in my head , and the dementors could n’t destroy it ... It was n’t a happy feeling ... it was an obsession ... but it gave me strength , it cleared my mind . So , one night when they opened my door to bring food , I slipped past them as a dog ... It ’s so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused ... I was thin , very thin ... thin enough to slip through the bars ... I swam as a dog back to the mainland ... I journeyed north and slipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog . I ’ve been living in the forest ever since , except when I came to watch the Quidditch , of course . You fly as well as your father did , Harry ... ”
119234	119238	119240	119240	Black	155	“ Believe me , ”
119242	119264	119240	119240	Black	155	“ Believe me , Harry . I never betrayed James and Lily . I would have died before I betrayed them . ”
119283	119286	119280	119280	he	121	“ No ! ”
119325	119343	119305	119305	He	2340	“ Sirius — it ’s me ... it ’s Peter ... your friend ... you would n’t ... ”
119351	119364	119366	119366	Black	155	“ There ’s enough filth on my robes without you touching them , ”
119368	119371	119372	119372	Pettigrew	301	“ Remus ! ”
119387	119406	119377	119377	Lupin	199	“ You do n’t believe this ... Would n’t Sirius have told you they ’d changed the plan ? ”
119407	119419	119421	119421	Lupin	199	“ Not if he thought I was the spy , Peter , ”
119423	119437	119438	119438	he	199	“ I assume that ’s why you did n’t tell me , Sirius ? ”
119446	119452	119454	119454	Black	155	“ Forgive me , Remus , ”
119456	119466	119468	119468	Lupin	199	“ Not at all , Padfoot , old friend , ”
119478	119495	119468	119468	Lupin	199	“ And will you , in turn , forgive me for believing you were the spy ? ”
119496	119500	119502	119502	Black	155	“ Of course , ”
119526	119533	119516	119516	He	155	“ Shall we kill him together ? ”
119534	119541	119543	119543	Lupin	199	“ Yes , I think so , ”
119546	119556	119558	119558	Pettigrew	301	“ You would n’t ... you wo n’t ... , ”
119567	119605	119561	119561	he	301	“ Ron ... have n’t I been a good friend ... a good pet ? You wo n’t let them kill me , Ron , will you ... you ’re on my side , are n’t you ? ”
119617	119626	119627	119627	he	151	“ I let you sleep in my bed ! ”
119630	119637	119638	119638	Pettigrew	301	“ Kind boy ... kind master ... ”
119643	119663	119638	119638	Pettigrew	301	“ you wo n’t let them do it ... I was your rat ... I was a good pet ... ”
119664	119685	119687	119687	Black	155	“ If you made a better rat than a human , it ’s not much to boast about , Peter , ”
119726	119744	119708	119708	Pettigrew	301	“ Sweet girl ... clever girl ... you — you wo n’t let them ... Help me ... ”
119779	119795	119777	119777	Harry	121	“ Harry ... Harry ... you look just like your father ... just like him ... ”
119796	119804	119806	119806	Black	155	“ HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY ? ”
119808	119826	119806	119806	Black	155	“ HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM ? HOW DARE YOU TALK ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM ? ”
119827	119830	119832	119832	Pettigrew	301	“ Harry , ”
119841	119866	119832	119832	Pettigrew	301	“ Harry , James would n’t have wanted me killed ... James would have understood , Harry ... he would have shown me mercy ... ”
119900	119909	119911	119911	Black	155	“ You sold Lily and James to Voldemort , ”
119918	119924	119911	119911	Black	155	“ Do you deny it ? ”
119950	120016	120023	120023	Black	155	“ Sirius , Sirius , what could I have done ? The Dark Lord ... you have no idea ... he has weapons you ca n’t imagine ... I was scared , Sirius , I was never brave like you and Remus and James . I never meant it to happen ... He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named forced me — ”
120017	120021	120023	120023	Black	155	“ DON’T LIE ! ”
120025	120046	120023	120023	Black	155	“ YOU’D BEEN PASSING INFORMATION TO HIM FOR A YEAR BEFORE LILY AND JAMES DIED ! YOU WERE HIS SPY ! ”
120047	120056	120058	120058	Pettigrew	301	“ He — he was taking over everywhere ! ”
120060	120073	120058	120058	Pettigrew	301	“ W - what was there to be gained by refusing him ? ”
120074	120092	120094	120094	Black	155	“ What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed ? ”
120104	120111	120101	120101	his	155	“ Only innocent lives , Peter ! ”
120112	120118	120120	120120	Pettigrew	301	“ You do n’t understand ! ”
120122	120131	120120	120120	Pettigrew	301	“ He would have killed me , Sirius ! ”
120132	120139	120141	120141	Black	155	“ THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED ! ”
120143	120159	120141	120141	Black	155	“ DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS , AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU ! ”
120171	120177	120179	120179	Lupin	199	“ You should have realized , ”
120182	120199	120179	120179	Lupin	199	“ if Voldemort did n’t kill you , we would . Good - bye , Peter . ”
120213	120216	120217	120217	Harry	121	“ NO ! ”
120235	120242	120243	120243	he	121	“ You ca n’t kill him , ”
120247	120252	120243	120243	he	121	“ You ca n’t . ”
120260	120275	120276	120276	Black	155	“ Harry , this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents , ”
120279	120314	120276	120276	Black	155	“ This cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too , without turning a hair . You heard him . His own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole family . ”
120315	120319	120320	120320	Harry	121	“ I know , ”
120323	120354	120320	120320	Harry	121	“ We ’ll take him up to the castle . We ’ll hand him over to the dementors ... He can go to Azkaban ... but do n’t kill him . ”
120355	120358	120360	120360	Pettigrew	301	“ Harry ! ”
120372	120388	120363	120363	he	301	“ You — thank you — it ’s more than I deserve — thank you — ”
120389	120394	120395	120395	Harry	121	“ Get off me , ”
120407	120441	120399	120399	Pettigrew	301	“ I ’m not doing this for you . I ’m doing it because I do n’t reckon my dad would ’ve wanted his best friends to become killers — just for you . ”
120484	120499	120501	120501	Black	155	“ You ’re the only person who has the right to decide , Harry , ”
120503	120512	120501	120501	Black	155	“ But think ... think what he did ... ”
120513	120520	120521	120521	Harry	121	“ He can go to Azkaban , ”
120524	120534	120521	120521	Harry	121	“ If anyone deserves that place , he does ... ”
120542	120546	120548	120548	Lupin	199	“ Very well , ”
120550	120556	120548	120548	Lupin	199	“ Stand aside , Harry . ”
120560	120569	120571	120571	Lupin	199	“ I ’m going to tie him up , ”
120573	120581	120571	120571	Lupin	199	“ That ’s all , I swear . ”
120614	120622	120624	120624	Black	155	“ But if you transform , Peter , ”
120634	120645	120626	120626	his	155	“ we will kill you . You agree , Harry ? ”
120665	120668	120670	120670	Lupin	199	“ Right , ”
120675	120713	120670	120670	Lupin	199	“ Ron , I ca n’t mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey , so I think it ’s best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing . ”
120734	120737	120728	120728	his	199	“ Ferula . ”
120772	120777	120778	120778	he	151	“ That ’s better , ”

120785	120791	120793	120793	Hermione	133	“ What about Professor Snape ? ”
120807	120816	120818	120818	Lupin	199	“ There ’s nothing seriously wrong with him , ”
120828	120870	120818	120818	Lupin	199	“ You were just a little — overenthusiastic . Still out cold . Er — perhaps it will be best if we do n’t revive him until we ’re safely back in the castle . We can take him like this ... ”
120874	120877	120871	120871	He	264	“ Mobilicorpus . ”
120940	120951	120953	120953	Black	155	“ And two of us should be chained to this , ”
120961	120967	120953	120953	Black	155	“ Just to make sure . ”
120968	120974	120976	120976	Lupin	199	“ I ’ll do it , ”
120978	120982	120984	120984	Ron	151	“ And me , ”
121232	121239	121240	121240	Sirius	155	“ You know what this means ? ”
121255	121260	121240	121240	Sirius	155	“ Turning Pettigrew in ? ”
121261	121266	121268	121268	Harry	121	“ You ’re free , ”
121270	121274	121276	121276	Sirius	155	“ Yes ... , ”
121278	121299	121276	121276	Sirius	155	“ But I ’m also — I do n’t know if anyone ever told you — I ’m your godfather . ”
121300	121307	121309	121309	Harry	121	“ Yeah , I knew that , ”
121311	121321	121323	121323	Sirius	155	“ Well ... your parents appointed me your guardian , ”
121326	121333	121323	121323	Sirius	155	“ If anything happened to them ... ”
121346	121365	121367	121367	Sirius	155	“ I ’ll understand , of course , if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle , ”
121369	121393	121367	121367	Sirius	155	“ But ... well ... think about it . Once my name ’s cleared ... if you wanted a ... a different home ... ”

123535	123564	123504	123504	Harry	121	“ Shocking business ... shocking ... miracle none of them died ... never heard the like ... by thunder , it was lucky you were there , Snape ... ”
123565	123571	123504	123504	Harry	121	“ Thank you , Minister . ”
123572	123593	123504	123504	Harry	121	“ Order of Merlin , Second Class , I ’d say . First Class , if I can wangle it ! ”
123594	123603	123504	123504	Harry	121	“ Thank you very much indeed , Minister . ”
123604	123619	123504	123504	Harry	121	“ Nasty cut you ’ve got there ... Black ’s work , I suppose ? ”
123620	123638	123504	123504	Harry	121	“ As a matter of fact , it was Potter , Weasley , and Granger , Minister ... ”
123639	123642	123504	123504	Harry	121	“ No ! ”
123643	123753	123504	123504	Harry	121	“ Black had bewitched them , I saw it immediately . A Confundus Charm , to judge by their behavior . They seemed to think there was a possibility he was innocent . They were n’t responsible for their actions . On the other hand , their interference might have permitted Black to escape ... They obviously thought they were going to catch Black single - handed . They ’ve got away with a great deal before now ... I ’m afraid it ’s given them a rather high opinion of themselves ... and of course Potter has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster — ”
123754	123782	123504	123504	Harry	121	“ Ah , well , Snape ... Harry Potter , you know ... we ’ve all got a bit of a blind spot where he ’s concerned . ”
123783	123884	123504	123504	Harry	121	“ And yet — is it good for him to be given so much special treatment ? Personally , I try and treat him like any other student . And any other student would be suspended — at the very least — for leading his friends into such danger . Consider , Minister — against all school rules — after all the precautions put in place for his protection — out - of - bounds , at night , consorting with a werewolf and a murderer — and I have reason to believe he has been visiting Hogsmeade illegally too — ”
123885	123907	123504	123504	Harry	121	“ Well , well ... we shall see , Snape , we shall see ... The boy has undoubtedly been foolish ... ”
123974	123998	124103	124103	He	121	“ What amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors ... you ’ve really no idea what made them retreat , Snape ? ”
123999	124023	124103	124103	He	121	“ No , Minister ... by the time I had come ’ round they were heading back to their positions at the entrances ... ”
124024	124038	124103	124103	He	121	“ Extraordinary . And yet Black , and Harry , and the girl — ”
124039	124070	124103	124103	He	121	“ All unconscious by the time I reached them . I bound and gagged Black , naturally , conjured stretchers , and brought them all straight back to the castle . ”
124293	124300	124301	124301	she	208	“ Ah , you ’re awake ! ”
124324	124329	124331	124331	Harry	121	“ How ’s Ron ? ”
124336	124341	124343	124344	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ He ’ll live , ”
124347	124375	124343	124344	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ As for you two ... you ’ll be staying here until I ’m satisfied you ’re — Potter , what do you think you ’re doing ? ”
124393	124401	124402	124402	he	121	“ I need to see the headmaster , ”
124405	124408	124410	124411	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ Potter , ”
124414	124442	124410	124411	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ it ’s all right . They ’ve got Black . He ’s locked away upstairs . The dementors will be performing the Kiss any moment now — ”
124443	124446	124461	124461	his	121	“ WHAT ? ”
124483	124492	124494	124494	Fudge	175	“ Harry , Harry , what ’s this ? ”
124499	124512	124513	124513	he	175	“ You should be in bed — has he had any chocolate ? ”
124519	124524	124525	124525	Harry	121	“ Minister , listen ! ”
124528	124561	124525	124525	Harry	121	“ Sirius Black ’s innocent ! Peter Pettigrew faked his own death ! We saw him tonight ! You ca n’t let the dementors do that thing to Sirius , he ’s — ”
124576	124607	124573	124573	his	175	“ Harry , Harry , you ’re very confused , you ’ve been through a dreadful ordeal , lie back down , now , we ’ve got everything under control ... ”
124608	124612	124613	124613	Harry	121	“ YOU HAVEN’T ! ”
124616	124623	124613	124613	Harry	121	“ YOU’VE GOT THE WRONG MAN ! ”
124624	124631	124635	124635	she	133	“ Minister , listen , please , ”
124651	124675	124635	124635	she	133	“ I saw him too . It was Ron ’s rat , he ’s an Animagus , Pettigrew , I mean , and — ”
124676	124682	124684	124684	Snape	264	“ You see , Minister ? ”
124686	124703	124684	124684	Snape	264	“ Confunded , both of them ... Black ’s done a very good job on them ... ”
124704	124709	124710	124710	Harry	121	“ WE’RE NOT CONFUNDED ! ”
124713	124718	124720	124721	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ Minister ! Professor ! ”
124724	124744	124720	124721	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ I must insist that you leave . Potter is my patient , and he should not be distressed ! ”
124745	124760	124761	124761	Harry	121	“ I ’m not distressed , I ’m trying to tell them what happened ! ”
124765	124772	124761	124761	Harry	121	“ If they ’d just listen — ”
124804	124819	124827	124827	Dumbledore	195	“ Now , please , Minister , these children need care . Please leave — ”
124843	124850	124829	124829	Harry	121	“ Professor Dumbledore , Sirius Black — ”
124851	124857	124859	124860	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ For heaven ’s sake ! ”
124863	124878	124859	124860	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ Is this a hospital wing or not ? Headmaster , I must insist — ”
124879	124897	124899	124899	Dumbledore	213	“ My apologies , Poppy , but I need a word with Mr. Potter and Miss Granger , ”
124902	124912	124899	124899	Dumbledore	213	“ I have just been talking to Sirius Black — ”
124913	124932	124934	124934	Snape	264	“ I suppose he ’s told you the same fairy tale he ’s planted in Potter ’s mind ? ”
124936	124947	124934	124934	Snape	264	“ Something about a rat , and Pettigrew being alive — ”
124948	124958	124960	124960	Dumbledore	213	“ That , indeed , is Black ’s story , ”
124972	124981	124983	124983	Snape	264	“ And does my evidence count for nothing ? ”
124985	125007	124983	124983	Snape	264	“ Peter Pettigrew was not in the Shrieking Shack , nor did I see any sign of him on the grounds . ”
125008	125019	125021	125021	Hermione	133	“ That was because you were knocked out , Professor ! ”
125024	125034	125021	125021	Hermione	133	“ You did n’t arrive in time to hear — ”
125035	125043	124983	124983	Snape	264	“ Miss Granger , HOLD YOUR TONGUE ! ”
125044	125049	125051	125051	Fudge	175	“ Now , Snape , ”
125055	125070	125051	125051	Fudge	175	“ the young lady is disturbed in her mind , we must make allowances — ”
125071	125083	125085	125085	Dumbledore	213	“ I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone , ”
125088	125099	125085	125085	Dumbledore	213	“ Cornelius , Severus , Poppy — please leave us . ”
125100	125103	125105	125106	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ Headmaster ! ”
125108	125117	125105	125106	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ They need treatment , they need rest — ”
125118	125124	125126	125126	Dumbledore	213	“ This can not wait , ”
125128	125133	125126	125126	Dumbledore	213	“ I must insist . ”
125170	125179	125180	125180	he	175	“ The dementors should have arrived by now , ”
125183	125199	125180	125180	he	175	“ I ’ll go and meet them . Dumbledore , I ’ll see you upstairs . ”
125218	125231	125232	125232	Snape	264	“ You surely do n’t believe a word of Black ’s story ? ”
125243	125254	125255	125255	Dumbledore	213	“ I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone , ”
125265	125280	125281	125281	he	264	“ Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen , ”
125284	125305	125281	125281	he	264	“ You have n’t forgotten that , Headmaster ? You have n’t forgotten that he once tried to kill me ? ”
125306	125319	125321	125321	Dumbledore	213	“ My memory is as good as it ever was , Severus , ”
125362	125375	125352	125352	They	2404	“ Professor , Black ’s telling the truth — we saw Pettigrew — ”
125376	125388	125345	125345	Dumbledore	213	“ — he escaped when Professor Lupin turned into a werewolf — ”
125389	125396	125352	125352	They	2404	“ — he ’s a rat — ”
125397	125414	125345	125345	Dumbledore	213	“ — Pettigrew ’s front paw , I mean , finger , he cut it off — ”
125415	125426	125352	125352	They	2404	“ — Pettigrew attacked Ron , it was n’t Sirius — ”
125440	125464	125465	125465	he	213	“ It is your turn to listen , and I beg you will not interrupt me , because there is very little time , ”
125469	125533	125465	125465	he	213	“ There is not a shred of proof to support Black ’s story , except your word — and the word of two thirteen - year - old wizards will not convince anybody . A street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew . I myself gave evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters ’ Secret - Keeper . ”
125534	125541	125548	125548	himself	121	“ Professor Lupin can tell you — ”
125550	125620	125465	125465	he	213	“ Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest , unable to tell anyone anything . By the time he is human again , it will be too late , Sirius will be worse than dead . I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little — and the fact that he and Sirius are old friends — ”
125621	125624	125465	125465	he	213	“ But — ”
125625	125658	125465	125465	he	213	“ Listen to me , Harry . It is too late , you understand me ? You must see that Professor Snape ’s version of events is far more convincing than yours . ”
125659	125664	125665	125665	Hermione	133	“ He hates Sirius , ”
125669	125681	125665	125665	Hermione	133	“ All because of some stupid trick Sirius played on him — ”
125682	125723	125465	125465	he	213	“ Sirius has not acted like an innocent man . The attack on the Fat Lady — entering Gryffindor Tower with a knife — without Pettigrew , alive or dead , we have no chance of overturning Sirius ’s sentence . ”
125724	125730	125665	125665	Hermione	133	“ But you believe us . ”
125731	125737	125739	125739	Dumbledore	213	“ Yes , I do , ”
125742	125764	125739	125739	Dumbledore	213	“ But I have no power to make other men see the truth , or to overrule the Minister of Magic ... ”
125821	125826	125828	125828	Dumbledore	213	“ What we need , ”
125842	125847	125832	125832	his	213	“ is more time . ”
125848	125851	125852	125852	Hermione	133	“ But — ”
125863	125866	125857	125857	her	133	“ OH ! ”
125867	125873	125875	125875	Dumbledore	213	“ Now , pay attention , ”
125885	125966	125875	125875	Dumbledore	213	“ Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick ’s office on the seventh floor . Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower . If all goes well , you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight . But remember this , both of you : You must not be seen . Miss Granger , you know the law — you know what is at stake ... You — must — not — be — seen . ”
125993	126005	126006	126006	he	213	“ I am going to lock you in . It is — ”
126011	126029	126006	126006	he	213	“ five minutes to midnight . Miss Granger , three turns should do it . Good luck . ”
126030	126034	126035	126035	Harry	121	“ Good luck ? ”
126044	126061	126035	126035	Harry	121	“ Three turns ? What ’s he talking about ? What are we supposed to do ? ”
126086	126092	126093	126093	she	133	“ Harry , come here , ”
126097	126100	126093	126093	she	133	“ Quick ! ”
126127	126130	126109	126109	She	133	“ Here — ”
126141	126144	126145	126145	she	133	“ Ready ? ”
126149	126155	126156	126156	Harry	121	“ What are we doing ? ”
126278	126284	126261	126261	He	121	“ Hermione , what — ? ”
126285	126289	126290	126290	Hermione	133	“ In here ! ”
126329	126339	126309	126309	she	133	“ What — how — Hermione , what happened ? ”
126340	126348	126349	126349	Hermione	133	“ We ’ve gone back in time , ”
126363	126368	126349	126349	Hermione	133	“ Three hours back ... ”
126403	126406	126349	126349	Hermione	133	“ But — ”
126407	126426	126349	126349	Hermione	133	“ Shh ! Listen ! Someone ’s coming ! I think — I think it might be us ! ”
126437	126456	126427	126427	Hermione	133	“ Footsteps across the hall ... yes , I think it ’s us going down to Hagrid ’s ! ”
126457	126463	126464	126464	Harry	121	“ Are you telling me , ”
126467	126482	126464	126464	Harry	121	“ that we ’re here in this cupboard and we ’re out there too ? ”
126483	126486	126488	126488	Hermione	133	“ Yes , ”
126499	126530	126488	126488	Hermione	133	“ I ’m sure it ’s us . It does n’t sound like more than three people ... and we ’re walking slowly because we ’re under the Invisibility Cloak — ”
126539	126548	126531	126531	She	133	“ We ’ve gone down the front steps ... ”
126569	126578	126549	126549	Hermione	133	“ Where did you get that hourglass thing ? ”
126579	126588	126589	126589	Hermione	133	“ It ’s called a Time - Turner , ”
126592	126739	126589	126589	Hermione	133	“ and I got it from Professor McGonagall on our first day back . I ’ve been using it all year to get to all my lessons . Professor McGonagall made me swear I would n’t tell anyone . She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of Magic so I could have one . She had to tell them that I was a model student , and that I ’d never , ever use it for anything except my studies ... I ’ve been turning it back so I could do hours over again , that ’s how I ’ve been doing several lessons at once , see ? But ... Harry , I do n’t understand what Dumbledore wants us to do . Why did he tell us to go back three hours ? How ’s that going to help Sirius ? ”
126747	126762	126763	126763	he	121	“ There must be something that happened around now he wants us to change , ”
126767	126782	126763	126763	he	121	“ What happened ? We were walking down to Hagrid ’s three hours ago ... ”
126783	126799	126801	126801	Hermione	133	“ This is three hours ago , and we are walking down to Hagrid ’s , ”
126803	126810	126801	126801	Hermione	133	“ We just heard ourselves leaving ... ”
126828	126844	126763	126763	he	121	“ Dumbledore just said — just said we could save more than one innocent life ... ”
126851	126861	126763	126763	he	121	“ Hermione , we ’re going to save Buckbeak ! ”
126862	126871	126801	126801	Hermione	133	“ But — how will that help Sirius ? ”
126872	126925	126763	126763	he	121	“ Dumbledore said — he just told us where the window is — the window of Flitwick ’s office ! Where they ’ve got Sirius locked up ! We ’ve got to fly Buckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius ! Sirius can escape on Buckbeak — they can escape together ! ”
126940	126955	126936	126936	she	133	“ If we manage that without being seen , it ’ll be a miracle ! ”
126956	126969	126971	126971	Harry	121	“ Well , we ’ve got to try , have n’t we ? ”
126984	127000	126973	126973	He	121	“ Does n’t sound like anyone ’s there ... Come on , let ’s go ... ”
127055	127065	127066	127066	Hermione	133	“ If anyone ’s looking out of the window — ”
127077	127084	127086	127086	Harry	121	“ We ’ll run for it , ”
127089	127113	127086	127086	Harry	121	“ Straight into the forest , all right ? We ’ll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout — ”
127114	127126	127128	127128	Hermione	133	“ Okay , but we ’ll go around by the greenhouses ! ”
127131	127161	127128	127128	Hermione	133	“ We need to keep out of sight of Hagrid ’s front door , or we ’ll see us ! We must be nearly at Hagrid ’s by now ! ”
127243	127246	127247	127247	she	133	“ Right , ”
127250	127267	127247	127247	she	133	“ We need to sneak over to Hagrid ’s ... Keep out of sight , Harry ... ”
127347	127369	127343	127343	his	121	“ It ’s us . We ’re wearing the Invisibility Cloak . Let us in and we can take it off . ”
127370	127375	127376	127376	Hagrid	309	“ Yeh shouldn’ve come ! ”
127389	127400	127401	127401	Harry	121	“ This is the weirdest thing we ’ve ever done , ”
127405	127413	127414	127414	Hermione	133	“ Let ’s move along a bit , ”
127417	127426	127414	127414	Hermione	133	“ We need to get nearer to Buckbeak ! ”
127449	127452	127453	127453	Harry	121	“ Now ? ”
127456	127459	127461	127461	Hermione	133	“ No ! ”
127463	127494	127461	127461	Hermione	133	“ If we steal him now , those Committee people will think Hagrid set him free ! We ’ve got to wait until they ’ve seen he ’s tied outside ! ”
127495	127506	127508	127508	Harry	121	“ That ’s going to give us about sixty seconds , ”
127534	127543	127544	127544	Hermione	133	“ That ’s Hagrid breaking the milk jug , ”
127547	127558	127544	127544	Hermione	133	“ I ’m going to find Scabbers in a moment — ”
127575	127578	127580	127580	Harry	121	“ Hermione , ”
127583	127597	127580	127580	Harry	121	“ what if we — we just run in there and grab Pettigrew — ”
127598	127601	127603	127603	Hermione	133	“ No ! ”
127609	127644	127603	127603	Hermione	133	“ Do n’t you understand ? We ’re breaking one of the most important Wizarding laws ! Nobody ’s supposed to change time , nobody ! You heard Dumbledore , if we ’re seen — ”
127645	127656	127580	127580	Harry	121	“ We ’d only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid ! ”
127657	127677	127679	127679	Hermione	133	“ Harry , what do you think you ’d do if you saw yourself bursting into Hagrid ’s house ? ”
127681	127693	127695	127695	Harry	121	“ I ’d — I ’d think I ’d gone mad , ”
127697	127710	127695	127695	Harry	121	“ or I ’d think there was some Dark Magic going on — ”
127711	127760	127781	127781	Hermione	133	“ Exactly ! You would n’t understand , you might even attack yourself ! Do n’t you see ? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time ... Loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistake ! ”
127761	127764	127766	127766	Harry	121	“ Okay ! ”
127768	127779	127766	127766	Harry	121	“ It was just an idea , I just thought — ”
127827	127835	127836	127836	Hermione	133	“ We ’re about to come out ! ”
127895	127907	127908	127908	Hagrid	309	“ It ’s okay , Beaky , it ’s okay ... , ”
127924	127931	127914	127914	he	309	“ Go on . Get goin’ . ”
127932	127939	127914	127914	he	309	“ Hagrid , we ca n’t — ”
127940	127949	127914	127914	he	309	“ We ’ll tell them what really happened — ”
127950	127957	127914	127914	he	309	“ They ca n’t kill him — ”
127958	127974	127914	127914	he	309	“ Go ! It ’s bad enough without you lot in trouble an ’ all ! ”
127992	128000	127977	127978	the Hermione	2431	“ Go quick . Don ’ listen ... ”
128084	128090	128096	128096	Macnair	361	“ Where is the beast ? ”
128098	128103	128104	128104	Hagrid	309	“ Out — outside , ”
128134	128180	128132	128132	Fudge	175	“ We — er — have to read you the official notice of execution , Hagrid . I ’ll make it quick . And then you and Macnair need to sign it . Macnair , you ’re supposed to listen too , that ’s procedure — ”
128195	128199	128200	128200	Harry	121	“ Wait here , ”
128205	128211	128200	128200	Harry	121	“ I ’ll do it . ”
128239	128274	128219	128219	Harry	121	“ It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak , hereafter called the condemned , shall be executed on the sixth of June at sundown — ”
128321	128343	128306	128306	Harry	121	“ ... sentenced to execution by beheading , to be carried out by the Committee ’s appointed executioner , Walden Macnair ... ”
128344	128350	128351	128351	Harry	121	“ Come on , Buckbeak , ”
128354	128369	128351	128351	Harry	121	“ come on , we ’re going to help you . Quietly ... quietly ... ”
128370	128382	128306	128306	Harry	121	“ ... as witnessed below . Hagrid , you sign here ... ”
128401	128411	128417	128419	the Committee member	2438	“ Well , let ’s get this over with , ”
128426	128439	128417	128419	the Committee member	2438	“ Hagrid , perhaps it will be better if you stay inside — ”
128440	128463	128480	128480	Harry	121	“ No , I — I wan ’ ter be with him ... I don ’ wan ’ him ter be alone — ”
128471	128476	128477	128477	Harry	121	“ Buckbeak , move ! ”
128521	128529	128531	128531	Dumbledore	213	“ One moment , please , Macnair , ”
128535	128542	128531	128531	Dumbledore	213	“ You need to sign too . ”
128575	128580	128581	128581	she	133	“ Harry , hurry ! ”
128617	128622	128623	128623	Hermione	133	“ Quick ! Quick ! ”
128670	128673	128674	128674	he	121	“ Stop ! ”
128679	128685	128674	128674	he	121	“ They might hear us — ”
128719	128724	128730	128732	the Committee member	2438	“ Where is it ? ”
128734	128740	128730	128732	the Committee member	2438	“ Where is the beast ? ”
128741	128747	128749	128750	the executioner	3768	“ It was tied here ! ”
128753	128761	128749	128750	the executioner	3768	“ I saw it ! Just here ! ”
128762	128766	128777	128777	his	213	“ How extraordinary , ”
128780	128783	128785	128785	Hagrid	309	“ Beaky ! ”
128833	128858	128826	128826	Hagrid	309	“ Gone ! Gone ! Bless his little beak , he ’s gone ! Musta pulled himself free ! Beaky , yeh clever boy ! ”
128892	128897	128898	128899	the executioner	3768	“ Someone untied him ! ”
128903	128913	128898	128899	the executioner	3768	“ We should search the grounds , the forest — ”
128914	128938	128940	128940	Dumbledore	213	“ Macnair , if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen , do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot ? ”
128946	128971	128940	128940	Dumbledore	213	“ Search the skies , if you will ... Hagrid , I could do with a cup of tea . Or a large brandy . ”
128972	128982	128984	128984	Hagrid	309	“ O ’ — o ’ course , Professor , ”
128992	128999	128984	128984	Hagrid	309	“ Come in , come in ... ”
129029	129033	129035	129035	Harry	121	“ Now what ? ”
129040	129049	129051	129051	Hermione	133	“ We ’ll have to hide in here , ”
129058	129108	129051	129051	Hermione	133	“ We need to wait until they ’ve gone back to the castle . Then we wait until it ’s safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius ’s window . He wo n’t be there for another couple of hours ... Oh , this is going to be difficult ... ”
129128	129137	129139	129139	Harry	121	“ We ’re going to have to move , ”
129144	129167	129139	129139	Harry	121	“ We ’ve got to be able to see the Whomping Willow , or we wo n’t know what ’s going on . ”
129168	129171	129173	129173	Hermione	133	“ Okay , ”
129184	129199	129173	129173	Hermione	133	“ But we ’ve got to keep out of sight , Harry , remember ... ”
129233	129238	129240	129240	Harry	121	“ There ’s Ron ! ”
129261	129275	129243	129245	A dark figure	2456	“ Get away from him — get away — Scabbers , come here — ”
129303	129313	129300	129300	Ron	151	“ Gotcha ! Get off , you stinking cat — ”
129314	129319	129321	129321	Harry	121	“ There ’s Sirius ! ”
129350	129361	129363	129363	Harry	121	“ Looks even worse from here , does n’t it ? ”
129374	129396	129363	129363	Harry	121	“ Ouch — look , I just got walloped by the tree — and so did you — this is weird — ”
129431	129439	129441	129441	Hermione	133	“ That was Crookshanks pressing the knot , ”
129443	129450	129451	129451	Harry	121	“ And there we go ... , ”
129454	129459	129451	129451	Harry	121	“ We ’re in . ”
129502	129513	129515	129515	Hermione	133	“ Right after we ’d gone down into the passage ! ”
129517	129526	129515	129515	Hermione	133	“ If only Dumbledore had come with us ... ”
129527	129536	129538	129538	Harry	121	“ Macnair and Fudge would ’ve come too , ”
129541	129558	129538	129538	Harry	121	“ I bet you anything Fudge would ’ve told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot ... ”
129584	129589	129591	129591	Harry	121	“ Here comes Lupin ! ”
129658	129667	129669	129669	Harry	121	“ If he ’d only grabbed the Cloak , ”
129671	129678	129669	129669	Harry	121	“ It ’s just lying there ... ”
129684	129704	129679	129679	He	121	“ If I just dashed out now and grabbed it , Snape’d never be able to get it and — ”
129705	129714	129679	129679	He	121	“ Harry , we must n’t be seen ! ”
129715	129722	129723	129723	he	121	“ How can you stand this ? ”
129728	129737	129738	129738	He	121	“ Just standing here and watching it happen ? ”
129741	129750	129738	129738	He	121	“ I ’m going to grab the Cloak ! ”
129751	129756	129757	129757	Hermione	133	“ Harry , no ! ”
129817	129820	129821	129821	Hermione	133	“ See ? ”
129824	129844	129821	129821	Hermione	133	“ See what would have happened ? We ’ve got to keep out of sight ! No , Buckbeak ! ”
129950	129958	129959	129959	Harry	121	“ Get your filthy hands off it , ”
129965	129968	129962	129962	his	121	“ Shh ! ”
129996	130002	130004	130004	Hermione	133	“ So that ’s it , ”
130007	130029	130004	130004	Hermione	133	“ We ’re all down there ... and now we ’ve just got to wait until we come back up again ... ”
130060	130099	130030	130030	She	133	“ Harry , there ’s something I do n’t understand ... Why did n’t the dementors get Sirius ? I remember them coming , and then I think I passed out ... there were so many of them ... ”
130156	130162	130143	130143	Hermione	133	“ But what was it ? ”
130163	130180	130182	130182	Harry	121	“ There ’s only one thing it could have been , to make the dementors go , ”
130184	130193	130182	130182	Harry	121	“ A real Patronus . A powerful one . ”
130194	130200	130143	130143	Hermione	133	“ But who conjured it ? ”
130241	130251	130253	130253	Hermione	133	“ Did n’t you see what they looked like ? ”
130256	130264	130253	130253	Hermione	133	“ Was it one of the teachers ? ”
130265	130268	130270	130270	Harry	121	“ No , ”
130272	130279	130270	130270	Harry	121	“ He was n’t a teacher . ”
130280	130319	130253	130253	Hermione	133	“ But it must have been a really powerful wizard , to drive all those dementors away ... If the Patronus was shining so brightly , did n’t it light him up ? Could n’t you see — ? ”
130320	130327	130329	130329	Harry	121	“ Yeah , I saw him , ”
130332	130352	130329	130329	Harry	121	“ But ... maybe I imagined it ... I was n’t thinking straight ... I passed out right afterward ... ”
130353	130361	130253	130253	Hermione	133	“ Who did you think it was ? ”
130362	130366	130367	130367	Harry	121	“ I think — ”
130379	130387	130367	130367	Harry	121	“ I think it was my dad . ”
130416	130427	130428	130428	she	133	“ Harry , your dad ’s — well — dead , ”
130432	130437	130439	130439	Harry	121	“ I know that , ”
130442	130450	130502	130502	Hermione	133	“ You think you saw his ghost ? ”
130451	130463	130502	130502	Hermione	133	“ I do n’t know ... no ... he looked solid ... ”
130464	130468	130502	130502	Hermione	133	“ But then — ”
130469	130476	130478	130478	Harry	121	“ Maybe I was seeing things , ”
130480	130501	130478	130478	Harry	121	“ But ... from what I could see ... it looked like him ... I ’ve got photos of him ... ”
130515	130522	130524	130524	Harry	121	“ I know it sounds crazy , ”
130695	130700	130701	130701	Hermione	133	“ Here we come ! ”
130795	130798	130803	130803	she	133	“ Harry , ”
130811	130832	130803	130803	she	133	“ we ’ve got to stay put . We must n’t be seen . There ’s nothing we can do ... ”
130833	130847	130849	130849	Harry	121	“ So we ’re just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again ... ”
130852	130865	130867	130867	Hermione	133	“ How do you expect to find a rat in the dark ? ”
130869	130894	130867	130867	Hermione	133	“ There ’s nothing we can do ! We came back to help Sirius . We ’re not supposed to be doing anything else ! ”
130895	130899	130930	130930	Hermione	133	“ All right ! ”
130924	130929	130930	130930	Hermione	133	“ There goes Lupin , ”
130933	130938	130930	130930	Hermione	133	“ He ’s transforming — ”
130939	130942	130944	130944	Harry	121	“ Hermione ! ”
130947	130954	130944	130944	Harry	121	“ We ’ve got to move ! ”
130955	130965	130930	130930	Hermione	133	“ We must n’t , I keep telling you — ”
130966	130984	130944	130944	Harry	121	“ Not to interfere ! Lupin ’s going to run into the forest , right at us ! ”
130988	130991	130992	130992	she	133	“ Quick ! ”
131000	131025	130992	130992	she	133	“ Quick ! Where are we going to go ? Where are we going to hide ? The dementors will be coming any moment — ”
131026	131032	131033	131033	Harry	121	“ Back to Hagrid ’s ! ”
131036	131045	131033	131033	Harry	121	“ It ’s empty now — come on ! ”
131110	131119	131121	131121	Hermione	133	“ Shh , Fang , it ’s us ! ”
131133	131139	131140	131140	she	133	“ That was really close ! ”
131145	131148	131140	131140	she	133	“ Yeah ... ”
131205	131218	131220	131220	Harry	121	“ I think I ’d better go outside again , you know , ”
131223	131242	131220	131220	Harry	121	“ I ca n’t see what ’s going on — we wo n’t know when it ’s time — ”
131252	131262	131264	131264	Harry	121	“ I ’m not going to try and interfere , ”
131267	131293	131264	131264	Harry	121	“ But if we do n’t see what ’s going on , how ’re we going to know when it ’s time to rescue Sirius ? ”
131294	131325	131356	131356	Hermione	133	“ Well ... okay , then ... I ’ll wait here with Buckbeak ... but Harry , be careful — there ’s a werewolf out there — and the dementors — ”
131609	131613	131614	131614	he	121	“ Come on ! ”
131620	131630	131614	131614	he	121	“ Where are you ? Dad , come on — ”
131713	131717	131718	131718	he	121	“ EXPECTO PATRONUM ! ”
131919	131922	131923	131923	he	121	“ Prongs , ”
131978	131984	131985	131985	she	133	“ What did you do ? ”
131989	132001	131985	131985	she	133	“ You said you were only going to keep a lookout ! ”
132002	132011	132013	132013	Harry	121	“ I just saved all our lives ... , ”
132015	132028	132013	132013	Harry	121	“ Get behind here — behind this bush — I ’ll explain . ”
132043	132049	132037	132037	her	133	“ Did anyone see you ? ”
132050	132074	131985	131985	she	133	“ Yes , have n’t you been listening ? I saw me but I thought I was my dad ! It ’s okay ! ”
132075	132104	132037	132037	her	133	“ Harry , I ca n’t believe it ... You conjured up a Patronus that drove away all those dementors ! That ’s very , very advanced magic ... ”
132105	132115	132117	132117	Harry	121	“ I knew I could do it this time , ”
132119	132132	132117	132117	Harry	121	“ because I ’d already done it ... Does that make sense ? ”
132133	132145	132037	132037	her	133	“ I do n’t know — Harry , look at Snape ! ”
132215	132223	132225	132225	Hermione	133	“ Right , it ’s nearly time , ”
132233	132271	132225	132225	Hermione	133	“ We ’ve got about forty - five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing . We ’ve got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes we ’re missing ... ”
132305	132314	132316	132316	Harry	121	“ D’you reckon he ’s up there yet ? ”
132341	132344	132345	132345	Hermione	133	“ Look ! ”
132348	132362	132345	132345	Hermione	133	“ Who ’s that ? Someone ’s coming back out of the castle ! ”
132390	132393	132395	132395	Harry	121	“ Macnair ! ”
132397	132415	132395	132395	Harry	121	“ The executioner ! He ’s gone to get the dementors ! This is it , Hermione — ”
132476	132479	132480	132480	he	121	“ Ready ? ”
132485	132494	132480	132480	he	121	“ You ’d better hold on to me — ”
132545	132565	132542	132542	her	133	“ Oh , no — I do n’t like this — oh , I really do n’t like this — ”
132610	132613	132614	132614	he	121	“ Whoa ! ”
132660	132665	132666	132666	Harry	121	“ He ’s there ! ”
132731	132735	132742	132742	she	133	“ Stand back ! ”
132761	132764	132742	132742	she	133	“ Alohomora ! ”
132770	132776	132778	132778	Black	155	“ How — how — ? ”
132786	132796	132798	132798	Harry	121	“ Get on — there ’s not much time , ”
132815	132837	132798	132798	Harry	121	“ You ’ve got to get out of here — the dementors are coming — Macnair ’s gone to get them . ”
132891	132898	132900	132900	Harry	121	“ Okay , Buckbeak , up ! ”
132906	132915	132900	132900	Harry	121	“ Up to the tower — come on ! ”
132960	132970	132971	132971	Harry	121	“ Sirius , you ’d better go , quick , ”
132974	132992	132971	132971	Harry	121	“ They ’ll reach Flitwick ’s office any moment , they ’ll find out you ’re gone . ”
133003	133013	133015	133015	Sirius	155	“ What happened to the other boy ? Ron ? ”
133017	133049	133015	133015	Sirius	155	“ He ’s going to be okay . He ’s still out of it , but Madam Pomfrey says she ’ll be able to make him better . Quick — go — ”
133059	133066	133051	133051	Black	155	“ How can I ever thank — ”
133067	133070	133071	133071	Harry	121	“ GO ! ”
133087	133095	133096	133096	he	155	“ We ’ll see each other again , ”
133099	133111	133096	133096	he	155	“ You are — truly your father ’s son , Harry ... ”
133168	133171	133164	133164	They	2535	“ Harry ! ”
133184	133210	133181	133181	her	133	“ We ’ve got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us — before Dumbledore locks the door — ”
133211	133214	133216	133216	Harry	121	“ Okay , ”
133225	133230	133216	133216	Harry	121	“ let ’s go ... ”
133288	133300	133301	133301	Snape	264	“ ... only hope Dumbledore ’s not going to make difficulties , ”
133305	133313	133301	133301	Snape	264	“ The Kiss will be performed immediately ? ”
133314	133394	133409	133409	he	121	“ As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors . This whole Black affair has been highly embarrassing . I ca n’t tell you how much I ’m looking forward to informing the Daily Prophet that we ’ve got him at last ... I daresay they ’ll want to interview you , Snape ... and once young Harry ’s back in his right mind , I expect he ’ll want to tell the Prophet exactly how you saved him ... ”
133468	133471	133472	133472	Harry	121	“ Peeves ! ”
133480	133484	133472	133472	Harry	121	“ In here ! ”
133516	133523	133527	133527	her	133	“ Oh , he ’s horrible , ”
133533	133550	133551	133551	She	133	“ I bet he ’s all excited because the dementors are going to finish off Sirius ... ”
133556	133562	133551	133551	She	133	“ Three minutes , Harry ! ”
133590	133611	133612	133612	Harry	121	“ Hermione — what ’ll happen — if we do n’t get back inside — before Dumbledore locks the door ? ”
133615	133625	133626	133626	Hermione	133	“ I do n’t want to think about it ! ”
133634	133638	133626	133626	Hermione	133	“ One minute ! ”
133653	133661	133663	133663	Hermione	133	“ Okay — I can hear Dumbledore , ”
133666	133672	133663	133663	Hermione	133	“ Come on , Harry ! ”
133688	133697	133700	133700	him	213	“ I am going to lock you in , ”
133703	133723	133700	133700	him	213	“ It is five minutes to midnight . Miss Granger , three turns should do it . Good luck . ”
133768	133771	133772	133772	he	213	“ Well ? ”
133776	133781	133783	133783	Harry	121	“ We did it ! ”
133786	133794	133783	133783	Harry	121	“ Sirius has gone , on Buckbeak ... ”
133800	133807	133808	133808	He	213	“ Well done . I think — ”
133819	133838	133808	133808	He	213	“ Yes , I think you ’ve gone too — get inside — I ’ll lock you in — ”
133907	133925	133897	133898	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ Did I hear the headmaster leaving ? Am I allowed to look after my patients now ? ”
134005	134010	134012	134013	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ What was that ? ”
134037	134054	134029	134030	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ Really — they ’ll wake everybody up ! What do they think they ’re doing ? ”
134071	134095	134066	134066	They	2539	“ He must have Disapparated , Severus . We should have left somebody in the room with him . When this gets out — ”
134096	134101	134102	134102	Snape	264	“ HE DIDN’T DISAPPARATE ! ”
134111	134135	134102	134102	Snape	264	“ YOU CAN’T APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE ! THIS — HAS — SOMETHING — TO — DO — WITH — POTTER ! ”
134136	134148	134149	134149	BAM	377	“ Severus — be reasonable — Harry has been locked up — ”
134199	134206	134207	134207	he	264	“ OUT WITH IT , POTTER ! ”
134210	134216	134207	134207	he	264	“ WHAT DID YOU DO ? ”
134217	134221	134223	134224	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ Professor Snape ! ”
134226	134230	134223	134224	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ Control yourself ! ”
134231	134240	134242	134242	Fudge	175	“ See here , Snape , be reasonable , ”
134244	134255	134242	134242	Fudge	175	“ This door ’s been locked , we just saw — ”
134256	134266	134267	134267	Snape	264	“ THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE , I KNOW IT ! ”
134288	134294	134295	134295	Fudge	175	“ Calm down , man ! ”
134298	134304	134295	134295	Fudge	175	“ You ’re talking nonsense ! ”
134305	134311	134313	134313	Snape	264	“ YOU DON’T KNOW POTTER ! ”
134315	134326	134313	134313	Snape	264	“ HE DID IT , I KNOW HE DID IT — ”
134327	134334	134336	134336	Dumbledore	213	“ That will do , Severus , ”
134339	134371	134336	134336	Dumbledore	213	“ Think about what you are saying . This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes ago . Madam Pomfrey , have these students left their beds ? ”
134372	134377	134379	134380	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ Of course not ! ”
134384	134391	134379	134380	Madam Pomfrey	208	“ I would have heard them ! ”
134392	134402	134404	134404	Dumbledore	213	“ Well , there you have it , Severus , ”
134407	134440	134404	134404	Dumbledore	213	“ Unless you are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at once , I ’m afraid I do n’t see any point in troubling them further . ”
134486	134492	134494	134494	Fudge	175	“ Fellow seems quite unbalanced , ”
134500	134514	134494	134494	Fudge	175	“ I ’d watch out for him if I were you , Dumbledore . ”
134515	134523	134525	134525	Dumbledore	213	“ Oh , he ’s not unbalanced , ”
134528	134537	134525	134525	Dumbledore	213	“ He ’s just suffered a severe disappointment . ”
134538	134546	134548	134548	Fudge	175	“ He ’s not the only one ! ”
134550	134610	134548	134548	Fudge	175	“ The Daily Prophet ’s going to have a field day ! We had Black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again ! All it needs now is for the story of that hippogriff ’s escape to get out , and I ’ll be a laughingstock ! Well ... I ’d better go and notify the Ministry ... ”
134611	134616	134618	134618	Dumbledore	213	“ And the dementors ? ”
134620	134632	134618	134618	Dumbledore	213	“ They ’ll be removed from the school , I trust ? ”
134633	134643	134645	134645	Fudge	175	“ Oh yes , they ’ll have to go , ”
134655	134699	134648	134648	his	175	“ Never dreamed they ’d attempt to administer the Kiss on an innocent boy ... Completely out of control ... no , I ’ll have them packed off back to Azkaban tonight ... Perhaps we should think about dragons at the school entrance ... ”
134700	134706	134708	134708	Dumbledore	213	“ Hagrid would like that , ”
134781	134787	134788	134788	he	151	“ What — what happened ? ”
134791	134813	134788	134788	he	151	“ Harry ? Why are we in here ? Where ’s Sirius ? Where ’s Lupin ? What ’s going on ? ”
134822	134826	134828	134828	Harry	121	“ You explain , ”
135003	135019	135020	135020	he	309	“ Know I shouldn ’ feel happy , after wha ’ happened las ’ night , ”
135023	135041	135020	135020	he	309	“ I mean , Black escapin ’ again , an ’ everythin ’ — but guess what ? ”
135042	135045	135046	135046	they	2565	“ What ? ”
135054	135070	135020	135020	he	309	“ Beaky ! He escaped ! He ’s free ! Bin celebratin ’ all night ! ”
135071	135076	135078	135078	Hermione	133	“ That ’s wonderful ! ”
135096	135107	135109	135109	Hagrid	309	“ Yeah ... ca n’t ’ve tied him up properly , ”
135118	135150	135109	135109	Hagrid	309	“ I was worried this mornin ’ , mind ... thought he mighta met Professor Lupin on the grounds , but Lupin says he never ate anythin ’ las ’ night ... ”
135151	135154	135156	135156	Harry	121	“ What ? ”
135159	135167	135169	135169	Hagrid	309	“ Blimey , haven ’ yeh heard ? ”
135190	135238	135177	135177	He	309	“ Er — Snape told all the Slytherins this mornin ’ ... Thought everyone’d know by now ... Professor Lupin ’s a werewolf , see . An ’ he was loose on the grounds las ’ night ... He ’s packin ’ now , o ’ course . ”
135239	135244	135246	135246	Harry	121	“ He ’s packing ? ”
135250	135253	135246	135246	Harry	121	“ Why ? ”
135254	135262	135264	135264	Hagrid	309	“ Leavin ’ , isn ’ he ? ”
135274	135293	135264	135264	Hagrid	309	“ Resigned firs ’ thing this mornin ’ . Says he ca n’t risk it happenin ’ again . ”
135300	135308	135309	135309	he	121	“ I ’m going to see him , ”
135316	135323	135264	135264	Hagrid	309	“ But if he ’s resigned — ”
135324	135337	135264	135264	Hagrid	309	“ — does n’t sound like there ’s anything we can do — ”
135338	135358	135264	135264	Hagrid	309	“ I do n’t care . I still want to see him . I ’ll meet you back here . ”
135414	135420	135422	135422	Lupin	199	“ I saw you coming , ”
135444	135450	135452	135452	Harry	121	“ I just saw Hagrid , ”
135454	135470	135452	135452	Harry	121	“ And he said you ’d resigned . It ’s not true , is it ? ”
135471	135478	135480	135480	Lupin	199	“ I ’m afraid it is , ”
135494	135497	135499	135499	Harry	121	“ Why ? ”
135501	135517	135499	135499	Harry	121	“ The Ministry of Magic do n’t think you were helping Sirius , do they ? ”
135529	135547	135548	135548	He	199	“ No . Professor Dumbledore managed to convince Fudge that I was trying to save your lives . ”
135551	135591	135548	135548	He	199	“ That was the final straw for Severus . I think the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard . So he — er — accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast . ”
135592	135602	135604	135604	Harry	121	“ You ’re not leaving just because of that ! ”
135610	135659	135548	135548	He	199	“ This time tomorrow , the owls will start arriving from parents ... They will not want a werewolf teaching their children , Harry . And after last night , I see their point . I could have bitten any of you ... That must never happen again . ”
135660	135676	135678	135678	Harry	121	“ You ’re the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we ’ve ever had ! ”
135680	135685	135678	135678	Harry	121	“ Do n’t go ! ”
135722	135764	135719	135719	Lupin	199	“ From what the headmaster told me this morning , you saved a lot of lives last night , Harry . If I ’m proud of anything , it ’s how much you ’ve learned ... Tell me about your Patronus . ”
135765	135772	135774	135774	Harry	121	“ How d’you know about that ? ”
135778	135788	135719	135719	Lupin	199	“ What else could have driven the dementors back ? ”
135806	135819	135820	135820	he	199	“ Yes , your father was always a stag when he transformed , ”
135823	135836	135820	135820	he	199	“ You guessed right ... that ’s why we called him Prongs . ”
135859	135872	135873	135873	he	199	“ Here — I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last night , ”
135883	135886	135887	135887	He	199	“ And ... ”
135899	135943	135887	135887	He	199	“ I am no longer your teacher , so I do n’t feel guilty about giving you this back as well . It ’s no use to me , and I daresay you , Ron , and Hermione will find uses for it . ”
135951	135983	135944	135944	Harry	121	“ You told me Moony , Wormtail , Padfoot , and Prongs would ’ve wanted to lure me out of school ... you said they ’d have thought it was funny . ”
135984	135991	135993	135993	Lupin	199	“ And so we would have , ”
136003	136033	135993	135993	Lupin	199	“ I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle . ”
136072	136082	136083	136083	he	213	“ Your carriage is at the gates , Remus , ”
136086	136092	136093	136093	Lupin	199	“ Thank you , Headmaster . ”
136105	136114	136115	136115	he	199	“ Well — good - bye , Harry , ”
136120	136156	136115	136115	he	199	“ It has been a real pleasure teaching you . I feel sure we ’ll meet again sometime . Headmaster , there is no need to see me to the gates , I can manage ... ”
136171	136180	136182	136182	Dumbledore	213	“ Good - bye , then , Remus , ”
136246	136253	136254	136254	he	213	“ Why so miserable , Harry ? ”
136258	136270	136254	136254	he	213	“ You should be very proud of yourself after last night . ”
136271	136279	136281	136281	Harry	121	“ It did n’t make any difference , ”
136284	136289	136281	136281	Harry	121	“ Pettigrew got away . ”
136290	136297	136299	136299	Dumbledore	213	“ Did n’t make any difference ? ”
136302	136330	136299	136299	Dumbledore	213	“ It made all the difference in the world , Harry . You helped uncover the truth . You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate . ”
136353	136375	136281	136281	Harry	121	“ Professor Dumbledore — yesterday , when I was having my Divination exam , Professor Trelawney went very — very strange . ”
136376	136379	136381	136381	Dumbledore	213	“ Indeed ? ”
136383	136393	136381	136381	Dumbledore	213	“ Er — stranger than usual , you mean ? ”
136394	136439	136440	136440	Harry	121	“ Yes ... her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said ... she said Voldemort ’s servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight ... She said the servant would help him come back to power . ”
136446	136476	136440	136440	Harry	121	“ And then she sort of became normal again , and she could n’t remember anything she ’d said . Was it — was she making a real prediction ? ”
136482	136496	136497	136497	he	213	“ Do you know , Harry , I think she might have been , ”
136501	136527	136497	136497	he	213	“ Who ’d have thought it ? That brings her total of real predictions up to two . I should offer her a pay raise ... ”
136528	136531	136532	136532	Harry	121	“ But — ”
136547	136570	136497	136497	he	213	“ But — I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew ! That makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back ! ”
136571	136576	136578	136578	Dumbledore	213	“ It does not , ”
136581	136646	136578	136578	Dumbledore	213	“ Has n’t your experience with the Time - Turner taught you anything , Harry ? The consequences of our actions are always so complicated , so diverse , that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed ... Professor Trelawney , bless her , is living proof of that ... You did a very noble thing , in saving Pettigrew ’s life . ”
136647	136658	136497	136497	he	213	“ But if he helps Voldemort back to power — ! ”
136659	136713	136578	136578	Dumbledore	213	“ Pettigrew owes his life to you . You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt . When one wizard saves another wizard ’s life , it creates a certain bond between them ... and I ’m much mistaken if Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry Potter . ”
136714	136724	136726	136726	Harry	121	“ I do n’t want a bond with Pettigrew ! ”
136728	136734	136726	136726	Harry	121	“ He betrayed my parents ! ”
136735	136769	136578	136578	Dumbledore	213	“ This is magic at its deepest , its most impenetrable , Harry . But trust me ... the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew ’s life . ”
136790	136806	136807	136807	he	213	“ I knew your father very well , both at Hogwarts and later , Harry , ”
136811	136825	136807	136807	he	213	“ He would have saved Pettigrew too , I am sure of it . ”
136842	136876	136840	136840	Dumbledore	213	“ Last night ... I thought it was my dad who ’d conjured my Patronus . I mean , when I saw myself across the lake ... I thought I was seeing him . ”
136877	136884	136886	136886	Dumbledore	213	“ An easy mistake to make , ”
136889	136919	136886	136886	Dumbledore	213	“ I expect you ’ll tire of hearing it , but you do look extraordinarily like James . Except for the eyes ... you have your mother ’s eyes . ”
136925	136935	136936	136936	he	121	“ It was stupid , thinking it was him , ”
136939	136949	136936	136936	he	121	“ I mean , I knew he was dead . ”
136950	137017	137027	137027	Dumbledore	213	“ You think the dead we have loved ever truly leave us ? You think that we do n’t recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble ? Your father is alive in you , Harry , and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him . How else could you produce that particular Patronus ? Prongs rode again last night . ”
137031	137044	137046	137046	Dumbledore	213	“ Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi , ”
137050	137106	137046	137046	Dumbledore	213	“ An extraordinary achievement — not least , keeping it quiet from me . And then I remembered the most unusual form your Patronus took , when it charged Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match against Ravenclaw . So you did see your father last night , Harry ... You found him inside yourself . ”
137235	137259	137260	137260	he	147	“ If I manage to get into the Ministry , I ’ll have a lot of proposals to make about Magical Law Enforcement ! ”
137349	137359	137361	137362	Seamus Finnigan	187	“ Wonder what they ’ll give us next year ? ”
137365	137370	137372	137373	Dean Thomas	181	“ Maybe a vampire , ”
137791	137813	137929	137929	She	133	“ I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning , just before breakfast . I ’ve decided to drop Muggle Studies . ”
137814	137827	137829	137829	Ron	151	“ But you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent ! ”
137831	137835	137837	137837	Hermione	133	“ I know , ”
137839	137885	137837	137837	Hermione	133	“ but I ca n’t stand another year like this one . That Time - Turner , it was driving me mad . I ’ve handed it in . Without Muggle Studies and Divination , I ’ll be able to have a normal schedule again . ”
137886	137900	137902	137902	Ron	151	“ I still ca n’t believe you did n’t tell us about it , ”
137905	137914	137902	137902	Ron	151	“ We ’re supposed to be your friends . ”
137915	137924	137926	137926	Hermione	133	“ I promised I would n’t tell anyone , ”
137956	137964	137966	137966	Hermione	133	“ Oh , cheer up , Harry ! ”
137969	137974	137976	137976	Harry	121	“ I ’m okay , ”
137979	137986	137976	137976	Harry	121	“ Just thinking about the holidays . ”
137987	137998	138000	138000	Ron	151	“ Yeah , I ’ve been thinking about them too , ”
138002	138040	138000	138000	Ron	151	“ Harry , you ’ve got to come and stay with us . I ’ll fix it up with Mum and Dad , then I ’ll call you . I know how to use a fellytone now — ”
138041	138047	138049	138049	Hermione	133	“ A telephone , Ron , ”
138051	138062	138049	138049	Hermione	133	“ Honestly , you should take Muggle Studies next year ... ”
138067	138103	138063	138063	Ron	151	“ It ’s the Quidditch World Cup this summer ! How about it , Harry ? Come and stay , and we ’ll go and see it ! Dad can usually get tickets from work . ”
138117	138140	138063	138063	Ron	151	“ Yeah ... I bet the Dursleys’d be pleased to let me come ... especially after what I did to Aunt Marge ... ”
138201	138204	138206	138206	Hermione	133	“ Harry , ”
138214	138223	138206	138206	Hermione	133	“ What ’s that thing outside your window ? ”
138421	138427	138412	138412	He	121	“ It ’s from Sirius ! ”
138428	138431	138433	138433	Ron	151	“ What ? ”
138438	138443	138433	138433	Ron	151	“ Read it aloud ! ”
138444	138447	138448	138448	I	0	“ Dear Harry ,
138597	138598	138591	138591	I	0	” .
138599	138602	138604	138604	Hermione	133	“ Ha ! ”
138607	138618	138604	138604	Hermione	133	“ See ! I told you it was from him ! ”
138619	138632	138634	138634	Ron	151	“ Yes , but he had n’t jinxed it , had he ? ”
138636	138639	138634	138634	Ron	151	“ Ouch ! ”
138640	138668	138604	138604	Hermione	133	“ The tiny owl , now hooting happily in his hand , had nibbled one of his fingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way .
138812	138813	138811	138811	Sirius	155	” .
138876	138885	138887	138887	Harry	121	“ That ’ll be good enough for Dumbledore ! ”
138898	138930	138890	138890	He	121	“ Hang on , there ’s a P.S ... I thought your friend Ron might like to keep this owl , as it ’s my fault he no longer has a rat ”
138945	138949	138950	138950	he	151	“ Keep him ? ”
138984	138989	138990	138990	Ron	151	“ What d’you reckon ? ”
138995	139000	138990	138990	Ron	151	“ Definitely an owl ? ”
139004	139012	139014	139014	Ron	151	“ That ’s good enough for me , ”
139017	139022	139014	139014	Ron	151	“ He ’s mine . ”
139109	139118	139119	139119	Ron	151	“ I ’ll call about the World Cup ! ”
139156	139161	139162	139162	he	127	“ What ’s that ? ”
139177	139193	139162	139162	he	127	“ If it ’s another form for me to sign , you ’ve got another — ”
139194	139199	139201	139201	Harry	121	“ It ’s not , ”
139204	139213	139201	139201	Harry	121	“ It ’s a letter from my godfather . ”
139214	139217	139219	139220	Uncle Vernon	127	“ Godfather ? ”
139222	139230	139219	139220	Uncle Vernon	127	“ You have n’t got a godfather ! ”
139231	139237	139239	139239	Harry	121	“ Yes , I have , ”
139242	139297	139239	139239	Harry	121	“ He was my mum and dad ’s best friend . He ’s a convicted murderer , but he ’s broken out of Wizard prison and he ’s on the run . He likes to keep in touch with me , though ... keep up with my news ... check if I ’m happy ... ”
