8	13	0	4	The villagers of Little Hangleton	591	“ the Riddle House , ”
98	101	88	90	The Little Hangletons	165	“ creepy . ”
237	256	217	218	The maid	608	“ Lying there with their eyes wide open ! Cold as ice ! Still in their dinner things ! ”
425	428	430	431	several people	624	“ Frank ! ”
433	436	430	431	several people	624	“ Never ! ”
508	515	516	516	she	630	“ Always thought he was odd , ”
528	562	516	516	she	630	“ Unfriendly , like . I ’m sure if I ’ve offered him a cuppa once , I ’ve offered it a hundred times . Never wanted to mix , he did n’t . ”
563	568	570	574	a woman at the bar	632	“ Ah , now , ”
576	597	570	574	a woman at the bar	632	“ he had a hard war , Frank . He likes the quiet life . That ’s no reason to — ”
598	611	613	614	the cook	630	“ Who else had a key to the back door , then ? ”
616	665	613	614	the cook	630	“ There ’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener ’s cottage far back as I can remember ! Nobody forced the door last night ! No broken windows ! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping ... ”
672	687	689	693	a man at the bar	635	“ I always thought he had a nasty look about him , right enough , ”
695	706	708	709	the landlord	636	“ War turned him funny , if you ask me , ”
711	733	735	740	an excited woman in the corner	637	“ Told you I would n’t like to get on the wrong side of Frank , did n’t I , Dot ? ”
742	746	748	748	Dot	170	“ Horrible temper , ”
753	763	748	748	Dot	170	“ I remember , when he was a kid ... ”
1101	1123	1125	1125	Dot	170	“ ’S far as I ’m concerned , he killed them , and I do n’t care what the police say , ”
1131	1153	1125	1125	Dot	170	“ And if he had any decency , he ’d leave here , knowing as how we knows he did it . ”
1253	1257	1243	1243	they	669	“ tax reasons , ”
1996	2015	1981	1982	a man	704	“ There is a little more in the bottle , my Lord , if you are still hungry . ”
2016	2019	2029	2030	a man	704	“ Later , ”
2068	2078	2079	2079	Frank	169	“ Move me closer to the fire , Wormtail . ”
2174	2179	2181	2183	the cold voice	708	“ Where is Nagini ? ”
2185	2196	2198	2200	the first voice	709	“ I — I do n’t know , my Lord , ”
2203	2215	2198	2200	the first voice	709	“ She set out to explore the house , I think ... ”
2216	2227	2229	2231	the second voice	710	“ You will milk her before we retire , Wormtail , ”
2233	2249	2229	2231	the second voice	710	“ I will need feeding in the night . The journey has tired me greatly . ”
2282	2298	2275	2277	the man called	711	“ My Lord , may I ask how long we are going to stay here ? ”
2299	2303	2305	2307	the cold voice	708	“ A week , ”
2309	2341	2305	2307	the cold voice	708	“ Perhaps longer . The place is moderately comfortable , and the plan can not proceed yet . It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over . ”
2370	2373	2305	2307	the cold voice	708	“ Quidditch , ”
2382	2393	2395	2395	Wormtail	171	“ The — the Quidditch World Cup , my Lord ? ”
2410	2432	2398	2398	Frank	169	“ Forgive me , but — I do not understand — why should we wait until the World Cup is over ? ”
2433	2500	2501	2501	Frank	169	“ Because , fool , at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world , and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty , on the watch for signs of unusual activity , checking and double - checking identities . They will be obsessed with security , lest the Muggles notice anything . So we wait . ”
2516	2521	2510	2510	He	169	“ Ministry of Magic , ”
2522	2525	2501	2501	Frank	169	“ wizards , ”
2527	2530	2501	2501	Frank	169	“ Muggles . ”
2578	2587	2588	2588	Wormtail	171	“ Your Lordship is still determined , then ? ”
2592	2600	2588	2588	Wormtail	171	“ Certainly I am determined , Wormtail . ”
2647	2659	2634	2634	he	171	“ It could be done without Harry Potter , my Lord . ”
2669	2674	2676	2678	the second voice	710	“ Without Harry Potter ? ”
2681	2685	2676	2678	the second voice	710	“ I see ... ”
2686	2702	2704	2704	Wormtail	171	“ My Lord , I do not say this out of concern for the boy ! ”
2711	2788	2704	2704	Wormtail	171	“ The boy is nothing to me , nothing at all ! It is merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard — any wizard — the thing could be done so much more quickly ! If you allowed me to leave you for a short while — you know that I can disguise myself most effectively — I could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person — ”
2789	2796	2798	2800	the cold voice	708	“ I could use another wizard , ”
2803	2808	2798	2800	the cold voice	708	“ that is true ... ”
2809	2817	2819	2819	Wormtail	171	“ My Lord , it makes sense , ”
2826	2843	2819	2819	Wormtail	171	“ Laying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult , he is so well protected — ”
2844	2891	2798	2800	the cold voice	708	“ And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute ? I wonder ... perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you , Wormtail ? Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me ? ”
2892	2910	2798	2800	the cold voice	708	“ My Lord ! I — I have no wish to leave you , none at all — ”
2911	2918	2920	2922	the second voice	710	“ Do not lie to me ! ”
2924	2964	2920	2922	the second voice	710	“ I can always tell , Wormtail ! You are regretting that you ever returned to me . I revolt you . I see you flinch when you look at me , feel you shudder when you touch me ... ”
2965	2974	2798	2800	the cold voice	708	“ No ! My devotion to Your Lordship — ”
2975	3019	2798	2800	the cold voice	708	“ Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice . You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go . How am I to survive without you , when I need feeding every few hours ? Who is to milk Nagini ? ”
3020	3031	2920	2922	the second voice	710	“ But you seem so much stronger , my Lord — ”
3032	3035	3037	3039	the second voice	710	“ Liar , ”
3041	3072	3037	3039	the second voice	710	“ I am no stronger , and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained under your clumsy care . Silence ! ”
3117	3205	3101	3103	the second man	720	“ I have my reasons for using the boy , as I have already explained to you , and I will use no other . I have waited thirteen years . A few more months will make no difference . As for the protection surrounding the boy , I believe my plan will be effective . All that is needed is a little courage from you , Wormtail — courage you will find , unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord Voldemort ’s wrath — ”
3206	3214	3216	3216	Wormtail	171	“ My Lord , I must speak ! ”
3224	3262	3216	3216	Wormtail	171	“ All through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head — my Lord , Bertha Jorkins ’s disappearance will not go unnoticed for long , and if we proceed , if I murder — ”
3263	3266	3268	3270	the second voice	710	“ If ? ”
3272	3357	3268	3270	the second voice	710	“ If ? If you follow the plan , Wormtail , the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died . You will do it quietly and without fuss ; I only wish that I could do it myself , but in my present condition ... Come , Wormtail , one more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear . I am not asking you to do it alone . By that time , my faithful servant will have rejoined us — ”
3358	3365	3367	3367	Wormtail	171	“ I am a faithful servant , ”
3378	3403	3375	3375	his	171	“ Wormtail , I need somebody with brains , somebody whose loyalty has never wavered , and you , unfortunately , fulfill neither requirement . ”
3404	3409	3411	3411	Wormtail	171	“ I found you , ”
3425	3440	3421	3421	his	171	“ I was the one who found you . I brought you Bertha Jorkins . ”
3441	3446	3448	3450	the second man	720	“ That is true , ”
3455	3495	3448	3450	the second man	720	“ A stroke of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you , Wormtail — though , if truth be told , you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her , were you ? ”
3496	3509	3515	3517	the second voice	710	“ I — I thought she might be useful , my Lord — ”
3510	3513	3515	3517	the second voice	710	“ Liar , ”
3528	3590	3515	3517	the second voice	710	“ However , I do not deny that her information was invaluable . Without it , I could never have formed our plan , and for that , you will have your reward , Wormtail . I will allow you to perform an essential task for me , one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform ... ”
3591	3602	3603	3603	Wormtail	171	“ R - really , my Lord ? What — ? ”
3608	3651	3603	3603	Wormtail	171	“ Ah , Wormtail , you do n’t want me to spoil the surprise ? Your part will come at the very end ... but I promise you , you will have the honor of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins . ”
3652	3657	3515	3517	the second voice	710	“ You ... you ... ”
3674	3685	3515	3517	the second voice	710	“ You ... are going ... to kill me too ? ”
3686	3691	3693	3695	the cold voice	708	“ Wormtail , Wormtail , ”
3698	3777	3693	3695	the cold voice	708	“ why would I kill you ? I killed Bertha because I had to . She was fit for nothing after my questioning , quite useless . In any case , awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays . Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns ... ”
3808	3855	3793	3795	the second man	720	“ We could have modified her memory ? But Memory Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard , as I proved when I questioned her . It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her , Wormtail . ”
3995	4036	4038	4040	the second man	720	“ One more murder ... my faithful servant at Hogwarts ... Harry Potter is as good as mine , Wormtail . It is decided . There will be no more argument . But quiet ... I think I hear Nagini ... ”
4383	4391	4374	4376	the cold voice	708	“ Nagini has interesting news , Wormtail , ”
4395	4403	4405	4405	Wormtail	171	“ In - indeed , my Lord ? ”
4407	4412	4374	4376	the cold voice	708	“ Indeed , yes , ”
4417	4440	4374	4376	the cold voice	708	“ According to Nagini , there is an old Muggle standing right outside this room , listening to every word we say . ”
4499	4511	4496	4496	his	744	“ Invite him inside , Wormtail . Where are your manners ? ”
4642	4649	4651	4653	the cold voice	708	“ You heard everything , Muggle ? ”
4655	4664	4666	4666	Frank	169	“ What ’s that you ’re calling me ? ”
4703	4711	4713	4714	the voice	752	“ I am calling you a Muggle , ”
4717	4727	4713	4714	the voice	752	“ It means that you are not a wizard . ”
4728	4739	4741	4741	Frank	169	“ I do n’t know what you mean by wizard , ”
4748	4784	4785	4785	he	169	“ All I know is I ’ve heard enough to interest the police tonight , I have . You ’ve done murder and you ’re planning more ! And I ’ll tell you this too , ”
4793	4810	4785	4785	he	169	“ my wife knows I ’m up here , and if I do n’t come back — ”
4811	4817	4819	4821	the cold voice	708	“ You have no wife , ”
4826	4858	4819	4821	the cold voice	708	“ Nobody knows you are here . You told nobody that you were coming . Do not lie to Lord Voldemort , Muggle , for he knows ... he always knows ... ”
4859	4864	4866	4866	Frank	169	“ Is that right ? ”
4869	4904	4866	4866	Frank	169	“ Lord , is it ? Well , I do n’t think much of your manners , my Lord . Turn ’ round and face me like a man , why do n’t you ? ”
4905	4915	4819	4821	the cold voice	708	“ But I am not a man , Muggle , ”
4931	4960	4819	4821	the cold voice	708	“ I am much , much more than a man . However ... why not ? I will face you ... Wormtail , come turn my chair around . ”
4967	4974	4978	4978	his	754	“ You heard me , Wormtail . ”
6816	6855	6802	6803	Hermione Granger	178	“ Your scar hurt ? Harry , that ’s really serious ... Write to Professor Dumbledore ! And I ’ll go and check Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions ... Maybe there ’s something in there about curse scars ... ”
7129	7195	7107	7107	Ron	188	“ Your scar hurt ? But ... but You - Know - Who ca n’t be near you now , can he ? I mean ... you ’d know , would n’t you ? He ’d be trying to do you in again , would n’t he ? I dunno , Harry , maybe curse scars always twinge a bit ... I ’ll ask Dad ... ”
8589	8597	8601	8601	her	184	“ There you are , Diddy darling , ”
8668	8683	8664	8665	Uncle Vernon	183	“ he did n’t want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway . ”
8696	8712	8713	8714	Aunt Petunia	184	“ He ’s a boisterous little boy , but he would n’t hurt a fly ! ”
8949	8953	8946	8947	Uncle Vernon	183	“ rabbit food . ”
9294	9299	9300	9300	he	183	“ Is this it ? ”
9490	9493	9494	9494	he	183	“ You , ”
9499	9507	9494	9494	he	183	“ In the living room . Now . ”
9551	9554	9555	9555	he	183	“ So , ”
9579	9582	9555	9555	he	183	“ So . ”
9592	9596	9583	9583	Harry	447	“ So what ? ”
9637	9642	9644	9645	Uncle Vernon	183	“ This just arrived , ”
9658	9665	9647	9647	He	183	“ A letter . About you . ”
9947	9952	9953	9953	he	183	“ Look at this , ”
10010	10020	10022	10022	Harry	447	“ She did put enough stamps on , then , ”
10045	10050	10051	10051	he	183	“ The postman noticed , ”
10057	10086	10051	10051	he	183	“ Very interested to know where this letter came from , he was . That ’s why he rang the doorbell . Seemed to think it was funny . ”
10219	10227	10228	10228	he	447	“ So — can I go then ? ”
10355	10361	10362	10362	he	447	“ Who is this woman ? ”
10372	10378	10380	10380	Harry	447	“ You ’ve seen her , ”
10382	10410	10411	10411	He	447	“ She ’s my friend Ron ’s mother , she was meeting him off the Hog — off the school train at the end of last term . ”
10415	10419	10411	10411	He	447	“ Hogwarts Express , ”
10465	10471	10472	10472	he	183	“ Dumpy sort of woman ? ”
10476	10484	10472	10472	he	183	“ Load of children with red hair ? ”
10501	10504	10488	10488	He	447	“ dumpy , ”
10544	10547	10548	10548	he	183	“ Quidditch , ”
10554	10562	10548	10548	he	183	“ Quidditch — what is this rubbish ? ”
10571	10577	10578	10578	he	447	“ It ’s a sport , ”
10582	10587	10578	10578	he	447	“ Played on broom — ”
10588	10595	10597	10598	Uncle Vernon	183	“ All right , all right ! ”
10626	10628	10645	10645	his	183	“ broomsticks ”
10650	10661	10662	10662	He	447	“ send us your answer ... in the normal way . ”
10665	10677	10678	10678	he	447	“ What does she mean , ‘ the normal way ’ ? ”
10681	10686	10688	10688	Harry	447	“ Normal for us , ”
10701	10716	10698	10698	he	447	“ you know , owl post . That ’s what ’s normal for wizards . ”
10762	10781	10782	10782	he	183	“ How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof ? ”
10793	10811	10782	10782	he	183	“ You stand there , in the clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back — ”
10812	10820	10822	10822	Harry	447	“ Only after Dudley finished with them , ”
10871	10881	10883	10884	Uncle Vernon	183	“ I will not be spoken to like that ! ”
10966	11003	10955	10955	Harry	447	“ Okay , I ca n’t see the World Cup . Can I go now , then ? Only I ’ve got a letter to Sirius I want to finish . You know — my godfather . ”
11040	11053	11055	11056	Uncle Vernon	183	“ You ’re — you ’re writing to him , are you ? ”
11081	11086	11088	11088	Harry	447	“ Well — yeah , ”
11092	11122	11088	11088	Harry	447	“ It ’s been a while since he heard from me , and , you know , if he does n’t , he might start thinking something ’s wrong . ”
11250	11333	11340	11340	Harry	447	“ Well , all right then . You can go to this ruddy ... this stupid ... this World Cup thing . You write and tell these — these Weasleys they ’re to pick you up , mind . I have n’t got time to go dropping you off all over the country . And you can spend the rest of the summer there . And you can tell your — your godfather ... tell him ... tell him you ’re going . ”
11334	11338	11340	11340	Harry	447	“ Okay then , ”
11426	11437	11439	11439	Harry	447	“ That was an excellent breakfast , was n’t it ? ”
11441	11451	11439	11439	Harry	447	“ I feel really full , do n’t you ? ”
11532	11535	11537	11537	Harry	447	“ OUCH ! ”
11694	11697	11689	11689	Harry	447	“ Pig , ”
11871	11875	11876	11876	Harry	447	“ Calm down ! ”
11908	11921	11876	11876	Harry	447	“ Come here , I need you to take my answer back ! ”
12054	12062	12063	12063	he	447	“ Feeling up to a long journey ? ”
12077	12087	12088	12088	he	447	“ Can you take this to Sirius for me ? ”
12096	12107	12088	12088	he	447	“ Hang on ... I just want to finish it . ”
12184	12199	12200	12200	Harry	447	“ I ’ll be at Ron ’s when you get back , all right ? ”
12516	12529	12530	12530	he	183	“ I hope you told them to dress properly , these people , ”
12535	12563	12530	12530	he	183	“ I ’ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear . They ’d better have the decency to put on normal clothes , that ’s all . ”
12587	12590	12583	12584	the Dursleys	185	“ normal . ”
12871	12880	12849	12849	she	184	“ They ’ll be driving , of course ? ”
12888	12891	12893	12893	Harry	447	“ Er , ”
12960	12965	12967	12967	Harry	447	“ I think so , ”
13215	13220	13221	13221	he	183	“ They ’re late ! ”
13226	13230	13232	13232	Harry	447	“ I know , ”
13234	13247	13232	13232	Harry	447	“ Maybe — er — the traffic ’s bad , or something . ”
13287	13293	13276	13277	Aunt Petunia	184	“ No consideration at all . ”
13294	13302	13337	13337	him	183	“ We might ’ve had an engagement . ”
13303	13318	13331	13332	Uncle Vernon	183	“ Maybe they think they ’ll get invited to dinner if they ’re late . ”
13319	13329	13331	13332	Uncle Vernon	183	“ Well , they most certainly wo n’t be , ”
13347	13406	13407	13407	Harry	447	“ They ’ll take the boy and go , there ’ll be no hanging around . That ’s if they ’re coming at all . Probably mistaken the day . I daresay their kind do n’t set much store by punctuality . Either that or they drive some tin - pot car that ’s broken d — AAAAAAAARRRRRGH ! ”
13449	13453	13455	13455	Harry	447	“ What happened ? ”
13457	13463	13455	13455	Harry	447	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
13526	13531	13533	13534	Aunt Petunia	184	“ What is it ? ”
13552	13559	13533	13534	Aunt Petunia	184	“ What is it , Vernon ? ”
13581	13625	13743	13743	He	447	“ Ouch ! Fred , no — go back , go back , there ’s been some kind of mistake — tell George not to — OUCH ! George , no , there ’s no room , go back quickly and tell Ron — ”
13626	13645	13743	13743	He	447	“ Maybe Harry can hear us , Dad — maybe he ’ll be able to let us out — ”
13661	13671	13672	13673	The Dursleys	185	“ Harry ? Harry , can you hear us ? ”
13684	13689	13691	13692	Uncle Vernon	183	“ What is this ? ”
13694	13700	13691	13692	Uncle Vernon	183	“ What ’s going on ? ”
13701	13714	13716	13716	Harry	447	“ They — they ’ve tried to get here by Floo powder , ”
13725	13742	13743	13743	He	447	“ They can travel by fire — only you ’ve blocked the fireplace — hang on — ”
13753	13762	13743	13743	He	447	“ Mr. Weasley ? Can you hear me ? ”
13774	13777	13767	13771	Somebody inside the chimney piece	956	“ Shh ! ”
13778	13803	13767	13771	Somebody inside the chimney piece	956	“ Mr. Weasley , it ’s Harry ... the fireplace has been blocked up . You wo n’t be able to get through there . ”
13804	13807	13809	13810	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Damn ! ”
13814	13828	13809	13810	Mr. Weasley	190	“ What on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for ? ”
13829	13837	13838	13838	Harry	447	“ They ’ve got an electric fire , ”
13841	13844	13846	13847	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Really ? ”
13852	13877	13878	13878	Ron	188	“ Eclectic , you say ? With a plug ? Gracious , I must see that ... Let ’s think ... ouch , Ron ! ”
13887	13899	13878	13878	Ron	188	“ What are we doing here ? Has something gone wrong ? ”
13900	13906	13908	13908	Fred	192	“ Oh no , Ron , ”
13915	13928	13908	13908	Fred	192	“ No , this is exactly where we wanted to end up . ”
13929	13942	13944	13944	George	193	“ Yeah , we ’re having the time of our lives here , ”
13960	13965	13967	13968	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Boys , boys ... ”
13971	13991	13967	13968	Mr. Weasley	190	“ I ’m trying to think what to do ... Yes ... only way ... Stand back , Harry . ”
14006	14011	14012	14012	he	183	“ Wait a moment ! ”
14018	14026	14012	14012	he	183	“ What exactly are you going to — ”
14115	14120	14122	14123	Mr. Weasley	190	“ That ’s better , ”
14137	14149	14157	14157	he	183	“ Ah — you must be Harry ’s aunt and uncle ! ”
14215	14224	14226	14227	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Er — yes — sorry about that , ”
14242	14365	14230	14230	his	190	“ It ’s all my fault . It just did n’t occur to me that we would n’t be able to get out at the other end . I had your fireplace connected to the Floo Network , you see — just for an afternoon , you know , so we could get Harry . Muggle fireplaces are n’t supposed to be connected , strictly speaking — but I ’ve got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel and he fixed it for me . I can put it right in a jiffy , though , do n’t worry . I ’ll light a fire to send the boys back , and then I can repair your fireplace before I Disapparate . ”
14404	14409	14411	14412	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Hello , Harry ! ”
14415	14421	14411	14412	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Got your trunk ready ? ”
14422	14427	14429	14429	Harry	447	“ It ’s upstairs , ”
14434	14440	14442	14442	Fred	192	“ We ’ll get it , ”
14501	14504	14506	14507	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Well , ”
14527	14540	14515	14515	he	190	“ Very — erm — very nice place you ’ve got here . ”
14627	14636	14637	14637	he	190	“ They run off eckeltricity , do they ? ”
14641	14655	14656	14656	he	190	“ Ah yes , I can see the plugs . I collect plugs , ”
14662	14686	14656	14656	he	190	“ And batteries . Got a very large collection of batteries . My wife thinks I ’m mad , but there you are . ”
14806	14819	14821	14822	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Ah , this is your cousin , is it , Harry ? ”
14832	14835	14837	14837	Harry	447	“ Yep , ”
14839	14844	14837	14837	Harry	447	“ that ’s Dudley . ”
14940	14948	14949	14949	he	190	“ Having a good holiday , Dudley ? ”
15000	15005	15007	15008	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Ah , right , ”
15010	15016	15017	15017	He	190	“ Better get cracking then . ”
15043	15046	15048	15049	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Incendio ! ”
15121	15129	15131	15132	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Off you go then , Fred , ”
15134	15137	15139	15139	Fred	192	“ Coming , ”
15141	15148	15139	15139	Fred	192	“ Oh no — hang on — ”
15209	15213	15214	15215	Aunt Petunia	184	“ the Burrow ! ”
15232	15238	15240	15241	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Right then , George , ”
15243	15249	15250	15250	Harry	447	“ you and the trunk . ”
15284	15288	15281	15281	George	193	“ the Burrow ! ”
15293	15299	15301	15302	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Ron , you next , ”
15304	15308	15310	15310	Ron	188	“ See you , ”
15329	15333	15316	15316	He	188	“ the Burrow ! ”
15345	15351	15352	15352	Harry	447	“ Well ... ’bye then , ”
15403	15412	15413	15413	he	190	“ Harry said good - bye to you , ”
15416	15423	15413	15413	he	190	“ Did n’t you hear him ? ”
15424	15430	15431	15431	Harry	447	“ It does n’t matter , ”
15437	15445	15431	15431	Harry	447	“ Honestly , I do n’t care . ”
15458	15471	15472	15472	he	190	“ You are n’t going to see your nephew till next summer , ”
15481	15492	15472	15472	he	190	“ Surely you ’re going to say good - bye ? ”
15556	15563	15550	15550	he	183	“ Good - bye , then . ”
15564	15568	15570	15570	Harry	447	“ See you , ”
15750	15761	15762	15762	he	190	“ Not to worry , I can sort him out ! ”
15794	15799	15801	15802	Mr. Weasley	190	“ No , really ! ”
15805	15848	15801	15802	Mr. Weasley	190	“ It ’s a simple process — it was the toffee — my son Fred — real practical joker — but it ’s only an Engorgement Charm — at least , I think it is — please , I can correct it — ”
15939	15943	15945	15946	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Now really ! ”
15953	15960	15950	15950	his	190	“ I ’m trying to help ! ”
15974	15982	15967	15968	Uncle Vernon	183	“ Harry , go ! Just go ! ”
15993	16000	15983	15984	Mr. Weasley	190	“ I ’ll sort this out ! ”
16050	16054	16048	16048	he	447	“ the Burrow ! ”
16202	16208	16210	16210	Fred	192	“ Did he eat it ? ”
16224	16227	16229	16229	Harry	447	“ Yeah , ”
16234	16239	16229	16229	Harry	447	“ What was it ? ”
16240	16246	16248	16248	Fred	192	“ Ton - Tongue Toffee , ”
16251	16272	16248	16248	Fred	192	“ George and I invented them , and we ’ve been looking for someone to test them on all summer ... ”
16327	16335	16340	16341	the two	980	“ How ’re you doing , Harry ? ”
16632	16640	16641	16641	he	190	“ That was n’t funny , Fred ! ”
16644	16655	16641	16641	he	190	“ What on earth did you give that Muggle boy ? ”
16656	16664	16666	16666	Fred	192	“ I did n’t give him anything , ”
16673	16695	16666	16666	Fred	192	“ I just dropped it ... It was his fault he went and ate it , I never told him to . ”
16696	16703	16705	16706	Mr. Weasley	190	“ You dropped it on purpose ! ”
16708	16724	16705	16706	Mr. Weasley	190	“ You knew he ’d eat it , you knew he was on a diet — ”
16725	16733	16734	16734	George	193	“ How big did his tongue get ? ”
16738	16753	16734	16734	George	193	“ It was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it ! ”
16763	16769	16756	16757	the Weasleys	194	“ It is n’t funny ! ”
16774	16803	16770	16771	Mr. Weasley	190	“ That sort of behavior seriously undermines wizard – Muggle relations ! I spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of Muggles , and my own sons — ”
16804	16818	16820	16820	Fred	192	“ We did n’t give it to him because he ’s a Muggle ! ”
16823	16839	16841	16841	George	193	“ No , we gave it to him because he ’s a great bullying git , ”
16843	16850	16841	16841	George	193	“ Is n’t he , Harry ? ”
16851	16860	16862	16862	Harry	447	“ Yeah , he is , Mr. Weasley , ”
16865	16872	16862	16862	Harry	447	“ That ’s not the point ! ”
16877	16886	16874	16875	Mr. Weasley	190	“ You wait until I tell your mother — ”
16887	16892	16907	16907	She	191	“ Tell me what ? ”
16929	16937	16938	16938	she	191	“ Oh hello , Harry , dear , ”
16955	16962	16947	16947	her	191	“ Tell me what , Arthur ? ”
17095	17102	17079	17079	she	213	“ Tell me what , Arthur ? ”
17114	17121	17103	17104	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ It ’s nothing , Molly , ”
17126	17140	17123	17124	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Fred and George just — but I ’ve had words with them — ”
17141	17149	17151	17152	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ What have they done this time ? ”
17154	17168	17151	17152	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ If it ’s got anything to do with Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes — ”
17169	17183	17185	17185	Hermione	178	“ Why do n’t you show Harry where he ’s sleeping , Ron ? ”
17190	17198	17200	17200	Ron	188	“ He knows where he ’s sleeping , ”
17202	17212	17200	17200	Ron	188	“ in my room , he slept there last — ”
17213	17219	17221	17221	Hermione	178	“ We can all go , ”
17224	17227	17229	17229	Ron	188	“ Oh , ”
17234	17237	17229	17229	Ron	188	“ Right . ”
17238	17246	17248	17248	George	193	“ Yeah , we ’ll come too , ”
17250	17257	17248	17248	George	193	“ You stay where you are ! ”
17299	17307	17308	17308	Harry	447	“ What are Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes ? ”
17325	17343	17345	17345	Ron	188	“ Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George ’s room , ”
17348	17389	17345	17345	Ron	188	“ Great long price lists for stuff they ’ve invented . Joke stuff , you know . Fake wands and trick sweets , loads of stuff . It was brilliant , I never knew they ’d been inventing all that ... ”
17390	17413	17415	17415	Ginny	213	“ We ’ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages , but we never thought they were actually making things , ”
17417	17426	17415	17415	Ginny	213	“ We thought they just liked the noise . ”
17427	17448	17450	17450	Ron	188	“ Only , most of the stuff — well , all of it , really — was a bit dangerous , ”
17452	17516	17450	17450	Ron	188	“ and , you know , they were planning to sell it at Hogwarts to make some money , and Mum went mad at them . Told them they were n’t allowed to make any more of it , and burned all the order forms ... She ’s furious at them anyway . They did n’t get as many O.W.L.s as she expected . ”
17534	17543	17544	17544	Ginny	213	“ And then there was this big row , ”
17547	17577	17544	17544	Ginny	213	“ because Mum wants them to go into the Ministry of Magic like Dad , and they told her all they want to do is open a joke shop . ”
17604	17609	17611	17611	Harry	447	“ Hi , Percy , ”
17613	17619	17621	17621	Percy	206	“ Oh hello , Harry , ”
17623	17673	17621	17621	Percy	206	“ I was wondering who was making all the noise . I ’m trying to work in here , you know — I ’ve got a report to finish for the office — and it ’s rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs . ”
17674	17680	17682	17682	Ron	188	“ We ’re not thundering , ”
17685	17706	17682	17682	Ron	188	“ We ’re walking . Sorry if we ’ve disturbed the top - secret workings of the Ministry of Magic . ”
17707	17714	17716	17716	Harry	447	“ What are you working on ? ”
17718	17729	17731	17731	Percy	206	“ A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation , ”
17734	17769	17731	17731	Percy	206	“ We ’re trying to standardize cauldron thickness . Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin — leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year — ”
17770	17781	17783	17783	Ron	188	“ That ’ll change the world , that report will , ”
17785	17799	17783	17783	Ron	188	“ Front page of the Daily Prophet , I expect , cauldron leaks . ”
17805	17812	17813	17813	he	206	“ You might sneer , Ron , ”
17817	17845	17813	17813	he	206	“ but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy , shallow - bottomed products that seriously endanger — ”
17846	17854	17856	17856	Ron	188	“ Yeah , yeah , all right , ”
18031	18037	18039	18039	Ron	188	“ Shut up , Pig , ”
18058	18077	18078	18078	he	188	“ Fred and George are in here with us , because Bill and Charlie are in their room , ”
18082	18099	18078	18078	he	188	“ Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he ’s got to work . ”
18100	18111	18112	18112	Harry	447	“ Er — why are you calling that owl Pig ? ”
18116	18123	18125	18125	Ginny	213	“ Because he ’s being stupid , ”
18127	18134	18125	18125	Ginny	213	“ Its proper name is Pigwidgeon . ”
18135	18148	18150	18150	Ron	188	“ Yeah , and that ’s not a stupid name at all , ”
18153	18158	18159	18159	he	188	“ Ginny named him , ”
18164	18222	18159	18159	he	188	“ She reckons it ’s sweet . And I tried to change it , but it was too late , he wo n’t answer to anything else . So now he ’s Pig . I ’ve got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes . He annoys me too , come to that . ”
18272	18277	18278	18278	Harry	447	“ Where ’s Crookshanks ? ”
18283	18292	18293	18293	she	178	“ Out in the garden , I expect , ”
18296	18309	18293	18293	she	178	“ He likes chasing gnomes . He ’s never seen any before . ”
18310	18318	18320	18320	Harry	447	“ Percy ’s enjoying work , then ? ”
18345	18349	18351	18351	Ron	188	“ Enjoying it ? ”
18354	18422	18351	18351	Ron	188	“ I do n’t reckon he ’d come home if Dad did n’t make him . He ’s obsessed . Just do n’t get him onto the subject of his boss . According to Mr. Crouch ... as I was saying to Mr. Crouch ... Mr. Crouch is of the opinion ... Mr. Crouch was telling me ... They ’ll be announcing their engagement any day now . ”
18423	18433	18435	18435	Hermione	178	“ Have you had a good summer , Harry ? ”
18437	18447	18435	18435	Hermione	178	“ Did you get our food parcels and everything ? ”
18448	18455	18457	18457	Harry	447	“ Yeah , thanks a lot , ”
18459	18468	18457	18457	Harry	447	“ They saved my life , those cakes . ”
18469	18477	18478	18478	Ron	188	“ And have you heard from — ? ”
18565	18573	18575	18575	Hermione	178	“ I think they ’ve stopped arguing , ”
18593	18605	18584	18584	Ginny	213	“ Shall we go down and help your mum with dinner ? ”
18606	18612	18614	18614	Ron	188	“ Yeah , all right , ”
18643	18652	18653	18653	she	191	“ We ’re eating out in the garden , ”
18660	18699	18700	18700	she	191	“ There ’s just not room for eleven people in here . Could you take the plates outside , girls ? Bill and Charlie are setting up the tables . Knives and forks , please , you two , ”
18744	18751	18752	18752	she	191	“ Oh for heaven ’s sake , ”
18780	18784	18785	18785	she	191	“ Those two ! ”
18809	18842	18785	18785	she	191	“ I do n’t know what ’s going to happen to them , I really do n’t . No ambition , unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly can ... ”
18878	18890	18891	18891	she	191	“ It ’s not as though they have n’t got brains , ”
18913	18974	18891	18891	she	191	“ but they ’re wasting them , and unless they pull themselves together soon , they ’ll be in real trouble . I ’ve had more owls from Hogwarts about them than the rest put together . If they carry on the way they ’re going , they ’ll end up in front of the Improper Use of Magic Office . ”
19030	19042	19049	19049	her	191	“ I do n’t know where we went wrong with them , ”
19060	19085	19086	19086	She	191	“ It ’s been the same for years , one thing after another , and they wo n’t listen to — OH NOT AGAIN ! ”
19111	19119	19120	19120	she	191	“ One of their fake wands again ! ”
19123	19138	19120	19120	she	191	“ How many times have I told them not to leave them lying around ? ”
19158	19162	19163	19163	Ron	188	“ C’m on , ”
19179	19189	19163	19163	Ron	188	“ let ’s go and help Bill and Charlie . ”
19452	19460	19461	19461	he	206	“ Will you keep it down ? ! ”
19464	19469	19471	19471	Bill	209	“ Sorry , Perce , ”
19475	19484	19471	19471	Bill	209	“ How ’re the cauldron bottoms coming on ? ”
19485	19489	19491	19491	Percy	206	“ Very badly , ”
19648	19663	19664	19664	Percy	206	“ I ’ve told Mr. Crouch that I ’ll have it ready by Tuesday , ”
19669	19748	19664	19664	Percy	206	“ That ’s a bit sooner than he expected it , but I like to keep on top of things . I think he ’ll be grateful I ’ve done it in good time , I mean , it ’s extremely busy in our department just now , what with all the arrangements for the World Cup . We ’re just not getting the support we need from the Department of Magical Games and Sports . Ludo Bagman — ”
19749	19754	19756	19757	Mr. Weasley	190	“ I like Ludo , ”
19760	19809	19756	19757	Mr. Weasley	190	“ He was the one who got us such good tickets for the Cup . I did him a bit of a favor : His brother , Otto , got into a spot of trouble — a lawnmower with unnatural powers — I smoothed the whole thing over . ”
19810	19820	19822	19822	Percy	206	“ Oh Bagman ’s likable enough , of course , ”
19825	19892	19822	19822	Percy	206	“ but how he ever got to be Head of Department ... when I compare him to Mr. Crouch ! I ca n’t see Mr. Crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out what ’s happened to them . You realize Bertha Jorkins has been missing for over a month now ? Went on holiday to Albania and never came back ? ”
19893	19903	19905	19906	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Yes , I was asking Ludo about that , ”
19910	19941	19905	19906	Mr. Weasley	190	“ He says Bertha ’s gotten lost plenty of times before now — though I must say , if it was someone in my department , I ’d be worried ... ”
19942	19951	19953	19953	Percy	206	“ Oh Bertha ’s hopeless , all right , ”
19955	20045	19953	19953	Percy	206	“ I hear she ’s been shunted from department to department for years , much more trouble than she ’s worth ... but all the same , Bagman ought to be trying to find her . Mr. Crouch has been taking a personal interest , she worked in our department at one time , you know , and I think Mr. Crouch was quite fond of her — but Bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in Australia instead of Albania . However ”
20061	20105	20047	20047	Percy	206	“ we ’ve got quite enough on our plates at the Department of International Magical Cooperation without trying to find members of other departments too . As you know , we ’ve got another big event to organize right after the World Cup . ”
20130	20142	20143	20143	He	206	“ You know the one I ’m talking about , Father . ”
20149	20156	20145	20145	his	206	“ The top - secret one . ”
20168	20197	20157	20157	Ron	188	“ He ’s been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work . Probably an exhibition of thick - bottomed cauldrons . ”
20223	20247	20205	20206	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ . . . with a horrible great fang on it . Really , Bill , what do they say at the bank ? ”
20248	20272	20274	20274	Bill	209	“ Mum , no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I bring home plenty of treasure , ”
20277	20287	20289	20290	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ And your hair ’s getting silly , dear , ”
20297	20309	20293	20293	her	191	“ I wish you ’d let me give it a trim ... ”
20310	20315	20317	20317	Ginny	213	“ I like it , ”
20325	20348	20317	20317	Ginny	213	“ You ’re so old - fashioned , Mum . Anyway , it ’s nowhere near as long as Professor Dumbledore ’s ... ”
20369	20377	20379	20379	Charlie	210	“ It ’s got to be Ireland , ”
20388	20396	20379	20379	Charlie	210	“ They flattened Peru in the semifinals . ”
20397	20406	20408	20408	Fred	192	“ Bulgaria has got Viktor Krum , though , ”
20410	20422	20424	20424	Charlie	210	“ Krum ’s one decent player , Ireland has got seven , ”
20427	20442	20424	20424	Charlie	210	“ I wish England had got through . That was embarrassing , that was . ”
20443	20447	20449	20449	Harry	447	“ What happened ? ”
20470	20483	20485	20485	Charlie	210	“ Went down to Transylvania , three hundred and ninety to ten , ”
20488	20505	20485	20485	Charlie	210	“ Shocking performance . And Wales lost to Uganda , and Scotland was slaughtered by Luxembourg . ”
20671	20681	20664	20664	he	188	“ So — have you heard from Sirius lately ? ”
20689	20692	20694	20694	Harry	447	“ Yeah , ”
20697	20719	20694	20694	Harry	447	“ twice . He sounds okay . I wrote to him yesterday . He might write back while I ’m here . ”
20782	20788	20789	20790	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Look at the time , ”
20798	20876	20789	20790	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ You really should be in bed , the whole lot of you — you ’ll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup . Harry , if you leave your school list out , I ’ll get your things for you tomorrow in Diagon Alley . I ’m getting everyone else ’s . There might not be time after the World Cup , the match went on for five days last time . ”
20877	20886	20888	20888	Harry	447	“ Wow — hope it does this time ! ”
20891	20899	20901	20901	Percy	206	“ Well , I certainly do n’t , ”
20904	20929	20901	20901	Percy	206	“ I shudder to think what the state of my in - tray would be if I was away from work for five days . ”
20930	20946	20948	20948	Fred	192	“ Yeah , someone might slip dragon dung in it again , eh , Perce ? ”
20950	20960	20962	20962	Percy	206	“ That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway ! ”
20971	20977	20962	20962	Percy	206	“ It was nothing personal ! ”
20978	20982	20983	20983	Fred	192	“ It was , ”
20995	21000	20983	20983	Fred	192	“ We sent it . ”
21026	21035	21036	21036	she	191	“ Time to go , Harry , dear , ”
21095	21101	21103	21103	Fred	192	“ ’S ’ time already ? ”
21216	21221	21222	21222	he	190	“ What d’you think ? ”
21226	21243	21222	21222	he	190	“ We ’re supposed to go incognito — do I look like a Muggle , Harry ? ”
21244	21247	21249	21249	Harry	447	“ Yeah , ”
21253	21257	21249	21249	Harry	447	“ very good . ”
21258	21271	21273	21273	George	193	“ Where ’re Bill and Charlie and Per - Per - Percy ? ”
21282	21293	21295	21296	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Well , they ’re Apparating , are n’t they ? ”
21314	21327	21295	21296	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ So they can have a bit of a lie - in . ”
21363	21371	21373	21373	Fred	192	“ So they ’re still in bed ? ”
21384	21392	21373	21373	Fred	192	“ Why ca n’t we Apparate too ? ”
21393	21408	21410	21411	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Because you ’re not of age and you have n’t passed your test , ”
21413	21422	21423	21423	She	191	“ And where have those girls got to ? ”
21437	21447	21448	21448	Harry	447	“ You have to pass a test to Apparate ? ”
21451	21455	21457	21458	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Oh yes , ”
21472	21526	21457	21458	Mr. Weasley	190	“ The Department of Magical Transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for Apparating without a license . It ’s not easy , Apparition , and when it ’s not done properly it can lead to nasty complications . This pair I ’m talking about went and Splinched themselves . ”
21535	21540	21542	21542	Harry	447	“ Er — Splinched ? ”
21544	21552	21554	21555	Mr. Weasley	190	“ They left half of themselves behind , ”
21567	21624	21554	21555	Mr. Weasley	190	“ So , of course , they were stuck . Could n’t move either way . Had to wait for the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad to sort them out . Meant a fair old bit of paperwork , I can tell you , what with the Muggles who spotted the body parts they ’d left behind ... ”
21647	21652	21653	21653	he	447	“ Were they okay ? ”
21658	21662	21664	21665	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Oh yes , ”
21672	21724	21664	21665	Mr. Weasley	190	“ But they got a heavy fine , and I do n’t think they ’ll be trying it again in a hurry . You do n’t mess around with Apparition . There are plenty of adult wizards who do n’t bother with it . Prefer brooms — slower , but safer . ”
21725	21737	21798	21799	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ But Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it ? ”
21738	21747	21749	21749	Fred	192	“ Charlie had to take the test twice , ”
21753	21784	21749	21749	Fred	192	“ He failed the first time , Apparated five miles south of where he meant to , right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping , remember ? ”
21785	21796	21798	21799	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Yes , well , he passed the second time , ”
21810	21818	21820	21820	George	193	“ Percy only passed two weeks ago , ”
21822	21838	21820	21820	George	193	“ He ’s been Apparating downstairs every morning since , just to prove he can . ”
21860	21871	21872	21872	Ginny	213	“ Why do we have to be up so early ? ”
21885	21895	21897	21898	Mr. Weasley	190	“ We ’ve got a bit of a walk , ”
21900	21903	21905	21905	Harry	447	“ Walk ? ”
21907	21918	21905	21905	Harry	447	“ What , are we walking to the World Cup ? ”
21919	21929	21931	21932	Mr. Weasley	190	“ No , no , that ’s miles away , ”
21936	21994	21931	21932	Mr. Weasley	190	“ We only need to walk a short way . It ’s just that it ’s very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting Muggle attention . We have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of times , and on a huge occasion like the Quidditch World Cup — ”
21995	21998	22000	22001	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ George ! ”
22009	22012	22014	22014	George	193	“ What ? ”
22024	22032	22014	22014	George	193	“ What is that in your pocket ? ”
22033	22036	22049	22049	her	191	“ Nothing ! ”
22037	22045	22046	22047	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Do n’t you lie to me ! ”
22058	22061	22049	22049	her	191	“ Accio ! ”
22095	22103	22105	22106	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ We told you to destroy them ! ”
22120	22142	22105	22106	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ We told you to get rid of the lot ! Empty your pockets , go on , both of you ! ”
22185	22192	22193	22193	she	191	“ Accio ! Accio ! Accio ! ”
22223	22231	22232	22232	Fred	192	“ We spent six months developing those ! ”
22244	22254	22255	22255	she	191	“ Oh a fine way to spend six months ! ”
22258	22268	22255	22255	she	191	“ No wonder you did n’t get more O.W.L.s ! ”
22326	22334	22336	22337	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Well , have a lovely time , ”
22339	22344	22345	22345	she	191	“ and behave yourselves , ”
22363	22377	22345	22345	she	191	“ I ’ll send Bill , Charlie , and Percy along around midday , ”
22460	22473	22474	22474	he	447	“ So how does everyone get there without all the Muggles noticing ? ”
22477	22486	22488	22489	Mr. Weasley	190	“ It ’s been a massive organizational problem , ”
22491	22767	22488	22489	Mr. Weasley	190	“ The trouble is , about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the World Cup , and of course , we just have n’t got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all . There are places Muggles ca n’t penetrate , but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine and three - quarters . So we had to find a nice deserted moor , and set up as many anti - Muggle precautions as possible . The whole Ministry ’s been working on it for months . First , of course , we have to stagger the arrivals . People with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand . A limited number use Muggle transport , but we ca n’t have too many clogging up their buses and trains — remember , wizards are coming from all over the world . Some Apparate , of course , but we have to set up safe points for them to appear , well away from Muggles . I believe there ’s a handy wood they ’re using as the Apparition point . For those who do n’t want to Apparate , or ca n’t , we use Portkeys . They ’re objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time . You can do large groups at a time if you need to . There have been two hundred Portkeys placed at strategic points around Britain , and the nearest one to us is up at the top of Stoatshead Hill , so that ’s where we ’re headed . ”
22789	22797	22799	22799	Harry	447	“ What sort of objects are Portkeys ? ”
22802	22810	22812	22813	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Well , they can be anything , ”
22815	22842	22812	22813	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Unobtrusive things , obviously , so Muggles do n’t go picking them up and playing with them ... stuff they ’ll just think is litter ... ”
22960	22963	22965	22966	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Whew , ”
22979	22994	22965	22966	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Well , we ’ve made good time — we ’ve got ten minutes ... ”
23012	23020	23022	23023	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Now we just need the Portkey , ”
23035	23045	23022	23023	Mr. Weasley	190	“ It wo n’t be big ... Come on ... ”
23074	23090	23091	23093	Two tall figures	1082	“ Over here , Arthur ! Over here , son , we ’ve got it ! ”
23108	23111	23118	23118	he	190	“ Amos ! ”
23165	23173	23175	23176	Mr. Weasley	190	“ This is Amos Diggory , everyone , ”
23178	23203	23175	23176	Mr. Weasley	190	“ He works for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures . And I think you know his son , Cedric ? ”
23229	23232	23234	23234	Cedric	231	“ Hi , ”
23278	23284	23285	23285	Cedric	231	“ Long walk , Arthur ? ”
23290	23295	23297	23298	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Not too bad , ”
23300	23315	23297	23298	Mr. Weasley	190	“ We live just on the other side of the village there . You ? ”
23316	23382	23383	23384	Amos Diggory	230	“ Had to get up at two , did n’t we , Ced ? I tell you , I ’ll be glad when he ’s got his Apparition test . Still ... not complaining ... Quidditch World Cup , would n’t miss it for a sackful of Galleons — and the tickets cost about that . Mind you , looks like I got off easy ... ”
23403	23410	23401	23401	Ginny	213	“ All these yours , Arthur ? ”
23411	23419	23421	23422	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Oh no , only the redheads , ”
23429	23445	23401	23401	Ginny	213	“ This is Hermione , friend of Ron ’s — and Harry , another friend — ”
23446	23451	23453	23454	Amos Diggory	230	“ Merlin ’s beard , ”
23460	23466	23456	23456	his	230	“ Harry ? Harry Potter ? ”
23467	23472	23474	23474	Harry	447	“ Er — yeah , ”
23515	23525	23527	23528	Amos Diggory	230	“ Ced ’s talked about you , of course , ”
23530	23568	23527	23528	Amos Diggory	230	“ Told us all about playing against you last year ... I said to him , I said — Ced , that ’ll be something to tell your grandchildren , that will ... You beat Harry Potter ! ”
23597	23606	23607	23607	he	231	“ Harry fell off his broom , Dad , ”
23610	23620	23607	23607	he	231	“ I told you ... it was an accident ... ”
23621	23634	23636	23636	Amos	230	“ Yes , but you did n’t fall off , did you ? ”
23646	23704	23636	23636	Amos	230	“ Always modest , our Ced , always the gentleman ... but the best man won , I ’m sure Harry’d say the same , would n’t you , eh ? One falls off his broom , one stays on , you do n’t need to be a genius to tell which one ’s the better flier ! ”
23705	23711	23713	23714	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Must be nearly time , ”
23723	23737	23719	23719	his	190	“ Do you know whether we ’re waiting for any more , Amos ? ”
23738	23758	23760	23761	Mr. Diggory	238	“ No , the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the Fawcetts could n’t get tickets , ”
23763	23778	23760	23761	Mr. Diggory	238	“ There are n’t any more of us in this area , are there ? ”
23779	23786	23788	23789	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Not that I know of , ”
23791	23806	23807	23807	He	190	“ Yes , it ’s a minute off ... We ’d better get ready ... ”
23815	23833	23807	23807	He	190	“ You just need to touch the Portkey , that ’s all , a finger will do — ”
23920	23923	23925	23926	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Three ... ”
23935	23940	23925	23926	Mr. Weasley	190	“ two ... one ... ”
24075	24083	24092	24092	Ron	188	“ Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill , ”
24184	24189	24191	24192	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Morning , Basil , ”
24236	24242	24244	24244	Basil	240	“ Hello there , Arthur , ”
24247	24307	24308	24308	He	240	“ Not on duty , eh ? It ’s all right for some ... We ’ve been here all night ... You ’d better get out of the way , we ’ve got a big party coming in from the Black Forest at five - fifteen . Hang on , I ’ll find your campsite ... Weasley ... Weasley ... ”
24314	24349	24308	24308	He	240	“ About a quarter of a mile ’s walk over there , first field you come to . Site manager ’s called Mr. Roberts . Diggory ... second field ... ask for Mr. Payne . ”
24350	24355	24361	24361	he	190	“ Thanks , Basil , ”
24496	24499	24501	24502	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Morning ! ”
24505	24508	24510	24511	the Muggle	178	“ Morning , ”
24513	24520	24510	24511	the Muggle	178	“ Would you be Mr. Roberts ? ”
24521	24527	24529	24530	Mr. Roberts	241	“ Aye , I would , ”
24532	24538	24529	24530	Mr. Roberts	241	“ And who ’re you ? ”
24539	24552	24510	24511	the Muggle	178	“ Weasley — two tents , booked a couple of days ago ? ”
24553	24556	24558	24559	Mr. Roberts	241	“ Aye , ”
24569	24586	24558	24559	Mr. Roberts	241	“ You ’ve got a space up by the wood there . Just the one night ? ”
24587	24592	24594	24595	Mr. Weasley	190	“ That ’s it , ”
24597	24606	24608	24609	Mr. Roberts	241	“ You ’ll be paying now , then ? ”
24611	24618	24620	24621	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Ah — right — certainly — ”
24637	24643	24644	24644	he	190	“ Help me , Harry , ”
24664	24693	24644	24644	he	190	“ This one ’s a — a — a ten ? Ah yes , I see the little number on it now ... So this is a five ? ”
24694	24698	24701	24701	him	190	“ A twenty , ”
24717	24736	24709	24710	Mr. Roberts	241	“ Ah yes , so it is ... I do n’t know , these little bits of paper ... ”
24737	24741	24743	24744	Mr. Roberts	241	“ You foreign ? ”
24754	24757	24759	24760	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Foreign ? ”
24764	24778	24780	24781	Mr. Roberts	241	“ You ’re not the first one who ’s had trouble with money , ”
24788	24808	24784	24785	Mr. Weasley	190	“ I had two try and pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago . ”
24809	24814	24816	24817	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Did you really ? ”
24831	24837	24838	24838	he	241	“ Never been this crowded , ”
24850	24863	24838	24838	he	241	“ Hundreds of pre - bookings . People usually just turn up ... ”
24864	24869	24871	24872	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Is that right ? ”
24892	24895	24896	24896	he	241	“ Aye , ”
24900	24934	24896	24896	he	241	“ People from all over . Loads of foreigners . And not just foreigners . Weirdos , you know ? There ’s a bloke walking ’ round in a kilt and a poncho . ”
24935	24940	24942	24943	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Should n’t he ? ”
24946	24963	24965	24966	Mr. Roberts	241	“ It ’s like some sort of ... I dunno ... like some sort of rally , ”
24968	24982	24965	24966	Mr. Roberts	241	“ They all seem to know each other . Like a big party . ”
25006	25009	25010	25010	he	1128	“ Obliviate ! ”
25061	25070	25071	25072	Mr. Roberts	241	“ A map of the campsite for you , ”
25079	25084	25071	25072	Mr. Roberts	241	“ And your change . ”
25085	25090	25092	25093	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Thanks very much , ”
25144	25214	25215	25215	He	241	“ Been having a lot of trouble with him . Needs a Memory Charm ten times a day to keep him happy . And Ludo Bagman ’s not helping . Trotting around talking about Bludgers and Quaffles at the top of his voice , not a worry about anti - Muggle security . Blimey , I ’ll be glad when this is over . See you later , Arthur . ”
25218	25231	25233	25233	Ginny	213	“ I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games and Sports , ”
25238	25255	25233	25233	Ginny	213	“ He should know better than to talk about Bludgers near Muggles , should n’t he ? ”
25256	25260	25262	25263	Mr. Weasley	190	“ He should , ”
25277	25329	25262	25263	Mr. Weasley	190	“ but Ludo ’s always been a bit ... well ... lax about security . You could n’t wish for a more enthusiastic Head of the sports department though . He played Quidditch for England himself , you know . And he was the best Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had . ”
25467	25472	25474	25475	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Always the same , ”
25479	25503	25474	25475	Mr. Weasley	190	“ We ca n’t resist showing off when we get together . Ah , here we are , look , this is us . ”
25539	25547	25549	25550	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Could n’t have a better spot ! ”
25553	25576	25577	25577	He	190	“ The field is just on the other side of the wood there , we ’re as close as we could be . ”
25585	25588	25589	25589	he	190	“ Right , ”
25593	25648	25589	25589	he	190	“ no magic allowed , strictly speaking , not when we ’re out in these numbers on Muggle land . We ’ll be putting these tents up by hand ! Should n’t be too difficult ... Muggles do it all the time ... Here , Harry , where do you reckon we should start ? ”
25816	25824	25825	25825	he	190	“ We ’ll be a bit cramped , ”
25828	25844	25825	25825	he	190	“ but I think we ’ll all squeeze in . Come and have a look . ”
25918	25927	25929	25930	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Well , it ’s not for long , ”
25953	25977	25978	25978	He	190	“ I borrowed this from Perkins at the office . Does n’t camp much anymore , poor fellow , he ’s got lumbago . ”
25989	25995	25978	25978	He	190	“ We ’ll need water ... ”
25996	26010	26012	26012	Ron	188	“ There ’s a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave us , ”
26031	26042	26012	26012	Ron	188	“ It ’s on the other side of the field . ”
26043	26062	26064	26065	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Well , why do n’t you , Harry , and Hermione go and get us some water then ”
26076	26090	26064	26065	Mr. Weasley	190	“ and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire ? ”
26091	26099	26101	26101	Ron	188	“ But we ’ve got an oven , ”
26103	26110	26101	26101	Ron	188	“ Why ca n’t we just — ”
26111	26119	26124	26124	his	190	“ Ron , anti - Muggle security ! ”
26130	26149	26124	26124	his	190	“ When real Muggles camp , they cook on fires outdoors . I ’ve seen them at it ! ”
26349	26369	26370	26370	She	871	“ How many times , Kevin ? You do n’t — touch — Daddy ’s — wand — yecchh ! ”
26399	26408	26381	26381	Her	871	“ You bust slug ! You bust slug ! ”
26469	26484	26465	26465	he	1181	“ In broad daylight ! Parents having a lie - in , I suppose — ”
26627	26641	26643	26643	Ron	188	“ Er — is it my eyes , or has everything gone green ? ”
26714	26721	26724	26725	Seamus Finnigan	252	“ Harry ! Ron ! Hermione ! ”
26771	26776	26778	26778	Seamus	252	“ Like the decorations ? ”
26782	26790	26778	26778	Seamus	252	“ The Ministry ’s not too happy . ”
26791	26802	26804	26805	Mrs. Finnigan	253	“ Ah , why should n’t we show our colors ? ”
26807	26831	26832	26832	she	253	“ You should see what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents . You ’ll be supporting Ireland , of course ? ”
26867	26879	26864	26864	Ron	188	“ Like we ’d say anything else surrounded by that lot . ”
26880	26894	26896	26896	Hermione	178	“ I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents ? ”
26898	26907	26909	26909	Harry	447	“ Let ’s go and have a look , ”
26994	26997	26999	26999	Ron	188	“ Krum , ”
27002	27005	27007	27007	Hermione	178	“ What ? ”
27009	27012	27014	27014	Ron	188	“ Krum ! ”
27016	27024	27014	27014	Ron	188	“ Viktor Krum , the Bulgarian Seeker ! ”
27025	27031	27033	27033	Hermione	178	“ He looks really grumpy , ”
27047	27053	27054	27054	Ron	188	“ ‘ Really grumpy ’ ? ”
27062	27100	27054	27054	Ron	188	“ Who cares what he looks like ? He ’s unbelievable . He ’s really young too . Only just eighteen or something . He ’s a genius , you wait until tonight , you ’ll see . ”
27178	27210	27163	27163	he	997	“ Just put them on , Archie , there ’s a good chap . You ca n’t walk around like that , the Muggle at the gate ’s already getting suspicious — ”
27211	27220	27222	27224	the old wizard	1207	“ I bought this in a Muggle shop , ”
27227	27232	27163	27163	he	997	“ Muggles wear them . ”
27233	27249	27256	27256	he	1208	“ Muggle women wear them , Archie , not the men , they wear these , ”
27262	27270	27272	27273	old Archie	255	“ I ’m not putting them on , ”
27277	27290	27272	27273	old Archie	255	“ I like a healthy breeze ’ round my privates , thanks . ”
27496	27503	27504	27504	he	447	“ Who d’you reckon they are ? ”
27507	27518	27504	27504	he	447	“ They do n’t go to Hogwarts , do they ? ”
27519	27529	27531	27531	Ron	188	“ ’ Spect they go to some foreign school , ”
27533	27611	27531	27531	Ron	188	“ I know there are others . Never met anyone who went to one , though . Bill had a penfriend at a school in Brazil ... this was years and years ago ... and he wanted to go on an exchange trip but Mum and Dad could n’t afford it . His penfriend got all offended when he said he was n’t going and sent him a cursed hat . It made his ears shrivel up . ”
27693	27699	27701	27701	George	193	“ You ’ve been ages , ”
27713	27719	27721	27721	Ron	188	“ Met a few people , ”
27728	27737	27721	27721	Ron	188	“ You not got that fire started yet ? ”
27738	27747	27749	27749	Fred	192	“ Dad ’s having fun with the matches , ”
27795	27798	27799	27799	he	190	“ Oops ! ”
27815	27822	27824	27824	Hermione	178	“ Come here , Mr. Weasley , ”
27942	28013	27928	27928	his	190	“ That was Cuthbert Mockridge , Head of the Goblin Liaison Office ... Here comes Gilbert Wimple ; he ’s with the Committee on Experimental Charms ; he ’s had those horns for a while now ... Hello , Arnie ... Arnold Peasegood , he ’s an Obliviator — member of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad , you know ... and that ’s Bode and Croaker ... they ’re Unspeakables ... ”
28014	28019	28080	28080	Percy	206	“ They ’re what ? ”
28020	28038	28080	28080	Percy	206	“ From the Department of Mysteries , top secret , no idea what they get up to ... ”
28072	28078	28080	28080	Percy	206	“ Just Apparated , Dad , ”
28083	28090	28080	28080	Percy	206	“ Ah , excellent , lunch ! ”
28121	28124	28125	28125	he	190	“ Aha ! ”
28128	28137	28125	28125	he	190	“ The man of the moment ! Ludo ! ”
28266	28270	28271	28271	Bagman	221	“ Ahoy there ! ”
28300	28306	28307	28307	he	221	“ Arthur , old man , ”
28315	28355	28307	28307	he	221	“ what a day , eh ? What a day ! Could we have asked for more perfect weather ? A cloudless night coming ... and hardly a hiccough in the arrangements ... Not much for me to do ! ”
28424	28429	28431	28432	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Ah — yes , ”
28436	28488	28431	28432	Mr. Weasley	190	“ this is my son Percy . He ’s just started at the Ministry — and this is Fred — no , George , sorry — that ’s Fred — Bill , Charlie , Ron — my daughter , Ginny — and Ron ’s friends , Hermione Granger and Harry Potter . ”
28519	28522	28504	28504	his	221	“ Everyone , ”
28527	28551	28523	28524	Mr. Weasley	190	“ this is Ludo Bagman , you know who he is , it ’s thanks to him we ’ve got such good tickets — ”
28567	28577	28578	28578	he	221	“ Fancy a flutter on the match , Arthur ? ”
28604	28658	28578	28578	he	221	“ I ’ve already got Roddy Pontner betting me Bulgaria will score first — I offered him nice odds , considering Ireland ’s front three are the strongest I ’ve seen in years — and little Agatha Timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a week - long match . ”
28659	28666	28668	28669	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Oh ... go on then , ”
28671	28683	28668	28669	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Let ’s see ... a Galleon on Ireland to win ? ”
28684	28688	28689	28690	Ludo Bagman	221	“ A Galleon ? ”
28699	28710	28697	28697	himself	221	“ Very well , very well ... any other takers ? ”
28711	28721	28723	28724	Mr. Weasley	190	“ They ’re a bit young to be gambling , ”
28726	28732	28723	28724	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Molly would n’t like — ”
28733	28748	28750	28750	Fred	192	“ We ’ll bet thirty - seven Galleons , fifteen Sickles , three Knuts , ”
28761	28783	28752	28752	he	1243	“ that Ireland wins — but Viktor Krum gets the Snitch . Oh and we ’ll throw in a fake wand . ”
28784	28798	28799	28799	Percy	206	“ You do n’t want to go showing Mr. Bagman rubbish like that — ”
28853	28874	28875	28875	Percy	206	“ Excellent ! I have n’t seen one that convincing in years ! I ’d pay five Galleons for that ! ”
28884	28887	28892	28892	his	190	“ Boys , ”
28895	28912	28892	28892	his	190	“ I do n’t want you betting ... That ’s all your savings ... Your mother — ”
28913	28922	28924	28925	Ludo Bagman	221	“ Do n’t be a spoilsport , Arthur ! ”
28932	28989	28924	28925	Ludo Bagman	221	“ They ’re old enough to know what they want ! You reckon Ireland will win but Krum’ll get the Snitch ? Not a chance , boys , not a chance ... I ’ll give you excellent odds on that one ... We ’ll add five Galleons for the funny wand , then , shall we ... ”
29013	29016	29018	29018	George	193	“ Cheers , ”
29043	29100	29034	29034	Bagman	221	“ Could n’t do me a brew , I suppose ? I ’m keeping an eye out for Barty Crouch . My Bulgarian opposite number ’s making difficulties , and I ca n’t understand a word he ’s saying . Barty’ll be able to sort it out . He speaks about a hundred and fifty languages . ”
29101	29105	29107	29107	Percy	206	“ Mr. Crouch ? ”
29124	29137	29107	29107	Percy	206	“ He speaks over two hundred ! Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll ... ”
29138	29144	29146	29146	Fred	192	“ Anyone can speak Troll , ”
29149	29160	29146	29146	Fred	192	“ All you have to do is point and grunt . ”
29182	29192	29193	29194	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet , Ludo ? ”
29208	29214	29216	29216	Bagman	221	“ Not a dicky bird , ”
29219	29267	29216	29216	Bagman	221	“ But she ’ll turn up . Poor old Bertha ... memory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction . Lost , you take my word for it . She ’ll wander back into the office sometime in October , thinking it ’s still July . ”
29268	29285	29286	29287	Mr. Weasley	190	“ You do n’t think it might be time to send someone to look for her ? ”
29297	29304	29306	29306	Bagman	221	“ Barty Crouch keeps saying that , ”
29314	29335	29306	29306	Bagman	221	“ but we really ca n’t spare anyone at the moment . Oh — talk of the devil ! Barty ! ”
29482	29492	29494	29494	Ludo	221	“ Pull up a bit of grass , Barty , ”
29503	29510	29512	29512	Crouch	269	“ No thank you , Ludo , ”
29525	29548	29522	29522	his	269	“ I ’ve been looking for you everywhere . The Bulgarians are insisting we add another twelve seats to the Top Box . ”
29549	29558	29560	29560	Bagman	221	“ Oh is that what they ’re after ? ”
29562	29582	29560	29560	Bagman	221	“ I thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers . Bit of a strong accent . ”
29583	29587	29589	29589	Percy	206	“ Mr. Crouch ! ”
29608	29617	29560	29560	Bagman	221	“ Would you like a cup of tea ? ”
29618	29621	29623	29624	Mr. Crouch	219	“ Oh , ”
29634	29642	29623	29624	Mr. Crouch	219	“ Yes — thank you , Weatherby . ”
29666	29681	29683	29684	Mr. Crouch	219	“ Oh and I ’ve been wanting a word with you too , Arthur , ”
29694	29715	29686	29686	his	219	“ Ali Bashir ’s on the warpath . He wants a word with you about your embargo on flying carpets . ”
29723	29769	29716	29717	Mr. Weasley	190	“ I sent him an owl about that just last week . If I ’ve told him once I ’ve told him a hundred times : Carpets are defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects , but will he listen ? ”
29770	29775	29777	29778	Mr. Crouch	219	“ I doubt it , ”
29786	29794	29777	29778	Mr. Crouch	219	“ He ’s desperate to export here . ”
29795	29809	29811	29811	Bagman	221	“ Well , they ’ll never replace brooms in Britain , will they ? ”
29813	29828	29830	29831	Mr. Crouch	219	“ Ali thinks there ’s a niche in the market for a family vehicle , ”
29833	29857	29858	29858	He	219	“ I remember my grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve — but that was before carpets were banned , of course . ”
29881	29890	29892	29892	Bagman	221	“ So , been keeping busy , Barty ? ”
29895	29898	29900	29901	Mr. Crouch	219	“ Fairly , ”
29904	29917	29900	29901	Mr. Crouch	219	“ Organizing Portkeys across five continents is no mean feat , Ludo . ”
29918	29931	29933	29934	Mr. Weasley	190	“ I expect you ’ll both be glad when this is over ? ”
29941	29984	29936	29937	Ludo Bagman	221	“ Glad ! Do n’t know when I ’ve had more fun ... Still , it ’s not as though we have n’t got anything to look forward to , eh , Barty ? Eh ? Plenty left to organize , eh ? ”
29993	30006	29988	29988	his	219	“ We agreed not to make the announcement until all the details — ”
30007	30011	30013	30013	Bagman	221	“ Oh details ! ”
30025	30062	30013	30013	Bagman	221	“ They ’ve signed , have n’t they ? They ’ve agreed , have n’t they ? I bet you anything these kids’ll know soon enough anyway . I mean , it ’s happening at Hogwarts — ”
30063	30076	30078	30079	Mr. Crouch	219	“ Ludo , we need to meet the Bulgarians , you know , ”
30088	30097	30098	30098	He	219	“ Thank you for the tea , Weatherby . ”
30135	30141	30142	30142	he	219	“ See you all later ! ”

38237	38475	38230	38230	We	1485	” Mr. Weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big plans were , but seemed to decide , upon reflection , that he did n’t want to know . They were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back to their campsites . Raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the lantern - lit path , and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads , cackling and waving their lanterns . When they finally reached the tents , nobody felt like sleeping at all , and given the level of noise around them , Mr. Weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in . They were soon arguing enjoyably about the match ; Mr. Weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with Charlie , and it was only when Ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that Mr. Weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed . Hermione and Ginny went into the next tent , and Harry and the rest of the Weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks . From the other side of the campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd echoing bang . “
38486	38492	38480	38480	I	0	” muttered Mr. Weasley sleepily . “
38511	38633	38634	38634	I	0	” Harry , who was on a top bunk above Ron , lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent , watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead , and picturing again some of Krum ’s more spectacular moves . He was itching to get back on his own Firebolt and try out the Wronski Feint ... Somehow Oliver Wood had never managed to convey with all his wriggling diagrams what that move was supposed to look like ... Harry saw himself in robes that had his name on the back , and imagined the sensation of hearing a hundred - thousand - strong crowd roar , as Ludo Bagman ’s voice echoed throughout the stadium , “
38640	38683	38634	38634	I	0	” Harry never knew whether or not he had actually dropped off to sleep — his fantasies of flying like Krum might well have slipped into actual dreams — all he knew was that , quite suddenly , Mr. Weasley was shouting . “
38702	38716	38687	38687	Ron	188	” Harry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit canvas . “
38721	38789	38793	38793	Harry	447	” he said . Dimly , he could tell that something was wrong . The noises in the campsite had changed . The singing had stopped . He could hear screams , and the sound of people running . He slipped down from the bunk and reached for his clothes , but Mr. Weasley , who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas , said , “
38805	39145	38687	38687	Ron	188	” Harry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent , Ron at his heels . By the light of the few fires that were still burning , he could see people running away into the woods , fleeing something that was moving across the field toward them , something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire . Loud jeering , roars of laughter , and drunken yells were drifting toward them ; then came a burst of strong green light , which illuminated the scene . A crowd of wizards , tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing straight upward , was marching slowly across the field . Harry squinted at them ... They did n’t seem to have faces ... Then he realized that their heads were hooded and their faces masked . High above them , floating along in midair , four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes . It was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers , and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air . Two of the figures were very small . More wizards were joining the marching group , laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies . Tents crumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled . Once or twice Harry saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of his way with his wand . Several caught fire . The screaming grew louder . The floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning tent and Harry recognized one of them : Mr. Roberts , the campsite manager . The other three looked as though they might be his wife and children . One of the marchers below flipped Mrs. Roberts upside down with his wand ; her nightdress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee . “
39150	39184	38687	38687	Ron	188	” Ron muttered , watching the smallest Muggle child , who had begun to spin like a top , sixty feet above the ground , his head flopping limply from side to side . “
39190	39243	39244	39244	We	1488	” Hermione and Ginny came hurrying toward them , pulling coats over their nightdresses , with Mr. Weasley right behind them . At the same moment , Bill , Charlie , and Percy emerged from the boys ’ tent , fully dressed , with their sleeves rolled up and their wands out . “
39252	39267	39268	39269	You lot	1491	” Mr. Weasley shouted over all the noise , rolling up his own sleeves . “
39293	39340	39280	39280	I	0	” Bill , Charlie , and Percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming marchers ; Mr. Weasley tore after them . Ministry wizards were dashing from every direction toward the source of the trouble . The crowd beneath the Roberts family was coming ever closer . “
39344	39504	39280	39280	I	0	” said Fred , grabbing Ginny ’s hand and starting to pull her toward the wood . Harry , Ron , Hermione , and George followed . They all looked back as they reached the trees . The crowd beneath the Roberts family was larger than ever ; they could see the Ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the center , but they were having great difficulty . It looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the Roberts family fall . The colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished . Dark figures were blundering through the trees ; children were crying ; anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air . Harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could not see . Then he heard Ron yell with pain . “
39508	39522	39523	39523	Ron	188	” said Hermione anxiously , stopping so abruptly that Harry walked into her . “
39536	39558	39534	39534	Lumos	312	” She illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path . Ron was lying sprawled on the ground . “
39565	39576	39534	39534	Lumos	312	” he said angrily , getting to his feet again . “
39588	39665	39534	39534	Lumos	312	” said a drawling voice from behind them . Harry , Ron , and Hermione turned sharply . Draco Malfoy was standing alone nearby , leaning against a tree , looking utterly relaxed . His arms folded , he seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees . Ron told Malfoy to do something that Harry knew he would never have dared say in front of Mrs. Weasley . “
39670	39679	39668	39668	Weasley	190	” said Malfoy , his pale eyes glittering . “
39700	39735	39698	39698	you	190	” He nodded at Hermione , and at the same moment , a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite , and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them . “
39743	39748	39749	39749	Granger	178	” said Hermione defiantly . “
39756	39760	39751	39751	they	1494	” said Malfoy . “
39795	39796	39797	39797	Hermione	178	” “
39802	39806	39799	39800	a witch	1497	” Harry snarled . “
39815	39822	39813	39813	Potter	447	” said Malfoy , grinning maliciously . “
39838	39839	39840	39840	You	190	” “
39845	39853	39840	39840	You	190	” shouted Ron . Everybody present knew that “
39855	39870	39840	39840	You	190	” was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of Muggle parentage . “
39876	39925	39874	39874	Ron	188	” said Hermione quickly , seizing Ron ’s arm to restrain him as he took a step toward Malfoy . There came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything they had heard . Several people nearby screamed . Malfoy chuckled softly . “
39933	39938	39931	39931	they	1494	” he said lazily . “
39961	39962	39951	39951	he	1498	” “
39968	39976	39983	39983	they	1499	” said Harry , his temper rising . “
39985	39996	39983	39983	they	1499	” Malfoy turned his face to Harry , still smiling . “
40017	40018	40015	40015	Potter	447	” “
40023	40034	40013	40013	I	0	” said Hermione , with a disgusted look at Malfoy , “
40043	40044	40040	40041	the others	957	” “
40054	40058	40052	40052	Granger	178	” sneered Malfoy . “
40062	40077	40078	40078	I	0	” Hermione repeated , and she pulled Harry and Ron up the path again . “
40092	40097	40086	40090	one of that masked lot	1503	” said Ron hotly . “
40110	40115	40086	40090	one of that masked lot	1503	” said Hermione fervently . “
40130	40205	40086	40090	one of that masked lot	1503	” Fred , George , and Ginny were nowhere to be seen , though the path was packed with plenty of other people , all looking nervously over their shoulders toward the commotion back at the campsite . A huddle of teenagers in pajamas was arguing vociferously a little way along the path . When they saw Harry , Ron , and Hermione , a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly , “
40215	40216	40318	40318	George	193	” “
40221	40225	40086	40090	one of that masked lot	1503	” said Ron . “
40228	40251	40318	40318	George	193	” The girl who had spoken turned her back on him , and as they walked on they distinctly heard her say , “
40255	40256	40318	40318	George	193	” “
40259	40263	40318	40318	George	193	” muttered Hermione . “
40266	40270	40318	40318	George	193	” said Harry . “
40277	40281	40282	40282	You	1507	” said Hermione . “
40303	40304	40290	40290	I	0	” “
40311	40315	40290	40290	I	0	” said Harry . “
40326	40376	40318	40318	George	193	” said Ron , pulling out his wand , lighting it like Hermione ’s , and squinting up the path . Harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wand — but it was n’t there . The only thing he could find was his Omnioculars . “
40393	40394	40395	40395	You	1507	” “
40399	40435	40395	40395	You	1507	” Ron and Hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams of light farther on the ground ; Harry looked all around him , but his wand was nowhere to be seen . “
40444	40448	40395	40395	You	1507	” said Ron . “
40461	40466	40454	40454	your	1507	” Hermione suggested anxiously . “
40469	40473	40454	40454	your	1507	” said Harry , “
40476	40566	40454	40454	your	1507	” He usually kept his wand with him at all times in the Wizarding world , and finding himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very vulnerable . A rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump . Winky the house - elf was fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby . She was moving in a most peculiar fashion , apparently with great difficulty ; it was as though someone invisible were trying to hold her back . “
40573	40587	40588	40588	People	5169	” she squeaked distractedly as she leaned forward and labored to keep running . “
40604	40632	40596	40596	Winky	278	” And she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path , panting and squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining her . “
40639	40648	40596	40596	Winky	278	” said Ron , looking curiously after Winky . “
40656	40657	40659	40659	she	278	” “
40667	40704	40659	40659	she	278	” said Harry . He was thinking of Dobby : Every time he had tried to do something the Malfoys would n’t like , the house - elf had been forced to start beating himself up . “
40717	40722	40708	40710	house - elves	5385	” said Hermione indignantly . “
40779	40780	40773	40773	anyone	816	” “
40792	40796	40799	40800	old Winky	278	” Ron said . “
40828	40829	40821	40821	she	278	” “
40838	40843	40834	40834	you	1512	” Hermione began hotly , “
40860	40872	40821	40821	she	278	” Another loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood . “
40882	41046	41047	41047	I	0	” said Ron , and Harry saw him glance edgily at Hermione . Perhaps there was truth in what Malfoy had said ; perhaps Hermione was in more danger than they were . They set off again , Harry still searching his pockets , even though he knew his wand was n’t there . They followed the dark path deeper into the wood , still keeping an eye out for Fred , George , and Ginny . They passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match , and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite . Farther still along the path , they walked into a patch of silvery light , and when they looked through the trees , they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing , surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards , all of whom were talking very loudly . “
41059	41065	41047	41047	I	0	” one of them shouted . “
41081	41082	41066	41066	I	0	” “
41089	41094	41066	41066	I	0	” yelled his friend . “
41119	41144	41111	41111	I	0	” A third young wizard , whose pimples were visible even by the dim , silvery light of the veela , now cut in , “
41161	41217	41150	41156	the youngest - ever Minister of Magic	1523	” Harry snorted with laughter . He recognized the pimply wizard : His name was Stan Shunpike , and he was in fact a conductor on the triple - decker Knight Bus . He turned to tell Ron this , but Ron ’s face had gone oddly slack , and next second Ron was yelling , “
41232	41233	41219	41219	I	0	” “
41236	41301	41219	41219	I	0	” said Hermione , and she and Harry grabbed Ron firmly by the arms , wheeled him around , and marched him away . By the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely , they were in the very heart of the wood . They seemed to be alone now ; everything was much quieter . Harry looked around . “
41322	41393	41313	41313	We	1525	” The words were hardly out of his mouth , when Ludo Bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them . Even by the feeble light of the two wands , Harry could see that a great change had come over Bagman . He no longer looked buoyant and rosy - faced ; there was no more spring in his step . He looked very white and strained . “
41398	41414	41313	41313	We	1525	” he said , blinking down at them , trying to make out their faces . “
41425	41434	41417	41417	you	1524	” They looked at one another , surprised . “
41446	41455	41417	41417	you	1524	” said Ron . Bagman stared at him . “
41458	41459	41417	41417	you	1524	” “
41475	41480	41482	41482	them	927	” Bagman swore loudly . “
41484	41504	41482	41482	them	927	” he said , looking quite distracted , and without another word , he Disapparated with a small pop ! “
41518	41524	41516	41516	he	221	” said Hermione , frowning . “
41533	41564	41525	41525	He	221	” said Ron , leading the way off the path into a small clearing , and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree . “
41582	41657	41565	41567	The Wimbourne Wasps	246	” He took his small figure of Krum out of his pocket , set it down on the ground , and watched it walk around . Like the real Krum , the model was slightly duck - footed and round - shouldered , much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick . Harry was listening for noise from the campsite . Everything seemed much quieter ; perhaps the riot was over . “
41665	41672	41658	41658	I	0	” said Hermione after a while . “
41678	41682	41673	41673	They	957	” said Ron . “
41691	41713	41714	41714	He	1533	” said Harry , sitting down next to Ron and watching the small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves . “
41727	41728	41714	41714	He	1533	” “
41743	41747	41714	41714	He	1533	” said Ron . “
41754	41759	41748	41750	Those poor Muggles	1534	” said Hermione nervously . “
41769	41770	41771	41771	They	1534	” “
41774	41779	41771	41771	They	1534	” said Ron reassuringly . “
41786	41787	41780	41780	They	1534	” “
41808	41812	41813	41813	I	0	” said Hermione . “
41839	41895	41827	41827	you	1536	” But she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder . Harry and Ron looked quickly around too . It sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing . They waited , listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark trees . But the footsteps came to a sudden halt . “
41898	41940	41827	41827	you	1536	” called Harry . There was silence . Harry got to his feet and peered around the tree . It was too dark to see very far , but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his vision . “
41945	41987	41827	41827	you	1536	” he said . And then , without warning , the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood ; and it uttered , not a panicked shout , but what sounded like a spell . “
41990	42025	41827	41827	you	1536	” And something vast , green , and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness Harry ’s eyes had been struggling to penetrate ; it flew up over the treetops and into the sky . “
42030	42187	41827	41827	you	1536	” gasped Ron as he sprang to his feet again , staring up at the thing that had appeared . For a split second , Harry thought it was another leprechaun formation . Then he realized that it was a colossal skull , comprised of what looked like emerald stars , with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue . As they watched , it rose higher and higher , blazing in a haze of greenish smoke , etched against the black sky like a new constellation . Suddenly , the wood all around them erupted with screams . Harry did n’t understand why , but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull , which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign . He scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull , but he could n’t see anyone . “
42192	42197	42198	42198	Harry	447	” he called again . “
42205	42220	42198	42198	Harry	447	” Hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward . “
42226	42240	42198	42198	Harry	447	” Harry said , startled to see her face so white and terrified . “
42249	42261	42247	42247	Harry	447	” Hermione moaned , pulling him as hard as she could . “
42270	42271	42262	42262	You	447	” “
42276	42277	42278	42278	Harry	447	” “
42283	42380	42381	42381	DUCK	315	” Harry turned — Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature Krum — the three of them started across the clearing — but before they had taken a few hurried steps , a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards , appearing from thin air , surrounding them . Harry whirled around , and in an instant , he registered one fact : Each of these wizards had his wand out , and every wand was pointing right at himself , Ron , and Hermione . Without pausing to think , he yelled , “
42383	42397	42381	42381	DUCK	315	” He seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground . “
42400	42469	42381	42381	DUCK	315	” roared twenty voices — there was a blinding series of flashes and Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing . Raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards ’ wands , crossing one another , bouncing off tree trunks , rebounding into the darkness — “
42472	42479	42381	42381	DUCK	315	” yelled a voice he recognized . “
42487	42528	42529	42529	Ron	188	” Harry ’s hair stopped blowing about . He raised his head a little higher . The wizard in front of him had lowered his wand . He rolled over and saw Mr. Weasley striding toward them , looking terrified . “
42532	42539	42540	42540	Hermione	178	” — his voice sounded shaky — “
42547	42548	42554	42554	Arthur	202	” “
42556	42599	42554	42554	Arthur	202	” said a cold , curt voice . It was Mr. Crouch . He and the other Ministry wizards were closing in on them . Harry got to his feet to face them . Mr. Crouch ’s face was taut with rage . “
42606	42617	42602	42602	you	447	” he snapped , his sharp eyes darting between them . “
42626	42627	42620	42620	you	447	” “
42634	42644	42645	42645	We	1538	” said Harry , gesturing up at the skull . “
42651	42667	42645	42645	We	1538	” said Ron , who was rubbing his elbow and looking indignantly at his father . “
42677	42678	42670	42670	you	447	” “
42685	42710	42711	42711	You	447	” shouted Mr. Crouch . His wand was still pointing directly at Ron , and his eyes were popping — he looked slightly mad . “
42722	42723	42724	42724	Barty	269	” “
42726	42737	42724	42724	Barty	269	” whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown , “
42752	42753	42744	42744	they	1540	” “
42764	42770	42757	42757	Mark	316	” said Mr. Weasley quickly . “
42774	42790	42798	42798	they	1543	” said Hermione shakily , pointing at the place where they had heard the voice . “
42805	42806	42798	42798	they	1543	” “
42816	42836	42842	42842	they	1543	” said Mr. Crouch , turning his popping eyes on Hermione now , disbelief etched all over his face . “
42858	42919	42856	42856	missy	1545	” But none of the Ministry wizards apart from Mr. Crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that Harry , Ron , or Hermione had conjured the skull ; on the contrary , at Hermione ’s words , they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated , squinting through the dark trees . “
42925	42939	42920	42920	We	1546	” said the witch in the woolen dressing gown , shaking her head . “
42945	42946	42940	42940	They	1543	” “
42953	42972	42947	42947	I	0	” said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard . It was Amos Diggory , Cedric ’s father . “
42990	42991	42992	42992	Amos	230	” “
42997	43049	42992	42992	Amos	230	” said a few of the wizards warningly as Mr. Diggory squared his shoulders , raised his wand , marched across the clearing , and disappeared into the darkness . Hermione watched him vanish with her hands over her mouth . A few seconds later , they heard Mr. Diggory shout . “
43070	43071	43063	43063	It	872	” “
43077	43086	43075	43075	someone	872	” shouted Mr. Crouch , sounding highly disbelieving . “
43093	43203	43091	43091	it	872	” They heard snapping twigs , the rustling of leaves , and then crunching footsteps as Mr. Diggory reemerged from behind the trees . He was carrying a tiny , limp figure in his arms . Harry recognized the tea towel at once . It was Winky . Mr. Crouch did not move or speak as Mr. Diggory deposited his elf on the ground at his feet . The other Ministry wizards were all staring at Mr. Crouch . For a few seconds Crouch remained transfixed , his eyes blazing in his white face as he stared down at Winky . Then he appeared to come to life again . “
43211	43216	43091	43091	it	872	” he said jerkily . “
43219	43238	43091	43091	it	872	” He moved quickly around Mr. Diggory and strode off toward the place where he had found Winky . “
43245	43252	43242	43243	Mr. Crouch	219	” Mr. Diggory called after him . “
43260	43295	43255	43258	no one else there	1550	” But Mr. Crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it . They could hear him moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside , searching . “
43299	43313	43255	43258	no one else there	1550	” Mr. Diggory said grimly , looking down at Winky ’s unconscious form . “
43326	43327	43321	43321	I	0	” “
43334	43340	43332	43332	Amos	230	” said Mr. Weasley quietly , “
43365	43366	43356	43356	wizard	5061	” “
43369	43374	43376	43376	she	1304	” said Mr. Diggory , “
43381	43382	43376	43376	she	1304	” “
43385	43390	43376	43376	she	1304	” said Mr. Weasley . “
43395	43409	43376	43376	she	1304	” Mr. Diggory held up a wand and showed it to Mr. Weasley . “
43447	43485	43486	43488	The Dark Mark	316	” Just then there was another pop , and Ludo Bagman Apparated right next to Mr. Weasley . Looking breathless and disorientated , he spun on the spot , goggling upward at the emerald - green skull . “
43490	43505	43486	43488	The Dark Mark	316	” he panted , almost trampling Winky as he turned inquiringly to his colleagues . “
43522	43549	43515	43515	Barty	269	” Mr. Crouch had returned empty - handed . His face was still ghostly white , and his hands and his toothbrush mustache were both twitching . “
43557	43561	43555	43555	Barty	269	” said Bagman . “
43582	43593	43570	43571	Your elf	1556	” Bagman had just noticed Winky lying at his feet . “
43599	43600	43570	43571	Your elf	1556	” “
43608	43626	43601	43601	I	0	” said Mr. Crouch , still talking in the same jerky fashion , barely moving his lips . “
43634	43635	43628	43629	my elf	1557	” “
43649	43678	43642	43642	you	269	” Comprehension dawned suddenly on Bagman ’s round , shiny face ; he looked up at the skull , down at Winky , and then at Mr. Crouch . “
43681	43685	43686	43686	Winky	278	” he said . “
43709	43710	43712	43712	she	1556	” “
43716	43721	43712	43712	she	1556	” said Mr. Diggory . “
43755	43792	43747	43747	she	1556	” Crouch gave no sign that he had heard Mr. Diggory , but Mr. Diggory seemed to take his silence for assent . He raised his own wand , pointed it at Winky , and said , “
43795	43902	43903	43903	Elf	318	” Winky stirred feebly . Her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way . Watched by the silent wizards , she raised herself shakily into a sitting position . She caught sight of Mr. Diggory ’s feet , and slowly , tremulously , raised her eyes to stare up into his face ; then , more slowly still , she looked up into the sky . Harry could see the floating skull reflected twice in her enormous , glassy eyes . She gave a gasp , looked wildly around the crowded clearing , and burst into terrified sobs . “
43905	43911	43903	43903	Elf	318	” said Mr. Diggory sternly . “
43935	43967	43919	43919	I	0	” Winky began to rock backward and forward on the ground , her breath coming in sharp bursts . Harry was reminded forcibly of Dobby in his moments of terrified disobedience . “
43985	43990	43919	43919	I	0	” said Mr. Diggory . “
44009	44010	44011	44011	I	0	” “
44023	44027	44015	44015	I	0	” Winky gasped . “
44036	44037	44028	44028	I	0	” “
44048	44082	44038	44038	You	318	” barked Mr. Diggory , brandishing it in front of her . And as the wand caught the green light that was filling the clearing from the skull above , Harry recognized it . “
44089	44101	44038	44038	You	318	” he said . Everyone in the clearing looked at him . “
44105	44112	44038	44038	You	318	” said Mr. Diggory , incredulously . “
44118	44122	44123	44123	I	0	” said Harry . “
44127	44128	44129	44129	You	0	” “
44133	44140	44129	44129	You	0	” repeated Mr. Diggory in disbelief . “
44156	44157	44146	44146	You	0	” “
44167	44175	44158	44158	Amos	230	” said Mr. Weasley , very angrily . “
44186	44187	44177	44178	Harry Potter	447	” “
44194	44199	44200	44200	Sorry	1566	” mumbled Mr. Diggory . “
44205	44206	44200	44200	Sorry	1566	” “
44216	44230	44207	44207	I	0	” said Harry , jerking his thumb toward the trees beneath the skull . “
44242	44243	44231	44231	I	0	” “
44246	44268	44269	44269	You	0	” said Mr. Diggory , his eyes hardening as he turned to look at Winky again , cowering at his feet . “
44296	44297	44294	44294	you	0	” “
44308	44324	44325	44325	I	0	” squealed Winky , tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and bulbous nose . “
44356	44357	44361	44361	her	1572	” “
44363	44388	44361	44361	her	1572	” said Hermione . She looked very nervous , speaking up in front of all these Ministry wizards , yet determined all the same . “
44409	44423	44389	44389	Winky	278	” She looked around at Harry and Ron , appealing for their support . “
44435	44436	44430	44430	Winky	278	” “
44439	44447	44430	44430	Winky	278	” said Harry , shaking his head . “
44457	44458	44454	44455	an elf	1574	” “
44467	44471	44454	44455	an elf	1574	” said Ron . “
44479	44487	44474	44474	we	1573	” growled Mr. Diggory , looking unimpressed . “
44509	44540	44505	44505	you	1562	” Winky trembled and shook her head frantically , her ears flapping , as Mr. Diggory raised his own wand again and placed it tip to tip with Harry ’s . “
44544	44605	44505	44505	you	1562	” roared Mr. Diggory . Harry heard Hermione gasp , horrified , as a gigantic serpent - tongued skull erupted from the point where the two wands met , but it was a mere shadow of the green skull high above them ; it looked as though it were made of thick gray smoke : the ghost of a spell . “
44608	44624	44505	44505	you	1562	” Mr. Diggory shouted , and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of smoke . “
44627	44649	44650	44650	I	0	” said Mr. Diggory with a kind of savage triumph , looking down upon Winky , who was still shaking convulsively . “
44656	44666	44650	44650	I	0	” she squealed , her eyes rolling in terror . “
44699	44700	44693	44693	I	0	” “
44711	44716	44701	44701	You	0	” Mr. Diggory roared . “
44726	44727	44728	44728	Amos	230	” “
44730	44736	44728	44728	Amos	230	” said Mr. Weasley loudly , “
44758	44759	44761	44761	Amos	230	” “
44765	44776	44761	44761	Amos	230	” said Mr. Crouch , cold anger in every syllable , “
44789	44802	44803	44804	Mr. Crouch	219	” There was a deeply unpleasant silence . Amos Diggory looked horrified . “
44812	44813	44814	44814	You	0	” “
44837	44842	44843	44844	Harry Potter	447	” barked Mr. Crouch . “
44862	44863	44860	44860	Amos	230	” “
44870	44879	44860	44860	Amos	230	” muttered Mr. Diggory , looking highly discomforted . “
44911	44921	44922	44923	Mr. Crouch	219	” Mr. Crouch shouted , his eyes bulging again . “
44938	44952	44927	44927	I	0	” Amos Diggory muttered again , now reddening behind his scrubby brown beard . “
44965	44970	44959	44959	you	0	” shouted Mr. Crouch . “
44981	44982	44983	44983	She	1557	” “
44993	44994	44985	44985	she	1557	” “
44999	45004	44997	44997	Amos	230	” said Mr. Weasley . “
45015	45037	45013	45013	Winky	278	” he said kindly , turning to the elf , but she flinched as though he too was shouting at her . “
45047	45067	45068	45068	I	0	” Winky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently that it was fraying beneath her fingers . “
45081	45085	45079	45079	sir	5372	” she whispered , “
45094	45095	45099	45099	Amos	230	” “
45101	45106	45099	45099	Amos	230	” said Mr. Weasley . “
45163	45164	45146	45146	Winky	278	” “
45182	45188	45189	45189	Elf	318	” said Mr. Diggory impatiently . “
45196	45228	45229	45229	I	0	” Winky began to tremble worse than ever . Her giant eyes flickered from Mr. Diggory , to Ludo Bagman , and onto Mr. Crouch . Then she gulped and said , “
45240	45241	45242	45242	Amos	230	” “
45244	45250	45242	45242	Amos	230	” said Mr. Crouch curtly , “
45290	45332	45276	45276	I	0	” Mr. Diggory looked as though he did n’t think much of this suggestion at all , but it was clear to Harry that Mr. Crouch was such an important member of the Ministry that he did not dare refuse him . “
45343	45349	45350	45354	M - m - master	1596	” Mr. Crouch added coldly . “
45356	45372	45373	45377	M - m - master	1596	” Winky stammered , looking up at Mr. Crouch , her eyes brimming with tears . “
45385	45412	45413	45413	Winky	278	” Mr. Crouch stared back , his face somehow sharpened , each line upon it more deeply etched . There was no pity in his gaze . “
45427	45432	45433	45433	I	0	” he said slowly . “
45469	45470	45461	45461	she	278	” “
45473	45485	45488	45488	master	5398	” shrieked Winky , prostrating herself at Mr. Crouch ’s feet . “
45496	45540	45542	45542	she	278	” Harry knew that the only way to turn a house - elf free was to present it with proper garments . It was pitiful to see the way Winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over Mr. Crouch ’s feet . “
45546	45557	45542	45542	she	278	” Hermione burst out angrily , glaring at Mr. Crouch . “
45588	45625	45574	45574	You	5398	” Mr. Crouch took a step backward , freeing himself from contact with the elf , whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his over - shined shoes . “
45639	45649	45650	45650	I	0	” he said coldly , looking over at Hermione . “
45673	45705	45708	45708	I	0	” Winky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed around the clearing . There was a very nasty silence , which was ended by Mr. Weasley , who said quietly , “
45747	45759	45727	45727	Amos	230	” Mr. Diggory handed Harry his wand and Harry pocketed it . “
45766	45791	45763	45763	you	1609	” Mr. Weasley said quietly . But Hermione did n’t seem to want to move ; her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf . “
45794	45819	45792	45792	Hermione	178	” Mr. Weasley said , more urgently . She turned and followed Harry and Ron out of the clearing and off through the trees . “
45828	45840	45841	45841	I	0	” said Hermione , the moment they had left the clearing . “
45846	45851	45841	45841	I	0	” said Mr. Weasley . “
45859	45864	45865	45866	Mr. Diggory	238	” said Hermione furiously . “
45922	45923	45897	45897	He	219	” “
45930	45939	45897	45897	He	219	” said Ron . Hermione rounded on him . “
45958	45959	45960	45960	Hermione	178	” “
45967	45977	45962	45962	I	0	” said Mr. Weasley quickly , beckoning her on , “
46009	46010	46011	46011	We	1613	” “
46018	46022	46023	46023	Dad	189	” said Ron . “
46035	46036	46037	46037	I	0	” “
46046	46097	46037	46037	I	0	” said Mr. Weasley tensely . But when they reached the edge of the wood , their progress was impeded . A large crowd of frightened - looking witches and wizards was congregated there , and when they saw Mr. Weasley coming toward them , many of them surged forward . “
46105	46106	46037	46037	I	0	” “
46111	46112	46113	46113	Arthur	202	” “
46121	46122	46113	46113	Arthur	202	” “
46130	46136	46113	46113	Arthur	202	” said Mr. Weasley impatiently . “
46164	46216	46217	46217	Dad	189	” He led Harry , Ron , and Hermione through the crowd and back into the campsite . All was quiet now ; there was no sign of the masked wizards , though several ruined tents were still smoking . Charlie ’s head was poking out of the boys ’ tent . “
46224	46231	46232	46232	Fred	192	” he called through the dark . “
46246	46247	46243	46244	the others	957	” “
46254	46326	46248	46248	I	0	” said Mr. Weasley , bending down and entering the tent . Harry , Ron , and Hermione entered after him . Bill was sitting at the small kitchen table , holding a bedsheet to his arm , which was bleeding profusely . Charlie had a large rip in his shirt , and Percy was sporting a bloody nose . Fred , George , and Ginny looked unhurt , though shaken . “
46334	46339	46328	46328	you	0	” said Bill sharply . “
46347	46348	46340	46345	The person who conjured the Mark	1621	” “
46351	46356	46340	46345	The person who conjured the Mark	1621	” said Mr. Weasley . “
46381	46382	46369	46369	we	1622	” “
46385	46395	46396	46396	Harry	447	” said Bill , Charlie , and Percy together . “
46400	46404	46396	46396	Harry	447	” said Fred . “
46410	46449	46405	46406	Mr. Crouch	219	” said Percy , sounding thunderstruck . With some assistance from Harry , Ron , and Hermione , Mr. Weasley explained what had happened in the woods . When they had finished their story , Percy swelled indignantly . “
46466	46470	46474	46474	he	219	” he said . “
46514	46515	46498	46498	she	1625	” “
46534	46566	46567	46567	Hermione	178	” Hermione snapped at Percy , who looked very taken aback . Hermione had always got on fairly well with Percy — better , indeed , than any of the others . “
46593	46601	46602	46602	She	1625	” said Percy pompously , recovering himself . “
46608	46612	46613	46613	She	1625	” shouted Hermione . “
46622	46623	46613	46613	She	1625	” “
46636	46641	46627	46627	someone	872	” said Ron impatiently . “
46656	46657	46658	46658	I	0	” “
46674	46684	46672	46672	Ron	188	” said Hermione , before anyone else could answer . “
46699	46700	46685	46685	I	0	” “
46711	46717	46685	46685	I	0	” said Mr. Weasley quietly . “
46736	46737	46728	46728	You	1633	” “
46744	46750	46738	46738	I	0	” said Ron , frowning . “
46764	46765	46766	46766	Ron	188	” “
46787	46792	46774	46774	his	1635	” said Mr. Weasley . “
46832	46837	46838	46838	Everyone	658	” Mr. Weasley winced . “
46847	46872	46838	46838	Everyone	658	” There was silence for a moment . Then Bill , removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut , said , “
46934	46935	46925	46925	They	1644	” “
46939	46943	46936	46937	Death Eaters	1645	” said Harry . “
46949	46950	46946	46947	Death Eaters	320	” “
46964	46968	46962	46962	themselves	1647	” said Bill . “
46993	46994	46995	46995	We	1641	” “
47005	47010	47003	47003	Bill	209	” said Mr. Weasley . “
47016	47021	47003	47003	Bill	209	” he added hopelessly . “
47029	47034	47035	47035	Dad	189	” said Ron suddenly . “
47078	47079	47066	47067	the Malfoys	287	” “
47087	47110	47083	47085	Voldemort ’s supporters	1655	” Harry began . Everybody flinched — like most of the Wizarding world , the Weasleys always avoided saying Voldemort ’s name . “
47113	47118	47083	47085	Voldemort ’s supporters	1655	” said Harry quickly . “
47142	47143	47134	47134	I	0	” “
47147	47156	47157	47157	Harry	447	” said Mr. Weasley with a hollow laugh . “
47216	47221	47226	47228	the Death Eaters	1643	” he finished disgustedly . “
47241	47245	47235	47235	they	1647	” said Ron . “
47259	47260	47257	47257	they	1647	” “
47267	47271	47265	47265	Ron	188	” said Bill . “
47371	47372	47369	47369	you	1667	” “
47381	47386	47388	47388	they	1647	” said Hermione slowly , “

47417	47422	47407	47407	Your	1667	” said Mr. Weasley . “
47511	47673	47506	47506	Portkey	239	” Harry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing . He knew he ought to feel exhausted : It was nearly three in the morning , but he felt wide - awake — wide - awake , and worried . Three days ago — it felt like much longer , but it had only been three days — he had awoken with his scar burning . And tonight , for the first time in thirteen years , Lord Voldemort ’s mark had appeared in the sky . What did these things mean ? He thought of the letter he had written to Sirius before leaving Privet Drive . Would Sirius have gotten it yet ? When would he reply ? Harry lay looking up at the canvas , but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep , and it was a long time after Charlie ’s snores filled the tent that Harry finally dozed off .
47733	47737	47726	47726	he	241	“ Merry Christmas . ”
47738	47745	47747	47748	Mr. Weasley	190	“ He ’ll be all right , ”
47758	47792	47747	47748	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Sometimes , when a person ’s memory ’s modified , it makes him a bit disorientated for a while ... and that was a big thing they had to make him forget . ”
47934	47942	47943	47944	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Oh thank goodness , thank goodness ! ”
47989	48001	48002	48002	She	191	“ Arthur — I ’ve been so worried — so worried — ”
48061	48067	48068	48069	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ You ’re all right , ”
48086	48094	48101	48101	she	191	“ you ’re alive ... Oh boys ... ”
48121	48131	48101	48101	she	191	“ Ouch ! Mum — you ’re strangling us — ”
48132	48141	48142	48143	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ I shouted at you before you left ! ”
48150	48194	48142	48143	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ It ’s all I ’ve been thinking about ! What if You - Know - Who had got you , and the last thing I ever said to you was that you did n’t get enough O.W.L.s ? Oh Fred ... George ... ”
48195	48209	48211	48212	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Come on , now , Molly , we ’re all perfectly okay , ”
48228	48231	48232	48232	he	190	“ Bill , ”
48238	48252	48232	48232	he	190	“ pick up that paper , I want to see what it says ... ”
48310	48315	48317	48318	Mr. Weasley	190	“ I knew it , ”
48321	48352	48317	48318	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Ministry blunders ... culprits not apprehended ... lax security ... Dark wizards running unchecked ... national disgrace ... Who wrote this ? Ah ... of course ... Rita Skeeter . ”
48353	48366	48368	48368	Percy	273	“ That woman ’s got it in for the Ministry of Magic ! ”
48371	48419	48368	48368	Percy	273	“ Last week she was saying we ’re wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness , when we should be stamping out vampires ! As if it was n’t specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non - Wizard Part - Humans — ”
48420	48428	48430	48430	Bill	209	“ Do us a favor , Perce , ”
48434	48439	48430	48430	Bill	209	“ and shut up . ”
48440	48445	48447	48448	Mr. Weasley	190	“ I ’m mentioned , ”
48467	48470	48472	48473	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Where ? ”
48482	48497	48472	48473	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ If I ’d seen that , I ’d have known you were alive ! ”
48498	48503	48505	48506	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Not by name , ”
48508	48603	48505	48506	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Listen to this : ‘ If the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the Ministry of Magic , they were sadly disappointed . A Ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the Dark Mark alleging that nobody had been hurt , but refusing to give any more information . Whether this statement will be enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods an hour later , remains to be seen . ’ Oh really , ”
48616	48651	48652	48652	He	273	“ Nobody was hurt . What was I supposed to say ? Rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods ... well , there certainly will be rumors now she ’s printed that . ”
48658	48681	48652	48652	He	273	“ Molly , I ’m going to have to go into the office ; this is going to take some smoothing over . ”
48682	48691	48693	48693	Percy	273	“ I ’ll come with you , Father , ”
48696	48717	48718	48718	He	273	“ Mr. Crouch will need all hands on deck . And I can give him my cauldron report in person . ”
48731	48761	48725	48726	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Arthur , you ’re supposed to be on holiday ! This has n’t got anything to do with your office ; surely they can handle this without you ? ”
48762	48771	48773	48774	Mr. Weasley	190	“ I ’ve got to go , Molly , ”
48776	48796	48773	48774	Mr. Weasley	190	“ I ’ve made things worse . I ’ll just change into my robes and I ’ll be off ... ”
48797	48801	48803	48803	Harry	447	“ Mrs. Weasley , ”
48811	48825	48809	48809	himself	447	“ Hedwig has n’t arrived with a letter for me , has she ? ”
48826	48831	48833	48834	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Hedwig , dear ? ”
48837	48851	48833	48834	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ No ... no , there has n’t been any post at all . ”
48871	48887	48868	48868	he	447	“ All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room , Ron ? ”
48888	48896	48898	48898	Ron	188	“ Yeah ... think I will too , ”
48902	48905	48898	48898	Ron	188	“ Hermione ? ”
48906	48909	48910	48910	she	178	“ Yes , ”
48929	48936	48938	48938	Ron	188	“ What ’s up , Harry ? ”
48954	48964	48965	48965	Harry	447	“ There ’s something I have n’t told you , ”
48968	48982	48965	48965	Harry	447	“ On Saturday morning , I woke up with my scar hurting again . ”
49039	49075	49034	49034	Ron	188	“ But — he was n’t there , was he ? You - Know - Who ? I mean — last time your scar kept hurting , he was at Hogwarts , was n’t he ? ”
49076	49087	49089	49089	Harry	447	“ I ’m sure he was n’t on Privet Drive , ”
49091	49126	49127	49127	He	447	“ But I was dreaming about him ... him and Peter — you know , Wormtail . I ca n’t remember all of it now , but they were plotting to kill ... someone . ”
49138	49141	49127	49127	He	447	“ me , ”
49159	49166	49168	49168	Ron	188	“ It was only a dream , ”
49171	49176	49168	49168	Ron	188	“ Just a nightmare . ”
49177	49186	49188	49188	Harry	447	“ Yeah , but was it , though ? ”
49202	49239	49188	49188	Harry	447	“ It ’s weird , is n’t it ? ... My scar hurts , and three days later the Death Eaters are on the march , and Voldemort ’s sign ’s up in the sky again . ”
49240	49250	49251	49251	Ron	188	“ Do n’t — say — his — name ! ”
49257	49265	49266	49266	Harry	447	“ And remember what Professor Trelawney said ? ”
49273	49281	49266	49266	Harry	447	“ At the end of last year ? ”
49304	49322	49297	49297	she	178	“ Oh Harry , you are n’t going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says ? ”
49323	49329	49331	49331	Harry	447	“ You were n’t there , ”
49333	49399	49331	49331	Harry	447	“ You did n’t hear her . This time was different . I told you , she went into a trance — a real one . And she said the Dark Lord would rise again ... greater and more terrible than ever before ... and he ’d manage it because his servant was going to go back to him ... and that night Wormtail escaped . ”
49418	49430	49431	49431	Hermione	178	“ Why were you asking if Hedwig had come , Harry ? ”
49434	49441	49431	49431	Hermione	178	“ Are you expecting a letter ? ”
49442	49450	49452	49452	Harry	447	“ I told Sirius about my scar , ”
49456	49464	49452	49452	Harry	447	“ I ’m waiting for his answer . ”
49465	49469	49471	49471	Ron	188	“ Good thinking ! ”
49477	49486	49473	49473	his	188	“ I bet Sirius’ll know what to do ! ”
49487	49498	49500	49500	Harry	447	“ I hoped he ’d get back to me quickly , ”
49502	49524	49526	49526	Hermione	178	“ But we do n’t know where Sirius is ... he could be in Africa or somewhere , could n’t he ? ”
49529	49543	49526	49526	Hermione	178	“ Hedwig ’s not going to manage that journey in a few days . ”
49544	49550	49552	49552	Harry	447	“ Yeah , I know , ”
49577	49591	49593	49593	Ron	188	“ Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard , Harry , ”
49595	49621	49593	49593	Ron	188	“ Come on — three on three , Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will play ... You can try out the Wronski Feint ... ”
49622	49625	49627	49627	Hermione	178	“ Ron , ”
49648	49676	49627	49627	Hermione	178	“ Harry does n’t want to play Quidditch right now ... He ’s worried , and he ’s tired ... We all need to go to bed ... ”
49677	49686	49688	49688	Harry	447	“ Yeah , I want to play Quidditch , ”
49691	49701	49688	49688	Harry	447	“ Hang on , I ’ll get my Firebolt . ”
49714	49717	49702	49702	Hermione	178	“ Boys . ”
49755	49763	49764	49764	Percy	273	“ It ’s been an absolute uproar , ”
49780	49826	49764	49764	Percy	273	“ I ’ve been putting out fires all week . People keep sending Howlers , and of course , if you do n’t open a Howler straight away , it explodes . Scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to cinders . ”
49827	49835	49837	49837	Ginny	213	“ Why are they all sending Howlers ? ”
49864	49873	49875	49875	Percy	273	“ Complaining about security at the World Cup , ”
49877	49927	49875	49875	Percy	273	“ They want compensation for their ruined property . Mundungus Fletcher ’s put in a claim for a twelve - bedroomed tent with en - suite Jacuzzi , but I ’ve got his number . I know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks . ”
50000	50003	50071	50072	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Home , ”

50092	50115	50116	50116	she	191	“ Your father has n’t had to go into the office on weekends since the days of You - Know - Who , ”
50119	50143	50116	50116	she	191	“ They ’re working him far too hard . His dinner ’s going to be ruined if he does n’t come home soon . ”
50144	50166	50168	50168	Percy	273	“ Well , Father feels he ’s got to make up for his mistake at the match , does n’t he ? ”
50170	50196	50168	50168	Percy	273	“ If truth be told , he was a tad unwise to make a public statement without clearing it with his Head of Department first — ”
50197	50213	50215	50216	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Do n’t you dare blame your father for what that wretched Skeeter woman wrote ! ”
50223	50248	50250	50250	Bill	209	“ If Dad had n’t said anything , old Rita would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from the Ministry had commented , ”
50259	50290	50250	50250	Bill	209	“ Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look good . Remember , she interviewed all the Gringotts Charm Breakers once , and called me ‘ a long - haired pillock ’ ? ”
50291	50302	50304	50305	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Well , it is a bit long , dear , ”
50308	50316	50304	50305	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ If you ’d just let me — ”
50317	50322	50250	50250	Bill	209	“ No , Mum . ”
50418	50426	50432	50432	her	191	“ What are you two up to ? ”
50438	50441	50443	50443	Fred	192	“ Homework , ”
50446	50458	50460	50461	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Do n’t be ridiculous , you ’re still on holiday , ”
50463	50474	50476	50476	George	193	“ Yeah , we ’ve left it a bit late , ”
50478	50495	50497	50498	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ You ’re not by any chance writing out a new order form , are you ? ”
50501	50520	50497	50498	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ You would n’t be thinking of re - starting Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes , by any chance ? ”
50521	50526	50528	50528	Fred	192	“ Now , Mum , ”
50542	50576	50539	50539	his	1718	“ If the Hogwarts Express crashed tomorrow , and George and I died , how would you feel to know that the last thing we ever heard from you was an unfounded accusation ? ”
50584	50591	50592	50592	she	191	“ Oh your father ’s coming ! ”

50686	50698	50699	50699	he	190	“ Well , the fat ’s really in the fire now , ”
50722	50781	50699	50699	he	190	“ Rita Skeeter ’s been ferreting around all week , looking for more Ministry mess - ups to report . And now she ’s found out about poor old Bertha going missing , so that ’ll be the headline in the Prophet tomorrow . I told Bagman he should have sent someone to look for her ages ago . ”
50782	50794	50796	50796	Percy	273	“ Mr. Crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks , ”
50799	50812	50814	50815	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Crouch is very lucky Rita has n’t found out about Winky , ”
50818	50844	50814	50815	Mr. Weasley	190	“ There ’d be a week ’s worth of headlines in his house - elf being caught holding the wand that conjured the Dark Mark . ”
50845	50865	50867	50867	Percy	273	“ I thought we were all agreed that that elf , while irresponsible , did not conjure the Mark ? ”
50870	50895	50897	50897	Hermione	178	“ If you ask me , Mr. Crouch is very lucky no one at the Daily Prophet knows how mean he is to elves ! ”
50900	50907	50909	50909	Percy	273	“ Now look here , Hermione ! ”
50911	50928	50909	50909	Percy	273	“ A high - ranking Ministry official like Mr. Crouch deserves unswerving obedience from his servants — ”
50929	50936	50940	50940	her	178	“ His slave , you mean ! ”
50945	50956	50940	50940	her	178	“ because he did n’t pay Winky , did he ? ”
50957	50974	50976	50977	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ I think you ’d all better go upstairs and check that you ’ve packed properly ! ”
50984	50993	50976	50977	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Come on now , all of you ... ”
51082	51089	51091	51091	Ron	188	“ Bung him some Owl Treats , ”
51100	51107	51091	51091	Ron	188	“ It might shut him up . ”
51139	51147	51148	51148	Harry	447	“ It ’s been over a week , ”
51158	51173	51148	51148	Harry	447	“ Ron , you do n’t reckon Sirius has been caught , do you ? ”
51174	51186	51188	51188	Ron	188	“ Nah , it would ’ve been in the Daily Prophet , ”
51190	51206	51188	51188	Ron	188	“ The Ministry would want to show they ’d caught someone , would n’t they ? ”
51207	51213	51148	51148	Harry	447	“ Yeah , I suppose ... ”
51214	51250	51251	51251	He	188	“ Look , here ’s the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon Alley . And she ’s got some gold out of your vault for you ... and she ’s washed all your socks . ”
51353	51361	51362	51362	He	188	“ What is that supposed to be ? ”
51417	51422	51423	51423	she	191	“ Here you are , ”
51432	51446	51423	51423	she	191	“ Now , mind you pack them properly so they do n’t crease . ”
51447	51459	51461	51461	Ron	188	“ Mum , you ’ve given me Ginny ’s new dress , ”
51469	51476	51478	51479	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Of course I have n’t , ”
51481	51490	51478	51479	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ That ’s for you . Dress robes . ”
51491	51494	51496	51496	Ron	188	“ What ? ”
51503	51507	51496	51496	Ron	188	“ Dress robes ! ”
51512	51535	51509	51510	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ It says on your school list that you ’re supposed to have dress robes this year ... robes for formal occasions . ”
51536	51544	51546	51546	Ron	188	“ You ’ve got to be kidding , ”
51550	51560	51546	51546	Ron	188	“ I ’m not wearing that , no way . ”
51561	51568	51570	51571	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Everyone wears them , Ron ! ”
51574	51590	51570	51571	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ They ’re all like that ! Your father ’s got some for smart parties ! ”
51591	51602	51604	51604	Ron	188	“ I ’ll go starkers before I put that on , ”
51607	51614	51616	51617	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Do n’t be so silly , ”
51619	51646	51616	51617	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ You ’ve got to have dress robes , they ’re on your list ! I got some for Harry too ... show him , Harry ... ”
51711	51726	51728	51729	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ I thought they ’d bring out the color of your eyes , dear , ”
51732	51739	51741	51741	Ron	188	“ Well , they ’re okay ! ”
51750	51760	51741	51741	Ron	188	“ Why could n’t I have some like that ? ”
51761	51782	51784	51785	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Because ... well , I had to get yours secondhand , and there was n’t a lot of choice ! ”
51818	51825	51826	51826	Ron	188	“ I ’m never wearing them , ”
51831	51834	51826	51826	Ron	188	“ Never . ”
51835	51838	51840	51841	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Fine , ”
51843	51869	51870	51870	She	191	“ Go naked . And , Harry , make sure you get a picture of him . Goodness knows I could do with a laugh . ”
51900	51908	51910	51910	Ron	188	“ Why is everything I own rubbish ? ”
52011	52014	52015	52015	she	191	“ Arthur ! ”
52021	52030	52015	52015	she	191	“ Arthur ! Urgent message from the Ministry ! ”
52077	52086	52069	52070	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ I ’ve got a quill here somewhere ! ”
52157	52194	52136	52136	It	1738	“ . . . Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting , so they went and called those what - d’you - call-’ems — please - men . Arthur , you ’ve got to get over there — ”
52195	52198	52200	52201	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Here ! ”
52225	52239	52241	52242	Mr. Diggory	238	“ — it ’s a real stroke of luck I heard about it , ”
52246	52286	52241	52242	Mr. Diggory	238	“ I had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls , and I found the Improper Use of Magic lot all setting off — if Rita Skeeter gets hold of this one , Arthur — ”
52287	52296	52298	52299	Mr. Weasley	190	“ What does Mad - Eye say happened ? ”
52325	52350	52317	52318	Mr. Diggory	238	“ Says he heard an intruder in his yard . Says he was creeping toward the house , but was ambushed by his dustbins . ”
52351	52358	52360	52361	Mr. Weasley	190	“ What did the dustbins do ? ”
52366	52385	52387	52388	Mr. Diggory	238	“ Made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere , as far as I can tell , ”
52390	52407	52387	52388	Mr. Diggory	238	“ Apparently one of them was still rocketing around when the please - men turned up — ”
52412	52419	52317	52318	Mr. Diggory	238	“ And what about the intruder ? ”
52420	52429	52431	52432	Mr. Diggory	238	“ Arthur , you know Mad - Eye , ”
52441	52521	52317	52318	Mr. Diggory	238	“ Someone creeping into his yard in the dead of night ? More likely there ’s a very shell - shocked cat wandering around somewhere , covered in potato peelings . But if the Improper Use of Magic lot get their hands on Mad - Eye , he ’s had it — think of his record — we ’ve got to get him off on a minor charge , something in your department — what are exploding dustbins worth ? ”
52522	52528	52530	52531	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Might be a caution , ”
52542	52559	52538	52538	his	190	“ Mad - Eye did n’t use his wand ? He did n’t actually attack anyone ? ”
52560	52580	52582	52583	Mr. Diggory	238	“ I ’ll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach through the window , ”
52585	52601	52582	52583	Mr. Diggory	238	“ but they ’ll have a job proving it , there are n’t any casualties . ”
52602	52610	52611	52612	Mr. Weasley	190	“ All right , I ’m off , ”
52646	52653	52636	52637	Mr. Diggory	238	“ Sorry about this , Molly , ”
52660	52704	52636	52637	Mr. Diggory	238	“ bothering you so early and everything ... but Arthur ’s the only one who can get Mad - Eye off , and Mad - Eye ’s supposed to be starting his new job today . Why he had to choose last night ... ”
52705	52711	52713	52714	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Never mind , Amos , ”
52716	52732	52713	52714	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Sure you wo n’t have a bit of toast or anything before you go ? ”
52733	52740	52742	52743	Mr. Diggory	238	“ Oh go on , then , ”
52777	52780	52781	52781	he	238	“ Fanks , ”
52845	52859	52861	52862	Mr. Weasley	190	“ I ’d better hurry — you have a good term , boys , ”
52883	52901	52861	52862	Mr. Weasley	190	“ Molly , are you going to be all right taking the kids to King ’s Cross ? ”
52902	52908	52909	52909	she	1743	“ Of course I will , ”
52912	52926	52909	52909	she	1743	“ You just look after Mad - Eye , we ’ll be fine . ”
52939	52947	52948	52948	Bill	209	“ Did someone say Mad - Eye ? ”
52951	52960	52948	52948	Bill	209	“ What ’s he been up to now ? ”
52961	52974	52976	52977	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ He says someone tried to break into his house last night , ”
52979	52985	52987	52987	George	193	“ Mad - Eye Moody ? ”
52996	53003	52987	52987	George	193	“ Is n’t he that nutter — ”
53004	53016	53018	53019	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Your father thinks very highly of Mad - Eye Moody , ”
53022	53035	53037	53037	Fred	192	“ Yeah , well , Dad collects plugs , does n’t he ? ”
53046	53052	53040	53041	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Birds of a feather ... ”
53053	53063	53065	53065	Bill	209	“ Moody was a great wizard in his time , ”
53067	53081	53083	53083	Charlie	210	“ He ’s an old friend of Dumbledore ’s , is n’t he ? ”
53085	53100	53102	53102	Fred	192	“ Dumbledore ’s not what you ’d call normal , though , is he ? ”
53104	53117	53102	53102	Fred	192	“ I mean , I know he ’s a genius and everything ... ”
53118	53125	53127	53127	Harry	447	“ Who is Mad - Eye ? ”
53129	53141	53143	53143	Charlie	210	“ He ’s retired , used to work at the Ministry , ”
53145	53175	53176	53176	he	210	“ I met him once when Dad took me in to work with him . He was an Auror — one of the best ... a Dark wizard catcher , ”
53185	53240	53180	53180	Harry	447	“ Half the cells in Azkaban are full because of him . He made himself loads of enemies , though ... the families of people he caught , mainly ... and I heard he ’s been getting really paranoid in his old age . Does n’t trust anyone anymore . Sees Dark wizards everywhere . ”
53274	53288	53289	53289	he	273	“ I just ca n’t justify taking more time off at the moment , ”
53293	53304	53289	53289	he	273	“ Mr. Crouch is really starting to rely on me . ”
53305	53314	53316	53316	George	193	“ Yeah , you know what , Percy ? ”
53319	53329	53316	53316	George	193	“ I reckon he ’ll know your name soon . ”
53353	53363	53364	53365	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Arthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us , ”
53392	53413	53414	53414	Harry	447	“ But there were n’t any to spare ... Oh dear , they do n’t look happy , do they ? ”
53802	53814	53816	53816	Charlie	210	“ I might be seeing you all sooner than you think , ”
53828	53831	53833	53833	Fred	192	“ Why ? ”
53836	53841	53843	53843	Charlie	210	“ You ’ll see , ”
53845	53877	53843	53843	Charlie	210	“ Just do n’t tell Percy I mentioned it ... it ’s ‘ classified information , until such time as the Ministry sees fit to release it , ’ after all . ”
53878	53893	53895	53895	Bill	209	“ Yeah , I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this year , ”
53909	53912	53914	53914	George	193	“ Why ? ”
53917	53927	53929	53929	Bill	209	“ You ’re going to have an interesting year , ”
53935	53951	53931	53931	his	209	“ I might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it ... ”
53952	53958	53960	53960	Ron	188	“ A bit of what ? ”
53981	53992	53994	53994	Hermione	178	“ Thanks for having us to stay , Mrs. Weasley , ”
54016	54026	54028	54028	Harry	447	“ Yeah , thanks for everything , Mrs. Weasley , ”
54030	54039	54041	54042	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Oh it was my pleasure , dears , ”
54044	54077	54041	54042	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ I ’d invite you for Christmas , but ... well , I expect you ’re all going to want to stay at Hogwarts , what with ... one thing and another . ”
54078	54081	54083	54083	Ron	188	“ Mum ! ”
54086	54096	54083	54083	Ron	188	“ What d’you three know that we do n’t ? ”
54097	54108	54110	54111	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ You ’ll find out this evening , I expect , ”
54115	54137	54110	54111	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ It ’s going to be very exciting — mind you , I ’m very glad they ’ve changed the rules — ”
54138	54142	54144	54144	Harry	447	“ What rules ? ”
54154	54183	54151	54151	George	193	“ I ’m sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you ... Now , behave , wo n’t you ? Wo n’t you , Fred ? And you , George ? ”
54195	54204	54205	54205	Fred	192	“ Tell us what ’s happening at Hogwarts ! ”
54224	54231	54218	54218	Charlie	210	“ What rules are they changing ? ”
54309	54321	54322	54322	he	188	“ Bagman wanted to tell us what ’s happening at Hogwarts , ”
54332	54351	54322	54322	he	188	“ At the World Cup , remember ? But my own mother wo n’t say . Wonder what — ”
54352	54355	54356	54356	Hermione	178	“ Shh ! ”
54393	54493	54494	54494	Hermione	178	“ . . . Father actually considered sending me to Durmstrang rather than Hogwarts , you know . He knows the headmaster , you see . Well , you know his opinion of Dumbledore — the man ’s such a Mudblood - lover — and Durmstrang does n’t admit that sort of riffraff . But Mother did n’t like the idea of me going to school so far away . Father says Durmstrang takes a far more sensible line than Hogwarts about the Dark Arts . Durmstrang students actually learn them , not just the defense rubbish we do ... ”
54515	54528	54529	54529	she	178	“ So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him , does he ? ”
54533	54551	54529	54529	she	178	“ I wish he had gone , then we would n’t have to put up with him . ”
54552	54559	54561	54561	Harry	447	“ Durmstrang ’s another Wizarding school ? ”
54563	54566	54568	54568	Hermione	178	“ Yes , ”
54571	54601	54568	54568	Hermione	178	“ and it ’s got a horrible reputation . According to An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe , it puts a lot of emphasis on the Dark Arts . ”
54602	54611	54613	54613	Ron	188	“ I think I ’ve heard of it , ”
54616	54624	54613	54613	Ron	188	“ Where is it ? What country ? ”
54625	54634	54639	54639	her	178	“ Well , nobody knows , do they ? ”
54642	54648	54650	54650	Harry	447	“ Er — why not ? ”
54652	54682	54684	54684	Hermione	178	“ There ’s traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools . Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal their secrets , ”
54691	54696	54698	54698	Ron	188	“ Come off it , ”
54704	54728	54698	54698	Ron	188	“ Durmstrang ’s got to be about the same size as Hogwarts — how are you going to hide a great big castle ? ”
54729	54735	54737	54737	Hermione	178	“ But Hogwarts is hidden , ”
54742	54760	54737	54737	Hermione	178	“ Everyone knows that ... well , everyone who ’s read Hogwarts : A History , anyway . ”
54761	54767	54769	54769	Ron	188	“ Just you , then , ”
54771	54784	54769	54769	Ron	188	“ So go on — how d’you hide a place like Hogwarts ? ”
54785	54790	54792	54792	Hermione	178	“ It ’s bewitched , ”
54794	54825	54792	54792	Hermione	178	“ If a Muggle looks at it , all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying DANGER , DO NOT ENTER , UNSAFE . ”
54826	54839	54769	54769	Ron	188	“ So Durmstrang’ll just look like a ruin to an outsider too ? ”
54840	54843	54845	54845	Hermione	178	“ Maybe , ”
54849	54883	54845	54845	Hermione	178	“ or it might have Muggle - repelling charms on it , like the World Cup stadium . And to keep foreign wizards from finding it , they ’ll have made it Unplottable — ”
54884	54888	54769	54769	Ron	188	“ Come again ? ”
54889	54911	54922	54922	Harry	447	“ Well , you can enchant a building so it ’s impossible to plot on a map , ca n’t you ? ”
54912	54920	54922	54922	Harry	447	“ Er ... if you say so , ”
54924	54937	54939	54939	Hermione	178	“ But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north , ”
54942	54959	54939	54939	Hermione	178	“ Somewhere very cold , because they ’ve got fur capes as part of their uniforms . ”
54960	54968	54970	54970	Ron	188	“ Ah , think of the possibilities , ”
54973	55000	54970	54970	Ron	188	“ It would ’ve been so easy to push Malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an accident ... Shame his mother likes him ... ”
55123	55130	55149	55149	Hermione	178	“ Troy — Mullet — Moran ! ”
55197	55205	55206	55206	he	337	“ Gran did n’t want to go , ”
55210	55221	55206	55206	he	337	“ Would n’t buy tickets . It sounded amazing though . ”
55222	55226	55228	55228	Ron	188	“ It was , ”
55230	55237	55238	55238	He	188	“ Look at this , Neville ... ”
55258	55262	55264	55264	Neville	337	“ Oh wow , ”
55275	55286	55288	55288	Ron	188	“ We saw him right up close , as well , ”
55290	55298	55288	55288	Ron	188	“ We were in the Top Box — ”
55299	55312	55313	55314	Draco Malfoy	282	“ For the first and last time in your life , Weasley . ”
55368	55380	55382	55382	Harry	447	“ Do n’t remember asking you to join us , Malfoy , ”
55385	55392	55394	55394	Malfoy	282	“ Weasley ... what is that ? ”
55454	55459	55461	55461	Malfoy	282	“ Look at this ! ”
55476	55501	55520	55520	he	188	“ Weasley , you were n’t thinking of wearing these , were you ? I mean — they were very fashionable in about 1890 ... ”
55502	55508	55510	55510	Ron	188	“ Eat dung , Malfoy ! ”
55542	55588	55538	55538	Goyle	523	“ So ... going to enter , Weasley ? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name ? There ’s money involved as well , you know ... you ’d be able to afford some decent robes if you won ... ”
55589	55596	55598	55598	Ron	188	“ What are you talking about ? ”
55600	55607	55608	55608	Malfoy	282	“ Are you going to enter ? ”
55611	55631	55608	55608	Malfoy	282	“ I suppose you will , Potter ? You never miss a chance to show off , do you ? ”
55632	55646	55648	55648	Hermione	178	“ Either explain what you ’re on about or go away , Malfoy , ”
55674	55684	55685	55685	he	282	“ Do n’t tell me you do n’t know ? ”
55689	55768	55685	55685	he	282	“ You ’ve got a father and brother at the Ministry and you do n’t even know ? My God , my father told me about it ages ago ... heard it from Cornelius Fudge . But then , Father ’s always associated with the top people at the Ministry ... Maybe your father ’s too junior to know about it , Weasley ... yes ... they probably do n’t talk about important stuff in front of him ... ”
55807	55810	55812	55812	Hermione	178	“ Ron ! ”
55823	55826	55816	55816	she	178	“ Reparo ! ”
55843	55858	55859	55859	Ron	188	“ Well ... making it look like he knows everything and we do n’t ... ”
55862	55895	55859	55859	Ron	188	“ ‘ Father ’s always associated with the top people at the Ministry . ’ ... Dad could ’ve got a promotion any time ... he just likes it where he is ... ”
55896	55902	55904	55904	Hermione	178	“ Of course he does , ”
55907	55918	55904	55904	Hermione	178	“ Do n’t let Malfoy get to you , Ron — ”
55919	55930	55932	55932	Ron	188	“ Him ! Get to me ! ? As if ! ”
56071	56076	56077	56077	Harry	447	“ Hi , Hagrid ! ”
56092	56099	56100	56100	Hagrid	198	“ All righ ’ , Harry ? ”
56106	56118	56100	56100	Hagrid	198	“ See yeh at the feast if we don ’ drown ! ”
56133	56147	56149	56149	Hermione	178	“ Oooh , I would n’t fancy crossing the lake in this weather , ”
56380	56383	56385	56385	Ron	188	“ Blimey , ”
56395	56413	56385	56385	Ron	188	“ if that keeps up the lake ’s going to overflow . I ’m soak — ARRGH ! ”
56545	56548	56584	56584	she	343	“ PEEVES ! ”
56554	56563	56584	56584	she	343	“ Peeves , come down here at ONCE ! ”
56602	56610	56584	56584	she	343	“ Ouch — sorry , Miss Granger — ”
56611	56619	56620	56620	Hermione	178	“ That ’s all right , Professor ! ”
56627	56635	56637	56638	Professor McGonagall	343	“ Peeves , get down here NOW ! ”
56654	56659	56661	56661	Peeves	342	“ Not doing nothing ! ”
56683	56696	56698	56698	he	342	“ Already wet , are n’t they ? Little squirts ! Wheeeeeeeeee ! ”
56713	56720	56722	56723	Professor McGonagall	343	“ I shall call the headmaster ! ”
56725	56733	56722	56723	Professor McGonagall	343	“ I ’m warning you , Peeves — ”
56762	56770	56772	56773	Professor McGonagall	343	“ Well , move along , then ! ”
56780	56789	56772	56773	Professor McGonagall	343	“ Into the Great Hall , come on ! ”
57002	57006	57007	57007	he	348	“ Good evening , ”
57014	57018	57020	57020	Harry	447	“ Says who ? ”
57032	57045	57020	57020	Harry	447	“ Hope they hurry up with the Sorting . I ’m starving . ”
57105	57110	57113	57114	Colin Creevey	350	“ Hiya , Harry ! ”
57128	57133	57135	57135	Harry	447	“ Hi , Colin , ”
57138	57158	57135	57135	Harry	447	“ Harry , guess what ? Guess what , Harry ? My brother ’s starting ! My brother Dennis ! ”
57159	57164	57166	57166	Harry	447	“ Er — good , ”
57168	57174	57176	57176	Colin	350	“ He ’s really excited ! ”
57187	57205	57176	57176	Colin	350	“ I just hope he ’s in Gryffindor ! Keep your fingers crossed , eh , Harry ? ”
57206	57214	57216	57216	Harry	447	“ Er — yeah , all right , ”
57231	57246	57247	57247	he	447	“ Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses , do n’t they ? ”
57267	57274	57276	57276	Hermione	178	“ Oh no , not necessarily , ”
57278	57304	57276	57276	Hermione	178	“ Parvati Patil ’s twin ’s in Ravenclaw , and they ’re identical . You ’d think they ’d be together , would n’t you ? ”
57374	57386	57388	57388	Hermione	178	“ Where ’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ? ”
57452	57460	57462	57462	Hermione	178	“ Maybe they could n’t get anyone ! ”
57754	57759	57760	57760	Ron	188	“ Oh hurry up , ”
57766	57773	57760	57760	Ron	188	“ I could eat a hippogriff . ”
58302	58315	58317	58317	Harry	447	“ That ’s not the song it sang when it Sorted us , ”
58325	58333	58335	58335	Ron	188	“ Sings a different one every year , ”
58337	58368	58335	58335	Ron	188	“ It ’s got to be a pretty boring life , has n’t it , being a hat ? I suppose it spends all year making up the next one . ”
58380	58400	58401	58401	she	343	“ When I call out your name , you will put on the hat and sit on the stool , ”
58407	58425	58401	58401	she	343	“ When the hat announces your House , you will go and sit at the appropriate table . “
58430	58460	58428	58428	Stewart	361	” A boy walked forward , visibly trembling from head to foot , picked up the Sorting Hat , put it on , and sat down on the stool . “
58463	58526	58527	58527	Baddock	362	” shouted the hat . Stewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the Ravenclaw table , where everyone was applauding him . Harry caught a glimpse of Cho , the Ravenclaw Seeker , cheering Stewart Ackerley as he sat down . For a fleeting second , Harry had a strange desire to join the Ravenclaw table too . “
58531	58532	58533	58533	SLYTHERIN	359	” “
58535	58591	58533	58533	SLYTHERIN	359	” The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers ; Harry could see Malfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins . Harry wondered whether Baddock knew that Slytherin House had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other . Fred and George hissed Malcolm Baddock as he sat down . “
58596	58597	58594	58594	Eleanor	363	” “
58600	58601	58594	58594	Eleanor	363	” “
58606	58607	58604	58604	Owen	364	” “
58610	58611	58612	58612	Creevey	350	” “
58616	58734	58612	58612	Creevey	350	” Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward , tripping over Hagrid ’s moleskin , just as Hagrid himself sidled into the Hall through a door behind the teachers ’ table . About twice as tall as a normal man , and at least three times as broad , Hagrid , with his long , wild , tangled black hair and beard , looked slightly alarming — a misleading impression , for Harry , Ron , and Hermione knew Hagrid to possess a very kind nature . He winked at them as he sat down at the end of the staff table and watched Dennis Creevey putting on the Sorting Hat . The rip at the brim opened wide — “
58737	58775	58776	58776	Colin	350	” the hat shouted . Hagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis Creevey , beaming widely , took off the hat , placed it back on the stool , and hurried over to join his brother . “
58782	58794	58776	58776	Colin	350	” he said shrilly , throwing himself into an empty seat . “
58814	58815	58776	58776	Colin	350	” “
58818	58826	58776	58776	Colin	350	” said Colin , just as excitedly . “
58836	58837	58834	58834	Dennis	351	” “
58840	58881	58882	58882	Dennis	351	” said Dennis , as though nobody in their wildest dreams could hope for more than being thrown into a storm - tossed , fathoms - deep lake , and pushed out of it again by a giant sea monster . “
58911	58967	58909	58909	Dennis	351	” Harry looked away , staring very hard at the Sorting Hat , now Sorting Emma Dobbs . The Sorting continued ; boys and girls with varying degrees of fright on their faces moving one by one to the four - legged stool , the line dwindling slowly as Professor McGonagall passed the L ’s . “
58972	58980	58909	58909	Dennis	351	” Ron moaned , massaging his stomach . “
58994	59000	59001	59001	Madley	366	” said Nearly Headless Nick as “
59005	59010	59001	59001	Madley	366	” became a Hufflepuff . “
59021	59025	59001	59001	Madley	366	” snapped Ron . “
59040	59048	59049	59049	McDonald	368	” said Nearly Headless Nick , applauding as “
59053	59059	59051	59051	Natalie	369	” joined the Gryffindor table . “
59073	59091	59092	59092	Pritchard	370	” Gryffindor had won the Inter - House Championship for the last three years in a row . “
59096	59097	59098	59098	SLYTHERIN	359	” “
59100	59101	59102	59102	Quirke	372	” “
59106	59107	59108	59108	RAVENCLAW	227	” “
59110	59115	59116	59116	Whitby	374	” And finally , with “
59118	59120	59116	59116	Whitby	374	Kevin!”(“HUFFLEPUFF ! ”
59141	59145	59147	59147	Ron	188	“ About time , ”
59185	59196	59197	59197	he	187	“ I have only two words to say to you , ”
59209	59213	59197	59197	he	187	“ Tuck in . ”
59214	59219	59221	59221	Harry	447	“ Hear , hear ! ”
59252	59260	59262	59262	Ron	188	“ Aaah , ’ at ’s be’er , ”
59272	59287	59289	59291	Nearly Headless Nick	348	“ You ’re lucky there ’s a feast at all tonight , you know , ”
59293	59302	59289	59291	Nearly Headless Nick	348	“ There was trouble in the kitchens earlier . ”
59303	59311	59313	59313	Harry	447	“ Why ? Wha ’ ’ appened ? ”
59322	59328	59330	59332	Nearly Headless Nick	348	“ Peeves , of course , ”
59354	59434	59342	59342	He	348	“ The usual argument , you know . He wanted to attend the feast — well , it ’s quite out of the question , you know what he ’s like , utterly uncivilized , ca n’t see a plate of food without throwing it . We held a ghost ’s council — the Fat Friar was all for giving him the chance — but most wisely , in my opinion , the Bloody Baron put his foot down . ”
59466	59478	59480	59480	Ron	188	“ Yeah , we thought Peeves seemed hacked off about something , ”
59483	59493	59480	59480	Ron	188	“ So what did he do in the kitchens ? ”
59494	59499	59501	59503	Nearly Headless Nick	348	“ Oh the usual , ”
59507	59533	59501	59503	Nearly Headless Nick	348	“ Wreaked havoc and mayhem . Pots and pans everywhere . Place swimming in soup . Terrified the house - elves out of their wits — ”
59566	59574	59575	59575	she	178	“ There are house - elves here ? ”
59589	59594	59575	59575	she	178	“ Here at Hogwarts ? ”
59595	59598	59600	59602	Nearly Headless Nick	348	“ Certainly , ”
59610	59627	59600	59602	Nearly Headless Nick	348	“ The largest number in any dwelling in Britain , I believe . Over a hundred . ”
59628	59635	59637	59637	Hermione	178	“ I ’ve never seen one ! ”
59639	59654	59656	59658	Nearly Headless Nick	348	“ Well , they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day , do they ? ”
59660	59719	59723	59723	him	348	“ They come out at night to do a bit of cleaning ... see to the fires and so on ... I mean , you ’re not supposed to see them , are you ? That ’s the mark of a good house - elf , is n’t it , that you do n’t know it ’s there ? ”
59725	59731	59732	59732	she	178	“ But they get paid ? ”
59735	59756	59732	59732	she	178	“ They get holidays , do n’t they ? And — and sick leave , and pensions , and everything ? ”
59792	59798	59799	59799	he	348	“ Sick leave and pensions ? ”
59818	59830	59799	59799	he	348	“ House - elves do n’t want sick leave and pensions ! ”
59858	59870	59872	59872	Ron	188	“ Oh c’m on , ’ Er - my - knee , ”
59883	59891	59892	59892	He	348	“ Oops — sorry , ’ Arry — ”
59895	59907	59892	59892	He	348	“ You wo n’t get them sick leave by starving yourself ! ”
59908	59912	59914	59914	Hermione	178	“ Slave labor , ”
59922	59933	59914	59914	Hermione	178	“ That ’s what made this dinner . Slave labor . ”
59990	59996	59998	59998	Ron	188	“ Treacle tart , Hermione ! ”
60007	60016	59998	59998	Ron	188	“ Spotted dick , look ! Chocolate gateau ! ”
60089	60092	60094	60094	Dumbledore	187	“ So ! ”
60102	60112	60094	60094	Dumbledore	187	“ Now that we are all fed and watered , ”
60114	60117	60119	60119	Hermione	178	“ Hmph ! ”
60121	60139	60094	60094	Dumbledore	187	“ I must once more ask for your attention , while I give out a few notices . “
60216	60228	60232	60232	I	0	” The corners of Dumbledore ’s mouth twitched . He continued , “
60266	60290	60298	60298	He	447	“ It is also my painful duty to inform you that the Inter - House Quidditch Cup will not take place this year . ”
60291	60294	60295	60295	Harry	447	“ What ? ”
60331	60386	60327	60327	Dumbledore	187	“ This is due to an event that will be starting in October , and continuing throughout the school year , taking up much of the teachers ’ time and energy — but I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely . I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts — ”
60874	60887	60889	60889	Dumbledore	187	“ May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ? ”
60895	60899	60889	60889	Dumbledore	187	“ Professor Moody . ”
60968	60971	60972	60972	Harry	447	“ Moody ? ”
60977	60993	60972	60972	Harry	447	“ Mad - Eye Moody ? The one your dad went to help this morning ? ”
60994	60998	61000	61000	Ron	188	“ Must be , ”
61008	61014	61000	61000	Ron	188	“ What happened to him ? ”
61018	61025	61000	61000	Ron	188	“ What happened to his face ? ”
61026	61029	61030	61030	Ron	188	“ Dunno , ”
61130	61136	61137	61137	he	187	“ As I was saying , ”
61162	61214	61157	61160	Mad - Eye Moody	332	“ we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months , an event that has not been held for over a century . It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year . ”
61215	61220	61222	61223	Fred Weasley	192	“ You ’re JOKING ! ”
61250	61259	61260	61260	he	187	“ I am not joking , Mr. Weasley , ”
61263	61297	61260	61260	he	187	“ though now that you mention it , I did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll , a hag , and a leprechaun who all go into a bar ... ”
61305	61318	61320	61320	Dumbledore	187	“ Er — but maybe this is not the time ... no ... ”
61322	61371	61320	61320	Dumbledore	187	“ where was I ? Ah yes , the Triwizard Tournament ... well , some of you will not know what this tournament involves , so I hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation , and allow their attention to wander freely . “
61477	61478	61593	61593	We	1939	” “
61482	61542	61593	61593	We	1939	” Hermione whispered , looking alarmed . But her anxiety did not seem to be shared by the majority of students in the Hall ; many of them were whispering excitedly to one another , and Harry himself was far more interested in hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that had happened hundreds of years ago . “
61556	61560	61593	61593	We	1939	” Dumbledore continued , “
61617	61678	61694	61694	his	1945	“ The Heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their shortlisted contenders in October , and the selection of the three champions will take place at Halloween . An impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup , the glory of their school , and a thousand Galleons personal prize money . ”
61679	61686	61687	61688	Fred Weasley	192	“ I ’m going for it ! ”
61761	61779	61780	61780	he	187	“ Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts , ”
61783	61839	61780	61780	he	187	“ the Heads of the participating schools , along with the Ministry of Magic , have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year . Only students who are of age — that is to say , seventeen years or older — will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration . This ”
61868	61933	61934	61934	His	187	“ is a measure we feel is necessary , given that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous , whatever precautions we take , and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them . I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hogwarts champion . ”
61951	61969	61934	61934	His	187	“ I therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen . “
62066	62107	62108	62108	They	1960	” Dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Mad - Eye Moody . There was a great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet and swarmed toward the double doors into the entrance hall . “
62114	62139	62108	62108	They	1960	” said George Weasley , who had not joined the crowd moving toward the door , but was standing up and glaring at Dumbledore . “
62154	62155	62156	62156	They	1960	” “
62163	62175	62156	62156	They	1960	” said Fred stubbornly , also scowling at the top table . “
62201	62202	62219	62221	a thousand Galleons	1962	” “
62205	62216	62219	62221	a thousand Galleons	1962	” said Ron , a faraway look on his face . “
62223	62224	62219	62221	a thousand Galleons	1962	” “
62228	62232	62219	62221	a thousand Galleons	1962	” said Hermione , “
62247	62286	62242	62242	you	1955	” Harry , Ron , Hermione , Fred , and George set off for the entrance hall , Fred and George debating the ways in which Dumbledore might stop those who were under seventeen from entering the tournament . “
62302	62306	62289	62300	this impartial judge who ’s going to decide who the champions are	1964	” said Harry . “
62309	62313	62289	62300	this impartial judge who ’s going to decide who the champions are	1964	” said Fred , “
62339	62340	62337	62337	George	193	” “
62351	62355	62341	62341	Dumbledore	187	” said Ron . “
62374	62379	62372	62372	he	1964	” said Fred shrewdly . “
62419	62420	62409	62409	Dumbledore	187	” “
62427	62452	62409	62409	Dumbledore	187	” said Hermione in a worried voice as they walked through a door concealed behind a tapestry and started up another , narrower staircase . “
62455	62460	62409	62409	Dumbledore	187	” said Fred airily , “
62502	62503	62505	62505	d’you	1971	” “
62508	62513	62505	62505	d’you	1971	” Ron asked Harry . “
62539	62540	62541	62541	I	0	” “
62546	62558	62541	62541	I	0	” came Neville ’s gloomy voice from behind Fred and George . “
62593	62673	62570	62570	She	1973	” Neville ’s foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the staircase . There were many of these trick stairs at Hogwarts ; it was second nature to most of the older students to jump this particular step , but Neville ’s memory was notoriously poor . Harry and Ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him out , while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked , laughing wheezily . “
62679	62720	62721	62721	Password	382	” said Ron , banging down its visor as they passed . They made their way up to the entrance to Gryffindor Tower , which was concealed behind a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink silk dress . “
62723	62730	62731	62731	Balderdash	383	” she said as they approached . “
62733	62737	62738	62740	a prefect downstairs	1974	” said George , “
62744	62796	62738	62740	a prefect downstairs	1974	” The portrait swung forward to reveal a hole in the wall through which they all climbed . A crackling fire warmed the circular common room , which was full of squashy armchairs and tables . Hermione cast the merrily dancing flames a dark look , and Harry distinctly heard her mutter “
62800	62921	62797	62798	Slave labor	5822	” before bidding them good night and disappearing through the doorway to the girls ’ dormitory . Harry , Ron , and Neville climbed up the last , spiral staircase until they reached their own dormitory , which was situated at the top of the tower . Five four - poster beds with deep crimson hangings stood against the walls , each with its owner ’s trunk at the foot . Dean and Seamus were already getting into bed ; Seamus had pinned his Ireland rosette to his headboard , and Dean had tacked up a poster of Viktor Krum over his bedside table . His old poster of the West Ham football team was pinned right next to it . “
62924	62987	62988	62988	I	0	” Ron sighed , shaking his head at the completely stationary soccer players . Harry , Ron , and Neville got into their pajamas and into bed . Someone — a house - elf , no doubt — had placed warming pans between the sheets . It was extremely comfortable , lying there in bed and listening to the storm raging outside . “
62998	63006	62988	62988	I	0	” Ron said sleepily through the darkness , “
63026	63027	63024	63024	you	1976	” “
63031	63138	63024	63024	you	1976	” Harry rolled over in bed , a series of dazzling new pictures forming in his mind ’s eye ... He had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was seventeen ... he had become Hogwarts champion ... he was standing on the grounds , his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school , all of whom were applauding and screaming ... he had just won the Triwizard Tournament ... Cho ’s face stood out particularly clearly in the blurred crowd , her face glowing with admiration ... Harry grinned into his pillow , exceptionally glad that Ron could n’t see what he could .
63211	63221	63223	63223	Ron	188	“ Today ’s not bad ... outside all morning , ”
63234	63255	63223	63223	Ron	188	“ Herbology with the Hufflepuffs and Care of Magical Creatures ... damn it , we ’re still with the Slytherins ... ”
63256	63262	63263	63263	Harry	447	“ Double Divination this afternoon , ”
63294	63308	63310	63310	Hermione	178	“ You should have given it up like me , should n’t you ? ”
63318	63329	63310	63310	Hermione	178	“ Then you ’d be doing something sensible like Arithmancy . ”
63330	63339	63341	63341	Ron	188	“ You ’re eating again , I notice , ”
63355	63371	63373	63373	Hermione	178	“ I ’ve decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights , ”
63376	63384	63386	63386	Ron	188	“ Yeah ... and you were hungry , ”
63632	63635	63636	63637	Professor Sprout	355	“ Bubotubers , ”
63642	63653	63636	63637	Professor Sprout	355	“ They need squeezing . You will collect the pus — ”
63654	63658	63660	63661	Seamus Finnigan	252	“ The what ? ”
63666	63673	63675	63676	Professor Sprout	355	“ Pus , Finnigan , pus , ”
63678	63725	63675	63676	Professor Sprout	355	“ and it ’s extremely valuable , so do n’t waste it . You will collect the pus , I say , in these bottles . Wear your dragon - hide gloves ; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted , bubotuber pus . ”
63784	63792	63794	63795	Professor Sprout	355	“ This ’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy , ”
63805	63833	63794	63795	Professor Sprout	355	“ An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne , bubotuber pus . Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples . ”

64287	64296	64298	64298	Malfoy	282	“ I mean , what do they do ? ”
64300	64308	64298	64298	Malfoy	282	“ What is the point of them ? ”

64587	64614	64574	64574	Hagrid	198	“ I reckon they ’re the males ... The females’ve got sorta sucker things on their bellies ... I think they might be ter suck blood . ”
64615	64631	64633	64633	Malfoy	282	“ Well , I can certainly see why we ’re trying to keep them alive , ”
64636	64654	64633	64633	Malfoy	282	“ Who would n’t want pets that can burn , sting , and bite all at once ? ”
64655	64673	64674	64674	Hermione	178	“ Just because they ’re not very pretty , it does n’t mean they ’re not useful , ”
64677	64698	64674	64674	Hermione	178	“ Dragon blood ’s amazingly magical , but you would n’t want a dragon for a pet , would you ? ”
64777	64787	64789	64789	Ron	188	“ Well , at least the skrewts are small , ”
64806	64811	64813	64813	Hermione	178	“ They are now , ”
64819	64839	64813	64813	Hermione	178	“ but once Hagrid ’s found out what they eat , I expect they ’ll be six feet long . ”
64840	64860	64862	64862	Ron	188	“ Well , that wo n’t matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something , will it ? ”
64869	64883	64885	64885	Hermione	178	“ You know perfectly well I only said that to shut Malfoy up , ”
64887	64920	64885	64885	Hermione	178	“ As a matter of fact I think he ’s right . The best thing to do would be to stamp on the lot of them before they start attacking us all . ”
64951	64963	64965	64965	Ron	188	“ Er — is this the new stand on elf rights ? ”
64967	64977	64965	64965	Ron	188	“ You ’re going to make yourself puke instead ? ”
64978	64981	64990	64990	she	178	“ No , ”

65305	65364	65299	65299	she	2009	“ My inner eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within . And I regret to say that your worries are not baseless . I see difficult times ahead for you , alas ... most difficult ... I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass ... and perhaps sooner than you think ... ”
65427	65441	65442	65442	she	324	“ My dears , it is time for us to consider the stars , ”
65445	65482	65442	65442	she	324	“ The movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance . Human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays , which intermingle ... ”

65680	65683	65677	65677	Ron	188	“ What ? ”
65716	65736	65738	65739	Professor Trelawney	324	“ I was saying , my dear , that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn , ”
65763	65771	65773	65773	Harry	447	“ Born under — what , sorry ? ”
65775	65784	65786	65787	Professor Trelawney	324	“ Saturn , dear , the planet Saturn ! ”
65801	65857	65793	65793	he	447	“ I was saying that Saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your birth ... Your dark hair ... your mean stature ... tragic losses so young in life ... I think I am right in saying , my dear , that you were born in midwinter ? ”
65858	65861	65863	65863	Harry	447	“ No , ”
65865	65872	65863	65863	Harry	447	“ I was born in July . ”
65931	65939	65941	65941	Harry	447	“ I ’ve got two Neptunes here , ”

65965	65968	65970	65970	Ron	188	“ Aaaaah , ”
65979	66004	65970	65970	Ron	188	“ when two Neptunes appear in the sky , it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born , Harry ... ”
66030	66054	66007	66007	Dean	167	“ Oh Professor , look ! I think I ’ve got an unaspected planet ! Oooh , which one ’s that , Professor ? ”
66055	66063	66065	66066	Professor Trelawney	324	“ It is Uranus , my dear , ”
66074	66086	66088	66088	Ron	188	“ Can I have a look at Uranus too , Lavender ? ”
66120	66145	66146	66146	she	324	“ A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you , with reference to your personal chart , ”
66163	66178	66146	66146	she	324	“ I want it ready to hand in next Monday , and no excuses ! ”
66179	66184	66186	66186	Ron	188	“ Miserable old bat , ”
66204	66214	66186	66186	Ron	188	“ That ’ll take all weekend , that will ... ”
66215	66220	66222	66222	Hermione	178	“ Lots of homework ? ”
66230	66241	66222	66222	Hermione	178	“ Professor Vector did n’t give us any at all ! ”
66242	66250	66252	66252	Ron	188	“ Well , bully for Professor Vector , ”
66289	66296	66297	66297	Harry	447	“ Weasley ! Hey , Weasley ! ”

68309	68312	68307	68307	Harry	447	“ Moody . ”
68410	68424	68425	68425	Harry	447	“ I reckon Snape ’s a bit scared of him , you know , ”
68429	68440	68442	68442	Ron	188	“ Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad , ”
68449	68458	68442	68442	Ron	188	“ and bounced him all around his dungeon ... ”
68510	68515	68498	68498	Hermione	178	“ Been in the — ”
68516	68519	68520	68520	Harry	447	“ Library . ”
68527	68541	68520	68520	Harry	447	“ C’m on , quick , or we wo n’t get decent seats . ”
68620	68627	68628	68628	he	381	“ You can put those away , ”
68640	68650	68628	68628	he	381	“ those books . You wo n’t need them . ”
68717	68721	68722	68722	he	381	“ Right then , ”
68734	68781	68722	68722	he	381	“ I ’ve had a letter from Professor Lupin about this class . Seems you ’ve had a pretty thorough grounding in tackling Dark creatures — you ’ve covered boggarts , Red Caps , hinkypunks , grindylows , Kappas , and werewolves , is that right ? ”
68790	68804	68806	68806	Moody	381	“ But you ’re behind — very behind — on dealing with curses , ”
68808	68842	68806	68806	Moody	381	“ So I ’m here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other . I ’ve got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark — ”
68843	68851	68852	68852	Ron	188	“ What , are n’t you staying ? ”
68928	68939	68940	68940	Moody	381	“ You ’ll be Arthur Weasley ’s son , eh ? ”
68943	68985	68940	68940	Moody	381	“ Your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago ... Yeah , I ’m staying just the one year . Special favor to Dumbledore ... One year , and then back to my quiet retirement . ”
69000	69192	68995	68995	his	381	“ So — straight into it . Curses . They come in many strengths and forms . Now , according to the Ministry of Magic , I ’m supposed to teach you countercurses and leave it at that . I ’m not supposed to show you what illegal Dark curses look like until you ’re in the sixth year . You ’re not supposed to be old enough to deal with it till then . But Professor Dumbledore ’s got a higher opinion of your nerves , he reckons you can cope , and I say , the sooner you know what you ’re up against , the better . How are you supposed to defend yourself against something you ’ve never seen ? A wizard who ’s about to put an illegal curse on you is n’t going to tell you what he ’s about to do . He ’s not going to do it nice and polite to your face . You need to be prepared . You need to be alert and watchful . You need to put that away , Miss Brown , when I ’m talking . ”
69232	69250	69210	69211	Apparently Moody	381	“ So ... do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by Wizarding law ? ”
69281	69284	69286	69286	Ron	188	“ Er , ”
69289	69307	69286	69286	Ron	188	“ my dad told me about one ... Is it called the Imperius Curse , or something ? ”
69308	69313	69315	69315	Moody	381	“ Ah , yes , ”
69318	69341	69315	69315	Moody	381	“ Your father would know that one . Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time , the Imperius Curse . ”
69424	69427	69414	69414	He	381	“ Imperio ! ”
69517	69526	69527	69527	he	381	“ Think it ’s funny , do you ? ”
69530	69546	69527	69527	he	381	“ You ’d like it , would you , if I did it to you ? ”
69554	69558	69560	69560	Moody	381	“ Total control , ”
69576	69598	69560	69560	Moody	381	“ I could make it jump out of the window , drown itself , throw itself down one of your throats ... ”
69605	69624	69626	69626	Moody	381	“ Years back , there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the Imperius Curse , ”
69646	69674	69631	69631	he	381	“ Some job for the Ministry , trying to sort out who was being forced to act , and who was acting of their own free will . “
69718	69740	69851	69851	Your	2072	” he barked , and everyone jumped . Moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar . “
69750	69799	69854	69854	Longbottom	337	” Hermione ’s hand flew into the air again and so , to Harry ’s slight surprise , did Neville ’s . The only class in which Neville usually volunteered information was Herbology , which was easily his best subject . Neville looked surprised at his own daring . “
69802	69817	69854	69854	Longbottom	337	” said Moody , his magical eye rolling right over to fix on Neville . “
69826	69850	69851	69851	Your	2072	” said Neville in a small but distinct voice . Moody was looking very intently at Neville , this time with both eyes . “
69856	69917	69854	69854	Longbottom	337	” he said , his magical eye swooping down to check the register again . Neville nodded nervously , but Moody made no further inquiries . Turning back to the class at large , he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon the desktop , where it remained motionless , apparently too scared to move . “
69922	69926	69854	69854	Longbottom	337	” said Moody . “
69940	69951	69854	69854	Longbottom	337	” he said , pointing his wand at the spider . “
69954	70002	69854	69854	Longbottom	337	” The spider swelled . It was now larger than a tarantula . Abandoning all pretense , Ron pushed his chair backward , as far away from Moody ’s desk as possible . Moody raised his wand again , pointed it at the spider , and muttered , “
70005	70076	69854	69854	Longbottom	337	” At once , the spider ’s legs bent in upon its body ; it rolled over and began to twitch horribly , rocking from side to side . No sound came from it , but Harry was sure that if it could have given voice , it would have been screaming . Moody did not remove his wand , and the spider started to shudder and jerk more violently — “
70080	70153	69854	69854	Longbottom	337	” Hermione said shrilly . Harry looked around at her . She was looking , not at the spider , but at Neville , and Harry , following her gaze , saw that Neville ’s hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him , his knuckles white , his eyes wide and horrified . Moody raised his wand . The spider ’s legs relaxed , but it continued to twitch . “
70156	70178	69854	69854	Longbottom	337	” Moody muttered , and the spider shrank back to its proper size . He put it back into the jar . “
70181	70186	69854	69854	Longbottom	337	” said Moody softly . “
70213	70221	70222	70222	Harry	447	“ Right ... anyone know any others ? ”
70269	70272	70274	70274	Moody	381	“ Yes ? ”
70280	70284	70285	70285	Hermione	178	“ Avada Kedavra , ”
70299	70302	70304	70304	Moody	381	“ Ah , ”
70314	70329	70330	70330	He	381	“ Yes , the last and worst . Avada Kedavra ... the Killing Curse . ”
70404	70408	70409	70409	Moody	381	“ Avada Kedavra ! ”
70490	70494	70495	70495	he	381	“ Not nice , ”
70499	70534	70495	70495	he	381	“ Not pleasant . And there ’s no countercurse . There ’s no blocking it . Only one known person has ever survived it , and he ’s sitting right in front of me . ”
70863	70927	70859	70859	Moody	381	“ Avada Kedavra ’s a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it — you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words , and I doubt I ’d get so much as a nosebleed . But that does n’t matter . I ’m not here to teach you how to do it . “
70978	70989	70996	70997	Avada Kedavra	402	” he roared , and the whole class jumped again . “
71086	71141	71143	71143	you	0	” They spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the Unforgivable Curses . No one spoke until the bell rang — but when Moody had dismissed them and they had left the classroom , a torrent of talk burst forth . Most people were discussing the curses in awed voices — “
71148	71149	71153	71153	he	0	” “
71161	71201	71153	71153	he	0	” They were talking about the lesson , Harry thought , as though it had been some sort of spectacular show , but he had n’t found it very entertaining — and nor , it seemed , had Hermione . “
71205	71214	71153	71153	he	0	” she said tensely to Harry and Ron . “
71221	71225	71153	71153	he	0	” said Ron . “
71228	71239	71240	71240	Neville	337	” said Hermione curtly , pointing up a side passage . “
71242	71280	71281	71281	Neville	337	” Neville was standing alone , halfway up the passage , staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same horrified , wide - eyed look he had worn when Moody had demonstrated the Cruciatus Curse . “
71283	71292	71281	71281	Neville	337	” Hermione said gently . Neville looked around . “
71296	71307	71281	71281	Neville	337	” he said , his voice much higher than usual . “
71333	71334	71331	71331	you	337	” “
71342	71346	71335	71335	Neville	337	” said Hermione . “
71354	71364	71350	71350	I	0	” Neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice . “
71378	71386	71387	71387	Neville	337	” Ron gave Harry a startled look . “
71392	71444	71387	71387	Neville	337	” But an odd clunking noise sounded behind them , and they turned to see Professor Moody limping toward them . All four of them fell silent , watching him apprehensively , but when he spoke , it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard . “
71452	71458	71450	71450	sonny	2096	” he said to Neville . “
71480	71508	71509	71509	You	2096	” Neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with Moody . He neither moved nor spoke . Moody turned his magical eye upon Harry . “
71518	71519	71516	71516	Potter	447	” “
71522	71547	71516	71516	Potter	447	” said Harry , almost defiantly . Moody ’s blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed Harry . Then he said , “
71588	71631	71578	71578	I	0	” Neville looked pleadingly at Harry , Ron , and Hermione , but they did n’t say anything , so Neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away , one of Moody ’s gnarled hands on his shoulder . “
71637	71649	71650	71650	I	0	” said Ron , watching Neville and Moody turn the corner . “
71655	71662	71650	71650	I	0	” said Hermione , looking pensive . “
71670	71684	71685	71685	Fred	192	” said Ron to Harry as they set off for the Great Hall . “
71725	71834	71708	71708	he	2100	” But Ron fell suddenly silent at the look on Harry ’s face and did n’t speak again until they reached the Great Hall , when he said he supposed they had better make a start on Professor Trelawney ’s predictions tonight , since they would take hours . Hermione did not join in with Harry and Ron ’s conversation during dinner , but ate furiously fast , and then left for the library again . Harry and Ron walked back to Gryffindor Tower , and Harry , who had been thinking of nothing else all through dinner , now raised the subject of the Unforgivable Curses himself . “
71855	71865	71847	71847	they	43	” Harry asked as they approached the Fat Lady . “
71870	71874	71847	71847	they	43	” said Ron . “
71915	71942	71913	71913	Balderdash	383	” The Fat Lady swung forward to reveal the entrance hole , and they climbed into the Gryffindor common room , which was crowded and noisy . “
71952	71956	71957	71957	I	0	” said Harry . “
71960	72017	71957	71957	I	0	” Ron groaned . They went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts , to find Neville there alone , sitting on his bed , reading . He looked a good deal calmer than at the end of Moody ’s lesson , though still not entirely normal . His eyes were rather red . “
72024	72029	72022	72022	Neville	337	” Harry asked him . “
72033	72037	72022	72022	Neville	337	” said Neville , “
72053	72067	72048	72049	Professor Moody	381	” He held up the book : Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean . “
72082	72104	72105	72105	He	381	” Neville said . There was a faint note of pride in his voice that Harry had rarely heard there before . “
72112	72239	72105	72105	He	381	” Telling Neville what Professor Sprout had said , Harry thought , had been a very tactful way of cheering Neville up , for Neville very rarely heard that he was good at anything . It was the sort of thing Professor Lupin would have done . Harry and Ron took their copies of Unfogging the Future back down to the common room , found a table , and set to work on their predictions for the coming month . An hour later , they had made very little progress , though their table was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols , and Harry ’s brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from Professor Trelawney ’s fire . “
72254	72267	72240	72240	I	0	” he said , staring down at a long list of calculations . “
72271	72295	72240	72240	I	0	” said Ron , whose hair was on end because of all the times he had run his fingers through it in frustration , “
72307	72308	72296	72296	I	0	” “
72315	72316	72385	72385	her	2104	” “
72319	72345	72385	72385	her	2104	” said Ron , sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table , dipping his pen into some ink , and starting to write . “
72349	72356	72385	72385	her	2104	” he said as he scribbled , “
72375	72382	72385	72385	her	2104	” He looked up at Harry . “
72400	72401	72394	72394	she	2104	” “
72404	72430	72394	72394	she	2104	” said Harry , crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire . “
72447	72448	72436	72436	I	0	” “
72455	72460	72451	72451	you	2103	” said Ron darkly , “
72479	72480	72474	72474	I	0	” “
72486	72500	72474	72474	I	0	” said Harry , who was flicking through Unfogging the Future for ideas . “
72504	72512	72474	72474	I	0	” said Ron , copying it down . “
72537	72538	72518	72518	Mercury	407	” “
72543	72551	72518	72518	Mercury	407	” said Harry , scribbling it down , “
72561	72562	72554	72554	Venus	408	” “
72578	72579	72567	72567	I	0	” “
72598	72599	72592	72592	I	0	” “
72612	72885	72894	72894	him	2110	” They continued to make up predictions ( which grew steadily more tragic ) for another hour , while the common room around them slowly emptied as people went up to bed . Crookshanks wandered over to them , leapt lightly into an empty chair , and stared inscrutably at Harry , rather as Hermione might look if she knew they were n’t doing their homework properly . Staring around the room , trying to think of a kind of misfortune he had n’t yet used , Harry saw Fred and George sitting together against the opposite wall , heads together , quills out , poring over a single piece of parchment . It was most unusual to see Fred and George hidden away in a corner and working silently ; they usually liked to be in the thick of things and the noisy center of attention . There was something secretive about the way they were working on the piece of parchment , and Harry was reminded of how they had sat together writing something back at the Burrow . He had thought then that it was another order form for Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes , but it did n’t look like that this time ; if it had been , they would surely have let Lee Jordan in on the joke . He wondered whether it had anything to do with entering the Triwizard Tournament . As Harry watched , George shook his head at Fred , scratched out something with his quill , and said , in a very quiet voice that nevertheless carried across the almost deserted room , “
72901	73003	73109	73109	I	0	” Then George looked over and saw Harry watching him . Harry grinned and quickly returned to his predictions — he did n’t want George to think he was eavesdropping . Shortly after that , the twins rolled up their parchment , said good night , and went off to bed . Fred and George had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened and Hermione climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the other . Crookshanks arched his back , purring . “
73006	73010	73109	73109	I	0	” she said , “
73016	73017	73020	73020	I	0	” “
73022	73055	73066	73066	you	0	” said Ron triumphantly , throwing down his quill . Hermione sat down , laid the things she was carrying in an empty armchair , and pulled Ron ’s predictions toward her . “
73068	73080	73066	73066	you	0	” she said sardonically as Crookshanks curled up in her lap . “
73090	73094	73086	73086	I	0	” Ron yawned . “
73102	73106	73095	73095	You	0	” said Hermione . “
73111	73121	73109	73109	I	0	” said Ron , peering down at his predictions . “
73137	73138	73122	73122	I	0	” “
73154	73158	73148	73148	you	0	” said Hermione . “
73163	73171	73161	73161	you	0	” said Ron , in mock outrage . “
73182	73188	73172	73172	We	2113	” Hermione raised her eyebrows . “
73195	73217	73172	73172	We	2113	” said Ron hastily . Harry laid down his quill too , having just finished predicting his own death by decapitation . “
73224	73232	73172	73172	We	2113	” he asked , pointing at it . “
73238	73279	73172	73172	We	2113	” said Hermione , with a nasty look at Ron . She took off the lid and showed them the contents . Inside were about fifty badges , all of different colors , but all bearing the same letters : S.P.E.W. “
73284	73297	73172	73172	We	2113	” said Harry , picking up a badge and looking at it . “
73303	73304	73172	73172	We	2113	” “
73308	73313	73172	73172	We	2113	” said Hermione impatiently . “
73334	73335	73172	73172	We	2113	” “
73341	73345	73172	73172	We	2113	” said Ron . “
73354	73359	73350	73350	you	0	” said Hermione briskly , “
73367	73368	73360	73360	I	0	” “
73371	73378	73360	73360	I	0	” said Ron in mild surprise . “
73386	73387	73383	73383	you	0	” “
73397	73401	73391	73391	you	0	” said Hermione . “
73420	73424	73418	73418	you	0	” said Ron . “
73433	73438	73439	73439	I	0	” said Hermione hotly . “
73478	73488	73489	73489	I	0	” She brandished the sheaf of parchment at them . “
73519	73520	73505	73505	I	0	” “
73527	73532	73533	73533	They	2117	” said Ron loudly . “
73544	73545	73546	73546	Our	2116	” “
73552	73574	73505	73505	I	0	” said Hermione , speaking even more loudly than Ron , and acting as though she had n’t heard a word , “
73626	73627	73674	73674	You	2124	” “
73636	73640	73674	73674	You	2124	” Harry asked . “
73647	73652	73653	73653	I	0	” said Hermione happily . “
73717	73807	73704	73704	I	0	” There was a pause in which Hermione beamed at the pair of them , and Harry sat , torn between exasperation at Hermione and amusement at the look on Ron ’s face . The silence was broken , not by Ron , who in any case looked as though he was temporarily dumbstruck , but by a soft tap , tap on the window . Harry looked across the now empty common room and saw , illuminated by the moonlight , a snowy owl perched on the windowsill . “
73810	73853	73808	73808	Hedwig	180	” he shouted , and he launched himself out of his chair and across the room to pull open the window . Hedwig flew inside , soared across the room , and landed on the table on top of Harry ’s predictions . “
73857	73865	73866	73866	She	2128	” said Harry , hurrying after her . “
73872	73910	73866	73866	She	2128	” said Ron excitedly , pointing at the grubby piece of parchment tied to Hedwig ’s leg . Harry hastily untied it and sat down to read , whereupon Hedwig fluttered onto his knee , hooting softly . “
73916	74031	73866	73866	She	2128	” Hermione asked breathlessly . The letter was very short , and looked as though it had been scrawled in a great hurry . Harry read it aloud : Harry — I ’m flying north immediately . This news about your scar is the latest in a series of strange rumors that have reached me here . If it hurts again , go straight to Dumbledore — they ’re saying he ’s got Mad - Eye out of retirement , which means he ’s reading the signs , even if no one else is . I ’ll be in touch soon . My best to Ron and Hermione . Keep your eyes open , Harry .
74046	74052	74053	74053	Hermione	178	“ He ’s flying north ? ”
74056	74062	74053	74053	Hermione	178	“ He ’s coming back ? ”
74063	74070	74072	74072	Ron	188	“ Dumbledore ’s reading what signs ? ”
74077	74084	74072	74072	Ron	188	“ Harry — what ’s up ? ”
74105	74113	74114	74114	Harry	447	“ I should n’t ’ve told him ! ”
74118	74125	74127	74127	Ron	188	“ What are you on about ? ”
74131	74144	74146	74146	Harry	447	“ It ’s made him think he ’s got to come back ! ”
74170	74199	74200	74200	Harry	447	“ Coming back , because he thinks I ’m in trouble ! And there ’s nothing wrong with me ! And I have n’t got anything for you , ”
74212	74227	74208	74208	her	180	“ you ’ll have to go up to the Owlery if you want food . ”
74256	74259	74260	74260	Hermione	178	“ Harry , ”
74270	74277	74279	74279	Harry	447	“ I ’m going to bed , ”
74282	74289	74279	74279	Harry	447	“ See you in the morning . ”
74826	74834	74835	74835	Harry	447	“ Just find him , all right ? ”
74857	74863	74864	74864	She	180	“ Before the dementors do . ”
74940	74948	74950	74950	Hermione	178	“ That was a lie , Harry , ”
74966	74979	74950	74950	Hermione	178	“ You did n’t imagine your scar hurting and you know it . ”
74980	74984	74986	74986	Harry	447	“ So what ? ”
74988	75000	74986	74986	Harry	447	“ He ’s not going back to Azkaban because of me . ”
75001	75005	75007	75007	Ron	188	“ Drop it , ”
75198	75210	75212	75212	Hermione	178	“ But — but you said it ’s illegal , Professor , ”
75239	75251	75266	75266	his	381	“ You said — to use it against another human was — ”
75252	75262	75264	75264	Moody	381	“ Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like , ”
75282	75318	75319	75319	He	381	“ If you ’d rather learn the hard way — when someone ’s putting it on you so they can control you completely — fine by me . You ’re excused . Off you go . ”
75469	75472	75473	75473	Moody	381	“ Potter , ”
75476	75480	75473	75473	Moody	381	“ you next . ”
75514	75517	75501	75501	Moody	381	“ Imperio ! ”
75729	75738	75740	75740	Moody	381	“ Now , that ’s more like it ! ”
75776	75842	75759	75759	He	447	“ Look at that , you lot ... Potter fought ! He fought it , and he damn near beat it ! We ’ll try that again , Potter , and the rest of you , pay attention — watch his eyes , that ’s where you see it — very good , Potter , very good indeed ! They ’ll have trouble controlling you ! ”
75843	75849	75850	75850	Harry	447	“ The way he talks , ”
75893	75907	75868	75868	Moody	381	“ you ’d think we were all going to be attacked any second . ”
75908	75914	75916	75916	Ron	188	“ Yeah , I know , ”
75950	75955	75956	75956	Ron	188	“ Talk about paranoid ... ”
75975	76037	75965	75965	Moody	381	“ No wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the Ministry . Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who shouted ‘ Boo ’ behind him on April Fools ’ Day ? And when are we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else we ’ve got to do ? ”
76083	76097	76098	76098	she	343	“ You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education ! ”
76111	76120	76098	76098	she	343	“ Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer — ”
76121	76131	76133	76134	Dean Thomas	167	“ We do n’t take O.W.L.s till fifth year ! ”
76137	76200	76133	76134	Dean Thomas	167	“ Maybe not , Thomas , but believe me , you need all the preparation you can get ! Miss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion . I might remind you that your pincushion , Thomas , still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin ! ”
76421	76424	76412	76412	Hagrid	198	“ project , ”
76448	76453	76455	76456	Draco Malfoy	282	“ I will not , ”
76480	76493	76494	76494	Hagrid	198	“ I see enough of these foul things during lessons , thanks . ”
76502	76510	76511	76511	he	198	“ Yeh’ll do wha ’ yer told , ”
76514	76539	76511	76511	he	198	“ or I ’ll be takin ’ a leaf outta Professor Moody ’s book ... I hear yeh made a good ferret , Malfoy . ”
76715	76718	76720	76720	Harry	447	“ Brilliant ! ”
76722	76741	76720	76720	Harry	447	“ It ’s Potions last thing on Friday ! Snape wo n’t have time to poison us all ! ”
76768	76774	76786	76786	his	257	“ Only a week away ! ”
76790	76805	76786	76786	his	257	“ I wonder if Cedric knows ? Think I ’ll go and tell him ... ”
76806	76809	76811	76811	Ron	188	“ Cedric ? ”
76818	76821	76823	76823	Harry	447	“ Diggory , ”
76825	76833	76823	76823	Harry	447	“ He must be entering the tournament . ”
76834	76841	76843	76843	Ron	188	“ That idiot , Hogwarts champion ? ”
76857	76877	76879	76879	Hermione	178	“ He ’s not an idiot . You just do n’t like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch , ”
76881	76898	76899	76899	She	178	“ I ’ve heard he ’s a really good student — and he ’s a prefect . ”
76908	76918	76920	76920	Ron	188	“ You only like him because he ’s handsome , ”
76923	76938	76940	76940	Hermione	178	“ Excuse me , I do n’t like people just because they ’re handsome ! ”
76954	76957	76943	76943	Ron	188	“ Lockhart ! ”
77145	77169	77135	77139	Other members of the staff	2192	“ Longbottom , kindly do not reveal that you ca n’t even perform a simple Switching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang ! ”
77347	77356	77357	77357	George	193	“ It ’s a bummer , all right , ”
77364	77403	77357	77357	George	193	“ But if he wo n’t talk to us in person , we ’ll have to send him the letter after all . Or we ’ll stuff it into his hand . He ca n’t avoid us forever . ”
77404	77410	77412	77412	Ron	188	“ Who ’s avoiding you ? ”
77420	77425	77427	77427	Fred	192	“ Wish you would , ”
77435	77441	77442	77442	Ron	188	“ What ’s a bummer ? ”
77446	77457	77459	77459	George	193	“ Having a nosy git like you for a brother , ”
77461	77473	77474	77474	Harry	447	“ You two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament yet ? ”
77477	77486	77474	77474	Harry	447	“ Thought any more about trying to enter ? ”
77487	77502	77504	77504	George	193	“ I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she was n’t telling , ”
77507	77523	77504	77504	George	193	“ She just told me to shut up and get on with Transfiguring my raccoon . ”
77524	77534	77536	77536	Ron	188	“ Wonder what the tasks are going to be ? ”
77539	77559	77536	77536	Ron	188	“ You know , I bet we could do them , Harry . We ’ve done dangerous stuff before ... ”
77560	77574	77576	77576	Fred	192	“ Not in front of a panel of judges , you have n’t , ”
77578	77596	77576	77576	Fred	192	“ McGonagall says the champions get awarded points according to how well they ’ve done the tasks . ”
77597	77603	77604	77604	Harry	447	“ Who are the judges ? ”
77607	77622	77624	77624	Hermione	178	“ Well , the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel , ”
77636	77665	77627	77627	everyone	658	“ because all three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792 , when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage . ”
77693	77747	77677	77677	her	178	“ It ’s all in Hogwarts : A History . Though , of course , that book ’s not entirely reliable . A Revised History of Hogwarts would be a more accurate title . Or A Highly Biased and Selective History of Hogwarts , Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School . ”
77748	77755	77757	77757	Ron	188	“ What are you on about ? ”
77768	77773	77777	77777	her	178	“ House - elves ! ”
77781	77810	77777	77777	her	178	“ Not once , in over a thousand pages , does Hogwarts : A History mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slaves ! ”
77943	77977	77978	77978	she	178	“ You do realize that your sheets are changed , your fires lit , your classrooms cleaned , and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid and enslaved ? ”
78081	78095	78072	78072	George	193	“ Listen , have you ever been down in the kitchens , Hermione ? ”
78096	78103	78105	78105	Hermione	178	“ No , of course not , ”
78108	78117	78105	78105	Hermione	178	“ I hardly think students are supposed to — ”
78118	78124	78126	78126	George	193	“ Well , we have , ”
78131	78163	78126	78126	George	193	“ loads of times , to nick food . And we ’ve met them , and they ’re happy . They think they ’ve got the best job in the world — ”
78164	78174	78175	78175	Hermione	178	“ That ’s because they ’re uneducated and brainwashed ! ”
78361	78370	78371	78371	Ron	188	“ Why d’you have to keep changing owls ? ”
78378	78385	78387	78387	Hermione	178	“ Hedwig’ll attract too much attention , ”
78391	78420	78387	78387	Hermione	178	“ She stands out . A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he ’s hiding ... I mean , they ’re not native birds , are they ? ”
78492	78497	78498	78498	he	447	“ Thanks , Hedwig , ”
78642	78649	78650	78651	Professor McGonagall	343	“ Weasley , straighten your hat , ”
78656	78669	78654	78654	Ron	188	“ Miss Patil , take that ridiculous thing out of your hair . ”
78685	78691	78693	78694	Professor McGonagall	343	“ Follow me , please , ”
78696	78705	78693	78694	Professor McGonagall	343	“ First years in front ... no pushing ... ”
78775	78779	78781	78781	Ron	188	“ Nearly six , ”
78799	78810	78781	78781	Ron	188	“ How d’you reckon they ’re coming ? The train ? ”
78811	78816	78818	78818	Hermione	178	“ I doubt it , ”
78820	78827	78828	78828	Harry	447	“ How , then ? Broomsticks ? ”
78838	78851	78828	78828	Harry	447	“ I do n’t think so ... not from that far away ... ”
78852	78856	78857	78857	Ron	188	“ A Portkey ? ”
78860	78880	78857	78857	Ron	188	“ Or they could Apparate — maybe you ’re allowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come from ? ”
78881	78900	78902	78902	Hermione	178	“ You ca n’t Apparate inside the Hogwarts grounds , how often do I have to tell you ? ”
78969	78985	78955	78956	Mr. Weasley	190	“ always the same — we ca n’t resist showing off when we get together ... ”
79003	79019	78988	78988	Dumbledore	187	“ Aha ! Unless I am very much mistaken , the delegation from Beauxbatons approaches ! ”
79020	79023	79025	79026	many students	2226	“ Where ? ”
79035	79038	79040	79042	a sixth year	2227	“ There ! ”
79083	79089	79040	79042	a sixth year	2227	“ It ’s a dragon ! ”
79102	79114	79116	79117	Dennis Creevey	351	“ Do n’t be stupid ... it ’s a flying house ! ”
79641	79647	79648	79648	he	187	“ My dear Madame Maxime , ”
79651	79656	79648	79648	he	187	“ Welcome to Hogwarts . ”
79657	79662	79664	79665	Madame Maxime	313	“ Dumbly - dorr , ”
79671	79680	79664	79665	Madame Maxime	313	“ I ’ ope I find you well ? ”
79681	79690	79692	79692	Dumbledore	187	“ In excellent form , I thank you , ”
79694	79698	79700	79701	Madame Maxime	313	“ My pupils , ”
79832	79839	79840	79841	Madame Maxime	313	“ ’ As Karkaroff arrived yet ? ”
79844	79852	79854	79854	Dumbledore	187	“ He should be here any moment , ”
79856	79879	79854	79854	Dumbledore	187	“ Would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle ? ”
79880	79887	79889	79890	Madame Maxime	313	“ Warm up , I think , ”
79892	79898	79889	79890	Madame Maxime	313	“ But ze ’ orses — ”
79899	79915	79917	79917	Dumbledore	187	“ Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them , ”
79919	79944	79917	79917	Dumbledore	187	“ the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other — er — charges . ”
79945	79948	79949	79949	Ron	188	“ Skrewts , ”
79956	79967	79969	79970	Madame Maxime	313	“ My steeds require — er — forceful ’ andling , ”
79993	79999	79975	79975	she	313	“ Zey are very strong ... ”
80000	80014	80016	80016	Dumbledore	187	“ I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job , ”
80020	80024	80026	80027	Madame Maxime	313	“ Very well , ”
80032	80051	80061	80061	Dumbledore	187	“ Will you please inform zis ’ Agrid zat ze ’ orses drink only single - malt whiskey ? ”
80052	80059	80061	80061	Dumbledore	187	“ It will be attended to , ”
80066	80069	80071	80072	Madame Maxime	313	“ Come , ”
80096	80109	80110	80111	Seamus Finnigan	252	“ How big d’you reckon Durmstrang ’s horses are going to be ? ”
80125	80147	80149	80149	Harry	447	“ Well , if they ’re any bigger than this lot , even Hagrid wo n’t be able to handle them , ”
80151	80171	80149	80149	Harry	447	“ That ’s if he has n’t been attacked by his skrewts . Wonder what ’s up with them ? ”
80172	80178	80180	80180	Ron	188	“ Maybe they ’ve escaped , ”
80183	80190	80192	80192	Hermione	178	“ Oh do n’t say that , ”
80197	80206	80192	80192	Hermione	178	“ Imagine that lot loose on the grounds ... ”
80255	80261	80263	80263	Ron	188	“ Can you hear something ? ”
80304	80308	80310	80311	Lee Jordan	384	“ The lake ! ”
80318	80324	80310	80311	Lee Jordan	384	“ Look at the lake ! ”
80450	80456	80457	80457	he	447	“ It ’s a mast ! ”
80681	80684	80685	80685	he	2283	“ Dumbledore ! ”
80695	80708	80685	80685	he	2283	“ How are you , my dear fellow , how are you ? ”
80709	80718	80719	80719	Dumbledore	187	“ Blooming , thank you , Professor Karkaroff , ”
80795	80800	80801	80801	he	417	“ Dear old Hogwarts , ”
80837	80872	80873	80873	Karkaroff	417	“ How good it is to be here , how good ... Viktor , come along , into the warmth ... you do n’t mind , Dumbledore ? Viktor has a slight head cold ... ”
80925	80932	80909	80909	Ron	188	“ Harry — it ’s Krum ! ”
80939	80963	80964	80964	Krum	225	” Ron said , in a stunned voice , as the Hogwarts students filed back up the steps behind the party from Durmstrang . “
80971	80972	80968	80969	Viktor Krum	225	” “
80987	80991	80980	80980	he	225	” said Hermione . “
80997	81013	81014	81014	Hermione	178	” Ron said , looking at her as though he could n’t believe his ears . “
81037	81098	81027	81027	I	0	” As they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of the Hogwarts students heading for the Great Hall , Harry saw Lee Jordan jumping up and down on the soles of his feet to get a better look at the back of Krum ’s head . Several sixth - year girls were frantically searching their pockets as they walked — “
81116	81117	81106	81106	I	0	” “
81128	81129	81120	81120	he	225	” “
81132	81148	81120	81120	he	225	” Hermione said loftily as they passed the girls , now squabbling over the lipstick . “
81158	81162	81149	81149	I	0	” said Ron . “
81175	81176	81171	81171	you	0	” “
81186	81273	81171	81171	you	0	” said Harry . They walked over to the Gryffindor table and sat down . Ron took care to sit on the side facing the doorway , because Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students were still gathered around it , apparently unsure about where they should sit . The students from Beauxbatons had chosen seats at the Ravenclaw table . They were looking around the Great Hall with glum expressions on their faces . Three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads . “
81280	81285	81171	81171	you	0	” said Hermione defensively . “
81293	81294	81289	81289	they	2297	” “
81304	81308	81289	81289	they	2297	” Ron hissed . “
81321	81322	81312	81312	Hermione	178	” “
81325	81326	81312	81312	Hermione	178	” “
81330	81377	81312	81312	Hermione	178	” said Ron bitterly . Viktor Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students had settled themselves at the Slytherin table . Harry could see Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle looking very smug about this . As he watched , Malfoy bent forward to speak to Krum . “
81391	81396	81389	81389	Malfoy	282	” said Ron scathingly . “
81457	81461	81462	81462	They	2302	” Hermione snorted . “
81472	81564	81462	81462	They	2302	” said Harry . The Durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy furs and looking up at the starry black ceiling with expressions of interest ; a couple of them were picking up the golden plates and goblets and examining them , apparently impressed . Up at the staff table , Filch , the caretaker , was adding chairs . He was wearing his moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion . Harry was surprised to see that he added four chairs , two on either side of Dumbledore ’s . “
81573	81577	81569	81571	two extra people	2303	” Harry said . “
81591	81592	81580	81580	Filch	413	” “
81595	81717	81580	81580	Filch	413	” said Ron vaguely . He was still staring avidly at Krum . When all the students had entered the Hall and settled down at their House tables , the staff entered , filing up to the top table and taking their seats . Last in line were Professor Dumbledore , Professor Karkaroff , and Madame Maxime . When their headmistress appeared , the pupils from Beauxbatons leapt to their feet . A few of the Hogwarts students laughed . The Beauxbatons party appeared quite unembarrassed , however , and did not resume their seats until Madame Maxime had sat down on Dumbledore ’s left - hand side . Dumbledore remained standing , and a silence fell over the Great Hall . “
81733	81744	81745	81745	I	0	” said Dumbledore , beaming around at the foreign students . “
81771	81792	81756	81756	I	0	” One of the Beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave what was unmistakably a derisive laugh . “
81800	81808	81756	81756	I	0	” Hermione whispered , bristling at her . “
81822	81826	81756	81756	I	0	” said Dumbledore . “
81843	81914	81827	81827	I	0	” He sat down , and Harry saw Karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him in conversation . The plates in front of them filled with food as usual . The house - elves in the kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops ; there was a greater variety of dishes in front of them than Harry had ever seen , including several that were definitely foreign . “
81919	81946	81827	81827	I	0	” said Ron , pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish stew that stood beside a large steak - and - kidney pudding . “
81949	81953	81827	81827	I	0	” said Hermione . “
81957	81961	81955	81955	you	2308	” said Ron . “
81966	81970	81971	81971	I	0	” said Hermione , “
81985	81986	81987	81987	I	0	” “
81995	82113	81990	81990	your	0	” said Ron , helping himself to black pudding . The Great Hall seemed somehow much more crowded than usual , even though there were barely twenty additional students there ; perhaps it was because their differently colored uniforms stood out so clearly against the black of the Hogwarts robes . Now that they had removed their furs , the Durmstrang students were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep bloodred . Hagrid sidled into the Hall through a door behind the staff table twenty minutes after the start of the feast . He slid into his seat at the end and waved at Harry , Ron , and Hermione with a very heavily bandaged hand . “
82121	82125	82119	82119	Hagrid	198	” Harry called . “
82129	82135	82142	82142	they	2312	” Hagrid called back happily . “
82145	82150	82142	82142	they	2312	” said Ron quietly . “
82170	82179	82166	82166	Hagrid	198	” At that moment , a voice said , “
82189	82266	82184	82184	you	0	” It was the girl from Beauxbatons who had laughed during Dumbledore ’s speech . She had finally removed her muffler . A long sheet of silvery - blonde hair fell almost to her waist . She had large , deep blue eyes , and very white , even teeth . Ron went purple . He stared up at her , opened his mouth to reply , but nothing came out except a faint gurgling noise . “
82272	82283	82184	82184	you	0	” said Harry , pushing the dish toward the girl . “
82291	82292	82284	82284	You	0	” “
82295	82300	82284	82284	You	0	” Ron said breathlessly . “
82307	82356	82284	82284	You	0	” The girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off to the Ravenclaw table . Ron was still goggling at the girl as though he had never seen one before . Harry started to laugh . The sound seemed to jog Ron back to his senses . “
82362	82369	82357	82357	She	2314	” he said hoarsely to Harry . “
82376	82381	82372	82372	she	2314	” said Hermione tartly . “
82395	82433	82434	82434	I	0	” But she was n’t entirely right about that . As the girl crossed the Hall , many boys ’ heads turned , and some of them seemed to have become temporarily speechless , just like Ron . “
82446	82462	82463	82463	They	2320	” said Ron , leaning sideways so he could keep a clear view of her . “
82473	82474	82463	82463	They	2320	” “
82482	82506	82475	82475	They	2320	” said Harry without thinking . Cho happened to be sitting only a few places away from the girl with the silvery hair . “
82517	82522	82475	82475	They	2320	” said Hermione briskly , “
82534	82580	82583	82583	they	2320	” She was pointing up at the staff table . The two remaining empty seats had just been filled . Ludo Bagman was now sitting on Professor Karkaroff ’s other side , while Mr. Crouch , Percy ’s boss , was next to Madame Maxime . “
82587	82593	82583	82583	they	2320	” said Harry in surprise . “
82604	82608	82602	82602	they	2320	” said Hermione . “
82621	82752	82611	82611	they	2320	” When the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar desserts too . Ron examined an odd sort of pale blancmange closely , then moved it carefully a few inches to his right , so that it would be clearly visible from the Ravenclaw table . The girl who looked like a veela appeared to have eaten enough , however , and did not come over to get it . Once the golden plates had been wiped clean , Dumbledore stood up again . A pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the Hall now . Harry felt a slight thrill of excitement , wondering what was coming . Several seats down from them , Fred and George were leaning forward , staring at Dumbledore with great concentration . “
82758	82771	82611	82611	they	2320	” said Dumbledore , smiling around at the sea of upturned faces . “
82797	82798	82780	82780	I	0	” “
82802	82809	82780	82780	I	0	” Harry muttered . Ron shrugged . “
82851	82861	82863	82865	Mr. Ludo Bagman	221	” — there was a smattering of polite applause — “
82877	82976	82977	82978	Mr. Bagman	221	” There was a much louder round of applause for Bagman than for Crouch , perhaps because of his fame as a Beater , or simply because he looked so much more likable . He acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand . Bartemius Crouch did not smile or wave when his name was announced . Remembering him in his neat suit at the Quidditch World Cup , Harry thought he looked strange in wizard ’s robes . His toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd next to Dumbledore ’s long white hair and beard . “
82998	83002	82980	82981	Mr. Crouch	219	” Dumbledore continued , “
83027	83034	83014	83015	Madame Maxime	313	” At the mention of the word “
83037	83063	83014	83015	Madame Maxime	313	” the attentiveness of the listening students seemed to sharpen . Perhaps Dumbledore had noticed their sudden stillness , for he smiled as he said , “
83076	83147	83073	83074	Mr. Filch	379	” Filch , who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the Hall , now approached Dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels . It looked extremely old . A murmur of excited interest rose from the watching students ; Dennis Creevey actually stood on his chair to see it properly , but , being so tiny , his head hardly rose above anyone else ’s . “
83170	83185	83187	83187	they	2326	” said Dumbledore as Filch placed the chest carefully on the table before him , “
83244	83266	83210	83210	they	2326	” At this last word , the Hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody seemed to be breathing . “
83278	83284	83308	83316	the champion with the highest total after task three	2332	” Dumbledore went on calmly , “
83338	83424	83323	83324	The champions	6016	” Dumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of the casket . The lid creaked slowly open . Dumbledore reached inside it and pulled out a large , roughly hewn wooden cup . It would have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing blue - white flames . Dumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it , where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the Hall . “
83451	83455	83456	83457	Aspiring champions	2336	” said Dumbledore . “
83519	83530	83532	83532	Dumbledore	187	“ To ensure that no underage student yields to temptation , ”
83534	83571	83532	83532	Dumbledore	187	“ I will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall . Nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line . “
83690	83691	83687	83687	you	2341	” “
83696	83722	83687	83687	you	2341	” Fred Weasley said , his eyes glinting , as they all made their way across the Hall to the doors into the entrance hall . “
83762	83763	83765	83765	I	0	” “
83777	83781	83765	83765	I	0	” said Hermione , “
83789	83790	83793	83793	yourself	2341	” “
83795	83800	83793	83793	yourself	2341	” said George shortly . “
83814	83870	83812	83812	Harry	447	” Harry thought briefly of Dumbledore ’s insistence that nobody under seventeen should submit their name , but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the Triwizard Tournament filled his mind again ... He wondered how angry Dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get over the Age Line ... “
83875	83903	83904	83904	Dumbledore	187	” said Ron , who was n’t listening to a word of this conversation , but looking through the crowd to see what had become of Krum . “
83918	83946	83916	83916	he	187	” But this query was answered almost instantly ; they were level with the Slytherin table now , and Karkaroff had just bustled up to his students . “
83954	83959	83960	83960	Viktor	225	” he was saying . “
83983	83998	83999	83999	Professor	5780	” Harry saw Krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on . “
84007	84017	84001	84001	I	0	” said one of the other Durmstrang boys hopefully . “
84028	84041	84026	84026	Poliakoff	420	” snapped Karkaroff , his warmly paternal air vanishing in an instant . “
84060	84095	84057	84058	disgusting boy	2354	” Karkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors , reaching them at exactly the same moment as Harry , Ron , and Hermione . Harry stopped to let him walk through first . “
84099	84213	84057	84058	disgusting boy	2354	” said Karkaroff carelessly , glancing at him . And then Karkaroff froze . He turned his head back to Harry and stared at him as though he could n’t believe his eyes . Behind their headmaster , the students from Durmstrang came to a halt too . Karkaroff ’s eyes moved slowly up Harry ’s face and fixed upon his scar . The Durmstrang students were staring curiously at Harry too . Out of the corner of his eye , Harry saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces . The boy with food all down his front nudged the girl next to him and pointed openly at Harry ’s forehead . “
84221	84282	84283	84283	You	2355	” said a growling voice from behind them . Professor Karkaroff spun around . Mad - Eye Moody was standing there , leaning heavily on his staff , his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the Durmstrang headmaster . The color drained from Karkaroff ’s face as Harry watched . A terrible look of mingled fury and fear came over him . “
84285	84301	84302	84302	Me	0	” he said , staring at Moody as though unsure he was really seeing him . “
84304	84309	84302	84302	Me	0	” said Moody grimly . “
84335	84518	84329	84329	You	2355	” It was true ; half the students in the Hall were now waiting behind them , looking over one another ’s shoulders to see what was causing the holdup . Without another word , Professor Karkaroff swept his students away with him . Moody watched him until he was out of sight , his magical eye fixed upon his back , a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face . As the next day was Saturday , most students would normally have breakfasted late . Harry , Ron , and Hermione , however , were not alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends . When they went down into the entrance hall , they saw about twenty people milling around it , some of them eating toast , all examining the Goblet of Fire . It had been placed in the center of the hall on the stool that normally bore the Sorting Hat . A thin golden line had been traced on the floor , forming a circle ten feet around it in every direction . “
84526	84536	84519	84519	Anyone	816	” Ron asked a third - year girl eagerly . “
84542	84546	84519	84519	Anyone	816	” she replied . “
84557	84558	84562	84562	them	816	” “
84576	84580	84560	84562	some of them	2358	” said Harry . “
84609	84639	84560	84562	some of them	2358	” Someone laughed behind Harry . Turning , he saw Fred , George , and Lee Jordan hurrying down the staircase , all three of them looking extremely excited . “
84643	84658	84560	84562	some of them	2358	” Fred said in a triumphant whisper to Harry , Ron , and Hermione . “
84663	84664	84560	84562	some of them	2358	” “
84667	84671	84560	84562	some of them	2358	” said Ron . “
84679	84683	84560	84562	some of them	2358	” said Fred . “
84688	84699	84560	84562	some of them	2358	” said George , rubbing his hands together with glee . “
84710	84711	84560	84562	some of them	2358	” “
84731	84738	84739	84739	I	0	” said Lee , grinning broadly . “
84752	84757	84739	84739	I	0	” said Hermione warningly . “
84768	84778	84761	84761	Dumbledore	187	” Fred , George , and Lee ignored her . “
84781	84793	84761	84761	Dumbledore	187	” Fred said to the other two , quivering with excitement . “
84804	85015	84799	84799	I	0	” Harry watched , fascinated , as Fred pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket bearing the words Fred Weasley — Hogwarts . Fred walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there , rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a fifty - foot drop . Then , with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him , he took a great breath and stepped over the line . For a split second Harry thought it had worked — George certainly thought so , for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after Fred — but next moment , there was a loud sizzling sound , and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible shot - putter . They landed painfully , ten feet away on the cold stone floor , and to add insult to injury , there was a loud popping noise , and both of them sprouted identical long white beards . The entrance hall rang with laughter . Even Fred and George joined in , once they had gotten to their feet and taken a good look at each other ’s beards . “
85021	85053	85016	85016	I	0	” said a deep , amused voice , and everyone turned to see Professor Dumbledore coming out of the Great Hall . He surveyed Fred and George , his eyes twinkling . “
85111	85211	85095	85095	I	0	” Fred and George set off for the hospital wing , accompanied by Lee , who was howling with laughter , and Harry , Ron , and Hermione , also chortling , went in to breakfast . The decorations in the Great Hall had changed this morning . As it was Halloween , a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling , while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner . Harry led the way over to Dean and Seamus , who were discussing those Hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering . “
85229	85234	85219	85219	Warrington	423	” Dean told Harry . “
85246	85262	85219	85219	Warrington	423	” Harry , who had played Quidditch against Warrington , shook his head in disgust . “
85271	85272	85267	85269	a Slytherin champion	2368	” “
85282	85287	85275	85276	the Hufflepuffs	346	” said Seamus contemptuously . “
85304	85305	85294	85294	he	238	” “
85308	85371	85294	85294	he	238	” said Hermione suddenly . People were cheering out in the entrance hall . They all swiveled around in their seats and saw Angelina Johnson coming into the Hall , grinning in an embarrassed sort of way . A tall black girl who played Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team , Angelina came over to them , sat down , and said , “
85385	85386	85387	85387	You	2369	” “
85391	85398	85387	85387	You	2369	” said Ron , looking impressed . “
85405	85409	85412	85412	she	2370	” asked Harry . “
85424	85428	85422	85422	you	2369	” said Ron . “
85436	85440	85429	85429	I	0	” said Angelina . “
85452	85456	85443	85443	I	0	” said Hermione . “
85466	85467	85464	85464	Angelina	424	” “
85472	85480	85470	85470	Hermione	178	” said Angelina , smiling at her . “
85491	85507	85486	85489	Pretty - Boy Diggory	425	” said Seamus , causing several Hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at him . “
85518	85536	85537	85537	We	2372	” Ron asked Harry and Hermione when they had finished breakfast and were leaving the Great Hall . “
85547	85551	85537	85537	We	2372	” said Harry . “
85554	85558	85537	85537	We	2372	” said Ron , “
85577	85590	85563	85563	he	198	” A look of great excitement suddenly dawned on Hermione ’s face . “
85606	85611	85617	85617	you	2373	” she said brightly . “
85628	85629	85620	85620	I	0	” “
85636	85651	85634	85634	her	2375	” said Ron , exasperated , as Hermione ran away up the marble staircase . “
85656	85661	85654	85654	Ron	188	” said Harry suddenly . “
85667	85762	85664	85665	your friend	2376	” The students from Beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the grounds , among them , the veela - girl . Those gathered around the Goblet of Fire stood back to let them pass , watching eagerly . Madame Maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them into a line . One by one , the Beauxbatons students stepped across the Age Line and dropped their slips of parchment into the blue - white flames . As each name entered the fire , it turned briefly red and emitted sparks . “
85775	85794	85835	85835	she	313	” Ron muttered to Harry as the veela - girl dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire . “
85811	85812	85835	85835	she	313	” “
85815	85819	85835	85835	she	313	” said Harry . “
85837	85864	85835	85835	she	313	” When all the Beauxbatons students had submitted their names , Madame Maxime led them back out of the hall and out onto the grounds again . “
85872	85903	85835	85835	she	313	” said Ron , moving toward the front doors and staring after them . A loud rattling noise behind them announced Hermione ’s reappearance with the box of S.P.E.W. badges . “
85910	86036	85835	85835	she	313	” said Ron , and he jumped down the stone steps , keeping his eyes on the back of the veela - girl , who was now halfway across the lawn with Madame Maxime . As they neared Hagrid ’s cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest , the mystery of the Beauxbatons ’ sleeping quarters was solved . The gigantic powder - blue carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from Hagrid ’s front door , and the students were climbing back inside it . The elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it . Harry knocked on Hagrid ’s door , and Fang ’s booming barks answered instantly . “
86041	86053	85835	85835	she	313	” said Hagrid , when he ’d flung open the door . “
86062	86063	86055	86055	you	2379	” “
86072	86205	86070	86070	Hag	426	” Hermione started to say , but then she stopped dead , looking up at Hagrid , apparently lost for words . Hagrid was wearing his best ( and very horrible ) hairy brown suit , plus a checked yellow - and - orange tie . This was n’t the worst of it , though ; he had evidently tried to tame his hair , using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease . It was now slicked down into two bunches — perhaps he had tried a ponytail like Bill ’s , but found he had too much hair . The look did n’t really suit Hagrid at all . For a moment , Hermione goggled at him , then , obviously deciding not to comment , she said , “
86213	86214	86070	86070	Hag	426	” “
86221	86226	86070	86070	Hag	426	” said Hagrid happily . “
86254	86255	86246	86246	they	2380	” “
86261	86292	86246	86246	they	2380	” said Hermione , shooting a repressive look at Ron , who , staring at Hagrid ’s odd hairstyle , had just opened his mouth to say something about it . “
86295	86300	86070	86070	Hag	426	” said Hagrid sadly . “
86322	86323	86307	86307	I	0	” “
86330	86426	86427	86427	You	2382	” said Ron . Hagrid missed the sarcasm . Hagrid ’s cabin comprised a single room , in one corner of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt . A similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling . They sat down at the table while Hagrid started to make tea , and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the Triwizard Tournament . Hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were . “
86430	86436	86437	86437	You	2382	” he said , grinning . “
86467	86468	86460	86460	I	0	” “
86474	86493	86472	86472	Hagrid	198	” Harry , Ron , and Hermione urged him , but he just shook his head , grinning . “
86504	86508	86494	86494	I	0	” said Hagrid . “
86546	86698	86538	86538	ter	2384	” They ended up having lunch with Hagrid , though they did n’t eat much — Hagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole , but after Hermione unearthed a large talon in hers , she , Harry , and Ron rather lost their appetites . However , they enjoyed themselves trying to make Hagrid tell them what the tasks in the tournament were going to be , speculating which of the entrants were likely to be selected as champions , and wondering whether Fred and George were beardless yet . A light rain had started to fall by midafternoon ; it was very cozy sitting by the fire , listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window , watching Hagrid darning his socks and arguing with Hermione about house - elves — for he flatly refused to join S.P.E.W. when she showed him her badges . “
86709	86724	86707	86707	Hermione	178	” he said gravely , threading a massive bone needle with thick yellow yarn . “
86767	86768	86761	86761	yeh	2387	” “
86784	86788	86776	86776	he	447	” said Hermione . “
86799	86800	86792	86792	he	447	” “
86846	86908	86844	86844	Hermione	178	” Hermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of badges back into her cloak pocket . By half past five it was growing dark , and Ron , Harry , and Hermione decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the Halloween feast — and , more important , the announcement of the school champions . “
86915	86924	86909	86909	I	0	” said Hagrid , putting away his darning . “
86932	86977	86978	86978	Hagrid	198	” Hagrid got up , went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed , and began searching for something inside it . They did n’t pay too much attention until a truly horrible smell reached their nostrils . Coughing , Ron said , “
86984	86985	86978	86978	Hagrid	198	” “
86988	87002	86978	86978	Hagrid	198	” said Hagrid , turning around with a large bottle in his hand . “
87009	87010	87005	87005	yeh	2387	” “
87015	87024	87005	87005	yeh	2387	” said Hermione in a slightly choked voice . “
87031	87039	87005	87005	yeh	2387	” Hagrid muttered . He was blushing . “
87047	87052	87053	87053	I	0	” he said gruffly . “
87063	87086	87053	87053	I	0	” He stumped out of the cabin , and they saw him washing himself vigorously in the water barrel outside the window . “
87091	87097	87098	87098	Hagrid	198	” said Hermione in amazement . “
87100	87101	87098	87098	Hagrid	198	” “
87112	87119	87098	87098	Hagrid	198	” said Harry in an undertone . “
87122	87257	87258	87258	He	2391	” said Ron suddenly , pointing out of the window . Hagrid had just straightened up and turned ’ round . If he had been blushing before , it was nothing to what he was doing now . Getting to their feet very cautiously , so that Hagrid would n’t spot them , Harry , Ron , and Hermione peered through the window and saw that Madame Maxime and the Beauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage , clearly about to set off for the feast too . They could n’t hear what Hagrid was saying , but he was talking to Madame Maxime with a rapt , misty - eyed expression Harry had only ever seen him wear once before — when he had been looking at the baby dragon , Norbert . “
87268	87273	87258	87258	He	2391	” said Hermione indignantly . “
87282	87322	87276	87276	he	2391	” Without so much as a backward glance at his cabin , Hagrid was trudging off up the grounds with Madame Maxime , the Beauxbatons students following in their wake , jogging to keep up with their enormous strides . “
87327	87332	87323	87323	He	2391	” said Ron incredulously . “
87361	87398	87342	87342	they	2395	” They let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them . It was surprisingly dark outside . Drawing their cloaks more closely around themselves , they set off up the sloping lawns . “
87406	87531	87342	87342	they	2395	” Hermione whispered . The Durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle from the lake . Viktor Krum was walking side by side with Karkaroff , and the other Durmstrang students were straggling along behind them . Ron watched Krum excitedly , but Krum did not look around as he reached the front doors a little ahead of Hermione , Ron , and Harry and proceeded through them . When they entered the candlelit Great Hall it was almost full . The Goblet of Fire had been moved ; it was now standing in front of Dumbledore ’s empty chair at the teachers ’ table . Fred and George — clean - shaven again — seemed to have taken their disappointment fairly well . “
87537	87550	87535	87535	Angelina	424	” said Fred as Harry , Ron , and Hermione sat down . “
87555	87560	87553	87553	I	0	” said Hermione breathlessly . “
87568	87745	87553	87553	I	0	” The Halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual . Perhaps because it was their second feast in two days , Harry did n’t seem to fancy the extravagantly prepared food as much as he would have normally . Like everyone else in the Hall , judging by the constantly craning necks , the impatient expressions on every face , the fidgeting , and the standing up to see whether Dumbledore had finished eating yet , Harry simply wanted the plates to clear , and to hear who had been selected as champions . At long last , the golden plates returned to their original spotless state ; there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the Hall , which died away almost instantly as Dumbledore got to his feet . On either side of him , Professor Karkaroff and Madame Maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone . Ludo Bagman was beaming and winking at various students . Mr. Crouch , however , looked quite uninterested , almost bored . “
87758	87762	87763	87763	I	0	” said Dumbledore . “
87810	87821	87763	87763	I	0	” — he indicated the door behind the staff table — “
87831	87913	87763	87763	I	0	” He took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it ; at once , all the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished , plunging them into a state of semidarkness . The Goblet of Fire now shone more brightly than anything in the whole Hall , the sparkling bright , bluey - whiteness of the flames almost painful on the eyes . Everyone watched , waiting ... A few people kept checking their watches ... “
87917	88008	87763	87763	I	0	” Lee Jordan whispered , two seats away from Harry . The flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again . Sparks began to fly from it . Next moment , a tongue of flame shot into the air , a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it — the whole room gasped . Dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at arm ’s length , so that he could read it by the light of the flames , which had turned back to blue - white . “
88014	88025	87763	87763	I	0	” he read , in a strong , clear voice , “
88031	88032	88028	88029	Viktor Krum	225	” “
88037	88086	88089	88089	Viktor	225	” yelled Ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept the Hall . Harry saw Viktor Krum rise from the Slytherin table and slouch up toward Dumbledore ; he turned right , walked along the staff table , and disappeared through the door into the next chamber . “
88091	88109	88089	88089	Viktor	225	” boomed Karkaroff , so loudly that everyone could hear him , even over all the applause . “
88117	88161	88162	88165	The champion for Beauxbatons	2402	” The clapping and chatting died down . Now everyone ’s attention was focused again on the goblet , which , seconds later , turned red once more . A second piece of parchment shot out of it , propelled by the flames . “
88167	88171	88162	88165	The champion for Beauxbatons	2402	” said Dumbledore , “
88176	88177	88180	88180	her	428	” “
88184	88220	88182	88182	Ron	188	” Harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet , shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair , and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables . “
88229	88245	88224	88224	they	2403	” Hermione said over the noise , nodding toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party . “
88247	88356	88357	88359	The Hogwarts champion	1947	” was a bit of an understatement , Harry thought . Two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms . When Fleur Delacour too had vanished into the side chamber , silence fell again , but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it . The Hogwarts champion next ... And the Goblet of Fire turned red once more ; sparks showered out of it ; the tongue of flame shot high into the air , and from its tip Dumbledore pulled the third piece of parchment . “
88361	88365	88357	88359	The Hogwarts champion	1947	” he called , “
88370	88371	88367	88368	Cedric Diggory	238	” “
88374	88457	88367	88368	Cedric Diggory	238	” said Ron loudly , but nobody heard him except Harry ; the uproar from the next table was too great . Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet , screaming and stamping , as Cedric made his way past them , grinning broadly , and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers ’ table . Indeed , the applause for Cedric went on so long that it was some time before Dumbledore could make himself heard again . “
88460	88472	88367	88368	Cedric Diggory	238	” Dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down . “
88528	88648	88649	88650	Harry Potter	447	” But Dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking , and it was apparent to everybody what had distracted him . The fire in the goblet had just turned red again . Sparks were flying out of it . A long flame shot suddenly into the air , and borne upon it was another piece of parchment . Automatically , it seemed , Dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the parchment . He held it out and stared at the name written upon it . There was a long pause , during which Dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands , and everyone in the room stared at Dumbledore . And then Dumbledore cleared his throat and read out — “
88652	88652	88649	88650	Harry Potter	447	”
88794	88803	88804	88804	Harry	447	“ I did n’t put my name in , ”
88808	88815	88804	88804	Harry	447	“ You know I did n’t . ”
88841	88845	88846	88846	he	187	“ Harry Potter ! ”
88850	88860	88846	88846	he	187	“ Harry ! Up here , if you please ! ”
88861	88865	88866	88866	Hermione	178	“ Go on , ”
88979	88988	88990	88990	Dumbledore	187	“ Well ... through the door , Harry , ”
89219	89224	89225	89225	she	428	“ What is it ? ”
89228	89238	89225	89225	she	428	“ Do zey want us back in ze Hall ? ”
89311	89314	89315	89315	he	221	“ Extraordinary ! ”
89323	89331	89332	89332	he	221	“ Absolutely extraordinary ! Gentlemen ... lady , ”
89344	89360	89332	89332	he	221	“ May I introduce — incredible though it may seem — the fourth Triwizard champion ? ”
89414	89424	89406	89406	her	428	“ Oh , vairy funny joke , Meester Bagman . ”
89425	89428	89429	89429	Bagman	429	“ Joke ? ”
89434	89455	89429	89429	Bagman	429	“ No , no , not at all ! Harry ’s name just came out of the Goblet of Fire ! ”
89473	89483	89484	89484	she	428	“ But evidently zair ’ as been a mistake , ”
89490	89503	89484	89484	she	428	“ ’ E can not compete . ’ E is too young . ”
89504	89511	89513	89513	Bagman	429	“ Well ... it is amazing , ”
89525	89595	89513	89513	Bagman	429	“ But , as you know , the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure . And as his name ’s come out of the goblet ... I mean , I do n’t think there can be any ducking out at this stage ... It ’s down in the rules , you ’re obliged ... Harry will just have to do the best he — ”
89658	89662	89664	89664	Fleur	428	“ Madame Maxime ! ”
89674	89687	89664	89664	Fleur	428	“ Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also ! ”
89741	89753	89754	89754	she	313	“ What is ze meaning of zis , Dumbly - dorr ? ”
89758	89770	89775	89775	He	417	“ I ’d rather like to know that myself , Dumbledore , ”
89792	89822	89823	89823	He	417	“ Two Hogwarts champions ? I do n’t remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions — or have I not read the rules carefully enough ? ”
89831	89835	89837	89838	Madame Maxime	313	“ C’est impossible , ”
89855	89870	89837	89838	Madame Maxime	313	“ ’ Ogwarts can not ’ ave two champions . It is most injust . ”
89871	89889	89891	89891	Karkaroff	417	“ We were under the impression that your Age Line would keep out younger contestants , Dumbledore , ”
89908	89930	89901	89901	his	417	“ Otherwise , we would , of course , have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools . ”
89931	89944	89946	89946	Snape	357	“ It ’s no one ’s fault but Potter ’s , Karkaroff , ”
89957	89982	89949	89949	His	417	“ Do n’t go blaming Dumbledore for Potter ’s determination to break rules . He has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here — ”
89983	89989	89991	89991	Dumbledore	187	“ Thank you , Severus , ”
90044	90058	90059	90059	he	187	“ Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire , Harry ? ”
90063	90066	90068	90068	Harry	447	“ No , ”
90092	90110	90112	90113	Professor Dumbledore	187	“ Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you ? ”
90118	90121	90123	90123	Harry	447	“ No , ”
90126	90137	90139	90140	Madame Maxime	313	“ Ah , but of course ’ e is lying ! ”
90153	90163	90165	90166	Professor McGonagall	343	“ He could not have crossed the Age Line , ”
90169	90180	90165	90166	Professor McGonagall	343	“ I am sure we are all agreed on that — ”
90181	90195	90197	90198	Madame Maxime	313	“ Dumbly - dorr must ’ ave made a mistake wiz ze line , ”
90202	90210	90212	90212	Dumbledore	187	“ It is possible , of course , ”
90215	90229	90231	90232	Professor McGonagall	343	“ Dumbledore , you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake ! ”
90235	90281	90282	90282	She	343	“ Really , what nonsense ! Harry could not have crossed the line himself , and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him , I ’m sure that should be good enough for everybody else ! ”
90292	90299	90303	90303	his	417	“ Mr. Crouch ... Mr. Bagman , ”
90309	90329	90303	90303	his	417	“ you are our — er — objective judges . Surely you will agree that this is most irregular ? ”
90400	90432	90395	90395	his	433	“ We must follow the rules , and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament . ”
90433	90445	90447	90447	Bagman	433	“ Well , Barty knows the rule book back to front , ”
90467	90481	90483	90483	Karkaroff	417	“ I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students , ”
90505	90537	90496	90496	His	417	“ You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more , and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions . It ’s only fair , Dumbledore . ”
90538	90549	90551	90551	Bagman	433	“ But Karkaroff , it does n’t work like that , ”
90553	90575	90551	90551	Bagman	433	“ The Goblet of Fire ’s just gone out — it wo n’t reignite until the start of the next tournament — ”
90576	90588	90590	90590	Karkaroff	417	“ — in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing ! ”
90592	90621	90590	90590	Karkaroff	417	“ After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises , I little expected something of this nature to occur ! I have half a mind to leave now ! ”
90622	90628	90551	90551	Bagman	433	“ Empty threat , Karkaroff , ”
90637	90671	90672	90672	Moody	332	“ You ca n’t leave your champion now . He ’s got to compete . They ’ve all got to compete . Binding magical contract , like Dumbledore said . Convenient , eh ? ”
90699	90702	90704	90704	Karkaroff	417	“ Convenient ? ”
90706	90718	90704	90704	Karkaroff	417	“ I ’m afraid I do n’t understand you , Moody . ”
90755	90760	90762	90762	Moody	332	“ Do n’t you ? ”
90765	90792	90762	90762	Moody	332	“ It ’s very simple , Karkaroff . Someone put Potter ’s name in that goblet knowing he ’d have to compete if it came out . ”
90793	90810	90812	90813	Madame Maxime	313	“ Evidently , someone ’ oo wished to give ’ Ogwarts two bites at ze apple ! ”
90815	90823	90825	90825	Karkaroff	417	“ I quite agree , Madame Maxime , ”
90831	90849	90825	90825	Karkaroff	417	“ I shall be lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic and the International Confederation of Wizards — ”
90850	90863	90865	90865	Moody	332	“ If anyone ’s got reason to complain , it ’s Potter , ”
90867	90882	90865	90865	Moody	332	“ but ... funny thing ... I do n’t hear him saying a word ... ”
90883	90890	90897	90897	her	428	“ Why should ’ e complain ? ”
90900	90952	90897	90897	her	428	“ ’ E ’ as ze chance to compete , ’ asn’t ’ e ? We ’ ave all been ’ oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks ! Ze honor for our schools ! A thousand Galleons in prize money — zis is a chance many would die for ! ”
90953	90966	90968	90968	Moody	332	“ Maybe someone ’s hoping Potter is going to die for it , ”
91007	91019	91002	91002	his	221	“ Moody , old man ... what a thing to say ! ”
91020	91043	91045	91045	Karkaroff	417	“ We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if he has n’t discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime , ”
91048	91083	91045	91045	Karkaroff	417	“ Apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too . An odd quality in a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher , Dumbledore , but no doubt you had your reasons . ”
91084	91091	91093	91093	Moody	381	“ Imagining things , am I ? ”
91095	91118	91093	91093	Moody	381	“ Seeing things , eh ? It was a skilled witch or wizard who put the boy ’s name in that goblet ... ”
91119	91129	91131	91132	Madame Maxime	313	“ Ah , what evidence is zere of zat ? ”
91140	91150	91152	91152	Moody	381	“ Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object ! ”
91154	91204	91152	91152	Moody	381	“ It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament ... I ’m guessing they submitted Potter ’s name under a fourth school , to make sure he was the only one in his category ... ”
91205	91220	91222	91222	Karkaroff	417	“ You seem to have given this a great deal of thought , Moody , ”
91225	91286	91222	91222	Karkaroff	417	“ and a very ingenious theory it is — though of course , I heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg , and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock . So you ’ll understand if we do n’t take you entirely seriously ... ”
91287	91300	91301	91301	Moody	381	“ There are those who ’ll turn innocent occasions to their advantage , ”
91308	91329	91301	91301	Moody	381	“ It ’s my job to think the way Dark wizards do , Karkaroff — as you ought to remember ... ”
91330	91333	91335	91335	Dumbledore	187	“ Alastor ! ”
91352	91356	91344	91344	he	447	“ Mad - Eye ”
91383	91394	91396	91396	Dumbledore	187	“ How this situation arose , we do not know , ”
91406	91445	91396	91396	Dumbledore	187	“ It seems to me , however , that we have no choice but to accept it . Both Cedric and Harry have been chosen to compete in the tournament . This , therefore , they will do ... ”
91446	91454	91486	91486	she	313	“ Ah , but Dumbly - dorr — ”
91455	91475	91476	91476	Dumbledore	187	“ My dear Madame Maxime , if you have an alternative , I would be delighted to hear it . ”
91513	91523	91524	91524	he	221	“ Well , shall we crack on , then ? ”
91537	91558	91524	91524	he	221	“ Got to give our champions their instructions , have n’t we ? Barty , want to do the honors ? ”
91570	91573	91574	91574	he	433	“ Yes , ”
91577	91586	91574	91574	he	433	“ instructions . Yes ... the first task ... ”
91631	91642	91643	91643	he	433	“ The first task is designed to test your daring , ”
91654	91686	91643	91643	he	433	“ so we are not going to be telling you what it is . Courage in the face of the unknown is an important quality in a wizard ... very important ... “
91712	91790	91791	91792	Mr. Crouch	433	“ The champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament . The champions will face the first challenge armed only with their wands . They will receive information about the second task when the first is over . Owing to the demanding and time - consuming nature of the tournament , the champions are exempted from end - of - year tests . ”
91799	91811	91791	91792	Mr. Crouch	433	“ I think that ’s all , is it , Albus ? ”
91812	91817	91819	91819	Dumbledore	187	“ I think so , ”
91831	91847	91819	91819	Dumbledore	187	“ Are you sure you would n’t like to stay at Hogwarts tonight , Barty ? ”
91848	91861	91863	91864	Mr. Crouch	433	“ No , Dumbledore , I must get back to the Ministry , ”
91866	91900	91863	91864	Mr. Crouch	433	“ It is a very busy , very difficult time at the moment ... I ’ve left young Weatherby in charge ... Very enthusiastic ... a little overenthusiastic , if truth be told ... ”
91901	91916	91918	91918	Dumbledore	187	“ You ’ll come and have a drink before you go , at least ? ”
91920	91930	91932	91932	Bagman	433	“ Come on , Barty , I ’m staying ! ”
91935	91956	91932	91932	Bagman	433	“ It ’s all happening at Hogwarts now , you know , much more exciting here than at the office ! ”
91957	91964	91966	91966	Crouch	269	“ I think not , Ludo , ”
91975	91985	91987	91987	Dumbledore	187	“ Professor Karkaroff — Madame Maxime — a nightcap ? ”
92046	92059	92061	92061	Dumbledore	187	“ Harry , Cedric , I suggest you go up to bed , ”
92069	92106	92061	92061	Dumbledore	187	“ I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you , and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise . ”
92146	92149	92151	92151	Cedric	238	“ So , ”
92158	92167	92151	92151	Cedric	238	“ We ’re playing against each other again ! ”
92168	92172	92174	92174	Harry	447	“ I s’pose , ”
92206	92212	92214	92214	Cedric	238	“ So ... tell me ... ”
92238	92247	92214	92214	Cedric	238	“ How did you get your name in ? ”
92248	92253	92255	92255	Harry	447	“ I did n’t , ”
92262	92276	92255	92255	Harry	447	“ I did n’t put it in . I was telling the truth . ”
92277	92282	92284	92284	Cedric	238	“ Ah ... okay , ”
92295	92303	92289	92289	Cedric	238	“ Well ... see you , then . ”
92767	92774	92776	92778	the Fat Lady	5972	“ Well , well , well , ”
92780	92799	92776	92778	the Fat Lady	5972	“ Violet ’s just told me everything . Who ’s just been chosen as school champion , then ? ”
92800	92803	92805	92805	Harry	447	“ Balderdash , ”
92808	92815	92817	92819	the pale witch	2469	“ It most certainly is n’t ! ”
92822	92834	92836	92838	the Fat Lady	5972	“ No , no , Vi , it ’s the password , ”
92915	92925	92927	92927	Fred	192	“ You should ’ve told us you ’d entered ! ”
92938	92951	92953	92953	George	193	“ How did you do it without getting a beard ? Brilliant ! ”
92955	92960	92961	92961	Harry	447	“ I did n’t , ”
92964	92971	92961	92961	Harry	447	“ I do n’t know how — ”
92981	92997	92973	92973	Angelina	424	“ Oh if it could n’t be me , at least it ’s a Gryffindor — ”
92998	93015	93017	93018	Katie Bell	436	“ You ’ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch match , Harry ! ”
93026	93039	93017	93018	Katie Bell	436	“ We ’ve got food , Harry , come and have some — ”
93040	93053	93060	93060	he	447	“ I ’m not hungry , I had enough at the feast — ”
93191	93196	93197	93197	he	447	“ I did n’t , ”
93205	93214	93197	93197	he	447	“ I do n’t know how it happened . ”
93234	93239	93240	93240	he	447	“ I ’m tired ! ”
93250	93263	93240	93240	he	447	“ No , seriously , George — I ’m going to bed — ”
93373	93379	93380	93380	Harry	447	“ Where ’ve you been ? ”

93481	93488	93490	93490	Harry	447	“ What d’you mean , congratulations ? ”
93515	93527	93529	93529	Ron	188	“ Well ... no one else got across the Age Line , ”
93531	93547	93529	93529	Ron	188	“ Not even Fred and George . What did you use — the Invisibility Cloak ? ”
93548	93561	93563	93563	Harry	447	“ The Invisibility Cloak would n’t have got me over that line , ”
93566	93570	93572	93572	Ron	188	“ Oh right , ”
93574	93610	93572	93572	Ron	188	“ I thought you might ’ve told me if it was the Cloak ... because it would ’ve covered both of us , would n’t it ? But you found another way , did you ? ”
93611	93614	93616	93616	Harry	447	“ Listen , ”
93618	93636	93616	93616	Harry	447	“ I did n’t put my name in that goblet . Someone else must ’ve done it . ”
93642	93650	93637	93637	Ron	188	“ What would they do that for ? ”
93651	93655	93657	93657	Harry	447	“ I dunno , ”
93669	93674	93659	93659	He	447	“ To kill me . ”
93692	93707	93708	93708	he	447	“ It ’s okay , you know , you can tell me the truth , ”
93711	93794	93708	93708	he	447	“ If you do n’t want everyone else to know , fine , but I do n’t know why you ’re bothering to lie , you did n’t get into trouble for it , did you ? That friend of the Fat Lady ’s , that Violet , she ’s already told us all Dumbledore ’s letting you enter . A thousand Galleons prize money , eh ? And you do n’t have to do end - of - year tests either ... ”
93795	93806	93808	93808	Harry	447	“ I did n’t put my name in that goblet ! ”
93815	93820	93822	93822	Ron	188	“ Yeah , okay , ”
93833	93863	93822	93822	Ron	188	“ Only you said this morning you ’d have done it last night , and no one would ’ve seen you ... I ’m not stupid , you know . ”
93864	93875	93876	93876	Harry	447	“ You ’re doing a really good impression of it , ”
93879	93882	93884	93884	Ron	188	“ Yeah ? ”
93904	93932	93933	93933	He	188	“ You want to get to bed , Harry . I expect you ’ll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo - call or something . ”
94175	94178	94179	94179	she	178	“ Hello , ”
94197	94210	94179	94179	she	178	“ I brought you this ... Want to go for a walk ? ”
94211	94215	94217	94217	Harry	447	“ Good idea , ”
94307	94320	94321	94321	she	178	“ Well , of course I knew you had n’t entered yourself , ”
94339	94397	94321	94321	she	178	“ The look on your face when Dumbledore read out your name ! But the question is , who did put it in ? Because Moody ’s right , Harry ... I do n’t think any student could have done it ... they ’d never be able to fool the goblet , or get over Dumbledore ’s — ”
94398	94404	94405	94405	Harry	447	“ Have you seen Ron ? ”
94411	94421	94422	94422	she	178	“ Erm ... yes ... he was at breakfast , ”
94425	94434	94422	94422	she	178	“ Does he still think I entered myself ? ”
94435	94449	94451	94451	Hermione	178	“ Well ... no , I do n’t think so ... not really , ”
94454	94467	94451	94451	Hermione	178	“ What ’s that supposed to mean , ‘ not really ’ ? ”
94468	94477	94478	94478	Hermione	178	“ Oh Harry , is n’t it obvious ? ”
94482	94487	94478	94478	Hermione	178	“ He ’s jealous ! ”
94488	94491	94492	94492	Harry	447	“ Jealous ? ”
94496	94519	94492	94492	Harry	447	“ Jealous of what ? He wants to make a prat of himself in front of the whole school , does he ? ”
94520	94523	94525	94525	Hermione	178	“ Look , ”
94528	94552	94553	94553	she	178	“ it ’s always you who gets all the attention , you know it is . I know it ’s not your fault , ”
94564	94642	94560	94560	his	447	“ I know you do n’t ask for it ... but — well — you know , Ron ’s got all those brothers to compete against at home , and you ’re his best friend , and you ’re really famous — he ’s always shunted to one side whenever people see you , and he puts up with it , and he never mentions it , but I suppose this is just one time too many ... ”
94643	94646	94648	94648	Harry	447	“ Great , ”
94651	94686	94648	94648	Harry	447	“ Really great . Tell him from me I ’ll swap any time he wants . Tell him from me he ’s welcome to it ... People gawping at my forehead everywhere I go ... ”
94687	94695	94696	94696	Hermione	178	“ I ’m not telling him anything , ”
94700	94715	94696	94696	Hermione	178	“ Tell him yourself . It ’s the only way to sort this out . ”
94716	94731	94732	94732	Harry	447	“ I ’m not running around after him trying to make him grow up ! ”
94749	94768	94732	94732	Harry	447	“ Maybe he ’ll believe I ’m not enjoying myself once I ’ve got my neck broken or — ”
94769	94775	94777	94777	Hermione	178	“ That ’s not funny , ”
94780	94788	94789	94789	She	178	“ That ’s not funny at all . ”
94794	94827	94789	94789	She	178	“ Harry , I ’ve been thinking — you know what we ’ve got to do , do n’t you ? Straight away , the moment we get back to the castle ? ”
94828	94839	94732	94732	Harry	447	“ Yeah , give Ron a good kick up the — ”
94840	94895	94732	94732	Harry	447	“ Write to Sirius . You ’ve got to tell him what ’s happened . He asked you to keep him posted on everything that ’s going on at Hogwarts ... It ’s almost as if he expected something like this to happen . I brought some parchment and a quill out with me — ”
94896	94901	94903	94903	Harry	447	“ Come off it , ”
94923	94958	94732	94732	Harry	447	“ He came back to the country just because my scar twinged . He ’ll probably come bursting right into the castle if I tell him someone ’s entered me in the Triwizard Tournament — ”
94959	94968	94970	94970	Hermione	178	“ He ’d want you to tell him , ”
94973	94982	94970	94970	Hermione	178	“ He ’s going to find out anyway — ”
94983	94986	94732	94732	Harry	447	“ How ? ”
94987	94999	95001	95001	Hermione	178	“ Harry , this is n’t going to be kept quiet , ”
95006	95066	95001	95001	Hermione	178	“ This tournament ’s famous , and you ’re famous . I ’ll be really surprised if there is n’t anything in the Daily Prophet about you competing ... You ’re already in half the books about You - Know - Who , you know ... and Sirius would rather hear it from you , I know he would . ”
95067	95078	95080	95080	Harry	447	“ Okay , okay , I ’ll write to him , ”
95127	95136	95137	95137	Harry	447	“ Whose owl am I going to use ? ”
95145	95155	95137	95137	Harry	447	“ He told me not to use Hedwig again . ”
95156	95164	95207	95207	Hermione	178	“ Ask Ron if you can borrow — ”
95165	95174	95175	95175	Harry	447	“ I ’m not asking Ron for anything , ”
95179	95196	95198	95198	Hermione	178	“ Well , borrow one of the school owls , then , anyone can use them , ”
95399	95402	95403	95403	he	447	“ Finished , ”
95434	95441	95442	95442	Harry	447	“ I ca n’t use you , ”
95453	95463	95442	95442	Harry	447	“ I ’ve got to use one of these ... ”
95537	95544	95546	95546	Harry	447	“ First Ron , then you , ”
95549	95556	95546	95546	Harry	447	“ This is n’t my fault . ”
95901	95913	95914	95914	he	282	“ Ah , look , boys , it ’s the champion , ”
95929	95982	95914	95914	he	282	“ Got your autograph books ? Better get a signature now , because I doubt he ’s going to be around much longer ... Half the Triwizard champions have died ... how long d’you reckon you ’re going to last , Potter ? Ten minutes into the first task ’s my bet . ”
96089	96097	96098	96098	he	282	“ Take this thing for a walk ? ”
96110	96134	96098	96098	he	282	“ And where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash ? Around the sting , the blasting end , or the sucker ? ”
96135	96141	96143	96143	Hagrid	198	“ Roun ’ the middle , ”
96147	96185	96143	96143	Hagrid	198	“ Er — yeh might want ter put on yer dragon - hide gloves , jus ’ as an extra precaution , like . Harry — you come here an ’ help me with this big one ... ”

96283	96294	96296	96296	Harry	447	“ You believe I did n’t do it , then ? ”
96312	96318	96319	96319	Hagrid	198	“ ’ Course I do , ”
96322	96346	96319	96319	Hagrid	198	“ Yeh say it wasn ’ you , an ’ I believe yeh — an ’ Dumbledore believes yer , an ’ all . ”
96347	96356	96358	96358	Harry	447	“ Wish I knew who did do it , ”
96449	96461	96462	96462	Hagrid	198	“ Look like they ’re havin’ fun , don ’ they ? ”
96531	96541	96542	96542	Hagrid	198	“ Ah , I don ’ know , Harry , ”

97075	97081	97083	97083	Harry	447	“ Wonder why that was , ”
97118	97135	97113	97116	Blast - Ended Skrewt	441	“ Still — never mind , eh ? Double Potions to look forward to this afternoon ... ”
97217	97226	97228	97228	her	178	“ ignore them , ignore them , ignore them ”
97317	97323	97325	97325	Malfoy	282	“ Like them , Potter ? ”

97480	97513	97471	97471	Malfoy	282	“ I ’ve got loads . But do n’t touch my hand , now . I ’ve just washed it , you see ; do n’t want a Mudblood sliming it up . ”
97566	97569	97570	97570	Hermione	178	“ Harry ! ”
97574	97582	97589	97589	his	282	“ Go on , then , Potter , ”
97593	97614	97589	97589	his	282	“ Moody ’s not here to look after you now — do it , if you ’ve got the guts — ”
97639	97642	97643	97643	Harry	447	“ Furnunculus ! ”

97808	97817	97825	97825	Snape	357	“ And what is all this noise about ? ”
97848	97851	97837	97837	Snape	357	“ Explain . ”
97852	97859	97837	97837	Snape	357	“ Potter attacked me , sir — ”
97860	97870	97871	97871	Harry	447	“ We attacked each other at the same time ! ”

98108	98137	98100	98100	he	357	“ Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley . Now get inside , or it ’ll be a week ’s worth of detentions . ”
98301	98304	98306	98306	Snape	357	“ Antidotes ! ”
98321	98353	98306	98306	Snape	357	“ You should all have prepared your recipes now . I want you to brew them carefully , and then , we will be selecting someone on whom to test one ... ”
98445	98448	98450	98450	Snape	357	“ Yes ? ”
98453	98467	98450	98450	Snape	357	“ Please , sir , I ’m supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs . ”
98485	98495	98497	98497	Snape	357	“ Potter has another hour of Potions to complete , ”

98779	98782	98784	98784	Harry	447	“ Great , ”
98787	98796	98784	98784	Harry	447	“ Exactly what I need . More publicity . ”

99055	99059	99060	99060	Harry	447	“ Wand weighing ? ”
99064	99094	99096	99096	Bagman	221	“ We have to check that your wands are fully functional , no problems , you know , as they ’re your most important tools in the tasks ahead , ”
99098	99124	99125	99125	he	221	“ The expert ’s upstairs now with Dumbledore . And then there ’s going to be a little photo shoot . This is Rita Skeeter , ”
99136	99151	99125	99125	he	221	“ She ’s doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily Prophet ... ”
99152	99160	99165	99165	her	322	“ Maybe not that small , Ludo , ”
99214	99230	99231	99231	she	322	“ I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start ? ”
99243	99258	99231	99231	she	322	“ The youngest champion , you know ... to add a bit of color ? ”
99259	99262	99264	99264	Bagman	221	“ Certainly ! ”
99266	99276	99264	99264	Bagman	221	“ That is — if Harry has no objection ? ”
99277	99280	99282	99282	Harry	447	“ Er — ”
99284	99287	99289	99290	Rita Skeeter	322	“ Lovely , ”
99329	99343	99344	99344	she	322	“ We do n’t want to be in there with all that noise , ”

99694	99709	99687	99687	she	322	“ So , Harry ... what made you decide to enter the Triwizard Tournament ? ”
99710	99713	99715	99715	Harry	447	“ Er — ”
99774	99781	99783	99784	Rita Skeeter	322	“ Ignore the quill , Harry , ”
99796	99810	99789	99789	Harry	447	“ Now — why did you decide to enter the tournament , Harry ? ”
99811	99816	99818	99818	Harry	447	“ I did n’t , ”
99820	99843	99818	99818	Harry	447	“ I do n’t know how my name got into the Goblet of Fire . I did n’t put it in there . ”
99852	99895	99844	99845	Rita Skeeter	322	“ Come now , Harry , there ’s no need to be scared of getting into trouble . We all know you should n’t really have entered at all . But do n’t worry about that . Our readers love a rebel . ”
99896	99903	99904	99904	Harry	447	“ But I did n’t enter , ”
99907	99914	99904	99904	Harry	447	“ I do n’t know who — ”
99915	99925	99927	99928	Rita Skeeter	322	“ How do you feel about the tasks ahead ? ”
99930	99935	99927	99928	Rita Skeeter	322	“ Excited ? Nervous ? ”
99936	99950	99952	99952	Harry	447	“ I have n’t really thought ... yeah , nervous , I suppose , ”
99962	99974	99976	99977	Rita Skeeter	322	“ Champions have died in the past , have n’t they ? ”
99980	99989	99976	99977	Rita Skeeter	322	“ Have you thought about that at all ? ”
99990	100006	100008	100008	Harry	447	“ Well ... they say it ’s going to be a lot safer this year , ”
100028	100045	100047	100048	Rita Skeeter	322	“ Of course , you ’ve looked death in the face before , have n’t you ? ”
100054	100064	100047	100048	Rita Skeeter	322	“ How would you say that ’s affected you ? ”
100065	100068	100070	100070	Harry	447	“ Er , ”
100075	100116	100070	100070	Harry	447	“ Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove yourself ? To live up to your name ? Do you think that perhaps you were tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because — ”
100117	100123	100125	100125	Harry	447	“ I did n’t enter , ”
100132	100141	100143	100144	Rita Skeeter	322	“ Can you remember your parents at all ? ”
100150	100153	100155	100155	Harry	447	“ No , ”
100157	100182	100155	100155	Harry	447	“ How do you think they ’d feel if they knew you were competing in the Triwizard Tournament ? Proud ? Worried ? Angry ? ”
100252	100262	100264	100264	Harry	447	“ I have NOT got tears in my eyes ! ”
100312	100315	100317	100318	Rita Skeeter	322	“ Dumbledore ! ”
100364	100369	100370	100370	she	322	“ How are you ? ”
100388	100407	100370	100370	she	322	“ I hope you saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards ’ Conference ? ”
100408	100412	100414	100414	Dumbledore	187	“ Enchantingly nasty , ”
100420	100433	100416	100416	his	187	“ I particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat . ”
100442	100471	100434	100435	Rita Skeeter	322	“ I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old - fashioned , Dumbledore , and that many wizards in the street — ”
100472	100487	100489	100489	Dumbledore	187	“ I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness , Rita , ”
100499	100541	100489	100489	Dumbledore	187	“ but I ’m afraid we will have to discuss the matter later . The Weighing of the Wands is about to start , and it can not take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard . ”
100657	100664	100669	100669	his	187	“ May I introduce Mr. Ollivander ? ”
100682	100701	100702	100702	Harry	447	“ He will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament . ”
100754	100766	100768	100769	Mr. Ollivander	445	“ Mademoiselle Delacour , could we have you first , please ? ”
100796	100799	100800	100800	he	445	“ Hmmm ... ”
100838	100841	100842	100842	he	445	“ Yes , ”
100846	100863	100842	100842	he	445	“ nine and a half inches ... inflexible ... rosewood ... and containing ... dear me ... ”
100864	100876	100878	100878	Fleur	428	“ An ’ air from ze ’ ead of a veela , ”
100880	100887	100878	100878	Fleur	428	“ One of my grandmuzzer ’s . ”
100916	100919	100921	100922	Mr. Ollivander	445	“ Yes , ”
100924	100960	100921	100922	Mr. Ollivander	445	“ yes , I ’ve never used veela hair myself , of course . I find it makes for rather temperamental wands ... however , to each his own , and if this suits you ... ”
100981	100984	100978	100978	he	445	“ Orchideous ! ”
100997	101011	101013	101014	Mr. Ollivander	445	“ Very well , very well , it ’s in fine working order , ”
101029	101036	101037	101037	Fleur	428	“ Mr. Diggory , you next . ”
101052	101067	101069	101070	Mr. Ollivander	445	“ Ah , now , this is one of mine , is n’t it ? ”
101084	101146	101078	101078	Cedric	238	“ Yes , I remember it well . Containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn ... must have been seventeen hands ; nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked his tail . Twelve and a quarter inches ... ash ... pleasantly springy . It ’s in fine condition ... You treat it regularly ? ”
101147	101153	101155	101155	Cedric	238	“ Polished it last night , ”
101245	101253	101238	101238	himself	445	“ Mr. Krum , if you please . ”
101292	101295	101297	101298	Mr. Ollivander	445	“ Hmm , ”
101300	101328	101329	101329	He	445	“ this is a Gregorovitch creation , unless I ’m much mistaken ? A fine wandmaker , though the styling is never quite what I ... however ... ”
101347	101355	101356	101356	he	445	“ Yes ... hornbeam and dragon heartstring ? ”
101364	101383	101356	101356	he	445	“ Rather thicker than one usually sees ... quite rigid ... ten and a quarter inches ... Avis ! ”
101418	101421	101423	101424	Mr. Ollivander	445	“ Good , ”
101432	101439	101423	101424	Mr. Ollivander	445	“ Which leaves ... Mr. Potter . ”
101459	101464	101469	101469	his	445	“ Aaaah , yes , ”
101475	101487	101469	101469	his	445	“ Yes , yes , yes . How well I remember . ”
101607	101610	101611	101611	he	445	“ Curious , ”
101615	101618	101611	101611	he	445	“ curious , ”
101790	101795	101797	101797	Dumbledore	187	“ Thank you all , ”
101807	101837	101797	101797	Dumbledore	187	“ You may go back to your lessons now — or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner , as they are about to end — ”
101868	101875	101877	101877	Bagman	221	“ Photos , Dumbledore , photos ! ”
101880	101894	101877	101877	Bagman	221	“ All the judges and champions , what do you think , Rita ? ”
101895	101906	101908	101909	Rita Skeeter	322	“ Er — yes , let ’s do those first , ”
101918	101926	101908	101909	Rita Skeeter	322	“ And then perhaps some individual shots . ”
102128	102135	102137	102137	Ron	188	“ You ’ve had an owl , ”
102163	102168	102170	102170	Harry	447	“ Oh — right , ”
102172	102188	102190	102190	Ron	188	“ And we ’ve got to do our detentions tomorrow night , Snape ’s dungeon , ”
102962	102965	102972	102972	She	322	“ er ’s ”
103065	103080	103047	103047	people	5169	“ Want a hanky , Potter , in case you start crying in Transfiguration ? ”
103081	103111	103047	103047	people	5169	“ Since when have you been one of the top students in the school , Potter ? Or is this a school you and Longbottom have set up together ? ”
103112	103117	103047	103047	people	5169	“ Hey — Harry ! ”
103118	103125	103128	103128	himself	447	“ Yeah , that ’s right ! ”
103144	103169	103131	103131	he	447	“ I ’ve just been crying my eyes out over my dead mum , and I ’m just off to do a bit more ... ”
103170	103182	103185	103185	Cho	258	“ No — it was just — you dropped your quill . ”
103196	103203	103204	103204	he	447	“ Oh — right — sorry , ”
103212	103220	103221	103221	she	2653	“ Er ... good luck on Tuesday , ”
103224	103232	103221	103221	she	2653	“ I really hope you do well . ”
103280	103286	103253	103253	she	178	“ Stunningly pretty ? Her ? ”
103311	103321	103294	103294	she	443	“ What was she judging against — a chipmunk ? ”
103322	103326	103327	103327	Hermione	178	“ Ignore it , ”
103355	103362	103349	103349	she	178	“ Just ignore it , Harry . ”
103505	103512	103513	103513	Harry	447	“ I did n’t start this , ”
103517	103523	103513	103513	Harry	447	“ It ’s his problem . ”
103524	103529	103530	103530	Hermione	178	“ You miss him ! ”
103534	103542	103530	103530	Hermione	178	“ And I know he misses you — ”
103543	103547	103549	103549	Harry	447	“ Miss him ? ”
103551	103558	103549	103549	Harry	447	“ I do n’t miss him ... ”
103724	103733	103734	103734	she	178	“ He ’s not even good - looking ! ”
103745	103773	103734	103734	she	178	“ They only like him because he ’s famous ! They would n’t look twice at him if he could n’t do that Wonky - Faint thing — ”
103774	103778	103780	103780	Harry	447	“ Wronski Feint , ”
103952	103959	103960	103960	he	447	“ What about Ron , though ? ”
103963	103973	103960	103960	he	447	“ Do n’t you want to go with him ? ”
103974	103979	103980	103980	Hermione	178	“ Oh ... well ... ”
103985	103999	103980	103980	Hermione	178	“ I thought we might meet up with him in the Three Broomsticks ... ”
104000	104003	104005	104005	Harry	447	“ No , ”
104008	104017	104005	104005	Harry	447	“ Oh Harry , this is so stupid — ”
104018	104038	103980	103980	Hermione	178	“ I ’ll come , but I ’m not meeting Ron , and I ’m wearing my Invisibility Cloak . ”
104039	104045	104046	104046	Hermione	178	“ Oh all right then ... ”
104049	104072	104046	104046	Hermione	178	“ but I hate talking to you in that Cloak , I never know if I ’m looking at you or not . ”
104148	104156	104158	104158	Hermione	178	“ People keep looking at me now , ”
104176	104185	104158	104158	Hermione	178	“ They think I ’m talking to myself . ”
104186	104196	104158	104158	Hermione	178	“ Do n’t move your lips so much then . ”
104197	104220	104158	104158	Hermione	178	“ Come on , please just take off your Cloak for a bit , no one ’s going to bother you here . ”
104221	104225	104227	104227	Harry	447	“ Oh yeah ? ”
104229	104234	104227	104227	Harry	447	“ Look behind you . ”
104294	104313	104291	104291	Harry	447	“ She ’s staying in the village . I bet she ’s coming to watch the first task . ”
104363	104368	104370	104370	Hermione	178	“ She ’s gone , ”
104383	104417	104418	104418	she	178	“ Why do n’t we go and have a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks , it ’s a bit cold , is n’t it ? You do n’t have to talk to Ron ! ”
104606	104620	104621	104621	she	178	“ I look like such an idiot , sitting here on my own , ”
104624	104632	104621	104621	she	178	“ Lucky I brought something to do . ”
104695	104713	104714	104714	Hermione	178	“ You know , maybe I should try and get some of the villagers involved in S.P.E.W. , ”
104723	104728	104730	104730	Harry	447	“ Yeah , right , ”
104742	104757	104732	104732	He	447	“ Hermione , when are you going to give up on this spew stuff ? ”
104758	104770	104771	104771	she	178	“ When house - elves have decent wages and working conditions ! ”
104775	104802	104771	104771	she	178	“ You know , I ’m starting to think it ’s time for more direct action . I wonder how you get into the school kitchens ? ”
104803	104812	104814	104814	Harry	447	“ No idea , ask Fred and George , ”
105153	105160	105162	105162	Hermione	178	“ Look , it ’s Hagrid ! ”
105417	105423	105425	105425	Hagrid	198	“ All right , Hermione ? ”
105428	105431	105433	105433	Hermione	178	“ Hello , ”

105508	105518	105519	105519	Moody	381	“ Yeah , it can see through Invisibility Cloaks , ”
105523	105538	105519	105519	Moody	381	“ And it ’s come in useful at times , I can tell you . ”
105594	105610	105565	105565	Hagrid	198	“ Harry , meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin . Wear that Cloak . ”

105636	105648	105649	105649	Harry	447	“ Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight ? ”
105655	105659	105661	105661	Hermione	178	“ Does he ? ”
105666	105686	105661	105661	Hermione	178	“ I wonder what he ’s up to ? I do n’t know whether you should go , Harry ... ”
105694	105703	105687	105687	She	178	“ It might make you late for Sirius . ”
105939	105942	105932	105932	He	447	“ Thanks ! ”
105999	106005	106006	106006	Hagrid	198	“ You there , Harry ? ”

106172	106185	106170	106170	Hagrid	198	“ We won ’ take Fang , he won ’ like it ... ”
106186	106211	106218	106218	he	198	“ Listen , Hagrid , I ca n’t stay long ... I ’ve got to be back up at the castle by one o’clock — ”
106253	106259	106244	106244	Hagrid	198	“ Hagrid , what — ? ”

107214	107267	107206	107206	he	210	“ They should be okay now — we put them out with a Sleeping Draught on the way here , thought it might be better for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet — but , like you saw , they were n’t happy , not happy at all — ”
107268	107277	107279	107279	Hagrid	198	“ What breeds you got here , Charlie ? ”
107318	107325	107327	107327	Charlie	210	“ This is a Hungarian Horntail , ”
107329	107364	107327	107327	Charlie	210	“ There ’s a Common Welsh Green over there , the smaller one — a Swedish Short - Snout , that blue - gray — and a Chinese Fireball , that ’s the red . ”
107387	107399	107400	107400	Charlie	210	“ I did n’t know you were bringing her , Hagrid , ”
107405	107429	107400	107400	Charlie	210	“ The champions are n’t supposed to know what ’s coming — she ’s bound to tell her student , is n’t she ? ”
107430	107441	107443	107443	Hagrid	198	“ Jus ’ thought she ’d like ter see ’em , ”
107454	107461	107463	107463	Charlie	210	“ Really romantic date , Hagrid , ”
107469	107472	107474	107474	Hagrid	198	“ Four ... ”
107476	107501	107474	107474	Hagrid	198	“ so it ’s one fer each o ’ the champions , is it ? What ’ve they got ta do — fight ’em ? ”
107502	107511	107513	107513	Charlie	210	“ Just get past them , I think , ”
107515	107575	107576	107576	Charlie	210	“ We ’ll be on hand if it gets nasty , Extinguishing Spells at the ready . They wanted nesting mothers , I do n’t know why ... but I tell you this , I do n’t envy the one who gets the Horntail . Vicious thing . Its back end ’s as dangerous as its front , look . ”
107648	107657	107659	107659	Charlie	210	“ I ’ve got them counted , Hagrid , ”
107666	107671	107663	107663	he	210	“ How ’s Harry ? ”
107672	107675	107677	107677	Hagrid	198	“ Fine , ”
107687	107701	107703	107703	Charlie	210	“ Just hope he ’s still fine after he ’s faced this lot , ”
107714	107740	107703	107703	Charlie	210	“ I did n’t dare tell Mum what he ’s got to do for the first task ; she ’s already having kittens about him ... ”
107749	107814	107741	107741	Charlie	210	“ ‘ How could they let him enter that tournament , he ’s much too young ! I thought they were all safe , I thought there was going to be an age limit ! ’ She was in floods after that Daily Prophet article about him . ‘ He still cries about his parents ! Oh bless him , I never knew ! ’ ”
108059	108066	108067	108067	Harry	447	“ Ouch ! Who ’s there ? ”
108103	108108	108110	108110	Karkaroff	417	“ Who ’s there ? ”
108376	108379	108380	108380	he	447	“ Balderdash ! ”
108400	108406	108407	108407	she	2780	“ If you say so , ”
108607	108615	108591	108591	he	447	“ Sirius — how ’re you doing ? ”
108696	108705	108707	108707	Sirius	195	“ Never mind me , how are you ? ”
108710	108714	108707	108707	Sirius	195	“ I ’m — ”
108723	108725	108719	108719	Harry	447	“ fine ”
108806	108838	108839	108839	he	447	“ . . . and now Hagrid ’s just shown me what ’s coming in the first task , and it ’s dragons , Sirius , and I ’m a goner , ”
108889	108946	108886	108886	he	195	“ Dragons we can deal with , Harry , but we ’ll get to that in a minute — I have n’t got long here ... I ’ve broken into a Wizarding house to use the fire , but they could be back at any time . There are things I need to warn you about . ”
108947	108950	108952	108952	Harry	447	“ What ? ”
108973	108976	108978	108978	Sirius	195	“ Karkaroff , ”
108980	109000	108978	108978	Sirius	195	“ Harry , he was a Death Eater . You know what Death Eaters are , do n’t you ? ”
109001	109008	108886	108886	he	195	“ Yes — he — what ? ”
109009	109062	108978	108978	Sirius	195	“ He was caught , he was in Azkaban with me , but he got released . I ’d bet everything that ’s why Dumbledore wanted an Auror at Hogwarts this year — to keep an eye on him . Moody caught Karkaroff . Put him into Azkaban in the first place . ”
109063	109068	109069	109069	Harry	447	“ Karkaroff got released ? ”
109088	109095	109069	109069	Harry	447	“ Why did they release him ? ”
109096	109107	109109	109109	Sirius	195	“ He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic , ”
109112	109196	109109	109109	Sirius	195	“ He said he ’d seen the error of his ways , and then he named names ... he put a load of other people into Azkaban in his place ... He ’s not very popular in there , I can tell you . And since he got out , from what I can tell , he ’s been teaching the Dark Arts to every student who passes through that school of his . So watch out for the Durmstrang champion as well . ”
109197	109200	109202	109202	Harry	447	“ Okay , ”
109205	109245	109202	109202	Harry	447	“ But ... are you saying Karkaroff put my name in the goblet ? Because if he did , he ’s a really good actor . He seemed furious about it . He wanted to stop me from competing . ”
109246	109255	109257	109257	Sirius	195	“ We know he ’s a good actor , ”
109259	109291	109257	109257	Sirius	195	“ because he convinced the Ministry of Magic to set him free , did n’t he ? Now , I ’ve been keeping an eye on the Daily Prophet , Harry — ”
109292	109302	109304	109304	Harry	447	“ — you and the rest of the world , ”
109307	109346	109347	109347	Sirius	195	“ — and reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman ’s article last month , Moody was attacked the night before he started at Hogwarts . Yes , I know she says it was another false alarm , ”
109357	109442	109347	109347	Sirius	195	“ but I do n’t think so , somehow . I think someone tried to stop him from getting to Hogwarts . I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around . And no one ’s going to look into it too closely ; Mad - Eye ’s heard intruders a bit too often . But that does n’t mean he ca n’t still spot the real thing . Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had . ”
109443	109451	109453	109453	Harry	447	“ So ... what are you saying ? ”
109456	109468	109453	109453	Harry	447	“ Karkaroff ’s trying to kill me ? But — why ? ”
109472	109482	109483	109483	he	195	“ I ’ve been hearing some very strange things , ”
109487	109539	109483	109483	he	195	“ The Death Eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately . They showed themselves at the Quidditch World Cup , did n’t they ? Someone set off the Dark Mark ... and then — did you hear about that Ministry of Magic witch who ’s gone missing ? ”
109540	109544	109546	109546	Harry	447	“ Bertha Jorkins ? ”
109548	109584	109546	109546	Harry	447	“ Exactly ... she disappeared in Albania , and that ’s definitely where Voldemort was rumored to be last ... and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up , would n’t she ? ”
109585	109606	109608	109608	Harry	447	“ Yeah , but ... it ’s not very likely she ’d have walked straight into Voldemort , is it ? ”
109610	109618	109620	109620	Sirius	195	“ Listen , I knew Bertha Jorkins , ”
109623	109681	109620	109620	Sirius	195	“ She was at Hogwarts when I was , a few years above your dad and me . And she was an idiot . Very nosy , but no brains , none at all . It ’s not a good combination , Harry . I ’d say she ’d be very easy to lure into a trap . ”
109682	109695	109697	109697	Harry	447	“ So ... so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament ? ”
109699	109716	109697	109697	Harry	447	“ Is that what you mean ? You think Karkaroff might be here on his orders ? ”
109717	109723	109725	109725	Sirius	195	“ I do n’t know , ”
109728	109799	109725	109725	Sirius	195	“ I just do n’t know ... Karkaroff does n’t strike me as the type who ’d go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was powerful enough to protect him . But whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a reason , and I ca n’t help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to attack you and make it look like an accident . ”
109800	109813	109815	109815	Harry	447	“ Looks like a really good plan from where I ’m standing , ”
109820	109836	109815	109815	Harry	447	“ They ’ll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff . ”
109837	109843	109845	109845	Sirius	195	“ Right — these dragons , ”
109852	109901	109845	109845	Sirius	195	“ There ’s a way , Harry . Do n’t be tempted to try a Stunning Spell — dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner , you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon — ”
109902	109912	109914	109914	Harry	447	“ Yeah , I know , I just saw , ”
109916	109924	109926	109926	Sirius	195	“ But you can do it alone , ”
109928	109945	109926	109926	Sirius	195	“ There is a way , and a simple spell ’s all you need . Just — ”
109978	109981	109982	109982	he	447	“ Go ! ”
109987	109995	109982	109982	he	447	“ Go ! There ’s someone coming ! ”
110122	110129	110130	110130	he	188	“ Who were you talking to ? ”
110133	110143	110144	110144	Harry	447	“ What ’s that got to do with you ? ”
110147	110160	110144	110144	Harry	447	“ What are you doing down here at this time of night ? ”
110161	110168	110169	110169	Ron	188	“ I just wondered where you — ”
110175	110185	110169	110169	Ron	188	“ Nothing . I ’m going back to bed . ”
110186	110198	110199	110199	Harry	447	“ Just thought you ’d come nosing around , did you ? ”
110255	110260	110262	110262	Ron	188	“ Sorry about that , ”
110270	110297	110262	110262	Ron	188	“ Should ’ve realized you did n’t want to be disturbed . I ’ll let you get on with practicing for your next interview in peace . ”
110334	110339	110340	110340	Harry	447	“ There you go , ”
110343	110375	110340	110340	Harry	447	“ Something for you to wear on Tuesday . You might even have a scar now , if you ’re lucky ... That ’s what you want , is n’t it ? ”
110596	110609	110610	110610	she	178	“ Let ’s just try and keep you alive until Tuesday evening , ”
110614	110623	110610	110610	she	178	“ and then we can worry about Karkaroff . ”
110688	110720	110678	110678	them	2800	“ ‘ Talon - clipping by charms ... treating scale - rot ... ’ This is no good , this is for nutters like Hagrid who want to keep them healthy ... ”
110721	110762	110786	110786	He	447	“ ‘ Dragons are extremely difficult to slay , owing to the ancient magic that imbues their thick hides , which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate ... ’ But Sirius said a simple one would do it ... ”
110763	110773	110775	110775	Harry	447	“ Let ’s try some simple spellbooks , then , ”
110817	110950	110810	110810	Hermione	178	“ Well , there are Switching Spells ... but what ’s the point of Switching it ? Unless you swapped its fangs for wine - gums or something that would make it less dangerous ... The trouble is , like that book said , not much is going to get through a dragon ’s hide ... I ’d say Transfigure it , but something that big , you really have n’t got a hope , I doubt even Professor McGonagall ... unless you ’re supposed to put the spell on yourself ? Maybe to give yourself extra powers ? But they ’re not simple spells , I mean , we have n’t done any of those in class , I only know about them because I ’ve been doing O.W.L. practice papers ... ”
110951	110954	110955	110955	Harry	447	“ Hermione , ”
110962	110979	110955	110955	Harry	447	“ will you shut up for a bit , please ? I ’m trying to concentrate . ”
111064	111083	111085	111085	Hermione	178	“ Oh no , he ’s back again , why ca n’t he read on his stupid ship ? ”
111117	111144	111106	111106	himself	225	“ Come on , Harry , we ’ll go back to the common room ... his fan club’ll be here in a moment , twittering away ... ”
111363	111374	111375	111375	Harry	447	“ Hermione , I ’ll see you in the greenhouses , ”
111390	111400	111375	111375	Harry	447	“ Go on , I ’ll catch you up . ”
111401	111416	111380	111380	his	447	“ Harry , you ’ll be late , the bell ’s about to ring — ”
111417	111426	111375	111375	Harry	447	“ I ’ll catch you up , okay ? ”
111531	111534	111520	111520	he	238	“ Diffindo ! ”
111560	111565	111567	111567	Cedric	238	“ Do n’t bother , ”
111581	111591	111567	111567	Cedric	238	“ Tell Flitwick I ’m coming , go on ... ”
111639	111642	111644	111644	Cedric	238	“ Hi , ”
111663	111675	111644	111644	Cedric	238	“ My bag just split ... brand - new and all ... ”
111676	111679	111681	111681	Harry	447	“ Cedric , ”
111683	111690	111681	111681	Harry	447	“ the first task is dragons . ”
111691	111694	111696	111696	Cedric	238	“ What ? ”
111701	111704	111706	111706	Harry	447	“ Dragons , ”
111725	111746	111747	111747	Cedric	238	“ They ’ve got four , one for each of us , and we ’ve got to get past them . ”
111772	111777	111778	111778	Cedric	238	“ Are you sure ? ”
111785	111789	111791	111791	Harry	447	“ Dead sure , ”
111793	111799	111791	111791	Harry	447	“ I ’ve seen them . ”
111800	111815	111825	111825	he	447	“ But how did you find out ? We ’re not supposed to know ... ”
111816	111820	111822	111822	Harry	447	“ Never mind , ”
111838	111866	111867	111867	Cedric	238	“ But I ’m not the only one who knows . Fleur and Krum will know by now — Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the dragons too . ”
111909	111916	111917	111917	he	238	“ Why are you telling me ? ”
111964	111975	111976	111976	he	447	“ It ’s just ... fair , is n’t it ? ”
111981	111998	111976	111976	he	447	“ We all know now ... we ’re on an even footing , are n’t we ? ”
112035	112042	112043	112043	he	332	“ Come with me , Potter , ”
112046	112053	112043	112043	he	332	“ Diggory , off you go . ”
112065	112078	112061	112061	he	447	“ Er — Professor , I ’m supposed to be in Herbology — ”
112079	112092	112095	112095	him	332	“ Never mind that , Potter . In my office , please ... ”
112211	112224	112225	112225	Moody	332	“ That was a very decent thing you just did , Potter , ”
112248	112252	112254	112254	Moody	332	“ Sit down , ”
112462	112471	112473	112473	Moody	332	“ Like my Dark Detectors , do you ? ”
112481	112486	112487	112487	Harry	447	“ What ’s that ? ”
112497	112582	112583	112583	he	332	“ Secrecy Sensor . Vibrates when it detects concealment and lies ... no use here , of course , too much interference — students in every direction lying about why they have n’t done their homework . Been humming ever since I got here . I had to disable my Sneakoscope because it would n’t stop whistling . It ’s extra - sensitive , picks up stuff about a mile around . Of course , it could be picking up more than kid stuff , ”
112589	112597	112583	112583	he	332	“ And what ’s the mirror for ? ”
112598	112638	112639	112639	He	332	“ Oh that ’s my Foe - Glass . See them out there , skulking around ? I ’m not really in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes . That ’s when I open my trunk . ”
112685	112697	112698	112698	Harry	447	“ So ... found out about the dragons , have you ? ”
112732	112738	112740	112740	Moody	332	“ It ’s all right , ”
112754	112769	112740	112740	Moody	332	“ Cheating ’s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been . ”
112770	112776	112778	112778	Harry	447	“ I did n’t cheat , ”
112781	112794	112795	112795	Moody	332	“ It was — a sort of accident that I found out . ”
112798	112870	112795	112795	Moody	332	“ I was n’t accusing you , laddie . I ’ve been telling Dumbledore from the start , he can be as high - minded as he likes , but you can bet old Karkaroff and Maxime wo n’t be . They ’ll have told their champions everything they can . They want to win . They want to beat Dumbledore . They ’d like to prove he ’s only human . ”
112894	112911	112913	112913	Moody	332	“ So ... got any ideas how you ’re going to get past your dragon yet ? ”
112915	112918	112920	112920	Harry	447	“ No , ”
112922	112933	112935	112935	Moody	332	“ Well , I ’m not going to tell you , ”
112938	112971	112935	112935	Moody	332	“ I do n’t show favoritism , me . I ’m just going to give you some good , general advice . And the first bit is — play to your strengths . ”
112972	112979	112981	112981	Harry	447	“ I have n’t got any , ”
112989	112993	112995	112995	Moody	332	“ Excuse me , ”
112997	113019	112995	112995	Moody	332	“ you ’ve got strengths if I say you ’ve got them . Think now . What are you best at ? ”
113039	113042	113043	113043	he	447	“ Quidditch , ”
113047	113055	113043	113043	he	447	“ and a fat lot of help — ”
113056	113061	113063	113063	Moody	332	“ That ’s right , ”
113079	113092	113063	113063	Moody	332	“ You ’re a damn good flier from what I ’ve heard . ”
113093	113098	113099	113099	Harry	447	“ Yeah , but ... ”
113104	113119	113099	113099	Harry	447	“ I ’m not allowed a broom , I ’ve only got my wand — ”
113120	113128	113130	113130	Moody	332	“ My second piece of general advice , ”

Now , I ’m going to have to leave you in a moment , because I ’m commentating . Mr. Diggory , you ’re first , just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle , all right ? Now ... Harry ... could I have a quick word ? Outside ? ”
115270	115275	115277	115277	Harry	447	“ Er ... yes , ”
115318	115331	115315	115315	his	221	“ Feeling all right , Harry ? Anything I can get you ? ”

115726	115736	115683	115683	Bagman	221	“ Clever move — pity it did n’t work ! ”
115769	115774	115775	115775	Bagman	221	“ Very good indeed ! ”
115779	115788	115775	115775	Bagman	221	“ And now the marks from the judges ! ”
115813	115821	115822	115822	Bagman	221	“ One down , three to go ! ”
115830	115838	115822	115822	Bagman	221	“ Miss Delacour , if you please ! ”
115902	115912	115916	115916	Bagman	221	“ Oh I ’m not sure that was wise ! ”
115920	115939	115916	115916	Bagman	221	“ Oh ... nearly ! Careful now ... good lord , I thought she ’d had it then ! ”

116066	116070	116071	116071	Bagman	221	“ Very daring ! ”
116096	116115	116078	116080	the Chinese Fireball	458	“ That ’s some nerve he ’s showing — and — yes , he ’s got the egg ! ”

116647	116650	116651	116651	Harry	447	“ Okay , ”
116655	116663	116664	116664	He	447	“ diversionary tactics ... let ’s go ... ”
116726	116734	116736	116736	Bagman	221	“ Great Scott , he can fly ! ”
116744	116753	116736	116736	Bagman	221	“ Are you watching this , Mr. Krum ? ”
117134	117138	117139	117139	Harry	447	“ Come on , ”
117147	117161	117139	117139	Harry	447	“ come on , come and get me ... up you get now ... ”
117322	117327	117328	117328	Bagman	221	“ Look at that ! ”
117332	117362	117328	117328	Bagman	221	“ Will you look at that ! Our youngest champion is quickest to get his egg ! Well , this is going to shorten the odds on Mr. Potter ! ”
117459	117466	117479	117479	her	343	“ That was excellent , Potter ! ”
117497	117525	117491	117491	she	343	“ You ’ll need to see Madam Pomfrey before the judges give out your score ... Over there , she ’s had to mop up Diggory already ... ”
117526	117533	117535	117535	Hagrid	198	“ Yeh did it , Harry ! ”
117538	117565	117535	117535	Hagrid	198	“ Yeh did it ! An ’ agains ’ the Horntail an ’ all , an ’ yeh know Charlie said that was the wors ’ — ”
117566	117571	117573	117573	Harry	447	“ Thanks , Hagrid , ”
117610	117620	117621	117621	he	381	“ Nice and easy does the trick , Potter , ”
117624	117637	117639	117640	Professor McGonagall	343	“ Right then , Potter , the first aid tent , please ... ”
117668	117671	117672	117672	she	323	“ Dragons ! ”
117733	117775	117776	117776	She	323	“ Last year dementors , this year dragons , what are they going to bring into this school next ? You ’re very lucky ... this is quite shallow ... it ’ll need cleaning before I heal it up , though ... ”
117808	117830	117831	117831	She	323	“ Now , just sit quietly for a minute — sit ! And then you can go and get your score . ”
117847	117856	117840	117840	her	323	“ How does it feel now , Diggory ? ”
117912	117919	117920	117920	Hermione	178	“ Harry , you were brilliant ! ”
117940	117949	117932	117932	she	178	“ You were amazing ! You really were ! ”
117972	117975	117976	117976	he	188	“ Harry , ”
117982	118003	117976	117976	he	188	“ whoever put your name in that goblet — I — I reckon they ’re trying to do you in ! ”
118035	118042	118044	118044	Harry	447	“ Caught on , have you ? ”
118047	118053	118044	118044	Harry	447	“ Took you long enough . ”
118092	118097	118098	118098	he	447	“ It ’s okay , ”
118109	118113	118098	118098	he	447	“ Forget it . ”
118114	118117	118119	118119	Ron	188	“ No , ”
118121	118127	118119	118119	Ron	188	“ I should n’t ’ve — ”
118128	118132	118133	118133	Harry	447	“ Forget it , ”
118152	118160	118161	118161	Harry	447	“ There ’s nothing to cry about ! ”
118167	118174	118175	118175	she	178	“ You two are so stupid ! ”
118217	118221	118223	118223	Ron	188	“ Barking mad , ”
118229	118243	118226	118226	his	188	“ Harry , c’m on , they ’ll be putting up your scores ... ”
118281	118527	118528	118528	Ron	188	“ You were the best , you know , no competition . Cedric did this weird thing where he Transfigured a rock on the ground ... turned it into a dog ... he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him . Well , it was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration , and it sort of worked , because he did get the egg , but he got burned as well — the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have him than the Labrador ; he only just got away . And that Fleur girl tried this sort of charm , I think she was trying to put it into a trance — well , that kind of worked too , it went all sleepy , but then it snored , and this great jet of flame shot out , and her skirt caught fire — she put it out with a bit of water out of her wand . And Krum — you wo n’t believe this , but he did n’t even think of flying ! He was probably the best after you , though . Hit it with some sort of spell right in the eye . Only thing is , it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs — they took marks off for that , he was n’t supposed to do any damage to them . ”
118574	118585	118586	118586	Ron	188	“ It ’s marks out of ten from each one , ”
118633	118637	118639	118639	Ron	188	“ Not bad ! ”
118645	118656	118639	118639	Ron	188	“ I suppose she took marks off for your shoulder ... ”
118671	118675	118676	118676	Ron	188	“ Looking good ! ”
118709	118712	118714	118714	Harry	447	“ Ten ? ”
118718	118731	118714	118714	Harry	447	“ But ... I got hurt ... What ’s he playing at ? ”
118732	118739	118740	118740	Ron	188	“ Harry , do n’t complain ! ”
118770	118773	118774	118774	Ron	188	“ What ? ”
118778	118792	118774	118774	Ron	188	“ Four ? You lousy , biased scumbag , you gave Krum ten ! ”
118917	118931	118933	118934	Charlie Weasley	210	“ You ’re tied in first place , Harry ! You and Krum ! ”
118949	119017	119018	119018	Ron	188	“ Listen , I ’ve got to run , I ’ve got to go and send Mum an owl , I swore I ’d tell her what happened — but that was unbelievable ! Oh yeah — and they told me to tell you you ’ve got to hang around for a few more minutes ... Bagman wants a word , back in the champions ’ tent . ”
119123	119129	119114	119114	He	238	“ Good one , Harry . ”
119130	119134	119136	119136	Harry	447	“ And you , ”
119141	119149	119151	119152	Ludo Bagman	221	“ Well done , all of you ! ”
119173	119292	119164	119164	he	221	“ Now , just a quick few words . You ’ve got a nice long break before the second task , which will take place at half past nine on the morning of February the twenty - fourth — but we ’re giving you something to think about in the meantime ! If you look down at those golden eggs you ’re all holding , you will see that they open ... see the hinges there ? You need to solve the clue inside the egg — because it will tell you what the second task is , and enable you to prepare for it ! All clear ? Sure ? Well , off you go , then ! ”
119385	119390	119391	119391	she	322	“ Congratulations , Harry ! ”
119398	119429	119391	119391	she	322	“ I wonder if you could give me a quick word ? How you felt facing that dragon ? How you feel now , about the fairness of the scoring ? ”
119430	119439	119441	119441	Harry	447	“ Yeah , you can have a word , ”
119444	119449	119451	119451	he	447	“ Good - bye . ”
119550	119557	119558	119558	he	188	“ Fits , does n’t it ? ”
119561	119658	119558	119558	he	188	“ Remember what Malfoy said on the train , about his dad being friends with Karkaroff ? Now we know where they knew each other . They were probably running around in masks together at the World Cup ... I ’ll tell you one thing , though , Harry , if it was Karkaroff who put your name in the goblet , he ’s going to be feeling really stupid now , is n’t he ? Did n’t work , did it ? You only got a scratch ! Come here — I ’ll do it — ”
119702	119724	119725	119725	Ron	188	“ There ’s no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous , how could they be ? ”
119736	119755	119725	119725	Ron	188	“ You know what ? I reckon you could win this tournament , Harry , I ’m serious . ”
119803	119818	119819	119819	she	178	“ Harry ’s got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament , ”
119823	119840	119819	119819	she	178	“ If that was the first task , I hate to think what ’s coming next . ”
119841	119852	119854	119854	Ron	188	“ Right little ray of sunshine , are n’t you ? ”
119856	119866	119867	119867	He	188	“ You and Professor Trelawney should get together sometime . ”
119945	119974	119942	119942	Ron	188	“ Well , we ’d better get downstairs for your surprise party , Harry — Fred and George should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by now . ”
120141	120148	120150	120151	Lee Jordan	384	“ Blimey , this is heavy , ”
120174	120192	120150	120151	Lee Jordan	384	“ Open it , Harry , go on ! Let ’s just see what ’s inside it ! ”
120193	120206	120207	120207	Hermione	178	“ He ’s supposed to work out the clue on his own , ”
120211	120219	120207	120207	Hermione	178	“ It ’s in the tournament rules ... ”
120220	120238	120239	120239	Harry	447	“ I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too , ”
120255	120266	120267	120268	several people	624	“ Yeah , go on , Harry , open it ! ”
120356	120360	120361	120361	Fred	192	“ Shut it ! ”
120370	120375	120377	120378	Seamus Finnigan	252	“ What was that ? ”
120391	120411	120385	120385	Harry	447	“ Sounded like a banshee ... Maybe you ’ve got to get past one of those next , Harry ! ”
120412	120419	120421	120421	Neville	337	“ It was someone being tortured ! ”
120437	120449	120421	120421	Neville	337	“ You ’re going to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse ! ”
120450	120463	120465	120465	George	193	“ Do n’t be a prat , Neville , that ’s illegal , ”
120467	120505	120465	120465	George	193	“ They would n’t use the Cruciatus Curse on the champions . I thought it sounded a bit like Percy singing ... maybe you ’ve got to attack him while he ’s in the shower , Harry . ”
120506	120514	120516	120516	Fred	192	“ Want a jam tart , Hermione ? ”
120532	120538	120539	120539	he	447	“ It ’s all right , ”

120793	120812	120814	120814	Fred	192	“ Do n’t you go upsetting them and telling them they ’ve got to take clothes and salaries ! ”
120817	120826	120814	120814	Fred	192	“ You ’ll put them off their cooking ! ”

The Prophet does a zoological column every Wednesday , as I ’m sure you know . We could feature these — er — Bang - Ended Scoots . ”
122114	122120	122121	122121	Hagrid	198	“ Blast - Ended Skrewts , ”

122255	122270	122272	122272	Hermione	178	“ Just as long as he did n’t import those skrewts illegally or anything , ”
122292	122309	122311	122311	Ron	188	“ Hagrid ’s been in loads of trouble before , and Dumbledore ’s never sacked him , ”
122314	122340	122311	122311	Ron	188	“ Worst that can happen is Hagrid’ll have to get rid of the skrewts . Sorry ... did I say worst ? I meant best . ”
122438	122443	122444	122444	she	324	“ I would think , ”
122459	122464	122444	122444	she	324	“ that some of us ”
122473	122542	122466	122466	she	324	“ might be a little less frivolous had they seen what I have seen during my crystal gazing last night . As I sat here , absorbed in my needlework , the urge to consult the orb overpowered me . I arose , I settled myself before it , and I gazed into its crystalline depths ... and what do you think I saw gazing back at me ? ”
122543	122552	122553	122553	Ron	188	“ An ugly old bat in outsize specs ? ”
122568	122574	122559	122559	Harry	447	“ Death , my dears . ”
122589	122592	122594	122595	Professor Trelawney	324	“ Yes , ”
122600	122623	122594	122595	Professor Trelawney	324	“ it comes , ever closer , it circles overhead like a vulture , ever lower ... ever lower over the castle ... ”
122637	122656	122657	122657	Harry	447	“ It ’d be a bit more impressive if she had n’t done it about eighty times before , ”
122675	122700	122657	122657	Harry	447	“ But if I ’d dropped dead every time she ’s told me I ’m going to , I ’d be a medical miracle . ”
122701	122713	122715	122715	Ron	188	“ You ’d be a sort of extra - concentrated ghost , ”
122737	122763	122731	122731	his	375	“ At least we did n’t get homework . I hope Hermione got loads off Professor Vector , I love not working when she is ... ”
122853	122861	122862	122862	Ron	188	“ Wonder where she ’s got to ? ”
122874	122879	122862	122862	Ron	188	“ Dunno ... balderdash . ”
122903	122906	122907	122907	she	5972	“ Harry ! ”

122971	122977	122978	122978	Harry	447	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
122981	122997	122978	122978	Harry	447	“ I ’ll show you when we get there — oh come on , quick — ”
123012	123015	123016	123016	Harry	447	“ Okay , ”
123034	123041	123042	123044	the Fat Lady	5972	“ Oh do n’t mind me ! ”
123050	123075	123042	123044	the Fat Lady	5972	“ Do n’t apologize for bothering me ! I ’ll just hang here , wide open , until you get back , shall I ? ”
123076	123081	123082	123082	Ron	188	“ Yeah , thanks ! ”

123253	123260	123245	123245	Harry	447	“ Wait a minute , Hermione ... ”
123261	123264	123265	123265	She	178	“ What ? ”
123279	123287	123289	123289	Harry	447	“ I know what this is about , ”
123311	123314	123316	123316	Ron	188	“ Hermione ! ”
123321	123334	123316	123316	Ron	188	“ You ’re trying to rope us into that spew stuff again ! ”
123335	123344	123345	123345	she	178	“ No , no , I ’m not ! ”
123349	123358	123345	123345	she	178	“ And it ’s not spew , Ron — ”

123375	123411	123369	123369	Ron	188	“ What are we now , then , the House - Elf Liberation Front ? I ’m not barging into that kitchen and trying to make them stop work , I ’m not doing it — ”
123412	123420	123421	123421	Hermione	178	“ I ’m not asking you to ! ”
123425	123455	123456	123456	She	178	“ I came down here just now , to talk to them all , and I found — oh come on , Harry , I want to show you ! ”
123586	123595	123608	123610	the squealing elf	3019	“ Harry Potter , sir ! Harry Potter ! ”
123629	123634	123635	123635	Harry	447	“ D - Dobby ? ”
123638	123648	123635	123635	Harry	447	“ It is Dobby , sir , it is ! ”
123658	123683	123635	123635	Harry	447	“ Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter , sir , and Harry Potter has come to see him , sir ! ”
123891	123900	123901	123901	Harry	447	“ Dobby , what ’re you doing here ? ”
123906	123917	123918	123918	Dobby	466	“ Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts , sir ! ”
123922	123933	123918	123918	Dobby	466	“ Professor Dumbledore gave Dobby and Winky jobs , sir ! ”
123934	123937	123939	123939	Harry	447	“ Winky ? ”
123941	123947	123960	123960	he	466	“ She ’s here too ? ”

124291	124302	124278	124278	Ron	188	“ Winky , do n’t cry , please do n’t ... ”
124322	124332	124333	124333	he	447	“ Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea ? ”
124342	124349	124351	124351	Harry	447	“ Er — yeah , okay , ”
124396	124400	124401	124401	Ron	188	“ Good service ! ”
124428	124438	124439	124439	Harry	447	“ How long have you been here , Dobby ? ”
124448	124458	124460	124460	Dobby	466	“ Only a week , Harry Potter , sir ! ”
124463	124503	124460	124460	Dobby	466	“ Dobby came to see Professor Dumbledore , sir . You see , sir , it is very difficult for a house - elf who has been dismissed to get a new position , sir , very difficult indeed — ”
124535	124553	124554	124554	Dobby	466	“ Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years , sir , trying to find work ! ”
124557	124573	124554	124554	Dobby	466	“ But Dobby has n’t found work , sir , because Dobby wants paying now ! ”
124615	124622	124609	124609	Hermione	178	“ Good for you , Dobby ! ”
124623	124629	124631	124631	Dobby	466	“ Thank you , miss ! ”
124638	124706	124631	124631	Dobby	466	“ But most wizards does n’t want a house - elf who wants paying , miss . ‘ That ’s not the point of a house - elf , ’ they says , and they slammed the door in Dobby ’s face ! Dobby likes work , but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid , Harry Potter ... Dobby likes being free ! ”
124750	124774	124776	124776	Dobby	466	“ And then , Harry Potter , Dobby goes to visit Winky , and finds out Winky has been freed too , sir ! ”
124847	124924	124834	124834	Dobby	466	“ And then Dobby had the idea , Harry Potter , sir ! ‘ Why does n’t Dobby and Winky find work together ? ’ Dobby says . ‘ Where is there enough work for two house - elves ? ’ says Winky . And Dobby thinks , and it comes to him , sir ! Hogwarts ! So Dobby and Winky came to see Professor Dumbledore , sir , and Professor Dumbledore took us on ! ”
124939	124980	124925	124925	Dobby	466	“ And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby , sir , if Dobby wants paying ! And so Dobby is a free elf , sir , and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month ! ”
124981	124988	124989	124989	Hermione	178	“ That ’s not very much ! ”
125006	125020	125022	125022	Dobby	466	“ Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week , and weekends off , ”
125043	125073	125022	125022	Dobby	466	“ but Dobby beat him down , miss ... Dobby likes freedom , miss , but he is n’t wanting too much , miss , he likes work better . ”
125074	125086	125087	125087	Hermione	178	“ And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you , Winky ? ”
125136	125151	125152	125152	she	278	“ Winky is a disgraced elf , but Winky is not yet getting paid ! ”
125155	125173	125152	125152	she	278	“ Winky is not sunk so low as that ! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed ! ”
125174	125177	125179	125179	Hermione	178	“ Ashamed ? ”
125182	125216	125179	125179	Hermione	178	“ But — Winky , come on ! It ’s Mr. Crouch who should be ashamed , not you ! You did n’t do anything wrong , he was really horrible to you — ”
125248	125283	125224	125224	her	278	“ You is not insulting my master , miss ! You is not insulting Mr. Crouch ! Mr. Crouch is a good wizard , miss ! Mr. Crouch is right to sack bad Winky ! ”
125284	125294	125296	125296	Dobby	466	“ Winky is having trouble adjusting , Harry Potter , ”
125299	125327	125296	125296	Dobby	466	“ Winky forgets she is not bound to Mr. Crouch anymore ; she is allowed to speak her mind now , but she wo n’t do it . ”
125328	125343	125344	125344	Harry	447	“ Ca n’t house - elves speak their minds about their masters , then ? ”
125347	125355	125357	125357	Dobby	466	“ Oh no , sir , no , ”
125363	125424	125357	125357	Dobby	466	“ ’ Tis part of the house - elf ’s enslavement , sir . We keeps their secrets and our silence , sir . We upholds the family ’s honor , and we never speaks ill of them — though Professor Dumbledore told Dobby he does not insist upon this . Professor Dumbledore said we is free to — to — ”
125441	125462	125438	125438	Dobby	466	“ He said we is free to call him a — a barmy old codger if we likes , sir ! ”
125471	125482	125483	125483	he	466	“ But Dobby is not wanting to , Harry Potter , ”
125500	125523	125483	125483	he	466	“ Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore very much , sir , and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him . ”
125524	125537	125538	125538	Harry	447	“ But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now ? ”
125555	125561	125562	125562	he	466	“ Dobby — Dobby could , ”
125572	125590	125566	125566	He	466	“ Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were — were — bad Dark wizards ! ”
125629	125636	125610	125610	he	466	“ Bad Dobby ! Bad Dobby ! ”
125654	125664	125666	125666	Dobby	466	“ Thank you , Harry Potter , thank you , ”
125673	125682	125683	125683	Harry	447	“ You just need a bit of practice , ”
125686	125689	125691	125691	Winky	278	“ Practice ! ”
125694	125713	125691	125691	Winky	278	“ You is ought to be ashamed of yourself , Dobby , talking that way about your masters ! ”
125714	125724	125726	125726	Dobby	466	“ They is n’t my masters anymore , Winky ! ”
125729	125739	125726	125726	Dobby	466	“ Dobby does n’t care what they think anymore ! ”
125740	125750	125752	125752	Winky	278	“ Oh you is a bad elf , Dobby ! ”
125762	125833	125834	125834	She	3034	“ My poor Mr. Crouch , what is he doing without Winky ? He is needing me , he is needing my help ! I is looking after the Crouches all my life , and my mother is doing it before me , and my grandmother is doing it before her ... oh what is they saying if they knew Winky was freed ? Oh the shame , the shame ! ”
125845	125848	125850	125850	Hermione	178	“ Winky , ”
125853	125876	125850	125850	Hermione	178	“ I ’m quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you . We ’ve seen him , you know — ”
125877	125884	125886	125886	Winky	278	“ You is seeing my master ? ”
125904	125913	125902	125902	Hermione	178	“ You is seeing him here at Hogwarts ? ”
125914	125917	125919	125919	Hermione	178	“ Yes , ”
125921	125933	125919	125919	Hermione	178	“ he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Triwizard Tournament . ”
125934	125940	125942	125942	Winky	278	“ Mr. Bagman comes too ? ”
125972	125999	125967	125967	she	278	“ Mr. Bagman is a bad wizard ! A very bad wizard ! My master is n’t liking him , oh no , not at all ! ”
126000	126005	126007	126007	Harry	447	“ Bagman — bad ? ”
126009	126013	126014	126014	Winky	278	“ Oh yes , ”
126022	126046	126018	126018	her	278	“ My master is telling Winky some things ! But Winky is not saying ... Winky — Winky keeps her master ’s secrets ... ”
126063	126078	126057	126057	her	278	“ Poor master , poor master , no Winky to help him no more ! ”
126119	126132	126133	126133	he	466	“ Dobby is going to buy a sweater next , Harry Potter ! ”
126143	126150	126152	126152	Ron	188	“ Tell you what , Dobby , ”
126166	126196	126152	126152	Ron	188	“ I ’ll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas , I always get one from her . You do n’t mind maroon , do you ? ”
126201	126214	126215	126215	Ron	188	“ We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you , ”
126219	126230	126215	126215	Ron	188	“ but it ’ll go well with your tea cozy . ”
126286	126291	126292	126292	Harry	447	“ Thanks a lot ! ”
126310	126316	126292	126292	Harry	447	“ See you , Dobby ! ”
126317	126331	126332	126332	Dobby	466	“ Harry Potter ... can Dobby come and see you sometimes , sir ? ”
126336	126342	126344	126344	Harry	447	“ ’ Course you can , ”
126350	126355	126357	126357	Ron	188	“ You know what ? ”
126382	126422	126357	126357	Ron	188	“ All these years I ’ve been really impressed with Fred and George , nicking food from the kitchens — well , it ’s not exactly difficult , is it ? They ca n’t wait to give it away ! ”
126423	126442	126444	126444	Hermione	178	“ I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves , you know , ”
126455	126491	126444	126444	Hermione	178	“ Dobby coming to work here , I mean . The other elves will see how happy he is , being free , and slowly it ’ll dawn on them that they want that too ! ”
126492	126505	126507	126507	Harry	447	“ Let ’s hope they do n’t look too closely at Winky , ”
126509	126516	126521	126521	she	178	“ Oh she ’ll cheer up , ”
126527	126557	126521	126521	she	178	“ Once the shock ’s worn off , and she ’s got used to Hogwarts , she ’ll see how much better off she is without that Crouch man . ”
126558	126565	126567	126567	Ron	188	“ She seems to love him , ”
126580	126593	126595	126595	Harry	447	“ Does n’t think much of Bagman , though , does she ? ”
126597	126607	126595	126595	Harry	447	“ Wonder what Crouch says at home about him ? ”
126608	126621	126623	126623	Hermione	178	“ Probably says he ’s not a very good Head of Department , ”
126625	126642	126623	126623	Hermione	178	“ and let ’s face it ... he ’s got a point , has n’t he ? ”
126643	126655	126657	126657	Ron	188	“ I ’d still rather work for him than old Crouch , ”
126659	126670	126657	126657	Ron	188	“ At least Bagman ’s got a sense of humor . ”
126671	126681	126682	126682	Hermione	178	“ Do n’t let Percy hear you saying that , ”
126688	126710	126712	126712	Ron	188	“ Yeah , well , Percy would n’t want to work for anyone with a sense of humor , would he ? ”
126721	126742	126712	126712	Ron	188	“ Percy would n’t recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby ’s tea cozy . ”
126743	126753	126754	126755	Professor McGonagall	343	“ Potter ! Weasley ! Will you pay attention ? ”
126835	126856	126825	126825	they	3047	“ Describe , with examples , the ways in which Transforming Spells must be adapted when performing Cross - Species Switches ”
126913	126928	126930	126931	Professor McGonagall	343	“ Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age , ”
126968	126978	126957	126957	Ron	188	“ I have something to say to you all . “
127029	127088	127019	127019	you	3053	” Lavender Brown let out a shrill giggle . Parvati Patil nudged her hard in the ribs , her face working furiously as she too fought not to giggle . They both looked around at Harry . Professor McGonagall ignored them , which Harry thought was distinctly unfair , as she had just told off him and Ron . “
127095	127100	127019	127019	you	3053	” Professor McGonagall continued , “
127124	127133	127019	127019	you	3053	” Professor McGonagall stared deliberately around the class . “
127154	127216	127019	127019	you	3053	” she said , in a disapproving voice . Lavender giggled harder than ever , with her hand pressed hard against her mouth to stifle the sound . Harry could see what was funny this time : Professor McGonagall , with her hair in a tight bun , looked as though she had never let her hair down in any sense . “
127223	127229	127295	127295	Potter	447	” Professor McGonagall went on , “
127262	127294	127295	127295	Potter	447	” The bell rang , and there was the usual scuffle of activity as everyone packed their bags and swung them onto their shoulders . Professor McGonagall called above the noise , “
127304	127342	127295	127295	Potter	447	” Assuming this had something to do with his headless rubber haddock , Harry proceeded gloomily to the teacher ’s desk . Professor McGonagall waited until the rest of the class had gone , and then said , “
127351	127352	127353	127354	What partners	3062	” “
127356	127378	127379	127379	Your	447	” said Harry . Professor McGonagall looked suspiciously at him , as though she thought he was trying to be funny . “
127388	127393	127386	127386	Potter	447	” she said coldly . “
127398	127409	127410	127411	Dance partners	3065	” Harry ’s insides seemed to curl up and shrivel . “
127413	127420	127421	127421	I	0	” He felt himself going red . “
127426	127431	127421	127421	I	0	” he said quickly . “
127438	127444	127435	127435	you	447	” said Professor McGonagall irritably . “
127464	127501	127502	127502	I	0	” Harry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and tails , accompanied by a girl in the sort of frilly dress Aunt Petunia always wore to Uncle Vernon ’s work parties . “
127507	127511	127502	127502	I	0	” he said . “
127516	127522	127523	127523	You	447	” said Professor McGonagall firmly . “
127556	127557	127554	127554	Potter	447	” “
127564	127565	127560	127560	I	0	” “
127572	127786	127570	127570	Potter	447	” said Professor McGonagall in a very final sort of way . A week ago , Harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a cinch compared to taking on a Hungarian Horntail . But now that he had done the latter , and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball , he thought he ’d rather have another round with the dragon . Harry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas ; he always did , of course , because the alternative was usually going back to Privet Drive , but he had always been very much in the minority before now . This year , however , everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying , and they all seemed to Harry to be obsessed with the coming ball — or at least all the girls were , and it was amazing how many girls Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold ; he had never quite noticed that before . Girls giggling and whispering in the corridors , girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them , girls excitedly comparing notes on what they were going to wear on Christmas night ... “
127796	127816	127570	127570	Potter	447	” Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them , sniggering and staring at Harry . “
127831	127832	127819	127819	you	3073	” “
127836	127840	127833	127833	Lasso	467	” Ron suggested . “
127851	127919	127833	127833	Lasso	467	” Harry did n’t answer . He knew perfectly well whom he ’d like to ask , but working up the nerve was something else ... Cho was a year older than he was ; she was very pretty ; she was a very good Quidditch player , and she was also very popular . Ron seemed to know what was going on inside Harry ’s head . “
127956	128109	128110	128110	She	3076	” In tribute to their recently repaired friendship , Ron had kept the bitterness in his voice to a bare minimum . Moreover , to Harry ’s amazement , he turned out to be quite right . A curly - haired third - year Hufflepuff girl to whom Harry had never spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day . Harry was so taken aback he said no before he ’d even stopped to consider the matter . The girl walked off looking rather hurt , and Harry had to endure Dean ’s , Seamus ’s , and Ron ’s taunts about her all through History of Magic . The following day , two more girls asked him , a second year and ( to his horror ) a fifth year who looked as though she might knock him out if he refused . “
128117	128128	128129	128129	She	3076	” said Ron fairly , after he ’d stopped laughing . “
128137	128144	128129	128129	She	3076	” said Harry , still unnerved . “
128157	128169	128147	128147	I	0	” Hermione ’s words about Krum kept coming back to him . “
128179	128383	128384	128384	She	3079	” Harry doubted very much if any of the girls who had asked to be his partner so far would have wanted to go to the ball with him if he had n’t been a school champion . Then he wondered if this would bother him if Cho asked him . On the whole , Harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him , life had definitely improved since he had got through the first task . He was n’t attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors anymore , which he suspected had a lot to do with Cedric — he had an idea Cedric might have told the Hufflepuffs to leave Harry alone , in gratitude for Harry ’s tip - off about the dragons . There seemed to be fewer Support Cedric Diggory ! badges around too . Draco Malfoy , of course , was still quoting Rita Skeeter ’s article to him at every possible opportunity , but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it — and just to heighten Harry ’s feeling of well - being , no story about Hagrid had appeared in the Daily Prophet . “
128400	128480	128481	128481	She	3079	” Hagrid said , when Harry , Ron , and Hermione asked him how his interview with Rita Skeeter had gone during the last Care of Magical Creatures lesson of the term . To their very great relief , Hagrid had given up on direct contact with the skrewts now , and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today , sitting at a trestle table and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to tempt the skrewts . “
128493	128501	128491	128491	Harry	447	” Hagrid continued in a low voice . “
128576	128577	128580	128580	she	3079	” “
128583	128607	128608	128608	She	3079	” said Harry , throwing lumps of dragon liver into a large metal bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more . “
128627	128628	128629	128629	She	3079	” “
128637	128647	128635	128635	Hagrid	198	” said Ron wisely as he shelled salamander eggs . “
128659	128660	128653	128653	Harry	447	” “
128666	128674	128653	128653	Harry	447	” said Hagrid , looking genuinely shocked . “
128681	128686	128687	128687	He	357	” said Harry grimly . “
128714	128715	128720	128720	he	357	” “
128722	128732	128720	128720	he	357	” said Hagrid , while Ron and Hermione laughed . “
128757	128758	128755	128755	you	447	” “
128763	128769	128761	128761	Hagrid	198	” said Harry , grinning . “
128782	128786	128780	128780	Hagrid	198	” said Ron . “
128798	128803	128789	128789	I	0	” said Hagrid gruffly . “
128834	128835	128830	128830	you	447	” “
128841	129183	129184	129184	Evil	470	” said Harry , feeling himself going red again . Hagrid did n’t pursue the subject . The last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed . Rumors about the Yule Ball were flying everywhere , though Harry did n’t believe half of them — for instance , that Dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from Madam Rosmerta . It seemed to be fact , however , that he had booked the Weird Sisters . Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters were Harry did n’t know , never having had access to a wizard ’s wireless , but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the WWN ( Wizarding Wireless Network ) that they were a very famous musical group . Some of the teachers , like little Professor Flitwick , gave up trying to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere ; he allowed them to play games in his lesson on Wednesday , and spent most of it talking to Harry about the perfect Summoning Charm Harry had used during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament . Other teachers were not so generous . Nothing would ever deflect Professor Binns , for example , from plowing on through his notes on goblin rebellions — as Binns had n’t let his own death stand in the way of continuing to teach , they supposed a small thing like Christmas was n’t going to put him off . It was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as Percy ’s cauldron - bottom report . Professors McGonagall and Moody kept them working until the very last second of their classes too , and Snape , of course , would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt Harry . Staring nastily around at them all , he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of the term . “
129189	129201	129186	129186	he	470	” Ron said bitterly that night in the Gryffindor common room . “
129225	129226	129186	129186	he	470	” “
129241	129295	129239	129239	you	470	” said Hermione , looking at him over the top of her Potions notes . Ron was busy building a card castle out of his Exploding Snap pack — a much more interesting pastime than with Muggle cards , because of the chance that the whole thing would blow up at any second . “
129302	129333	129239	129239	you	470	” said Harry lazily ; he was rereading Flying with the Cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire . Hermione looked severely over at him too . “
129358	129359	129395	129395	Hermione	178	” “
129363	129383	129395	129395	Hermione	178	” Harry said as he watched Joey Jenkins of the Cannons belt a Bludger toward a Ballycastle Bats Chaser . “
129387	129391	129395	129395	Hermione	178	” Hermione hissed . “
129407	129460	129397	129397	I	0	” Harry said . He had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk and had n’t opened it since the celebration party after the first task . There were still two and a half months to go until he needed to know what all the screechy wailing meant , after all . “
129471	129475	129476	129476	You	470	” said Hermione . “
129498	129499	129504	129504	Hermione	178	” “
129515	129542	129506	129506	he	470	” said Ron , and he placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up , singeing his eyebrows . “
129558	129588	129589	129589	Ron	188	” It was Fred and George . They sat down at the table with Harry , Ron , and Hermione as Ron felt how much damage had been done . “
129596	129600	129589	129589	Ron	188	” George asked . “
129610	129614	129603	129603	he	216	” said Ron . “
129617	129618	129603	129603	he	216	” “
129629	129634	129620	129620	George	193	” said Fred sarcastically . “
129648	129652	129643	129643	you	188	” said George . “
129662	129666	129643	129643	you	188	” said Ron . “
129681	129690	129673	129673	I	0	” said Fred , waving his wand threateningly . “
129702	129703	129693	129693	you	3093	” “
129706	129710	129693	129693	you	3093	” said Ron . “
129730	129734	129722	129725	all the good ones	3095	” said Fred . “
129743	129747	129748	129748	Angelina	424	” said Ron . “
129750	129761	129748	129748	Angelina	424	” said Fred promptly , without a trace of embarrassment . “
129764	129771	129776	129776	her	424	” said Ron , taken aback . “
129778	129779	129772	129772	You	0	” “
129783	129798	129772	129772	You	0	” said Fred . He turned his head and called across the common room , “
129803	129822	129801	129801	Angelina	424	” Angelina , who had been chatting with Alicia Spinnet near the fire , looked over at him . “
129825	129830	129772	129772	You	0	” she called back . “
129840	129850	129772	129772	You	0	” Angelina gave Fred an appraising sort of look . “
129856	129880	129772	129772	You	0	” she said , and she turned back to Alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her face . “
129885	129893	129882	129882	you	3096	” said Fred to Harry and Ron , “
129898	129910	129882	129882	you	3096	” He got to his feet , yawning , and said , “
129925	129947	129920	129920	George	193	” They left . Ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle at Harry . “
129978	129987	129973	129976	a pair of trolls	3099	” Hermione let out a sputter of indignation . “
129997	129998	129973	129976	a pair of trolls	3099	” “
130004	130010	129973	129976	a pair of trolls	3099	” said Ron , shrugging . “
130025	130026	130020	130021	Eloise Midgen	387	” “
130040	130041	130035	130035	she	387	” “
130049	130053	130035	130035	she	387	” said Ron . “
130058	130064	130035	130035	she	387	” Hermione said , bristling . “
130090	130091	130085	130085	she	387	” “
130101	130105	130085	130085	she	387	” said Ron . “
130112	130241	130106	130106	I	0	” Hermione snapped , and she swept off toward the girls ’ staircase without another word . The Hogwarts staff , demonstrating a continued desire to impress the visitors from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang , seemed determined to show the castle at its best this Christmas . When the decorations went up , Harry noticed that they were the most stunning he had yet seen inside the school . Everlasting icicles had been attached to the banisters of the marble staircase ; the usual twelve Christmas trees in the Great Hall were bedecked with everything from luminous holly berries to real , hooting , golden owls , and the suits of armor had all been bewitched to sing carols whenever anyone passed them . It was quite something to hear “
130248	130357	130358	130358	I	0	” sung by an empty helmet that only knew half the words . Several times , Filch the caretaker had to extract Peeves from inside the armor , where he had taken to hiding , filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of his own invention , all of which were very rude . And still , Harry had n’t asked Cho to the ball . He and Ron were getting very nervous now , though as Harry pointed out , Ron would look much less stupid than he would without a partner ; Harry was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other champions . “
130366	130386	130387	130387	Harry	447	” he said gloomily , referring to the ghost who haunted the girls ’ toilets on the second floor . “
130401	130423	130387	130387	Harry	447	” said Ron on Friday morning , in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable fortress . “
130442	130443	130438	130438	partners	3104	” “
130448	130614	130438	130438	partners	3104	” said Harry . But every time he glimpsed Cho that day — during break , and then lunchtime , and once on the way to History of Magic — she was surrounded by friends . Did n’t she ever go anywhere alone ? Could he perhaps ambush her as she was going into a bathroom ? But no — she even seemed to go there with an escort of four or five girls . Yet if he did n’t do it soon , she was bound to have been asked by somebody else . He found it hard to concentrate on Snape ’s Potions test , and consequently forgot to add the key ingredient — a bezoar — meaning that he received bottom marks . He did n’t care , though ; he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do . When the bell rang , he grabbed his bag , and hurried to the dungeon door . “
130622	130686	130689	130689	Cho	258	” he said to Ron and Hermione , and he dashed off upstairs . He ’d just have to ask Cho for a private word , that was all ... He hurried off through the packed corridors looking for her , and ( rather sooner than he had expected ) he found her , emerging from a Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson . “
130699	130729	130692	130692	I	0	” Giggling should be made illegal , Harry thought furiously , as all the girls around Cho started doing it . She did n’t , though . She said , “
130732	130766	130692	130692	I	0	” and followed him out of earshot of her classmates . Harry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs . “
130769	130811	130692	130692	I	0	” he said . He could n’t ask her . He could n’t . But he had to . Cho stood there looking puzzled , watching him . The words came out before Harry had quite got his tongue around them . “
130814	130815	130692	130692	I	0	” “
130818	130822	130823	130823	D’you	3106	” said Cho . “
130835	130850	130823	130823	D’you	3106	” said Harry . Why did he have to go red now ? Why ? “
130853	130863	130823	130823	D’you	3106	” said Cho , and she went red too . “
130872	130879	130867	130867	I	0	” and she truly looked it . “
130891	130892	130888	130889	someone else	2454	” “
130895	130927	130888	130889	someone else	2454	” said Harry . It was odd ; a moment before his insides had been writhing like snakes , but suddenly he did n’t seem to have any insides at all . “
130931	130935	130865	130865	Harry	447	” he said , “
130939	130940	130865	130865	Harry	447	” “
130946	130951	130941	130941	I	0	” she said again . “
130956	130973	130941	130941	I	0	” said Harry . They stood there looking at each other , and then Cho said , “
130976	130977	130941	130941	I	0	” “
130980	130984	130941	130941	I	0	” said Harry . “
130990	131013	130941	130941	I	0	” said Cho , still very red . She walked away . Harry called after her , before he could stop himself . “
131020	131021	131024	131024	Cedric	238	” “
131026	131030	131024	131024	Cedric	238	” she said . “
131034	131035	131031	131032	Cedric Diggory	238	” “
131039	131091	131092	131092	Cedric	238	” said Harry . His insides had come back again . It felt as though they had been filled with lead in their absence . Completely forgetting about dinner , he walked slowly back up to Gryffindor Tower , Cho ’s voice echoing in his ears with every step he took . “
131097	131159	131094	131095	Cedric Diggory	238	” He had been starting to quite like Cedric — prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at Quidditch , and was handsome , and popular , and nearly everyone ’s favorite champion . Now he suddenly realized that Cedric was in fact a useless pretty boy who did n’t have enough brains to fill an eggcup . “
131163	131181	131186	131186	dear	5160	” he said dully to the Fat Lady — the password had been changed the previous day . “
131188	131251	131186	131186	dear	5160	” she trilled , straightening her new tinsel hair band as she swung forward to admit him . Entering the common room , Harry looked around , and to his surprise he saw Ron sitting ashen - faced in a distant corner . Ginny was sitting with him , talking to him in what seemed to be a low , soothing voice . “
131258	131280	131256	131256	Ron	188	” said Harry , joining them . Ron looked up at Harry , a sort of blind horror in his face . “
131287	131292	131283	131283	I	0	” he said wildly . “
131303	131304	131293	131293	I	0	” “
131307	131311	131312	131312	He	3109	” said Harry . “
131328	131352	131312	131312	He	3109	” said Ginny . She looked as though she was fighting back a smile , but she kept patting Ron ’s arm sympathetically . “
131356	131360	131361	131361	I	0	” said Harry . “
131371	131376	131361	131361	I	0	” Ron gasped again . “
131430	131452	131453	131453	She	428	” Ron moaned and put his face in his hands . He kept talking , though the words were barely distinguishable . “
131490	131491	131477	131477	I	0	” “
131497	131501	131492	131492	She	428	” said Harry . “
131554	131559	131551	131552	Cho Chang	258	” Ron looked up . “
131570	131575	131577	131577	she	428	” Harry said dully , “
131581	131588	131577	131577	she	428	” Ginny had suddenly stopped smiling . “
131593	131597	131577	131577	she	428	” said Ron . “
131624	131625	131622	131622	Hermione	178	” “
131628	131639	131622	131622	Hermione	178	” said Harry , completely distracted by this startling news . “
131645	131664	131665	131665	He	238	” said Ron , some of the color coming back into his face as he started to laugh . “
131719	131720	131703	131703	She	428	” “
131724	131730	131703	131703	She	428	” said Ginny , annoyed . “
131735	131746	131703	131703	She	428	” Just then Hermione climbed in through the portrait hole . “
131755	131765	131750	131750	you	3119	” she said , coming over to join them . “
131792	131803	131808	131808	Ginny	213	” said Ginny . That shut Harry and Ron up . “
131810	131815	131808	131808	Ginny	213	” said Ron sourly . “
131826	131831	131824	131824	Ron	188	” said Hermione loftily . “
131859	131877	131846	131846	I	0	” But Ron was staring at Hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light . “
131889	131890	131884	131884	you	3119	” “
131895	131900	131884	131884	you	3119	” she said acidly . “
131911	131912	131915	131915	I	0	” “
131919	131923	131915	131915	I	0	” snapped Hermione . “
131928	131933	131915	131915	I	0	” he said impatiently , “
131956	131957	131958	131958	I	0	” “
131965	131972	131958	131958	I	0	” said Hermione , now blushing , “
131981	131982	131979	131979	someone	872	” “
131989	131993	131994	131994	You	3119	” said Ron . “
132004	132005	132008	132008	I	0	” “
132010	132020	132008	132008	I	0	” said Hermione , and her eyes flashed dangerously . “
132047	132058	132044	132045	a girl	6625	” Ron stared at her . Then he grinned again . “
132070	132074	132063	132063	we	3131	” he said . “
132083	132084	132085	132085	I	0	” “
132091	132097	132085	132085	I	0	” Hermione said very angrily . “
132105	132117	132102	132103	someone else	2454	” And she stormed off toward the girls ’ dormitories again . “
132122	132131	132132	132132	She	3134	” said Ron flatly , watching her go . “
132136	132141	132132	132132	She	3134	” said Ginny quietly . “
132147	132152	132153	132153	I	0	” said Ron sharply . “
132164	132168	132153	132153	I	0	” said Ginny . “
132171	132181	132153	132153	I	0	” said Ron , who looked extremely put out , “
132200	132201	132202	132202	I	0	” “
132206	132216	132202	132202	I	0	” said Ginny , and she went scarlet too . “
132257	132263	132264	132264	I	0	” She looked extremely miserable . “
132273	132298	132266	132266	I	0	” she said , and she got up and walked off to the portrait hole , her head bowed . Ron goggled at Harry . “
132305	132332	132303	132303	them	3136	” he demanded . But Harry had just seen Parvati and Lavender come in through the portrait hole . The time had come for drastic action . “
132336	132356	132357	132357	Parvati	352	” he said to Ron , and he stood up , walked straight up to Parvati , and said , “
132368	132394	132360	132360	you	352	” Parvati went into a fit of giggles . Harry waited for them to subside , his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes . “
132401	132409	132360	132360	you	352	” she said finally , blushing furiously . “
132412	132419	132420	132420	Lavender	392	” said Harry , in relief . “
132428	132429	132426	132426	Ron	188	” “
132436	132453	132430	132430	She	352	” said Parvati , and the pair of them giggled harder than ever . Harry sighed . “
132466	132480	132464	132464	Ron	188	” he said , lowering his voice so that Ron would n’t hear . “
132486	132490	132483	132484	Hermione Granger	178	” said Parvati . “
132498	132503	132491	132491	She	178	” Parvati looked astonished . “
132508	132516	132491	132491	She	178	” she said keenly . Harry shrugged . “
132520	132524	132491	132491	She	178	” he said . “
132530	132531	132528	132528	Ron	188	” “
132534	132539	132528	132528	Ron	188	” said Parvati slowly , “
132562	132563	132557	132557	her	3138	” “
132571	132575	132557	132557	her	3138	” said Harry . “
132583	132618	132581	132581	you	3140	” And he went back over to Ron , feeling that this ball was a lot more trouble than it was worth , and hoping very much that Padma Patil ’s nose was dead center .
132909	132922	132925	132925	her	428	“ It is too ’ eavy , all zis ’ Ogwarts food , ”
132953	132963	132939	132939	Ron	188	“ I will not fit into my dress robes ! ”
132964	132971	132972	132972	Hermione	178	“ Oooh there ’s a tragedy , ”
132983	132999	132975	132975	Fleur	428	“ She really thinks a lot of herself , that one , does n’t she ? ”
133000	133012	133014	133014	Ron	188	“ Hermione — who are you going to the ball with ? ”
133048	133063	133042	133042	Hermione	178	“ I ’m not telling you , you ’ll just make fun of me . ”
133064	133071	133073	133073	Malfoy	282	“ You ’re joking , Weasley ! ”
133078	133099	133073	133073	Malfoy	282	“ You ’re not telling me someone ’s asked that to the ball ? Not the long - molared Mudblood ? ”
133120	133126	133108	133108	Hermione	178	“ Hello , Professor Moody ! ”
133154	133165	133167	133167	Hermione	178	“ Twitchy little ferret , are n’t you , Malfoy ? ”
133185	133188	133190	133190	Ron	188	“ Hermione , ”
133200	133204	133190	133190	Ron	188	“ your teeth ... ”
133205	133210	133211	133211	she	178	“ What about them ? ”
133214	133226	133190	133190	Ron	188	“ Well , they ’re different ... I ’ve just noticed ... ”
133227	133245	133190	133190	Ron	188	“ Of course they are — did you expect me to keep those fangs Malfoy gave me ? ”
133246	133279	133280	133280	Hermione	178	“ No , I mean , they ’re different to how they were before he put that hex on you ... They ’re all ... straight and — and normal - sized . ”
133304	133340	133341	133341	she	178	“ Well ... when I went up to Madam Pomfrey to get them shrunk , she held up a mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they normally were , ”
133344	133356	133341	133341	she	178	“ And I just ... let her carry on a bit . ”
133363	133422	133357	133357	She	178	“ Mum and Dad wo n’t be too pleased . I ’ve been trying to persuade them to let me shrink them for ages , but they wanted me to carry on with my braces . You know , they ’re dentists , they just do n’t think teeth and magic should — look ! Pigwidgeon ’s back ! ”
133469	133482	133458	133464	a group of third - year girls	3161	“ Oh look at the weeny owl ! Is n’t he cute ? ”
133483	133489	133490	133490	Ron	188	“ Stupid little feathery git ! ”
133502	133518	133519	133519	Pigwidgeon	216	“ You bring letters to the addressee ! You do n’t hang around showing off ! ”
133541	133545	133546	133546	Ron	188	“ Clear off ! ”
133570	133578	133579	133579	Ron	188	“ Here — take it , Harry , ”
133717	133724	133725	133725	Hermione	178	“ That ’s what Krum did ! ”
133810	133817	133819	133819	Harry	476	“ He sounds exactly like Moody , ”
133831	133853	133819	133819	Harry	476	“ ‘ Constant vigilance ! ’ You ’d think I walk around with my eyes shut , banging off the walls ... ”
133854	133862	133864	133864	Hermione	178	“ But he ’s right , Harry , ”
133866	133898	133864	133864	Hermione	178	“ you have still got two tasks to do . You really ought to have a look at that egg , you know , and start working out what it means ... ”
133899	133907	133909	133909	Ron	188	“ Hermione , he ’s got ages ! ”
133911	133920	133909	133909	Ron	188	“ Want a game of chess , Harry ? ”
133921	133926	133928	133928	Harry	476	“ Yeah , okay , ”
133943	133973	133940	133940	he	476	“ Come on , how’m I supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on ? I wo n’t even be able to hear the egg over this lot . ”
133974	133980	133981	133981	she	178	“ Oh I suppose not , ”
134068	134071	134072	134072	Harry	476	“ Dobby ! ”
134089	134095	134072	134072	Harry	476	“ Do n’t do that ! ”
134096	134103	134111	134111	his	466	“ Dobby is sorry , sir ! ”
134118	134153	134111	134111	his	466	“ Dobby is only wanting to wish Harry Potter ‘ Merry Christmas ’ and bring him a present , sir ! Harry Potter did say Dobby could come and see him sometimes , sir ! ”
134154	134159	134161	134161	Harry	447	“ It ’s okay , ”
134178	134200	134201	134201	Harry	447	“ Just — just prod me or something in future , all right , do n’t bend over me like that ... ”
134259	134266	134267	134267	Seamus	252	“ Someone attacking you , Harry ? ”
134271	134279	134280	134280	Harry	447	“ No , it ’s just Dobby , ”
134283	134289	134280	134280	Harry	447	“ Go back to sleep . ”
134290	134295	134297	134297	Seamus	252	“ Nah ... presents ! ”
134377	134386	134387	134387	he	447	“ Can Dobby give Harry Potter his present ? ”
134391	134397	134399	134399	Harry	447	“ ’ Course you can , ”
134401	134412	134399	134399	Harry	447	“ Er ... I ’ve got something for you too . ”
134503	134512	134489	134489	He	447	“ Sorry , I forgot to wrap them ... ”
134519	134531	134532	134532	he	466	“ Socks are Dobby ’s favorite , favorite clothes , sir ! ”
134547	134558	134559	134559	he	466	“ I has seven now , sir ... But sir ... ”
134587	134608	134559	134559	he	466	“ they has made a mistake in the shop , Harry Potter , they is giving you two the same ! ”
134609	134624	134626	134626	Ron	188	“ Ah , no , Harry , how come you did n’t spot that ? ”
134643	134672	134673	134673	He	188	“ Tell you what , Dobby — here you go — take these two , and you can mix them up properly . And here ’s your sweater . ”
134702	134708	134709	134709	he	466	“ Sir is very kind ! ”
134724	134763	134709	134709	he	466	“ Dobby knew sir must be a great wizard , for he is Harry Potter ’s greatest friend , but Dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit , as noble , as selfless — ”
134764	134770	134772	134772	Ron	188	“ They ’re only socks , ”
134792	134797	134798	134798	He	188	“ Wow , Harry — ”
134811	134814	134815	134815	He	188	“ Cool ! ”
134846	134855	134856	134857	the elf	1304	“ Dobby is making them himself , sir ! ”
134861	134874	134856	134857	the elf	1304	“ He is buying the wool out of his wages , sir ! ”
134901	134915	134917	134917	Harry	447	“ They ’re ... they ’re really ... well , thanks , Dobby , ”
134935	134953	134955	134955	Dobby	466	“ Dobby must go now , sir , we is already making Christmas dinner in the kitchens ! ”
135283	135291	135293	135293	Ron	188	“ What , you need three hours ? ”
135325	135332	135333	135333	he	188	“ Who ’re you going with ? ”
135427	135436	135437	135437	she	5972	“ Lairy fights , that ’s the one ! ”
135588	135608	135610	135610	Dean	167	“ I still ca n’t work out how you two got the best - looking girls in the year , ”
135612	135616	135618	135618	Ron	188	“ Animal magnetism , ”
135701	135709	135710	135710	he	447	“ You — er — look nice , ”
135714	135717	135718	135718	she	352	“ Thanks , ”
135721	135733	135734	135734	she	352	“ Padma ’s going to meet you in the entrance hall , ”
135739	135742	135744	135744	Ron	188	“ Right , ”
135749	135754	135744	135744	Ron	188	“ Where ’s Hermione ? ”
135758	135767	135755	135755	Parvati	352	“ Shall we go down then , Harry ? ”
135768	135771	135773	135773	Harry	447	“ Okay , ”
135867	135870	135872	135872	Padma	475	“ Hi , ”
135925	135928	135930	135930	Ron	188	“ Hi , ”
135944	135948	135949	135949	He	188	“ Oh no ... ”
136004	136009	136010	136010	he	188	“ Where is Hermione ? ”
136217	136224	136211	136212	Professor McGonagall	343	“ Champions over here , please ! ”
136236	136242	136234	136234	Harry	447	“ See you in a minute ”
136526	136531	136532	136532	she	178	“ Hi , Harry ! ”
136535	136540	136532	136532	she	178	“ Hi , Parvati ! ”
136983	136989	136990	136990	Percy	206	“ I ’ve been promoted , ”
137017	137034	137003	137003	he	206	“ I ’m now Mr. Crouch ’s personal assistant , and I ’m here representing him . ”
137035	137042	137043	137043	Harry	447	“ Why did n’t he come ? ”
137061	137263	137046	137046	He	447	“ I ’m afraid to say Mr. Crouch is n’t well , not well at all . Has n’t been right since the World Cup . Hardly surprising — overwork . He ’s not as young as he was — though still quite brilliant , of course , the mind remains as great as it ever was . But the World Cup was a fiasco for the whole Ministry , and then , Mr. Crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that house - elf of his , Blinky , or whatever she was called . Naturally , he dismissed her immediately afterward , but — well , as I say , he ’s getting on , he needs looking after , and I think he ’s found a definite drop in his home comforts since she left . And then we had the tournament to arrange , and the aftermath of the Cup to deal with — that revolting Skeeter woman buzzing around — no , poor man , he ’s having a well - earned , quiet Christmas . I ’m just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place . ”
137277	137279	137271	137272	Mr. Crouch	433	“ Weatherby ”
137345	137349	137333	137333	his	187	“ Pork chops ! ”
137465	137488	137489	137489	he	447	“ Vell , ve have a castle also , not as big as this , nor as comfortable , I am thinking , ”
137494	137553	137489	137489	he	447	“ Ve have just four floors , and the fires are lit only for magical purposes . But ve have grounds larger even than these — though in vinter , ve have very little daylight , so ve are not enjoying them . But in summer ve are flying every day , over the lakes and the mountains — ”
137554	137561	137563	137563	Karkaroff	417	“ Now , now , Viktor ! ”
137575	137598	137563	137563	Karkaroff	417	“ do n’t go giving away anything else , now , or your charming friend will know exactly where to find us ! ”
137606	137623	137602	137602	his	187	“ Igor , all this secrecy ... one would almost think you did n’t want visitors . ”
137624	137629	137631	137631	Karkaroff	417	“ Well , Dumbledore , ”
137642	137694	137631	137631	Karkaroff	417	“ we are all protective of our private domains , are we not ? Do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us ? Are we not right to be proud that we alone know our school ’s secrets , and right to protect them ? ”
137695	137712	137714	137714	Dumbledore	187	“ Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts ’ secrets , Igor , ”
137717	137820	137821	137821	Harry	447	“ Only this morning , for instance , I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before , containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots . When I went back to investigate more closely , I discovered that the room had vanished . But I must keep an eye out for it . Possibly it is only accessible at five - thirty in the morning . Or it may only appear at the quarter moon — or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder . ”
137858	137863	137864	137864	she	3260	“ Zis is nothing , ”
137879	137975	137864	137864	she	3260	“ At ze Palace of Beauxbatons , we ’ ave ice sculptures all around ze dining chamber at Chreestmas . Zey do not melt , of course ... zey are like ’ uge statues of diamond , glittering around ze place . And ze food is seemply superb . And we ’ ave choirs of wood nymphs , ’ oo serenade us as we eat . We ’ ave none of zis ugly armor in ze ’ alls , and eef a poltergeist ever entaired into Beauxbatons , ’ e would be expelled like zat . ”
138031	138035	138036	138036	he	447	“ Absolutely right , ”
138053	138059	138060	138060	Harry	447	“ Like that . Yeah . ”
138134	138139	138130	138130	he	447	“ Hermy - own . ”
138140	138149	138150	138150	she	178	“ Her - my - oh - nee , ”
138156	138163	138150	138150	she	178	“ Herm - own - ninny . ”
138164	138168	138169	138169	she	178	“ Close enough , ”
138341	138345	138346	138346	Parvati	352	“ Come on ! ”
138349	138356	138357	138357	Harry	447	“ We ’re supposed to dance ! ”
138579	138585	138586	138586	Moody	332	“ Nice socks , Potter , ”
138601	138616	138618	138618	Harry	447	“ Oh — yeah , Dobby the house - elf knitted them for me , ”
138622	138628	138629	138629	Parvati	352	“ He is so creepy ! ”
138636	138647	138632	138632	Moody	332	“ I do n’t think that eye should be allowed ! ”
138683	138692	138675	138675	Harry	447	“ Let ’s sit down , shall we ? ”
138693	138705	138706	138706	Parvati	352	“ Oh — but — this is a really good one ! ”
138723	138732	138733	138733	Harry	447	“ No , I do n’t like it , ”
138780	138786	138787	138787	Harry	447	“ How ’s it going ? ”
138884	138895	138896	138896	Parvati	352	“ You do n’t mind , do you , Harry ? ”
138899	138902	138904	138904	Harry	447	“ What ? ”
138914	138919	138921	138921	Parvati	352	“ Oh never mind , ”
138966	138969	138971	138971	Harry	447	“ Hi , ”
138979	138988	138993	138993	herself	178	“ It ’s hot , is n’t it ? ”
138998	139008	138993	138993	herself	178	“ Viktor ’s just gone to get some drinks . ”
139016	139019	139020	139020	he	188	“ Viktor ? ”
139023	139035	139020	139020	he	188	“ Has n’t he asked you to call him Vicky yet ? ”
139043	139050	139051	139051	she	178	“ What ’s up with you ? ”
139054	139061	139063	139063	Ron	188	“ If you do n’t know , ”
139066	139075	139079	139079	him	188	“ I ’m not going to tell you . ”
139088	139094	139083	139083	Harry	447	“ Ron , what — ? ”
139095	139101	139103	139103	Ron	188	“ He ’s from Durmstrang ! ”
139105	139120	139121	139121	Ron	188	“ He ’s competing against Harry ! Against Hogwarts ! You — you ’re — ”
139136	139149	139121	139121	Ron	188	“ fraternizing with the enemy , that ’s what you ’re doing ! ”
139156	139163	139164	139164	she	178	“ Do n’t be so stupid ! ”
139170	139211	139164	139164	she	178	“ The enemy ! Honestly — who was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive ? Who was the one who wanted his autograph ? Who ’s got a model of him up in their dormitory ? ”
139218	139236	139212	139212	Ron	188	“ I s’pose he asked you to come with him while you were both in the library ? ”
139237	139243	139245	139245	Hermione	178	“ Yes , he did , ”
139257	139261	139245	139245	Hermione	178	“ So what ? ”
139262	139277	139212	139212	Ron	188	“ What happened — trying to get him to join spew , were you ? ”
139278	139325	139326	139326	Hermione	178	“ No , I was n’t ! If you really want to know , he — he said he ’d been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me , but he had n’t been able to pluck up the courage ! ”
139347	139357	139359	139359	Ron	188	“ Yeah , well — that ’s his story , ”
139362	139371	139359	139359	Ron	188	“ And what ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
139372	139421	139422	139422	Hermione	178	“ Obvious , is n’t it ? He ’s Karkaroff ’s student , is n’t he ? He knows who you hang around with ... He ’s just trying to get closer to Harry — get inside information on him — or get near enough to jinx him — ”
139439	139458	139459	139459	Ron	188	“ For your information , he has n’t asked me one single thing about Harry , not one — ”
139468	139500	139459	139459	Ron	188	“ Then he ’s hoping you ’ll help him find out what his egg means ! I suppose you ’ve been putting your heads together during those cozy little library sessions — ”
139501	139512	139514	139514	Hermione	178	“ I ’d never help him work out that egg ! ”
139519	139548	139514	139514	Hermione	178	“ Never . How could you say something like that — I want Harry to win the tournament , Harry knows that , do n’t you , Harry ? ”
139549	139560	139562	139562	Ron	188	“ You ’ve got a funny way of showing it , ”
139564	139584	139586	139586	Hermione	178	“ This whole tournament ’s supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards and making friends with them ! ”
139589	139595	139597	139597	Ron	188	“ No it is n’t ! ”
139599	139605	139597	139597	Ron	188	“ It ’s about winning ! ”
139614	139617	139619	139619	Harry	447	“ Ron , ”
139622	139635	139619	139619	Harry	447	“ I have n’t got a problem with Hermione coming with Krum — ”
139642	139660	139662	139662	Ron	188	“ Why do n’t you go and find Vicky , he ’ll be wondering where you are , ”
139664	139671	139662	139662	Ron	188	“ Do n’t call him Vicky ! ”
139705	139717	139690	139690	Ron	188	“ Are you going to ask me to dance at all ? ”
139722	139725	139727	139727	Ron	188	“ No , ”
139734	139737	139739	139739	Padma	475	“ Fine , ”
139782	139791	139796	139796	Krum	225	“ Vare is Herm - own - ninny ? ”
139807	139811	139813	139813	Ron	188	“ No idea , ”
139821	139828	139813	139813	Ron	188	“ Lost her , have you ? ”
139835	139849	139850	139850	he	225	“ Vell , if you see her , tell her I haff drinks , ”
139858	139870	139854	139854	he	225	“ Made friends with Viktor Krum , have you , Ron ? ”
139885	139901	139871	139871	Percy	273	“ Excellent ! That ’s the whole point , you know — international magical cooperation ! ”
140003	140017	140018	140018	Percy	273	“ What do they think they ’re doing , annoying senior Ministry members ? ”
140027	140031	140018	140018	Percy	273	“ No respect ... ”
140057	140070	140072	140072	Percy	273	“ I hope my brothers were n’t bothering you , Mr. Bagman ? ”
140076	140088	140090	140090	Bagman	221	“ What ? Oh not at all , not at all ! ”
140092	140141	140090	140090	Bagman	221	“ No , they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs . Wondering if I could advise them on the marketing . I ’ve promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at Zonko ’s Joke Shop ... ”
140211	140237	140239	140239	he	221	“ How do you feel the tournament ’s going , Mr. Bagman ? Our department ’s quite satisfied — the hitch with the Goblet of Fire ”
140244	140268	140239	140239	he	221	“ was a little unfortunate , of course , but it seems to have gone very smoothly since , do n’t you think ? ”
140269	140273	140274	140274	Bagman	221	“ Oh yes , ”
140278	140298	140274	140274	Bagman	221	“ it ’s all been enormous fun . How ’s old Barty doing ? Shame he could n’t come . ”
140299	140315	140317	140317	Percy	273	“ Oh I ’m sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no time , ”
140320	140346	140348	140348	he	273	“ but in the meantime , I ’m more than willing to take up the slack . Of course , it ’s not all attending balls ”
140352	140424	140348	140348	he	273	“ oh no , I ’ve had to deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up in his absence — you heard Ali Bashir was caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets into the country ? And then we ’ve been trying to persuade the Transylvanians to sign the International Ban on Dueling . I ’ve got a meeting with their Head of Magical Cooperation in the new year — ”
140425	140433	140434	140434	Ron	188	“ Let ’s go for a walk , ”
140439	140445	140434	140434	Ron	188	“ get away from Percy ... ”
140571	140587	140601	140601	Karkaroff	417	“ . . . do n’t see what there is to fuss about , Igor . ”
140588	140600	140601	140601	Karkaroff	417	“ Severus , you can not pretend this is n’t happening ! ”
140617	140640	140601	140601	Karkaroff	417	“ It ’s been getting clearer and clearer for months . I am becoming seriously concerned , I ca n’t deny it — ”
140641	140645	140647	140647	Snape	431	“ Then flee , ”
140652	140670	140647	140647	Snape	431	“ Flee — I will make your excuses . I , however , am remaining at Hogwarts . ”
140712	140720	140721	140721	Snape	431	“ Ten points from Ravenclaw , Fawcett ! ”
140730	140740	140721	140721	Snape	431	“ And ten points from Hufflepuff too , Stebbins ! ”
140749	140757	140758	140758	he	5794	“ And what are you two doing ? ”
140803	140808	140809	140809	Ron	188	“ We ’re walking , ”
140814	140823	140809	140809	Ron	188	“ Not against the law , is it ? ”
140824	140830	140831	140831	Snape	431	“ Keep walking , then ! ”
140863	140871	140872	140872	Ron	188	“ What ’s got Karkaroff all worried ? ”
140875	140890	140892	140892	Harry	447	“ And since when have he and Snape been on first - name terms ? ”
140945	140955	140956	140956	he	198	“ Momen ’ I saw yeh , I knew , ”
141079	141088	141096	141096	her	313	“ What did you know , ’ Agrid ? ”
141189	141209	141184	141184	Hagrid	198	“ I jus ’ knew ... knew you were like me ... Was it yer mother or yer father ? ”
141210	141224	141233	141233	Hagrid	198	“ I — I do n’t know what you mean , ’ Agrid ... ”
141225	141231	141233	141233	Hagrid	198	“ It was my mother , ”
141236	141306	141233	141233	Hagrid	198	“ She was one o ’ the las ’ ones in Britain . ’ Course , I can ’ remember her too well ... she left , see . When I was abou ’ three . She wasn ’ really the maternal sort . Well ... it ’s not in their natures , is it ? Dunno what happened to her ... might be dead fer all I know ... ”
141352	141404	141405	141405	Hagrid	198	“ Me dad was broken - hearted when she wen ’ . Tiny little bloke , my dad was . By the time I was six I could lift him up an ’ put him on top o ’ the dresser if he annoyed me . Used ter make him laugh ... ”
141425	141471	141411	141412	Madame Maxime	313	“ Dad raised me ... but he died , o ’ course , jus ’ after I started school . Sorta had ter make me own way after that . Dumbledore was a real help , mind . Very kind ter me , he was ... ”
141486	141507	141472	141472	Hagrid	198	“ So ... anyway ... enough abou ’ me . What about you ? Which side you got it on ? ”
141518	141523	141524	141524	she	313	“ It is chilly , ”
141544	141553	141524	141524	she	313	“ I think I will go in now . ”
141554	141557	141559	141559	Hagrid	198	“ Eh ? ”
141562	141580	141559	141559	Hagrid	198	“ No , don ’ go ! I ’ve — I ’ve never met another one before ! ”

141841	141846	141847	141847	he	188	“ Did you know ? ”
141850	141858	141847	141847	he	188	“ About Hagrid being half - giant ? ”
141859	141862	141863	141863	Harry	447	“ No , ”
141868	141872	141863	141863	Harry	447	“ So what ? ”
141944	141948	141938	141939	most wizards	6555	“ So what ? ”
141964	141970	141972	141972	Ron	188	“ I ’ll explain inside , ”
141975	141979	141972	141972	Ron	188	“ c’m on ... ”
142047	142050	142051	142051	Harry	447	“ So ? ”
142055	142063	142051	142051	Harry	447	“ What ’s the problem with giants ? ”
142064	142073	142074	142074	Ron	188	“ Well , they ’re ... they ’re ... ”
142079	142087	142088	142088	he	188	“ . . . not very nice , ”
142092	142096	142097	142097	Harry	447	“ Who cares ? ”
142100	142108	142097	142097	Harry	447	“ There ’s nothing wrong with Hagrid ! ”
142109	142127	142128	142128	Ron	188	“ I know there is n’t , but ... blimey , no wonder he keeps it quiet , ”
142135	142165	142128	142128	Ron	188	“ I always thought he ’d got in the way of a bad Engorgement Charm when he was a kid or something . Did n’t like to mention it ... ”
142166	142179	142181	142181	Harry	447	“ But what ’s it matter if his mother was a giantess ? ”
142183	142203	142205	142205	Ron	188	“ Well ... no one who knows him will care , ’cos they ’ll know he ’s not dangerous , ”
142208	142257	142205	142205	Ron	188	“ But ... Harry , they ’re just vicious , giants . It ’s like Hagrid said , it ’s in their natures , they ’re like trolls ... they just like killing , everyone knows that . There are n’t any left in Britain now , though . ”
142258	142264	142128	142128	Ron	188	“ What happened to them ? ”
142265	142300	142205	142205	Ron	188	“ Well , they were dying out anyway , and then loads got themselves killed by Aurors . There ’re supposed to be giants abroad , though ... They hide out in mountains mostly ... ”
142301	142313	142314	142314	Harry	447	“ I do n’t know who Maxime thinks she ’s kidding , ”
142332	142361	142318	142319	Madame Maxime	313	“ If Hagrid ’s half - giant , she definitely is . Big bones ... the only thing that ’s got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur . ”
142538	142543	142534	142534	someone	872	“ Hey — Harry ! ”
142562	142565	142567	142567	Harry	447	“ Yeah ? ”
142611	142614	142615	142615	Cedric	238	“ Listen ... ”
142623	142649	142617	142617	his	238	“ I owe you one for telling me about the dragons . You know that golden egg ? Does yours wail when you open it ? ”
142650	142653	142655	142655	Harry	447	“ Yeah , ”
142657	142666	142617	142617	his	238	“ Well ... take a bath , okay ? ”
142667	142670	142617	142617	his	238	“ What ? ”
142671	142708	142709	142709	Harry	447	“ Take a bath , and — er — take the egg with you , and — er — just mull things over in the hot water . It ’ll help you think ... Trust me . ”
142714	142719	142720	142720	Cedric	238	“ Tell you what , ”
142723	142764	142720	142720	Cedric	238	“ use the prefects ’ bathroom . Fourth door to the left of that statue of Boris the Bewildered on the fifth floor . Password ’s ‘ pine fresh . ’ Got ta go ... want to say good night — ”
142857	142861	142853	142853	Harry	447	“ Fairy lights ! ”
142912	142933	142935	142935	Hermione	178	“ Well , if you do n’t like it , you know what the solution is , do n’t you ? ”
142958	142962	142963	142963	Ron	188	“ Oh yeah ? ”
142967	142972	142963	142963	Ron	188	“ What ’s that ? ”
142973	142995	142996	142996	Ron	188	“ Next time there ’s a ball , ask me before someone else does , and not as a last resort ! ”
143028	143031	143032	143032	he	188	“ Well , ”
143038	143050	143032	143032	he	188	“ well — that just proves — completely missed the point — ”
143147	143160	143161	143161	she	178	“ but it ’s way too much bother to do every day , ”
143250	143259	143260	143260	she	178	“ Well , I thought he must be , ”
143265	143320	143260	143260	she	178	“ I knew he could n’t be pure giant because they ’re about twenty feet tall . But honestly , all this hysteria about giants . They ca n’t all be horrible ... It ’s the same sort of prejudice that people have toward werewolves ... It ’s just bigotry , is n’t it ? ”
143862	143875	143876	143876	she	3357	“ Hurry up , now , the bell rang five minutes ago , ”
143889	143894	143896	143896	Ron	188	“ Who ’re you ? ”
143902	143907	143896	143896	Ron	188	“ Where ’s Hagrid ? ”
143908	143917	143918	143918	she	3357	“ My name is Professor Grubbly - Plank , ”
143922	143933	143918	143918	she	3357	“ I am your temporary Care of Magical Creatures teacher . ”
143934	143939	143940	143940	Harry	447	“ Where ’s Hagrid ? ”
143944	143949	143951	143954	Professor Grubbly - Plank	491	“ He is indisposed , ”
144001	144007	144009	144012	Professor Grubbly - Plank	491	“ This way , please , ”
144062	144069	144070	144070	Harry	447	“ What ’s wrong with Hagrid ? ”
144083	144088	144089	144089	she	491	“ Never you mind , ”
144100	144107	144109	144109	Harry	447	“ I do mind , though , ”
144112	144119	144109	144109	Harry	447	“ What ’s up with him ? ”
144176	144179	144174	144175	the girls	1159	“ ooooohed ! ”
144187	144194	144196	144197	Lavender Brown	392	“ Oh it ’s so beautiful ! ”
144199	144216	144196	144197	Lavender Brown	392	“ How did she get it ? They ’re supposed to be really hard to catch ! ”
144249	144254	144256	144259	Professor Grubbly - Plank	491	“ Boys keep back ! ”
144273	144300	144301	144301	She	491	“ They prefer the woman ’s touch , unicorns . Girls to the front , and approach with care , come on , easy does it ... ”
144339	144356	144337	144337	Ron	188	“ What d’you reckon ’s wrong with him ? You do n’t think a skrewt — ? ”
144357	144375	144377	144377	Malfoy	282	“ Oh he has n’t been attacked , Potter , if that ’s what you ’re thinking , ”
144380	144396	144377	144377	Malfoy	282	“ No , he ’s just too ashamed to show his big , ugly face . ”
144397	144402	144404	144404	Harry	447	“ What d’you mean ? ”
144426	144431	144432	144432	he	282	“ There you go , ”
144435	144445	144446	144446	He	282	“ Hate to break it to you , Potter ... ”
144532	144536	144529	144529	he	3372	“ Mad - Eye ”
144737	144741	144722	144722	Hagrid	198	“ very frightening . ”
144742	144763	144765	144766	Draco Malfoy	282	“ I was attacked by a hippogriff , and my friend Vincent Crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm , ”
144774	144790	144765	144766	Draco Malfoy	282	“ We all hate Hagrid , but we ’re just too scared to say anything . ”
144821	144827	144818	144818	he	198	“ Blast - Ended Skrewts , ”
144881	144889	144890	144890	he	198	“ I was just having some fun , ”
145212	145219	145220	145220	he	188	“ How did she find out ? ”
145232	145244	145245	145245	Harry	447	“ What d’you mean , ‘ we all hate Hagrid ’ ? ”
145250	145257	145259	145259	he	447	“ What ’s this rubbish about him ”
145264	145280	145259	145259	he	447	“ getting a bad bite off a flobberworm ? They have n’t even got teeth ! ”
145291	145308	145310	145310	Malfoy	282	“ Well , I think this should put an end to the oaf ’s teaching career , ”
145316	145369	145312	145312	his	282	“ Half - giant ... and there was me thinking he ’d just swallowed a bottle of Skele - Gro when he was young ... None of the mummies and daddies are going to like this at all ... They ’ll be worried he ’ll eat their kids , ha , ha ... ”
145370	145373	145312	145312	his	282	“ You — ”
145374	145382	145383	145386	Professor Grubbly - Plank	491	“ Are you paying attention over there ? ”
145455	145464	145466	145467	Parvati Patil	352	“ I hope she stays , that woman ! ”
145485	145508	145466	145467	Parvati Patil	352	“ That ’s more what I thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like ... proper creatures like unicorns , not monsters ... ”
145509	145514	145515	145515	Harry	447	“ What about Hagrid ? ”
145525	145530	145532	145532	Parvati	352	“ What about him ? ”
145538	145549	145532	145532	Parvati	352	“ He can still be gamekeeper , ca n’t he ? ”
145615	145623	145625	145625	Hermione	178	“ That was a really good lesson , ”
145633	145650	145625	145625	Hermione	178	“ I did n’t know half the things Professor Grubbly - Plank told us about uni — ”
145651	145656	145657	145657	Harry	447	“ Look at this ! ”
145691	145709	145688	145688	Ron	188	“ How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out ? You do n’t think Hagrid told her ? ”
145710	145713	145715	145715	Harry	447	“ No , ”
145734	145771	145727	145727	himself	447	“ He never even told us , did he ? I reckon she was so mad he would n’t give her loads of horrible stuff about me , she went ferreting around to get him back . ”
145772	145784	145786	145786	Hermione	178	“ Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball , ”
145789	145799	145801	145801	Ron	188	“ We ’d have seen her in the garden ! ”
145803	145822	145801	145801	Ron	188	“ Anyway , she ’s not supposed to come into school anymore , Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her ... ”
145823	145832	145834	145834	Harry	447	“ Maybe she ’s got an Invisibility Cloak , ”
145850	145869	145834	145834	Harry	447	“ Sort of thing she ’d do , is n’t it , hide in bushes listening to people . ”
145870	145880	145882	145882	Hermione	178	“ Like you and Ron did , you mean , ”
145884	145893	145895	145895	Ron	188	“ We were n’t trying to hear him ! ”
145898	145922	145895	145895	Ron	188	“ We did n’t have any choice ! The stupid prat , talking about his giantess mother where anyone could have heard him ! ”
145923	145933	145935	145935	Harry	447	“ We ’ve got to go and see him , ”
145937	145957	145958	145958	he	447	“ This evening , after Divination . Tell him we want him back ... you do want him back ? ”
145963	146005	146006	146006	Hermione	178	“ I — well , I ’m not going to pretend it did n’t make a nice change , having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once — but I do want Hagrid back , of course I do ! ”
146054	146061	146062	146062	Harry	447	“ Hagrid , it ’s us ! ”
146070	146074	146062	146062	Harry	447	“ Open up ! ”
146123	146131	146106	146106	Ron	188	“ What ’s he avoiding us for ? ”
146148	146164	146106	146106	Ron	188	“ He surely does n’t think we ’d care about him being half - giant ? ”
146232	146240	146241	146241	he	282	“ Missing your half - breed pal ? ”
146263	146270	146241	146241	he	282	“ Missing the elephant - man ? ”
146291	146308	146309	146309	she	178	“ I just thought you ’d want to take advantage of the common room being quiet , ”
146312	146321	146309	146309	she	178	“ Really get to work on that egg . ”
146322	146341	146342	146342	Harry	447	“ Oh I — I reckon I ’ve got a pretty good idea what it ’s about now , ”
146345	146350	146352	146352	Hermione	178	“ Have you really ? ”
146357	146361	146352	146352	Hermione	178	“ Well done ! ”
146510	146515	146517	146517	Harry	447	“ He ’s mad ! ”
146536	146546	146517	146517	Harry	447	“ It must be freezing , it ’s January ! ”
146547	146558	146560	146560	Hermione	178	“ It ’s a lot colder where he comes from , ”
146562	146572	146560	146560	Hermione	178	“ I suppose it feels quite warm to him . ”
146573	146584	146586	146586	Ron	188	“ Yeah , but there ’s still the giant squid , ”
146610	146619	146620	146620	she	178	“ He ’s really nice , you know , ”
146623	146649	146650	146650	Ron	188	“ He ’s not at all like you ’d think , coming from Durmstrang . He likes it much better here , he told me . ”
146807	146817	146818	146818	Hermione	178	“ Does n’t he ever go into the office ? ”
146822	146825	146826	146826	She	178	“ Look ! ”
146962	146971	146948	146948	Bagman	221	“ In a moment , in a moment ! ”
146997	147000	147001	147001	he	221	“ Harry ! ”
147004	147021	147001	147001	he	221	“ How are you ? Been hoping to run into you ! Everything going all right ? ”
147022	147027	147029	147029	Harry	447	“ Fine , thanks , ”
147031	147045	147047	147047	Bagman	221	“ Wonder if I could have a quick , private word , Harry ? ”
147050	147065	147047	147047	Bagman	221	“ You could n’t give us a moment , you two , could you ? ”
147066	147071	147073	147073	Ron	188	“ Er — okay , ”
147100	147121	147123	147123	Bagman	221	“ Well , I just thought I ’d congratulate you again on your splendid performance against that Horntail , Harry , ”
147125	147129	147123	147123	Bagman	221	“ Really superb . ”
147130	147133	147135	147135	Harry	447	“ Thanks , ”
147209	147213	147215	147215	Bagman	221	“ Absolute nightmare , ”
147229	147304	147305	147305	He	221	“ Their English is n’t too good ... it ’s like being back with all the Bulgarians at the Quidditch World Cup ... but at least they used sign language another human could recognize . This lot keep gabbling in Gobbledegook ... and I only know one word of Gobbledegook . Bladvak . It means ‘ pickax . ’ I do n’t like to use it in case they think I ’m threatening them . ”
147313	147319	147320	147320	Harry	447	“ What do they want ? ”
147334	147339	147341	147341	Bagman	221	“ Er — well ... ”
147347	147359	147341	147341	Bagman	221	“ They ... er ... they ’re looking for Barty Crouch . ”
147360	147369	147371	147371	Harry	447	“ Why are they looking for him here ? ”
147373	147386	147371	147371	Harry	447	“ He ’s at the Ministry in London , is n’t he ? ”
147387	147404	147406	147406	Bagman	221	“ Er ... as a matter of fact , I ’ve no idea where he is , ”
147408	147500	147406	147406	Bagman	221	“ He ’s sort of ... stopped coming to work . Been absent for a couple of weeks now . Young Percy , his assistant , says he ’s ill . Apparently he ’s just been sending instructions in by owl . But would you mind not mentioning that to anyone , Harry ? Because Rita Skeeter ’s still poking around everywhere she can , and I ’m willing to bet she ’d work up Barty ’s illness into something sinister . Probably say he ’s gone missing like Bertha Jorkins . ”
147501	147510	147511	147511	Harry	447	“ Have you heard anything about Bertha Jorkins ? ”
147514	147517	147519	147519	Bagman	221	“ No , ”
147525	147535	147519	147519	Bagman	221	“ I ’ve got people looking , of course ... ”
147543	147636	147638	147638	he	3452	“ and it ’s all very strange . She definitely arrived in Albania , because she met her second cousin there . And then she left the cousin ’s house to go south and see an aunt ... and she seems to have vanished without trace en route . Blowed if I can see where she ’s got to ... she does n’t seem the type to elope , for instance ... but still ... What are we doing , talking about goblins and Bertha Jorkins ? I really wanted to ask you ”
147643	147654	147640	147640	his	3452	“ how are you getting on with your golden egg ? ”
147655	147661	147662	147662	Harry	447	“ Er ... not bad , ”
147676	147681	147682	147682	he	221	“ Listen , Harry , ”
147693	147719	147682	147682	he	221	“ I feel very bad about all this ... you were thrown into this tournament , you did n’t volunteer for it ... and if ... ”
147736	147775	147721	147721	his	221	“ if I can help at all ... a prod in the right direction ... I ’ve taken a liking to you ... the way you got past that dragon ! ... well , just say the word . ”
147795	147810	147811	147811	he	447	“ We ’re supposed to work out the clues alone , are n’t we ? ”
147843	147850	147852	147852	Bagman	221	“ Well ... well , yes , ”
147855	147874	147852	147852	Bagman	221	“ but — come on , Harry — we all want a Hogwarts victory , do n’t we ? ”
147875	147882	147883	147883	Harry	447	“ Have you offered Cedric help ? ”
147896	147903	147904	147904	he	447	“ No , I have n’t , ”
147907	147930	147904	147904	he	447	“ I — well , like I say , I ’ve taken a liking to you . Just thought I ’d offer ... ”
147931	147936	147938	147938	Harry	447	“ Well , thanks , ”
147940	147959	147938	147938	Harry	447	“ but I think I ’m nearly there with the egg ... couple more days should crack it . ”
148026	148032	148034	148034	Fred	192	“ Hello , Mr. Bagman , ”
148037	148045	148034	148034	Fred	192	“ Can we buy you a drink ? ”
148046	148051	148053	148053	Bagman	221	“ Er ... no , ”
148063	148071	148072	148072	Fred	192	“ no , thank you , boys ... ”
148095	148102	148103	148103	he	221	“ Well , I must dash , ”
148106	148117	148118	148118	He	221	“ Nice seeing you all . Good luck , Harry . ”
148145	148151	148152	148152	Ron	188	“ What did he want ? ”
148162	148173	148175	148175	Harry	447	“ He offered to help me with the golden egg , ”
148177	148185	148187	148187	Hermione	178	“ He should n’t be doing that ! ”
148193	148215	148187	148187	Hermione	178	“ He ’s one of the judges ! And anyway , you ’ve already worked it out — have n’t you ? ”
148216	148221	148223	148223	Harry	447	“ Er ... nearly , ”
148225	148248	148250	148250	Hermione	178	“ Well , I do n’t think Dumbledore would like it if he knew Bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat ! ”
148257	148269	148250	148250	Hermione	178	“ I hope he ’s trying to help Cedric as much ! ”
148270	148278	148280	148280	Harry	447	“ He ’s not , I asked , ”
148282	148291	148293	148293	Ron	188	“ Who cares if Diggory ’s getting help ? ”
148299	148308	148310	148310	Hermione	178	“ Those goblins did n’t look very friendly , ”
148316	148323	148310	148310	Hermione	178	“ What were they doing here ? ”
148324	148333	148335	148335	Harry	447	“ Looking for Crouch , according to Bagman , ”
148337	148349	148335	148335	Harry	447	“ He ’s still ill . Has n’t been into work . ”
148350	148357	148359	148359	Ron	188	“ Maybe Percy ’s poisoning him , ”
148361	148381	148359	148359	Ron	188	“ Probably thinks if Crouch snuffs it he ’ll be made Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation . ”
148402	148427	148382	148382	Hermione	178	“ Funny , goblins looking for Mr. Crouch ... They ’d normally deal with the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures . ”
148428	148439	148441	148441	Harry	447	“ Crouch can speak loads of different languages , though , ”
148443	148450	148441	148441	Harry	447	“ Maybe they need an interpreter . ”
148451	148464	148465	148465	Ron	188	“ Worrying about poor ’ ickle goblins , now , are you ? ”
148469	148486	148467	148467	Hermione	178	“ Thinking of starting up S.P.U.G. or something ? Society for the Protection of Ugly Goblins ? ”
148487	148494	148496	148496	Hermione	178	“ Ha , ha , ha , ”
148499	148523	148496	148496	Hermione	178	“ Goblins do n’t need protection . Have n’t you been listening to what Professor Binns has been telling us about goblin rebellions ? ”
148524	148527	148529	148529	Harry	447	“ No , ”
148534	148546	148548	148548	Hermione	178	“ Well , they ’re quite capable of dealing with wizards , ”
148556	148577	148548	148548	Hermione	178	“ They ’re very clever . They ’re not like house - elves , who never stick up for themselves . ”
148578	148583	148585	148585	Ron	188	“ Uh - oh , ”
148668	148775	148657	148657	She	322	“ . . . did n’t seem very keen to talk to us , did he , Bozo ? Now , why would that be , do you think ? And what ’s he doing with a pack of goblins in tow anyway ? Showing them the sights ... what nonsense ... he was always a bad liar . Reckon something ’s up ? Think we should do a bit of digging ? ‘ Disgraced Ex - Head of Magical Games and Sports , Ludo Bagman ... ’ Snappy start to a sentence , Bozo — we just need to find a story to fit it — ”
148776	148785	148787	148787	Harry	447	“ Trying to ruin someone else ’s life ? ”
148812	148815	148816	148816	she	322	“ Harry ! ”
148821	148834	148816	148816	she	322	“ How lovely ! Why do n’t you come and join — ? ”
148835	148849	148851	148851	Harry	447	“ I would n’t come near you with a ten - foot broomstick , ”
148854	148866	148851	148851	Harry	447	“ What did you do that to Hagrid for , eh ? ”
148875	148893	148870	148870	her	322	“ Our readers have a right to the truth , Harry . I am merely doing my — ”
148894	148904	148905	148905	Harry	447	“ Who cares if he ’s half - giant ? ”
148908	148916	148905	148905	Harry	447	“ There ’s nothing wrong with him ! ”
148988	149026	148968	148968	she	322	“ How about giving me an interview about the Hagrid you know , Harry ? The man behind the muscles ? Your unlikely friendship and the reasons behind it . Would you call him a father substitute ? ”
149046	149051	149052	149052	she	322	“ You horrible woman , ”
149059	149086	149052	149052	she	322	“ you do n’t care , do you , anything for a story , and anyone will do , wo n’t they ? Even Ludo Bagman — ”
149087	149107	149113	149113	her	322	“ Sit down , you silly little girl , and do n’t talk about things you do n’t understand , ”
149122	149142	149143	149143	she	322	“ I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl ... not that it needs it — ”
149152	149157	149159	149159	Hermione	178	“ Let ’s go , ”
149161	149169	149159	149159	Hermione	178	“ c’m on , Harry — Ron ... ”
149217	149227	149229	149229	Ron	188	“ She ’ll be after you next , Hermione , ”
149245	149250	149255	149255	she	178	“ Let her try ! ”
149261	149290	149255	149255	she	178	“ I ’ll show her ! Silly little girl , am I ? Oh , I ’ll get her back for this . First Harry , then Hagrid ... ”
149291	149302	149304	149304	Ron	188	“ You do n’t want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter , ”
149307	149322	149304	149304	Ron	188	“ I ’m serious , Hermione , she ’ll dig up something on you — ”
149323	149341	149343	149343	Hermione	178	“ My parents do n’t read the Daily Prophet . She ca n’t scare me into hiding ! ”
149387	149412	149418	149418	she	178	“ And Hagrid is n’t hiding anymore ! He should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him ! Come on ! ”
149463	149466	149467	149467	Hermione	178	“ Hagrid ! ”
149476	149525	149467	149467	Hermione	178	“ Hagrid , that ’s enough ! We know you ’re in there ! Nobody cares if your mum was a giantess , Hagrid ! You ca n’t let that foul Skeeter woman do this to you ! Hagrid , get out here , you ’re just being — ”
149533	149538	149530	149530	Hermione	178	“ About t — ! ”
149566	149570	149571	149571	he	187	“ Good afternoon , ”
149580	149591	149593	149593	Hermione	178	“ We — er — we wanted to see Hagrid , ”
149600	149608	149610	149610	Dumbledore	187	“ Yes , I surmised as much , ”
149616	149624	149610	149610	Dumbledore	187	“ Why do n’t you come in ? ”
149625	149632	149634	149634	Hermione	178	“ Oh ... um ... okay , ”
149737	149742	149744	149744	Harry	447	“ Hi , Hagrid , ”
149750	149754	149755	149755	he	198	“ ’ Lo , ”
149763	149770	149772	149772	Dumbledore	187	“ More tea , I think , ”
149832	149847	149829	149829	Dumbledore	187	“ Did you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was shouting , Hagrid ? ”
149861	149889	149854	149854	Dumbledore	187	“ Hermione , Harry , and Ron still seem to want to know you , judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door . ”
149890	149900	149901	149901	Harry	447	“ Of course we still want to know you ! ”
149908	149922	149923	149923	he	447	“ You do n’t think anything that Skeeter cow — sorry , Professor , ”
149931	149948	149950	149950	Dumbledore	187	“ I have gone temporarily deaf and have n’t any idea what you said , Harry , ”
149961	149966	149968	149968	Harry	447	“ Er — right , ”
149971	149994	149968	149968	Harry	447	“ I just meant — Hagrid , how could you think we ’d care what that — woman — wrote about you ? ”
150015	150028	150030	150030	Dumbledore	187	“ Living proof of what I ’ve been telling you , Hagrid , ”
150040	150081	150030	150030	Dumbledore	187	“ I have shown you the letters from the countless parents who remember you from their own days here , telling me in no uncertain terms that if I sacked you , they would have something to say about it — ”
150082	150088	150090	150090	Hagrid	198	“ Not all of ’em , ”
150093	150104	150090	150090	Hagrid	198	“ Not all of ’em wan ’ me ter stay . ”
150105	150134	150136	150136	Dumbledore	187	“ Really , Hagrid , if you are holding out for universal popularity , I ’m afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time , ”
150148	150196	150136	150136	Dumbledore	187	“ Not a week has passed since I became headmaster of this school when I have n’t had at least one owl complaining about the way I run it . But what should I do ? Barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybody ? ”
150197	150206	150208	150208	Hagrid	198	“ Yeh — yeh’re not half - giant ! ”
150211	150222	150223	150223	Harry	447	“ Hagrid , look what I ’ve got for relatives ! ”
150227	150233	150223	150223	Harry	447	“ Look at the Dursleys ! ”
150234	150239	150241	150242	Professor Dumbledore	187	“ An excellent point , ”
150244	150312	150241	150242	Professor Dumbledore	187	“ My own brother , Aberforth , was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat . It was all over the papers , but did Aberforth hide ? No , he did not ! He held his head high and went about his business as usual ! Of course , I ’m not entirely sure he can read , so that may not have been bravery ... ”
150313	150321	150323	150323	Hermione	178	“ Come back and teach , Hagrid , ”
150326	150336	150323	150323	Hermione	178	“ please come back , we really miss you . ”
150357	150377	150378	150378	he	187	“ I refuse to accept your resignation , Hagrid , and I expect you back at work on Monday , ”
150381	150406	150378	150378	he	187	“ You will join me for breakfast at eight - thirty in the Great Hall . No excuses . Good afternoon to you all . ”
150464	150473	150451	150451	Hagrid	198	“ Great man , Dumbledore ... great man ... ”
150474	150480	150482	150482	Ron	188	“ Yeah , he is , ”
150484	150495	150482	150482	Ron	188	“ Can I have one of these cakes , Hagrid ? ”
150496	150500	150502	150502	Hagrid	198	“ Help yerself , ”
150514	150551	150511	150511	his	198	“ Ar , he ’s righ ’ , o ’ course — yeh’re all righ ’ ... I bin stupid ... my ol’ dad woulda bin ashamed o ’ the way I ’ve bin behavin ’ ... ”
150568	150584	150558	150558	he	198	“ Never shown you a picture of my old dad , have I ? Here ... ”
150664	150677	150678	150678	Hagrid	198	“ Tha ’ was taken jus ’ after I got inter Hogwarts , ”
150681	150737	150678	150678	Hagrid	198	“ Dad was dead chuffed ... thought I migh ’ not be a wizard , see , ’cos me mum ... well , anyway . ’ Course , I never was great shakes at magic , really ... but at least he never saw me expelled . Died , see , in me second year ... “
150938	150993	150931	150931	I	0	” Harry , Ron , and Hermione looked at one another nervously ; Harry would rather have taken fifty Blast - Ended Skrewts for a walk than admit to Hagrid that he had overheard him talking to Madame Maxime , but Hagrid was still talking , apparently unaware that he had said anything odd . “
151001	151019	150999	150999	Harry	447	” he said , looking up from the photograph of his father , his eyes very bright , “
151080	151095	151075	151075	Harry	447	” He looked at Harry for a moment and then said , very seriously , “
151181	151182	151173	151173	you	447	” “
151185	151189	151173	151173	you	447	” said Harry . “
151193	151206	151173	151173	you	447	” Hagrid ’s miserable face broke into a wide , watery smile . “
151226	151324	151218	151218	you	447	” Lying to Hagrid was n’t quite like lying to anyone else . Harry went back to the castle later that afternoon with Ron and Hermione , unable to banish the image of the happy expression on Hagrid ’s whiskery face as he had imagined Harry winning the tournament . The incomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than ever on Harry ’s conscience that evening , and by the time he had got into bed , he had made up his mind — it was time to shelve his pride and see if Cedric ’s hint was worth anything .
151612	151615	151600	151600	Ron	188	“ banana fritters ”
151618	151622	151623	151623	Ron	188	“ Good luck , ”
151743	151747	151727	151727	he	447	“ Pine fresh , ”
152385	152400	152382	152382	someone	872	“ I ’d try putting it in the water , if I were you . ”
152465	152468	152469	152469	Harry	447	“ Myrtle ! ”
152474	152484	152469	152469	Harry	447	“ I ’m — I ’m not wearing anything ! ”
152521	152531	152532	152532	she	474	“ I closed my eyes when you got in , ”
152543	152554	152532	152532	she	474	“ You have n’t been to see me for ages . ”
152555	152560	152562	152562	Harry	447	“ Yeah ... well ... ”
152583	152604	152562	152562	Harry	447	“ I ’m not supposed to come into your bathroom , am I ? It ’s a girls ’ one . ”
152605	152613	152615	152615	Myrtle	474	“ You did n’t used to care , ”
152618	152629	152615	152615	Myrtle	474	“ You used to be in there all the time . ”
152694	152704	152706	152706	Harry	447	“ I got told off for going in there , ”
152726	152738	152714	152714	Percy	494	“ I thought I ’d better not come back after that . ”
152739	152745	152747	152747	Myrtle	474	“ Oh ... I see ... ”
152763	152784	152747	152747	Myrtle	474	“ Well ... anyway ... I ’d try the egg in the water . That ’s what Cedric Diggory did . ”
152785	152794	152796	152796	Harry	447	“ Have you been spying on him too ? ”
152799	152817	152796	152796	Harry	447	“ What d’you do , sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths ? ”
152818	152821	152823	152823	Myrtle	474	“ Sometimes , ”
152828	152841	152823	152823	Myrtle	474	“ but I ’ve never come out to speak to anyone before . ”
152842	152847	152849	152849	Harry	447	“ I ’m honored , ”
152852	152859	152860	152860	He	447	“ You keep your eyes shut ! ”
152908	152920	152900	152900	Myrtle	474	“ Go on , then ... open it under the water ! ”
152963	152973	152975	152975	Myrtle	474	“ You need to put your head under too , ”
152987	152991	152975	152975	Myrtle	474	“ Go on ! ”
153036	153110	153111	153111	Harry	447	“ Come seek us where our voices sound , We can not sing above the ground , And while you ’re searching , ponder this : We ’ve taken what you ’ll sorely miss , An hour long you ’ll have to look , And to recover what we took , But past an hour — the prospect ’s black , Too late , it ’s gone , it wo n’t come back . ”
153131	153135	153137	153137	Myrtle	474	“ Hear it ? ”
153139	153167	153137	153137	Myrtle	474	“ Yeah ... ‘ Come seek us where our voices sound ... ’ and if I need persuading ... hang on , I need to listen again ... ”
153210	153230	153231	153231	he	447	“ I ’ve got to go and look for people who ca n’t use their voices above the ground ... ”
153235	153243	153231	153231	he	447	“ Er ... who could that be ? ”
153244	153251	153252	153252	He	447	“ Slow , are n’t you ? ”
153324	153333	153334	153334	she	474	“ Well , that ’s what Diggory thought , ”
153337	153360	153334	153334	she	474	“ He lay there talking to himself for ages about it . Ages and ages ... nearly all the bubbles had gone ... ”
153361	153364	153365	153365	Harry	447	“ Underwater ... ”
153369	153384	153365	153365	Harry	447	“ Myrtle ... what lives in the lake , apart from the giant squid ? ”
153385	153390	153391	153391	she	474	“ Oh all sorts , ”
153394	153420	153391	153391	she	474	“ I sometimes go down there ... sometimes do n’t have any choice , if someone flushes my toilet when I ’m not expecting it ... ”
153445	153460	153442	153442	Harry	447	“ Well , does anything in there have a human voice ? Hang on — ”

153491	153497	153498	153498	she	474	“ Oooh , very good , ”
153506	153522	153498	153498	she	474	“ it took Diggory much longer than that ! And that was with her awake too ”
153542	153552	153526	153526	her	474	“ giggling and showing off and flashing her fins ... ”
153553	153562	153564	153564	Harry	447	“ That ’s it , is n’t it ? ”
153567	153585	153564	153564	Harry	447	“ The second task ’s to go and find the merpeople in the lake and ... and ... ”
153697	153700	153701	153701	Harry	447	“ Myrtle , ”
153705	153713	153701	153701	Harry	447	“ how am I supposed to breathe ? ”
153726	153729	153730	153730	she	474	“ Tactless ! ”
153741	153746	153748	153748	Harry	447	“ What ’s tactless ? ”
153752	153761	153762	153762	she	474	“ Talking about breathing in front of me ! ”
153775	153790	153762	153762	she	474	“ When I ca n’t ... when I have n’t ... not for ages ... ”
153829	153832	153833	153833	he	447	“ Sorry , ”
153837	153847	153833	153833	he	447	“ I did n’t mean — I just forgot ... ”
153848	153860	153862	153862	Myrtle	474	“ Oh yes , very easy to forget Myrtle ’s dead , ”
153874	153982	153862	153862	Myrtle	474	“ Nobody missed me even when I was alive . Took them hours and hours to find my body — I know , I was sitting there waiting for them . Olive Hornby came into the bathroom — ‘ Are you in here again , sulking , Myrtle ? ’ she said , ‘ because Professor Dippet asked me to look for you — ’ And then she saw my body ... ooooh , she did n’t forget it until her dying day , I made sure of that ... followed her around and reminded her , I did . I remember at her brother ’s wedding — ”
153999	154009	153989	153989	he	447	“ We ’ve taken what you ’ll sorely miss . ”
154037	154071	154032	154032	they	3543	“ — and then , of course , she went to the Ministry of Magic to stop me stalking her , so I had to come back here and live in my toilet . ”
154072	154075	154077	154077	Harry	447	“ Good , ”
154080	154106	154107	154107	He	447	“ Well , I ’m a lot further on than I was ... Shut your eyes again , will you ? I ’m getting out . ”
154134	154147	154148	154149	Moaning Myrtle	474	“ Will you come and visit me in my bathroom again sometime ? ”
154160	154167	154168	154168	Harry	447	“ Er ... I ’ll try , ”
154196	154207	154168	154168	Harry	447	“ See you , Myrtle ... thanks for your help . ”
154208	154215	154216	154216	she	474	“ ’ Bye , ’ bye , ”
154361	154364	154368	154369	Bartemius Crouch	219	“ Severus Snape ”
154801	154804	154789	154789	his	447	“ PEEVES ! ”
154836	154871	154872	154872	Filch	379	“ What ’s this racket ? Wake up the whole castle , will you ? I ’ll have you , Peeves , I ’ll have you , you ’ll ... and what is this ? ”
154968	154971	154982	154982	Filch	379	“ Harry Potter ”
154978	154981	154982	154982	Filch	379	“ Egg ? ”
154992	154996	154982	154982	Filch	379	“ My sweet ! ”
155005	155019	154998	154999	Mrs. Norris	500	“ This is a Triwizard clue ! This belongs to a school champion ! ”
155031	155034	155035	155035	Filch	379	“ PEEVES ! ”
155039	155045	155046	155046	He	379	“ You ’ve been stealing ! ”
155078	155084	155085	155085	he	379	“ Hiding , are you ? ”
155089	155125	155085	155085	he	379	“ I ’m coming to get you , Peeves ... You ’ve gone and stolen a Triwizard clue , Peeves ... Dumbledore’ll have you out of here for this , you filthy , pilfering poltergeist ... ”
155235	155243	155244	155244	Filch	379	“ Filch ? What ’s going on ? ”
155286	155293	155294	155294	Filch	379	“ It ’s Peeves , Professor , ”
155298	155307	155294	155294	Filch	379	“ He threw this egg down the stairs . ”
155337	155340	155342	155342	Snape	431	“ Peeves ? ”
155354	155364	155342	155342	Snape	431	“ But Peeves could n’t get into my office ... ”
155365	155375	155317	155317	Filch	379	“ This egg was in your office , Professor ? ”
155376	155381	155382	155382	Snape	431	“ Of course not , ”
155385	155392	155382	155382	Snape	431	“ I heard banging and wailing — ”
155393	155403	155317	155317	Filch	379	“ Yes , Professor , that was the egg — ”
155404	155412	155317	155317	Filch	379	“ — I was coming to investigate — ”
155413	155421	155382	155382	Snape	431	“ — Peeves threw it , Professor — ”
155422	155451	155317	155317	Filch	379	“ — and when I passed my office , I saw that the torches were lit and a cupboard door was ajar ! Somebody has been searching it ! ”
155452	155458	155317	155317	Filch	379	“ But Peeves could n’t — ”
155459	155468	155469	155469	Snape	431	“ I know he could n’t , Filch ! ”
155473	155488	155469	155469	Snape	431	“ I seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break ! ”
155507	155523	155489	155489	Snape	431	“ I want you to come and help me search for the intruder , Filch . ”
155524	155533	155534	155534	Filch	379	“ I — yes , Professor — but — ”
155607	155614	155616	155616	Filch	379	“ The thing is , Professor , ”
155619	155657	155616	155616	Filch	379	“ the headmaster will have to listen to me this time . Peeves has been stealing from a student , it might be my chance to get him thrown out of the castle once and for all — ”
155658	155679	155722	155722	Moody	332	“ Filch , I do n’t give a damn about that wretched poltergeist ; it ’s my office that ’s — ”
155740	155747	155748	155748	he	332	“ Pajama party , is it ? ”
155754	155764	155766	155766	Filch	379	“ Professor Snape and I heard noises , Professor , ”
155770	155794	155766	155766	Filch	379	“ Peeves the Poltergeist , throwing things around as usual — and then Professor Snape discovered that someone had broken into his off — ”
155795	155799	155800	155800	Snape	357	“ Shut up ! ”
155924	155933	155934	155934	he	332	“ Did I hear that correctly , Snape ? ”
155938	155945	155934	155934	he	332	“ Someone broke into your office ? ”
155946	155951	155953	155953	Snape	357	“ It is unimportant , ”
155956	155961	155963	155963	Moody	332	“ On the contrary , ”
155965	155980	155963	155963	Moody	332	“ it is very important . Who ’d want to break into your office ? ”
155981	155988	155990	155990	Snape	357	“ A student , I daresay , ”
156005	156030	155963	155963	Moody	332	“ It has happened before . Potion ingredients have gone missing from my private store cupboard ... students attempting illicit mixtures , no doubt ... ”
156031	156041	156043	156043	Moody	332	“ Reckon they were after potion ingredients , eh ? ”
156045	156057	156043	156043	Moody	332	“ Not hiding anything else in your office , are you ? ”
156082	156092	156093	156093	he	357	“ You know I ’m hiding nothing , Moody , ”
156102	156113	156093	156093	he	357	“ as you ’ve searched my office pretty thoroughly yourself . ”
156122	156137	156114	156114	Moody	332	“ Auror ’s privilege , Snape . Dumbledore told me to keep an eye — ”
156138	156145	156147	156147	Snape	357	“ Dumbledore happens to trust me , ”
156152	156167	156147	156147	Snape	357	“ I refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my office ! ”
156168	156175	156177	156177	Moody	332	“ ’ Course Dumbledore trusts you , ”
156179	156223	156177	156177	Moody	332	“ He ’s a trusting man , is n’t he ? Believes in second chances . But me — I say there are spots that do n’t come off , Snape . Spots that never come off , d’you know what I mean ? ”
156254	156262	156251	156251	Moody	332	“ Get back to bed , Snape . ”
156263	156275	156276	156276	Snape	357	“ You do n’t have the authority to send me anywhere ! ”
156290	156306	156276	156276	Snape	357	“ I have as much right to prowl this school after dark as you do ! ”
156307	156311	156313	156313	Moody	332	“ Prowl away , ”
156323	156346	156316	156316	his	332	“ I look forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some time ... You ’ve dropped something , by the way ... ”
156409	156416	156391	156391	he	447	“ It ’s mine ! Mine ! ”
156434	156438	156431	156431	his	357	“ Accio Parchment ! ”
156464	156468	156469	156469	Moody	332	“ My mistake , ”
156473	156484	156469	156469	Moody	332	“ It ’s mine — must ’ve dropped it earlier — ”
156524	156527	156528	156528	he	447	“ Potter , ”
156532	156537	156539	156539	Moody	332	“ What ’s that ? ”
156550	156553	156554	156554	Snape	357	“ Potter ! ”
156581	156618	156558	156558	he	357	“ That egg is Potter ’s egg . That piece of parchment belongs to Potter . I have seen it before , I recognize it ! Potter is here ! Potter , in his Invisibility Cloak ! ”
156672	156680	156682	156682	Moody	332	“ There ’s nothing there , Snape ! ”
156684	156703	156682	156682	Moody	332	“ but I ’ll be happy to tell the headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to Harry Potter ! ”
156704	156708	156709	156709	Snape	357	“ Meaning what ? ”
156728	156746	156748	156748	Moody	332	“ Meaning that Dumbledore ’s very interested to know who ’s got it in for that boy ! ”
156760	156771	156748	156748	Moody	332	“ And so am I , Snape ... very interested ... ”
156835	156840	156842	156842	Snape	357	“ I merely thought , ”
156851	156882	156842	156842	Snape	357	“ that if Potter was wandering around after hours again ... it ’s an unfortunate habit of his ... he should be stopped . For — for his own safety . ”
156883	156889	156891	156891	Moody	332	“ Ah , I see , ”
156894	156906	156891	156891	Moody	332	“ Got Potter ’s best interests at heart , have you ? ”
156948	156958	156959	156959	Snape	357	“ I think I will go back to bed , ”
156963	156972	156974	156974	Moody	332	“ Best idea you ’ve had all night , ”
156976	156990	156974	156974	Moody	332	“ Now , Filch , if you ’ll just give me that egg — ”
156991	156994	156996	156996	Filch	379	“ No ! ”
157009	157021	156996	156996	Filch	379	“ Professor Moody , this is evidence of Peeves ’ treachery ! ”
157022	157035	157037	157037	Moody	381	“ It ’s the property of the champion he stole it from , ”
157039	157046	157037	157037	Moody	381	“ Hand it over , now . ”
157113	157136	157110	157111	Mrs. Norris	500	“ Never mind , my sweet ... we ’ll see Dumbledore in the morning ... tell him what Peeves was up to ... ”
157173	157179	157180	157180	he	381	“ Close shave , Potter , ”
157183	157192	157194	157194	Harry	447	“ Yeah ... I — er ... thanks , ”
157197	157203	157205	157205	Moody	381	“ What is this thing ? ”
157220	157225	157227	157227	Harry	447	“ Map of Hogwarts , ”
157249	157254	157255	157255	Moody	381	“ Merlin ’s beard , ”
157269	157279	157255	157255	Moody	381	“ This ... this is some map , Potter ! ”
157280	157289	157290	157290	Harry	447	“ Yeah , it ’s ... quite useful , ”
157303	157317	157290	157290	Harry	447	“ Er — Professor Moody , d’you think you could help me — ? ”
157318	157330	157331	157331	Moody	381	“ What ? Oh ! Yes ... yes , of course ... ”
157368	157371	157372	157372	he	381	“ Potter ... ”
157376	157405	157372	157372	he	381	“ you did n’t happen , by any chance , to see who broke into Snape ’s office , did you ? On this map , I mean ? ”
157406	157414	157415	157415	Harry	447	“ Er ... yeah , I did ... ”
157418	157424	157415	157415	Harry	447	“ It was Mr. Crouch . ”
157443	157446	157447	157447	he	381	“ Crouch ? ”
157450	157460	157447	157447	he	381	“ You ’re — you ’re sure , Potter ? ”
157461	157464	157466	157466	Harry	447	“ Positive , ”
157468	157477	157479	157479	Moody	381	“ Well , he ’s not here anymore , ”
157489	157499	157479	157479	Moody	381	“ Crouch ... that ’s very — very interesting ... ”
157559	157578	157579	157579	Moody	381	“ Er ... Professor Moody ... why d’you reckon Mr. Crouch wanted to look around Snape ’s office ? ”
157626	157634	157635	157635	Moody	381	“ Put it this way , Potter , ”
157639	157665	157635	157635	Moody	381	“ they say old Mad - Eye ’s obsessed with catching Dark wizards ... but I ’m nothing — nothing — compared to Barty Crouch . ”
157681	157685	157686	157686	he	447	“ Professor Moody ? ”
157690	157712	157686	157686	he	447	“ D’you think ... could this have anything to do with ... maybe Mr. Crouch thinks there ’s something going on ... ”
157713	157717	157719	157719	Moody	381	“ Like what ? ”
157756	157762	157763	157763	Harry	447	“ I do n’t know , ”
157766	157801	157763	157763	Harry	447	“ odd stuff ’s been happening lately , has n’t it ? It ’s been in the Daily Prophet ... the Dark Mark at the World Cup , and the Death Eaters and everything ... ”
157810	157819	157820	157820	he	381	“ You ’re a sharp boy , Potter , ”
157834	157843	157844	157844	he	381	“ Crouch could be thinking along those lines , ”
157848	157883	157844	157844	he	381	“ Very possible ... there have been some funny rumors flying around lately — helped along by Rita Skeeter , of course . It ’s making a lot of people nervous , I reckon . ”
157892	157902	157903	157903	he	381	“ Oh if there ’s one thing I hate , ”
157929	157939	157903	157903	he	381	“ it ’s a Death Eater who walked free ... ”
157955	157968	157970	157970	Moody	381	“ And now I want to ask you a question , Potter , ”
158061	158067	158059	158059	himself	447	“ Can I borrow this ? ”
158068	158071	158073	158073	Harry	447	“ Oh ! ”
158116	158121	158110	158110	he	447	“ Yeah , okay . ”
158122	158126	158128	158128	Moody	381	“ Good boy , ”
158130	158161	158128	158128	Moody	381	“ I can make good use of this ... this might be exactly what I ’ve been looking for ... Right , bed , Potter , come on , now ... ”
158214	158227	158206	158206	he	381	“ You ever thought of a career as an Auror , Potter ? ”
158228	158231	158233	158233	Harry	447	“ No , ”
158238	158245	158247	158247	Moody	381	“ You want to consider it , ”
158256	158279	158247	158247	Moody	381	“ Yes , indeed ... and incidentally ... I ’m guessing you were n’t just taking that egg for a walk tonight ? ”
158280	158285	158287	158287	Harry	447	“ Er — no , ”
158291	158300	158287	158287	Harry	447	“ I ’ve been working out the clue . ”
158313	158332	158301	158301	Moody	381	“ Nothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas , Potter ... See you in the morning ... ”
158491	158496	158480	158480	You	3597	” said Hermione indignantly . “
158502	158507	158508	158508	I	0	” said Harry crossly . “
158523	158648	158508	158508	I	0	” He , Ron , and Hermione were sitting at the very back of the Charms class with a table to themselves . They were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the Summoning Charm today — the Banishing Charm . Owing to the potential for nasty accidents when objects kept flying across the room , Professor Flitwick had given each student a stack of cushions on which to practice , the theory being that these would n’t hurt anyone if they went off target . It was a good theory , but it was n’t working very well . Neville ’s aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room — Professor Flitwick , for instance . “
158660	158680	158508	158508	I	0	” Harry hissed as Professor Flitwick went whizzing resignedly past them , landing on top of a large cabinet . “
158692	158737	158738	158738	Snape	357	” This class was an ideal cover for a private conversation , as everyone was having far too much fun to pay them any attention . Harry had been recounting his adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour . “
158748	158782	158738	158738	Snape	357	” Ron whispered , his eyes alight with interest as he Banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand ( it soared into the air and knocked Parvati ’s hat off ) . “
158801	158802	158787	158787	Moody	381	” “
158824	158851	158852	158852	Moody	381	” said Harry , waving his wand without paying much attention , so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk . “
158871	158872	158861	158861	he	187	” “
158875	158905	158906	158906	Harry	447	” said Ron , his eyes widening , his next cushion spinning high into the air , ricocheting off the chandelier , and dropping heavily onto Flitwick ’s desk . “
158921	158922	158911	158911	Snape	357	” “
158926	158935	158924	158924	Ron	188	” said Hermione , shaking her head skeptically , “
158959	159061	158950	158950	he	357	” She Banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they were all supposed to be aiming at . Harry looked at Hermione , thinking ... it was true that Snape had saved his life once , but the odd thing was , Snape definitely loathed him , just as he ’d loathed Harry ’s father when they had been at school together . Snape loved taking points from Harry , and had certainly never missed an opportunity to give him punishments , or even to suggest that he should be suspended from the school . “
159070	159075	159067	159067	Moody	381	” Hermione went on . “
159120	159121	159115	159115	Snape	357	” “
159125	159130	159115	159115	Snape	357	” said Ron promptly . “
159149	159150	159140	159142	Dark wizard catchers	3604	” “
159161	159168	159153	159154	Mr. Crouch	219	” said Hermione , ignoring Ron . “
159208	159209	159210	159210	You	178	” “
159223	159235	159221	159221	Winky	278	” said Ron , sending a cushion soaring into the window . “
159247	159260	159261	159261	I	0	” said Hermione , sending her cushion zooming neatly into the box . “
159282	159490	159267	159267	Snape	357	” said Harry grimly , and his cushion , to his very great surprise , flew straight across the room and landed neatly on top of Hermione ’s . Obedient to Sirius ’s wish of hearing about anything odd at Hogwarts , Harry sent him a letter by brown owl that night , explaining all about Mr. Crouch breaking into Snape ’s office , and Moody and Snape ’s conversation . Then Harry turned his attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing him : how to survive underwater for an hour on the twenty - fourth of February . Ron quite liked the idea of using the Summoning Charm again — Harry had explained about Aqua - Lungs , and Ron could n’t see why Harry should n’t Summon one from the nearest Muggle town . Hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that , in the unlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to operate an Aqua - Lung within the set limit of an hour , he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy — it was too much to hope that no Muggles would spot an Aqua - Lung zooming across the countryside to Hogwarts . “
159510	159514	159500	159500	you	3606	” Hermione said . “
159552	159553	159525	159525	I	0	” “
159571	159575	159576	159576	I	0	” said Harry . “
159595	159596	159588	159588	he	872	” “
159616	159621	159601	159601	he	872	” said Hermione seriously . “
159635	159970	159624	159624	I	0	” So Harry , thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to last him a lifetime , buried himself once more among the dusty volumes , looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen . However , though he , Ron , and Hermione searched through their lunchtimes , evenings , and whole weekends — though Harry asked Professor McGonagall for a note of permission to use the Restricted Section , and even asked the irritable , vulture - like librarian , Madam Pince , for help — they found nothing whatsoever that would enable Harry to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale . Familiar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb Harry now , and he was finding it difficult to concentrate in class again . The lake , which Harry had always taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds , drew his eyes whenever he was near a classroom window , a great , iron - gray mass of chilly water , whose dark and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon . Just as it had before he faced the Horntail , time was slipping away as though somebody had bewitched the clocks to go extra - fast . There was a week to go before February the twenty - fourth ( there was still time ) ... there were five days to go ( he was bound to find something soon ) ... three days to go ( please let me find something ... please ) ... With two days left , Harry started to go off food again . The only good thing about breakfast on Monday was the return of the brown owl he had sent to Sirius . He pulled off the parchment , unrolled it , and saw the shortest letter Sirius had ever written to him . Send date of next Hogsmeade weekend by return owl .
159993	159998	160000	160000	Hermione	178	“ Weekend after next , ”
160012	160026	160000	160000	Hermione	178	“ Here — take my quill and send this owl back straight away . ”
160092	160106	160108	160108	Ron	188	“ What ’s he want to know about the next Hogsmeade weekend for ? ”
160110	160113	160115	160115	Harry	447	“ Dunno , ”
160135	160144	160115	160115	Harry	447	“ Come on ... Care of Magical Creatures . ”
160291	160299	160300	160300	Hagrid	198	“ Easier ter spot than the adults , ”
160305	160389	160300	160300	Hagrid	198	“ They turn silver when they ’re abou ’ two years old , an ’ they grow horns at aroun ’ four . Don ’ go pure white till they ’re full grown , ’ round about seven . They ’re a bit more trustin ’ when they ’re babies ... don ’ mind boys so much ... C’m on , move in a bit , yeh can pat ’em if yeh want ... give ’em a few o ’ these sugar lumps ... “
160395	160414	160393	160393	Harry	447	” Hagrid muttered , moving aside slightly , while most of the others swarmed around the baby unicorns . “
160417	160421	160393	160393	Harry	447	” said Harry . “
160428	160432	160393	160393	Harry	447	” said Hagrid . “
160435	160439	160440	160440	Harry	447	” said Harry . “
160442	160464	160440	160440	Harry	447	” said Hagrid , clapping a massive hand on his shoulder , so that Harry ’s knees buckled under its weight , “
160518	160593	160516	160516	yeh	3614	” Harry nodded , but even as he did so , an insane urge to confess that he did n’t have any idea how to survive at the bottom of the lake for an hour came over him . He looked up at Hagrid — perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes , to deal with the creatures in it ? He looked after everything else on the grounds , after all — “
160599	160625	160626	160626	I	0	” Hagrid growled , patting Harry ’s shoulder again , so that Harry actually felt himself sink a couple of inches into the soft ground . “
160642	160838	160640	160640	Harry	447	” Harry just could n’t bring himself to wipe the happy , confident smile off Hagrid ’s face . Pretending he was interested in the young unicorns , he forced a smile in return , and moved forward to pat them with the others . By the evening before the second task , Harry felt as though he were trapped in a nightmare . He was fully aware that even if , by some miracle , he managed to find a suitable spell , he ’d have a real job mastering it overnight . How could he have let this happen ? Why had n’t he got to work on the egg ’s clue sooner ? Why had he ever let his mind wander in class — what if a teacher had once mentioned how to breathe underwater ? He sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the sun set outside , tearing feverishly through page after page of spells , hidden from one another by the massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them . Harry ’s heart gave a huge leap every time he saw the word “
160840	160853	160626	160626	I	0	” on a page , but more often than not it was merely “
160872	160873	160626	160626	I	0	” “
160883	160897	160874	160874	I	0	” said Ron ’s voice flatly from the other side of the table . “
160931	160932	160874	160874	I	0	” “
160938	160978	160979	160979	They	3618	” Hermione muttered , moving a candle closer to her . Her eyes were so tired she was poring over the tiny print of Olde and Forgotten Bewitchments and Charmes with her nose about an inch from the page . “
160990	160991	160992	160992	They	3618	” “
160995	160999	160992	160992	They	3618	” said Ron . “
161044	161045	161038	161038	you	447	” “
161054	161059	161038	161038	you	447	” Hermione said crossly . “
161066	161094	161038	161038	you	447	” She seemed to be taking the library ’s lack of useful information on the subject as a personal insult ; it had never failed her before . “
161103	161118	161038	161038	you	447	” said Harry , resting , facedown , on Saucy Tricks for Tricky Sorts . “
161130	161143	161128	161128	Sirius	195	” An Animagus was a wizard who could transform into an animal . “
161158	161162	161128	161128	Sirius	195	” said Ron . “
161167	161175	161128	161128	Sirius	195	” yawned Harry . He was exhausted . “
161194	161212	161213	161214	Professor McGonagall	343	” said Hermione vaguely , now squinting down the index of Weird Wizarding Dilemmas and Their Solutions . “
161250	161251	161252	161252	Hermione	178	” “
161258	161263	161254	161254	I	0	” said Harry wearily . “
161281	161282	161252	161252	Hermione	178	” “
161289	161299	161252	161252	Hermione	178	” Hermione said , snapping shut Weird Wizarding Dilemmas . “
161313	161314	161315	161315	I	0	” “
161320	161327	161315	161315	I	0	” said Fred Weasley ’s voice . “
161337	161358	161315	161315	I	0	” Harry , Ron , and Hermione looked up . Fred and George had just emerged from behind some bookshelves . “
161366	161370	161361	161361	you	3626	” Ron asked . “
161375	161379	161361	161361	you	3626	” said George . “
161391	161392	161387	161387	you	3626	” “
161395	161402	161405	161405	she	343	” said Hermione , looking surprised . “
161414	161418	161405	161405	she	343	” said Fred . “
161430	161483	161419	161419	We	3626	” said George . Ron and Hermione stared at Harry , who felt his stomach drop . Was Professor McGonagall about to tell Ron and Hermione off ? Perhaps she ’d noticed how much they were helping him , when he ought to be working out how to do the task alone ? “
161494	161514	161484	161484	We	3626	” Hermione told Harry as she got up to go with Ron — both of them looked very anxious . “
161527	161528	161484	161484	We	3626	” “
161531	161840	161484	161484	We	3626	” said Harry uneasily . By eight o’clock , Madam Pince had extinguished all the lamps and came to chivvy Harry out of the library . Staggering under the weight of as many books as he could carry , Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room , pulled a table into a corner , and continued to search . There was nothing in Madcap Magic for Wacky Warlocks ... nothing in A Guide to Medieval Sorcery ... not one mention of underwater exploits in An Anthology of Eighteenth - Century Charms , or in Dreadful Denizens of the Deep , or Powers You Never Knew You Had and What to Do with Them Now You ’ve Wised Up . Crookshanks crawled into Harry ’s lap and curled up , purring deeply . The common room emptied slowly around Harry . People kept wishing him luck for the next morning in cheery , confident voices like Hagrid ’s , all of them apparently convinced that he was about to pull off another stunning performance like the one he had managed in the first task . Harry could n’t answer them , he just nodded , feeling as though there were a golf ball stuck in his throat . By ten to midnight , he was alone in the room with Crookshanks . He had searched all the remaining books , and Ron and Hermione had not come back . It ’s over , he told himself . You ca n’t do it . You ’ll just have to go down to the lake in the morning and tell the judges ... He imagined himself explaining that he could n’t do the task . He pictured Bagman ’s look of round - eyed surprise , Karkaroff ’s satisfied , yellow - toothed smile . He could almost hear Fleur Delacour saying “
161858	161960	161961	161961	Lumos	312	” He saw Malfoy flashing his POTTER STINKS badge at the front of the crowd , saw Hagrid ’s crestfallen , disbelieving face ... Forgetting that Crookshanks was on his lap , Harry stood up very suddenly ; Crookshanks hissed angrily as he landed on the floor , gave Harry a disgusted look , and stalked away with his bottlebrush tail in the air , but Harry was already hurrying up the spiral staircase to his dormitory ... He would grab the Invisibility Cloak and go back to the library , he ’d stay there all night if he had to ... “
161963	162133	161961	161961	Lumos	312	” Harry whispered fifteen minutes later as he opened the library door . Wand - tip alight , he crept along the bookshelves , pulling down more books — books of hexes and charms , books on merpeople and water monsters , books on famous witches and wizards , on magical inventions , on anything at all that might include one passing reference to underwater survival . He carried them over to a table , then set to work , searching them by the narrow beam of his wand , occasionally checking his watch ... One in the morning ... two in the morning ... the only way he could keep going was to tell himself , over and over again , next book ... in the next one ... the next one ... The mermaid in the painting in the prefects ’ bathroom was laughing . Harry was bobbing like a cork in bubbly water next to her rock , while she held his Firebolt over his head . “
162139	162144	161961	161961	Lumos	312	” she giggled maliciously . “
162150	162151	162152	162152	I	0	” “
162156	162171	162152	162152	I	0	” Harry panted , snatching at the Firebolt , and struggling not to sink . “
162177	162198	162152	162152	I	0	” But she just poked him painfully in the side with the end of the broomstick , laughing at him . “
162207	162208	162152	162152	I	0	” “
162217	162218	162215	162215	sir	5372	” “
162223	162224	162215	162215	sir	5372	” “
162238	162301	162231	162231	sir	5372	” Harry opened his eyes . He was still in the library ; the Invisibility Cloak had slipped off his head as he ’d slept , and the side of his face was stuck to the pages of Where There ’s a Wand , There ’s a Way . He sat up , straightening his glasses , blinking in the bright daylight . “
162308	162312	162231	162231	sir	5372	” squeaked Dobby . “
162325	162326	162322	162323	Harry Potter	447	” “
162330	162334	162322	162323	Harry Potter	447	” Harry croaked . “
162340	162374	162322	162323	Harry Potter	447	” He looked down at his watch . Dobby was right . It was twenty past nine . A large , dead weight seemed to fall through Harry ’s chest into his stomach . “
162380	162390	162391	162391	You	447	” squeaked Dobby , plucking at Harry ’s sleeve . “
162407	162408	162405	162405	sir	5372	” “
162416	162421	162414	162414	Dobby	466	” Harry said hopelessly . “
162435	162436	162429	162429	I	0	” “
162444	162449	162450	162450	Dobby	466	” squeaked the elf . “
162467	162468	162461	162461	Dobby	466	” “
162471	162475	162461	162461	Dobby	466	” said Harry . “
162487	162488	162489	162489	Dobby	466	” “
162507	162508	162494	162495	Harry Potter	447	” “
162513	162514	162494	162495	Harry Potter	447	” “
162525	162526	162522	162523	the merpeople	3542	” “
162532	162533	162534	162534	Your	466	” “
162550	162566	162539	162540	your Wheezy	3641	” Dobby plucked at the shrunken maroon sweater he was now wearing over his shorts . “
162569	162573	162539	162540	your Wheezy	3641	” Harry gasped . “
162583	162584	162578	162578	they	3542	” “
162595	162599	162647	162647	Dobby	466	” squeaked Dobby . “
162607	162608	162647	162647	Dobby	466	” “
162617	162631	162647	162647	Dobby	466	” Harry recited , staring , horror - struck , at the elf . “
162656	162657	162647	162647	Dobby	466	” “
162666	162699	162658	162658	You	5372	” squeaked the elf , and he put his hand in the pocket of his shorts and drew out a ball of what looked like slimy , grayish - green rat tails . “
162712	162713	162658	162658	You	5372	” “
162719	162728	162658	162658	You	5372	” said Harry , staring at the gillyweed . “
162739	162740	162741	162741	Dobby	466	” “
162743	162748	162741	162741	Dobby	466	” said Harry frantically , “
162757	162771	162752	162752	you	466	” He could n’t quite forget that the last time Dobby had tried to “
162773	162788	162789	162789	Dobby	466	” him , he had ended up with no bones in his right arm . “
162796	162802	162789	162789	Dobby	466	” said the elf earnestly . “
162859	162905	162856	162856	his	447	” Harry ’s doubts vanished . Jumping to his feet he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak , stuffed it into his bag , grabbed the gillyweed , and put it into his pocket , then tore out of the library with Dobby at his heels . “
162917	162927	162915	162915	sir	5372	” Dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor . “
162944	162945	162915	162915	sir	5372	” “
162952	163139	162950	162950	Dobby	466	” Harry shouted , and he sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs , three at a time . The entrance hall contained a few last - minute stragglers , all leaving the Great Hall after breakfast and heading through the double oak doors to watch the second task . They stared as Harry flashed past , sending Colin and Dennis Creevey flying as he leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright , chilly grounds . As he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats that had encircled the dragons ’ enclosure in November were now ranged along the opposite bank , rising in stands that were packed to the bursting point and reflected in the lake below . The excited babble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water as Harry ran flat - out around the other side of the lake toward the judges , who were sitting at another gold - draped table at the water ’s edge . Cedric , Fleur , and Krum were beside the judges ’ table , watching Harry sprint toward them . “
163145	163163	163140	163140	I	0	” Harry panted , skidding to a halt in the mud and accidentally splattering Fleur ’s robes . “
163169	163177	163140	163140	I	0	” said a bossy , disapproving voice . “
163185	163209	163140	163140	I	0	” Harry looked around . Percy Weasley was sitting at the judges ’ table — Mr. Crouch had failed to turn up again . “
163216	163230	163214	163214	Percy	206	” said Ludo Bagman , who was looking intensely relieved to see Harry . “
163237	163368	163372	163372	Harry	447	” Dumbledore smiled at Harry , but Karkaroff and Madame Maxime did n’t look at all pleased to see him ... It was obvious from the looks on their faces that they had thought he was n’t going to turn up . Harry bent over , hands on his knees , gasping for breath ; he had a stitch in his side that felt as though he had a knife between his ribs , but there was no time to get rid of it ; Ludo Bagman was now moving among the champions , spacing them along the bank at intervals of ten feet . Harry was on the very end of the line , next to Krum , who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding his wand ready . “
163374	163389	163372	163372	Harry	447	” Bagman whispered as he moved Harry a few feet farther away from Krum . “
163398	163399	163392	163392	you	447	” “
163402	163444	163445	163445	Sonorus	505	” Harry panted , massaging his ribs . Bagman gave Harry ’s shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges ’ table ; he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done at the World Cup , said , “
163447	163461	163445	163445	Sonorus	505	” and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands . “
163509	164366	163445	163445	Sonorus	505	” The whistle echoed shrilly in the cold , still air ; the stands erupted with cheers and applause ; without looking to see what the other champions were doing , Harry pulled off his shoes and socks , pulled the handful of gillyweed out of his pocket , stuffed it into his mouth , and waded out into the lake . It was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as though this were fire , not icy water . His sodden robes weighed him down as he walked in deeper ; now the water was over his knees , and his rapidly numbing feet were slipping over silt and flat , slimy stones . He was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he could ; it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery , like octopus tentacles . Waist - deep in the freezing water he stopped , swallowed , and waited for something to happen . He could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he must look stupid , walking into the lake without showing any sign of magical power . The part of him that was still dry was covered in goose pimples ; half immersed in the icy water , a cruel breeze lifting his hair , Harry started to shiver violently . He avoided looking at the stands ; the laughter was becoming louder , and there were catcalls and jeering from the Slytherins ... Then , quite suddenly , Harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been pressed over his mouth and nose . He tried to draw breath , but it made his head spin ; his lungs were empty , and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of his neck — Harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below his ears , flapping in the cold air ... He had gills . Without pausing to think , he did the only thing that made sense — he flung himself forward into the water . The first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life . His head had stopped spinning ; he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills , sending oxygen back to his brain . He stretched out his hands in front of him and stared at them . They looked green and ghostly under the water , and they had become webbed . He twisted around and looked at his bare feet — they had become elongated and the toes were webbed too : It looked as though he had sprouted flippers . The water did n’t feel icy anymore either ... on the contrary , he felt pleasantly cool and very light ... Harry struck out once more , marveling at how far and fast his flipper - like feet propelled him through the water , and noticing how clearly he could see , and how he no longer seemed to need to blink . He had soon swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see the bottom . He flipped over and dived into its depths . Silence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange , dark , foggy landscape . He could only see ten feet around him , so that as he sped through the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the oncoming darkness : forests of rippling , tangled black weed , wide plains of mud littered with dull , glimmering stones . He swam deeper and deeper , out toward the middle of the lake , his eyes wide , staring through the eerily gray - lit water around him to the shadows beyond , where the water became opaque . Small fish flickered past him like silver darts . Once or twice he thought he saw something larger moving ahead of him , but when he got nearer , he discovered it to be nothing but a large , blackened log , or a dense clump of weed . There was no sign of any of the other champions , merpeople , Ron — nor , thankfully , the giant squid . Light green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see , two feet deep , like a meadow of very overgrown grass . Harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him , trying to discern shapes through the gloom ... and then , without warning , something grabbed hold of his ankle . Harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow , a small , horned water demon , poking out of the weed , its long fingers clutched tightly around Harry ’s leg , its pointed fangs bared — Harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand . By the time he had grasped it , two more grindylows had risen out of the weed , had seized handfuls of Harry ’s robes , and were attempting to drag him down . “
164369	164585	163445	163445	Sonorus	505	” Harry shouted , except that no sound came out ... A large bubble issued from his mouth , and his wand , instead of sending sparks at the grindylows , pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water , for where it struck them , angry red patches appeared on their green skin . Harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylow ’s grip and swam , as fast as he could , occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random ; every now and then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again , and he kicked out , hard ; finally , he felt his foot connect with a horned skull , and looking back , saw the dazed grindylow floating away , cross - eyed , while its fellows shook their fists at Harry and sank back into the weed . Harry slowed down a little , slipped his wand back inside his robes , and looked around , listening again . He turned full circle in the water , the silence pressing harder than ever against his eardrums . He knew he must be even deeper in the lake now , but nothing was moving but the rippling weed . “
164592	164626	164627	164627	Myrtle	474	” Harry thought he was having a heart attack . He whipped around and saw Moaning Myrtle floating hazily in front of him , gazing at him through her thick , pearly glasses . “
164629	164656	164627	164627	Myrtle	474	” Harry tried to shout — but once again , nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble . Moaning Myrtle actually giggled . “
164664	164670	164627	164627	Myrtle	474	” she said , pointing . “
164695	164779	164685	164685	they	3658	” Harry gave her the thumbs - up to show his thanks and set off once more , careful to swim a bit higher over the weed to avoid any more grindylows that might be lurking there . He swam on for what felt like at least twenty minutes . He was passing over vast expanses of black mud now , which swirled murkily as he disturbed the water . Then , at long last , he heard a snatch of haunting mersong . “
164796	164796	164783	164783	you	3657	”
164846	164868	164835	164835	Harry	447	“ . . . your time ’s half gone , so tarry not Lest what you seek stays here to rot ... ”
165353	165359	165360	165360	he	3687	“ We do not help , ”
165369	165373	165374	165374	Harry	447	“ Come ON ! ”
165574	165581	165582	165584	one of them	1203	“ You take your own hostage , ”
165589	165594	165582	165584	one of them	1203	“ Leave the others ... ”
165595	165599	165601	165601	Harry	447	“ No way ! ”
165612	165626	165601	165601	Harry	447	“ Your task is to retrieve your own friend ... leave the others ... ”
165627	165634	165635	165635	Harry	447	“ She ’s my friend too ! ”
165652	165663	165664	165664	Cho	258	“ And I do n’t want them to die either ! ”
165805	165809	165810	165810	he	238	“ Got lost ! ”
165818	165825	165810	165810	he	238	“ Fleur and Krum’re coming now ! ”
166125	166132	166119	166119	Harry	447	“ Get out of the way ! ”
166213	166220	166221	166221	Harry	447	“ You ’ve got until three ! ”
166247	166250	166252	166252	he	447	“ One ... ”
166258	166261	166263	166263	he	447	“ two ... ”
166778	166787	166756	166756	Ron	188	“ Wet , this , is n’t it ? ”
166795	166803	166789	166789	he	447	“ What did you bring her for ? ”
166804	166817	166818	166818	Harry	447	“ Fleur did n’t turn up , I could n’t leave her , ”
166821	166827	166829	166829	Ron	188	“ Harry , you prat , ”
166831	166854	166829	166829	Ron	188	“ you did n’t take that song thing seriously , did you ? Dumbledore would n’t have let any of us drown ! ”
166855	166860	166789	166789	he	447	“ The song said — ”
166861	166876	166878	166878	Ron	188	“ It was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit ! ”
166880	166894	166878	166878	Ron	188	“ I hope you did n’t waste time down there acting the hero ! ”
166943	166947	166948	166948	Harry	447	“ C’m on , ”
166952	166968	166948	166948	Harry	447	“ help me with her , I do n’t think she can swim very well . ”
167093	167107	167075	167076	Fleur Delacour	428	“ Gabrielle ! Gabrielle ! Is she alive ? Is she ’ urt ? ”
167108	167113	167114	167114	Harry	447	“ She ’s fine ! ”
167146	167156	167134	167134	Percy	206	“ Gerroff , Percy , I ’m all right ! ”
167180	167199	167167	167167	Fleur	428	“ It was ze grindylows ... zey attacked me ... oh Gabrielle , I thought ... I thought ... ”
167200	167206	167208	167209	Madam Pomfrey	323	“ Come here , you , ”
167261	167267	167268	167268	Hermione	178	“ Harry , well done ! ”
167271	167284	167268	167268	Hermione	178	“ You did it , you found out how all by yourself ! ”
167285	167288	167290	167290	Harry	447	“ Well — ”
167345	167352	167354	167354	Harry	447	“ Yeah , that ’s right , ”
167367	167383	167385	167385	Krum	225	“ You haff a water beetle in your hair , Herm - own - ninny , ”
167425	167447	167416	167416	Hermione	178	“ You ’re well outside the time limit , though , Harry ... Did it take you ages to find us ? ”
167448	167456	167457	167457	Harry	447	“ No ... I found you okay ... ”
167607	167619	167594	167594	he	187	“ A conference before we give the marks , I think . ”
167700	167705	167706	167706	she	323	“ Look after Gabrielle , ”
167717	167723	167724	167724	she	323	“ You saved ’ er , ”
167728	167738	167724	167724	she	323	“ Even though she was not your ’ ostage . ”
167739	167742	167744	167744	Harry	447	“ Yeah , ”
167800	167809	167798	167798	Ron	188	“ And you too — you ’ elped — ”
167810	167813	167815	167815	Ron	188	“ Yeah , ”
167821	167827	167815	167815	Ron	188	“ yeah , a bit — ”
167875	167921	167922	167923	Fleur Delacour	428	“ Ladies and gentlemen , we have reached our decision . Merchieftainess Murcus has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake , and we have therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions , as follows ... “
167962	167968	167954	167954	We	3758	” Applause from the stands . “
167973	167983	167984	167985	Cedric Diggory	238	” said Fleur throatily , shaking her magnificent head . “
168017	168036	168005	168005	he	238	” Enormous cheers from the Hufflepuffs in the crowd ; Harry saw Cho give Cedric a glowing look . “
168046	168067	168005	168005	he	238	” Harry ’s heart sank . If Cedric had been outside the time limit , he most certainly had been . “
168097	168107	168091	168091	We	3758	” Karkaroff clapped particularly hard , looking very superior . “
168116	168120	168121	168121	He	447	” Bagman continued . “
168175	168191	168194	168195	the judges	6019	” Ron and Hermione both gave Harry half - exasperated , half - commiserating looks . “
168197	168209	168194	168195	the judges	6019	” and here , Bagman gave Karkaroff a very nasty look , “
168233	168274	168223	168224	Mr. Potter	447	” Harry ’s stomach leapt — he was now tying for first place with Cedric . Ron and Hermione , caught by surprise , stared at Harry , then laughed and started applauding hard with the rest of the crowd . “
168281	168288	168276	168276	you	447	” Ron shouted over the noise . “
168303	168339	168276	168276	you	447	” Fleur was clapping very hard too , but Krum did n’t look happy at all . He attempted to engage Hermione in conversation again , but she was too busy cheering Harry to listen . “
168358	168362	168363	168364	The champions	6016	” continued Bagman . “
168387	168477	168381	168381	your	3765	” It was over , Harry thought dazedly , as Madam Pomfrey began herding the champions and hostages back to the castle to get into dry clothes ... it was over , he had got through ... he did n’t have to worry about anything now until June the twenty - fourth ... Next time he was in Hogsmeade , Harry decided as he walked back up the stone steps into the castle , he was going to buy Dobby a pair of socks for every day of the year .
168632	168643	168644	168644	he	447	“ But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve , ”
168683	168697	168660	168660	he	188	“ I could ’ve taken those mer - idiots any time I wanted . ”
168698	168710	168712	168712	Hermione	178	“ What were you going to do , snore at them ? ”
168902	168911	168913	168913	Ron	188	“ He has n’t come back to Hogsmeade ? ”
168916	168926	168928	168928	Hermione	178	“ It looks like it , does n’t it ? ”
168930	168937	168939	168939	Harry	447	“ I ca n’t believe him , ”
168942	168948	168939	168939	Harry	447	“ if he ’s caught ... ”
168949	168961	168963	168963	Ron	188	“ Made it so far , though , has n’t he ? ”
168965	168979	168963	168963	Ron	188	“ And it ’s not like the place is swarming with dementors anymore . ”
169093	169102	169103	169103	she	443	“ There they are , there they are ! ”
169155	169168	169169	169169	Pansy	443	“ You might find something to interest you in there , Granger ! ”
169461	169471	169430	169430	Krum	225	“ never felt this way about any other girl . ”
169493	169499	169501	169502	Pansy Parkinson	443	“ She ’s really ugly , ”
169513	169541	169501	169502	Pansy Parkinson	443	“ but she ’d be well up to making a Love Potion , she ’s quite brainy . I think that ’s how she ’s doing it . ”
169591	169596	169597	169597	Ron	188	“ I told you ! ”
169609	169634	169597	169597	Ron	188	“ I told you not to annoy Rita Skeeter ! She ’s made you out to be some sort of — of scarlet woman ! ”
169644	169648	169649	169649	she	178	“ Scarlet woman ? ”
169663	169672	169673	169673	Ron	188	“ It ’s what my mum calls them , ”
169681	169697	169705	169705	she	178	“ If that ’s the best Rita can do , she ’s losing her touch , ”
169716	169724	169725	169725	She	178	“ What a pile of old rubbish . ”
169785	169793	169795	169795	Hermione	178	“ There ’s something funny , though , ”
169811	169820	169795	169795	Hermione	178	“ How could Rita Skeeter have known ... ? ”
169821	169825	169827	169827	Ron	188	“ Known what ? ”
169830	169843	169827	169827	Ron	188	“ You have n’t been mixing up Love Potions , have you ? ”
169844	169850	169851	169851	Hermione	178	“ Do n’t be stupid , ”
169862	169883	169851	169851	Hermione	178	“ No , it ’s just ... how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer ? ”
169898	169901	169903	169903	Ron	188	“ What ? ”
169913	169928	169929	169929	Hermione	178	“ He asked me right after he ’d pulled me out of the lake , ”
169932	169986	169929	169929	Hermione	178	“ After he ’d got rid of his shark ’s head . Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they would n’t hear , and he said , if I was n’t doing anything over the summer , would I like to — ”
169987	169994	169996	169996	Ron	188	“ And what did you say ? ”
170027	170043	170021	170021	he	188	“ And he did say he ’d never felt the same way about anyone else , ”
170063	170102	170061	170061	her	178	“ but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him ? She was n’t there ... or was she ? Maybe she has got an Invisibility Cloak ; maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task ... ”
170103	170110	170111	170111	Ron	188	“ And what did you say ? ”
170126	170142	170111	170111	Ron	188	“ Well , I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were okay to — ”
170143	170155	170190	170190	Snape	357	“ Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is , Miss Granger , ”
170171	170189	170190	170190	Snape	357	“ I must ask you not to discuss it in my class . Ten points from Gryffindor . ”
170226	170237	170238	170238	Snape	357	“ Ah ... reading magazines under the table as well ? ”
170249	170262	170238	170238	Snape	357	“ A further ten points from Gryffindor ... oh but of course ... ”
170277	170288	170263	170263	Snape	357	“ Potter has to keep up with his press cuttings ... ”
170321	170352	170313	170313	he	357	“ ‘ Harry Potter ’s Secret Heartache ’ ... dear , dear , Potter , what ’s ailing you now ? ‘ A boy like no other , perhaps ... ’ ”
170395	170425	170427	170427	Snape	357	“ ‘ ... Harry Potter ’s well - wishers must hope that , next time , he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate . ’ How very touching , ”
170442	170503	170427	170427	Snape	357	“ Well , I think I had better separate the three of you , so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives . Weasley , you stay here . Miss Granger , over there , beside Miss Parkinson . Potter — that table in front of my desk . Move . Now . ”
170571	170587	170589	170589	Snape	357	“ All this press attention seems to have inflated your already overlarge head , Potter , ”
170646	170664	170665	170665	Snape	357	“ You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire Wizarding world is impressed with you , ”
170701	170738	170739	170739	Harry	447	“ but I do n’t care how many times your picture appears in the papers . To me , Potter , you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him . ”
170784	170794	170795	170795	Snape	357	“ So I give you fair warning , Potter , ”
170805	170825	170795	170795	Snape	357	“ pint - sized celebrity or not — if I catch you breaking into my office one more time — ”
170826	170836	170838	170838	Harry	447	“ I have n’t been anywhere near your office ! ”
170846	170853	170854	170854	Snape	357	“ Do n’t lie to me , ”
170866	170886	170854	170854	Snape	357	“ Boomslang skin . Gillyweed . Both come from my private stores , and I know who stole them . ”
170966	170977	170978	170978	Harry	447	“ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about , ”
170982	170997	170998	170998	Snape	357	“ You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into ! ”
171001	171044	170998	170998	Snape	357	“ I know it , Potter ! Now , Mad - Eye Moody might have joined your fan club , but I will not tolerate your behavior ! One more nighttime stroll into my office , Potter , and you will pay ! ”
171045	171048	171050	171050	Harry	447	“ Right , ”
171060	171078	171050	171050	Harry	447	“ I ’ll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go in there . ”
171138	171148	171149	171149	Snape	357	“ Do you know what this is , Potter ? ”
171158	171161	171163	171163	Harry	447	“ No , ”
171171	171198	171200	171200	Snape	357	“ It is Veritaserum — a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear , ”
171203	171234	171236	171236	he	357	“ Now , the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines . But unless you watch your step , you might just find that my hand slips ”
171243	171271	171272	171272	Harry	447	“ right over your evening pumpkin juice . And then , Potter ... then we ’ll find out whether you ’ve been in my office or not . ”
171441	171444	171446	171446	Snape	357	“ Enter , ”
171490	171496	171498	171498	Karkaroff	417	“ We need to talk , ”
171549	171561	171562	171562	Snape	357	“ I ’ll talk to you after my lesson , Karkaroff , ”
171570	171592	171566	171566	Karkaroff	417	“ I want to talk now , while you ca n’t slip off , Severus . You ’ve been avoiding me . ”
171593	171598	171599	171599	Snape	357	“ After the lesson , ”
171725	171731	171734	171734	Snape	357	“ What ’s so urgent ? ”
171739	171742	171744	171744	Karkaroff	417	“ This , ”
171778	171781	171783	171783	Karkaroff	417	“ Well ? ”
171795	171810	171783	171783	Karkaroff	417	“ Do you see ? It ’s never been this clear , never since — ”
171811	171816	171818	171818	Snape	357	“ Put it away ! ”
171827	171834	171820	171820	his	357	“ But you must have noticed — ”
171842	171850	171852	171852	Snape	357	“ We can talk later , Karkaroff ! ”
171854	171862	171852	171852	Snape	357	“ Potter ! What are you doing ? ”
171863	171872	171874	171874	Harry	447	“ Clearing up my armadillo bile , Professor , ”
172216	172221	172223	172223	Harry	447	“ Hello , Sirius , ”
172572	172575	172576	172576	he	195	“ Chicken ! ”
172613	172616	172618	172618	Sirius	195	“ Thanks , ”
172644	172669	172670	172670	He	195	“ I ’ve been living off rats mostly . Ca n’t steal too much food from Hogsmeade ; I ’d draw attention to myself . ”
172684	172693	172694	172694	he	447	“ What ’re you doing here , Sirius ? ”
172697	172704	172706	172706	Sirius	195	“ Fulfilling my duty as godfather , ”
172719	172735	172706	172706	Sirius	195	“ Do n’t worry about it , I ’m pretending to be a lovable stray . ”
172754	172809	172810	172810	He	195	“ I want to be on the spot . Your last letter ... well , let ’s just say things are getting fishier . I ’ve been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out , and by the looks of things , I ’m not the only one who ’s getting worried . ”
172841	172854	172831	172831	Harry	447	“ What if they catch you ? What if you ’re seen ? ”
172855	172873	172875	172875	Sirius	195	“ You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who know I ’m an Animagus , ”
172974	172985	172987	172987	Harry	447	“ They ’re making it sound like he ’s dying , ”
172990	173006	172987	172987	Harry	447	“ But he ca n’t be that ill if he managed to get up here ... ”
173007	173016	173017	173017	Ron	188	“ My brother ’s Crouch ’s personal assistant , ”
173021	173030	173017	173017	Ron	188	“ He says Crouch is suffering from overwork . ”
173031	173048	173050	173050	Harry	447	“ Mind you , he did look ill , last time I saw him up close , ”
173058	173069	173050	173050	Harry	447	“ The night my name came out of the goblet ... ”
173070	173082	173089	173089	her	178	“ Getting his comeuppance for sacking Winky , is n’t he ? ”
173106	173133	173092	173092	She	178	“ I bet he wishes he had n’t done it now — bet he feels the difference now she ’s not there to look after him . ”
173134	173143	173144	173144	Ron	188	“ Hermione ’s obsessed with house - elves , ”
173162	173170	173155	173155	Sirius	195	“ Crouch sacked his house - elf ? ”
173171	173180	173182	173182	Harry	447	“ Yeah , at the Quidditch World Cup , ”
173237	173244	173245	173245	he	195	“ Let me get this straight , ”
173257	173277	173245	173245	he	195	“ You first saw the elf in the Top Box . She was saving Crouch a seat , right ? ”
173278	173281	173283	173283	Harry	447	“ Right , ”
173291	173302	173332	173332	he	195	“ But Crouch did n’t turn up for the match ? ”
173303	173306	173308	173308	Harry	447	“ No , ”
173310	173321	173308	173308	Harry	447	“ I think he said he ’d been too busy . ”
173335	173354	173332	173332	he	195	“ Harry , did you check your pockets for your wand after you ’d left the Top Box ? ”
173355	173358	173359	173359	Harry	447	“ Erm ... ”
173363	173366	173367	173367	he	447	“ No , ”
173371	173406	173407	173407	He	447	“ I did n’t need to use it before we got in the forest . And then I put my hand in my pocket , and all that was in there were my Omnioculars . ”
173412	173428	173407	173407	He	447	“ Are you saying whoever conjured the Mark stole my wand in the Top Box ? ”
173429	173434	173436	173436	Sirius	195	“ It ’s possible , ”
173438	173446	173436	173436	Sirius	195	“ Winky did n’t steal that wand ! ”
173450	173462	173464	173464	Sirius	195	“ The elf was n’t the only one in that box , ”
173475	173483	173466	173466	his	195	“ Who else was sitting behind you ? ”
173484	173489	173491	173491	Harry	447	“ Loads of people , ”
173493	173504	173491	173491	Harry	447	“ Some Bulgarian ministers ... Cornelius Fudge ... the Malfoys ... ”
173505	173509	173511	173511	Ron	188	“ The Malfoys ! ”
173532	173540	173528	173528	his	196	“ I bet it was Lucius Malfoy ! ”
173541	173545	173547	173547	Sirius	195	“ Anyone else ? ”
173549	173553	173555	173555	Harry	447	“ No one , ”
173557	173568	173571	173571	him	447	“ Yes , there was , there was Ludo Bagman , ”
173573	173577	173571	173571	him	447	“ Oh yeah ... ”
173578	173598	173600	173600	Sirius	195	“ I do n’t know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps , ”
173605	173611	173600	173600	Sirius	195	“ What ’s he like ? ”
173612	173617	173619	173619	Harry	447	“ He ’s okay , ”
173621	173633	173619	173619	Harry	447	“ He keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard Tournament . ”
173634	173640	173642	173642	Sirius	195	“ Does he , now ? ”
173648	173657	173642	173642	Sirius	195	“ I wonder why he ’d do that ? ”
173658	173668	173670	173670	Harry	447	“ Says he ’s taken a liking to me , ”
173672	173675	173677	173677	Sirius	195	“ Hmm , ”
173682	173696	173699	173699	Sirius	195	“ We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared , ”
173701	173704	173705	173705	she	178	“ Remember ? ”
173712	173727	173729	173729	Ron	188	“ Yeah , but he did n’t stay in the forest , did he ? ”
173731	173748	173729	173729	Ron	188	“ The moment we told him about the riot , he went off to the campsite . ”
173749	173754	173755	173755	Hermione	178	“ How d’you know ? ”
173759	173768	173755	173755	Hermione	178	“ How d’you know where he Disapparated to ? ”
173769	173774	173776	173776	Ron	188	“ Come off it , ”
173779	173792	173776	173776	Ron	188	“ Are you saying you reckon Ludo Bagman conjured the Dark Mark ? ”
173793	173804	173806	173806	Hermione	178	“ It ’s more likely he did it than Winky , ”
173809	173813	173815	173815	Ron	188	“ Told you , ”
173822	173831	173815	173815	Ron	188	“ told you she ’s obsessed with house — ”
173842	173867	173833	173833	Sirius	195	“ When the Dark Mark had been conjured , and the elf had been discovered holding Harry ’s wand , what did Crouch do ? ”
173868	173876	173878	173878	Harry	447	“ Went to look in the bushes , ”
173880	173889	173878	173878	Harry	447	“ but there was n’t anyone else there . ”
173890	173894	173895	173895	Sirius	195	“ Of course , ”
173903	173926	173895	173895	Sirius	195	“ of course , he ’d want to pin it on anyone but his own elf ... and then he sacked her ? ”
173927	173930	173932	173932	Hermione	178	“ Yes , ”
173938	173958	173932	173932	Hermione	178	“ he sacked her , just because she had n’t stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled — ”
173959	173972	173974	173974	Ron	188	“ Hermione , will you give it a rest with the elf ! ”
173983	174024	173978	173978	his	195	“ She ’s got the measure of Crouch better than you have , Ron . If you want to know what a man ’s like , take a good look at how he treats his inferiors , not his equals . ”
174038	174123	174025	174025	He	195	“ All these absences of Barty Crouch ’s ... he goes to the trouble of making sure his house - elf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup , but does n’t bother to turn up and watch . He works very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament , and then stops coming to that too ... It ’s not like Crouch . If he ’s ever taken a day off work because of illness before this , I ’ll eat Buckbeak . ”
174124	174131	174133	174133	Harry	447	“ D’you know Crouch , then ? ”
174168	174176	174177	174177	he	195	“ Oh I know Crouch all right , ”
174181	174202	174177	174177	he	195	“ He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban — without a trial . ”
174203	174206	174208	174208	Ron	188	“ What ? ”
174213	174218	174220	174220	Harry	447	“ You ’re kidding ! ”
174222	174229	174231	174231	Sirius	195	“ No , I ’m not , ”
174240	174259	174231	174231	Sirius	195	“ Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement , did n’t you know ? ”
174270	174281	174283	174283	Sirius	195	“ He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic , ”
174285	174309	174310	174310	he	188	“ He ’s a great wizard , Barty Crouch , powerfully magical — and power - hungry . Oh never a Voldemort supporter , ”
174321	174360	174310	174310	he	188	“ No , Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against the Dark Side . But then a lot of people who were against the Dark Side ... well , you would n’t understand ... you ’re too young ... ”
174361	174373	174375	174375	Ron	188	“ That ’s what my dad said at the World Cup , ”
174386	174395	174383	174383	his	188	“ Try us , why do n’t you ? ”
174405	174414	174415	174415	He	188	“ All right , I ’ll try you ... ”
174429	174558	174415	174415	He	188	“ Imagine that Voldemort ’s powerful now . You do n’t know who his supporters are , you do n’t know who ’s working for him and who is n’t ; you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves . You ’re scared for yourself , and your family , and your friends . Every week , news comes of more deaths , more disappearances , more torturing ... the Ministry of Magic ’s in disarray , they do n’t know what to do , they ’re trying to keep everything hidden from the Muggles , but meanwhile , Muggles are dying too . Terror everywhere ... panic ... confusion ... that ’s how it used to be . “
174746	174751	174752	174752	Crouch	269	” Sirius smiled grimly . “
174788	174789	174776	174776	they	3873	” “
174796	174800	174776	174776	they	3873	” gasped Hermione . “
174803	174833	174776	174776	they	3873	” said Sirius , throwing his chicken bone to Buckbeak , flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread , and tearing it in half . “
174881	174892	174877	174877	his	269	” He began to wolf down large pieces of bread . “
174900	174904	174877	174877	his	269	” said Harry . “
174908	174917	174877	174877	his	269	” said Sirius , still stuffing down bread . “
174982	174983	174977	174980	the house - elf	1321	” “
174993	175010	175011	175011	Crouch	269	” Hermione whispered . Sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark . “
175127	175128	175129	175129	He	269	” “
175138	175143	175129	175129	He	269	” asked Harry quietly . “
175148	175161	175162	175162	I	0	” said Sirius , and he did n’t look remotely amused now . “
175233	175259	175227	175227	they	2090	” For a moment , the deadened look in Sirius ’s eyes became more pronounced than ever , as though shutters had closed behind them . “
175267	175271	175227	175227	they	2090	” Harry said . “
175274	175279	175227	175227	they	2090	” said Sirius dully . “
175300	175301	175302	175302	He	5057	” “
175305	175306	175307	175307	He	5057	” “
175314	175319	175307	175307	He	5057	” said Sirius bitterly . “
175447	175473	175443	175443	them	2090	” Sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and instead picked up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it . “
175490	175504	175483	175483	he	269	” he continued , wiping his mouth with the back of his hand . “
175616	175698	175699	175699	Moody	332	” There was a long silence . Harry was thinking of the way Crouch ’s eyes had bulged as he ’d looked down at his disobedient house - elf back in the wood at the Quidditch World Cup . This , then , must have been why Crouch had overreacted to Winky being found beneath the Dark Mark . It had brought back memories of his son , and the old scandal , and his fall from grace at the Ministry . “
175709	175714	175701	175701	Crouch	269	” Harry told Sirius . “
175731	175737	175717	175717	I	0	” said Sirius , nodding . “
175760	175761	175763	175763	he	269	” “
175773	175782	175763	175763	he	269	” said Ron triumphantly , looking at Hermione . “
175794	175798	175763	175763	he	269	” said Sirius . “
175804	175815	175763	175763	he	269	” said Ron excitedly , but Sirius shook his head . “
175855	175856	175858	175858	you	3925	” “
175869	175878	175858	175858	you	3925	” asked Harry , but Hermione broke in . “
175893	175894	175891	175891	Snape	357	” “
175903	175908	175901	175901	Hermione	178	” said Ron impatiently . “
175932	175933	175922	175926	a really clever Dark wizard	3928	” “
175957	175958	175951	175951	he	357	” “
175971	175972	175965	175965	Dumbledore	187	” “
175979	175993	175977	175977	Sirius	195	” Harry said loudly , and Ron and Hermione stopped bickering to listen . “
176003	176014	175996	175996	they	3930	” said Sirius , looking thoughtfully at Ron and Hermione . “
176063	176076	176060	176060	he	357	” Sirius added , and Harry and Ron grinned at each other . “
176113	176125	176126	176126	Rosier	521	” Sirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names . “
176233	176234	176235	176235	Snape	357	” “
176249	176253	176242	176242	he	357	” said Ron . “
176271	176276	176264	176264	Karkaroff	417	” said Harry quickly . “
176314	176315	176316	176316	He	417	” “
176324	176346	176316	176316	He	417	” said Sirius , looking frankly bewildered . He ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair , then shrugged again . “
176374	176389	176366	176366	he	417	” Sirius stared at the cave wall , then made a grimace of frustration . “
176434	176435	176432	176432	Voldemort	176	” “
176451	176456	176440	176440	Crouch	269	” said Ron stubbornly . “
176459	176464	176440	176440	Crouch	269	” said Sirius slowly , “
176647	176685	176686	176686	You	3953	” Sirius lapsed into silence , still staring at the cave wall . Buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky floor , looking for bones he might have overlooked . Finally , Sirius looked up at Ron . “
176709	176710	176711	176711	I	0	” “
176715	176720	176711	176711	I	0	” said Ron doubtfully . “
176742	176743	176738	176738	Percy	206	” “
176766	176780	176761	176761	you	3953	” said Sirius , gesturing to the second copy of the Daily Prophet . “
176788	176792	176795	176795	he	221	” said Harry . “

Here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head , before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village . Harry , Ron , and Hermione made their way back into Hogsmeade and up toward Hogwarts . “

181574	181599	181539	181539	Hermione	178	“ Moody says he did n’t see her anywhere near the judges ’ table at the second task , or anywhere near the lake ! ”
181600	181614	181616	181616	Ron	188	“ Hermione , is there any point in telling you to drop this ? ”
181618	181621	181623	181623	Hermione	178	“ No ! ”
181626	181649	181623	181623	Hermione	178	“ I want to know how she heard me talking to Viktor ! And how she found out about Hagrid ’s mum ! ”
181650	181657	181659	181659	Harry	447	“ Maybe she had you bugged , ”

181714	181720	181722	181722	Ron	188	“ What ’s the point ? ”
181724	181737	181722	181722	Ron	188	“ You know it by heart , we can just ask you . ”
181738	181810	181695	181695	Hermione	178	“ All those substitutes for magic Muggles use — electricity , computers , and radar , and all those things — they all go haywire around Hogwarts , there ’s too much magic in the air .

186546	186556	186539	186539	Hagrid	198	“ Maybe I ’d better stay here , Headmaster ... ”
186557	186568	186569	186569	Dumbledore	187	“ You will take Harry back to school , Hagrid , ”
186573	186618	186569	186569	Dumbledore	187	“ Take him right up to Gryffindor Tower . And Harry — I want you to stay there . Anything you might want to do — any owls you might want to send — they can wait until morning , do you understand me ? ”
186619	186624	186626	186626	Harry	447	“ Er — yes , ”
186661	186671	186672	186672	Hagrid	198	“ I ’ll leave Fang with yeh , Headmaster , ”
186698	186708	186709	186709	They	4117	“ Stay , Fang . C’m on , Harry . ”
186723	186728	186729	186729	Hagrid	198	“ How dare he , ”
186738	186786	186787	186787	Hagrid	198	“ How dare he accuse Dumbledore . Like Dumbledore’d do anythin ’ like that . Like Dumbledore wanted you in the tournament in the firs ’ place . Worried ! I dunno when I seen Dumbledore more worried than he ’s bin lately . An ’ you ! ”
186803	186852	186787	186787	Hagrid	198	“ What were yeh doin’ , wanderin ’ off with ruddy Krum ? He ’s from Durmstrang , Harry ! Coulda jinxed yeh right there , couldn ’ he ? Hasn ’ Moody taught yeh nothin’ ? ’ Magine lettin ’ him lure yeh off on yer own — ”
186853	186859	186861	186861	Harry	447	“ Krum ’s all right ! ”
186872	186889	186861	186861	Harry	447	“ He was n’t trying to jinx me , he just wanted to talk about Hermione — ”
186890	186905	186907	186907	Hagrid	198	“ I ’ll be havin’ a few words with her , an ’ all , ”
186915	186941	186907	186907	Hagrid	198	“ The less you lot ’ ave ter do with these foreigners , the happier yeh’ll be . Yeh can ’ trust any of ’em . ”
186942	186953	186954	186954	Harry	447	“ You were getting on all right with Madame Maxime , ”
186959	186970	186972	186972	Hagrid	198	“ Don ’ you talk ter me abou ’ her ! ”
186983	187028	186975	186975	he	198	“ I ’ve got her number now ! Tryin ’ ter get back in me good books , tryin ’ ter get me ter tell her what ’s comin ’ in the third task . Ha ! You can ’ trust any of ’em ! ”
187091	187099	187101	187102	Mr. Crouch	219	” said Hermione , rubbing her forehead . “
187119	187120	187114	187114	Viktor	225	” “
187127	187133	187125	187125	Crouch	219	” said Ron at once . “
187153	187154	187147	187147	He	219	” “
187161	187169	187170	187170	He	219	” said Harry , shaking his head . “
187187	187188	187189	187189	You	0	” “
187206	187210	187189	187189	You	0	” said Hermione . “
187220	187225	187226	187226	Krum	225	” said Ron excitedly . “
187241	187242	187239	187239	himself	219	” “
187251	187256	187249	187249	he	219	” said Hermione coldly . “
187260	187327	187249	187249	he	219	” It was daybreak . Harry , Ron , and Hermione had crept out of their dormitories very early and hurried up to the Owlery together to send a note to Sirius . Now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds . All three of them were puffy - eyed and pale because they had been talking late into the night about Mr. Crouch . “
187336	187340	187334	187334	Harry	447	” said Hermione . “
187348	187349	187343	187344	Mr. Crouch	219	” “
187362	187366	187367	187367	He	219	” said Harry . “
187405	187406	187400	187400	He	219	” “
187414	187419	187420	187420	He	219	” said Hermione testily . “
187427	187431	187420	187420	He	219	” said Harry . “
187460	187461	187448	187448	he	219	” “
187476	187481	187467	187467	he	219	” said Ron tentatively . “
187487	187492	187482	187482	I	0	” Harry repeated dully . “
187500	187515	187493	187493	He	219	” There was a pause . Then Ron said in a falsely confident voice , “
187537	187538	187539	187539	He	219	” “
187551	187565	187543	187543	he	219	” said Harry , and Ron winced at the sound of the name . “
187606	187657	187596	187596	He	219	” Harry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters . The many perches were half - empty ; every now and then , another owl would swoop in through one of the windows , returning from its night ’s hunting with a mouse in its beak . “
187666	187671	187659	187659	Snape	357	” Harry said bitterly , “
187708	187709	187699	187699	he	219	” “
187720	187725	187711	187711	he	219	” said Ron quickly . “
187755	187756	187746	187746	he	219	” “
187769	187773	187759	187759	he	219	” said Harry . “
187781	187785	187779	187779	him	219	” Ron muttered . “
187793	187797	187790	187791	Professor Moody	381	” said Hermione . “
187809	187810	187804	187804	he	219	” “
187827	187831	187812	187812	he	219	” said Harry . “
187840	187844	187833	187833	Crouch	219	” said Ron , “
187857	187858	187833	187833	Crouch	219	” “
187861	187888	187833	187833	Crouch	219	” said Hermione suddenly . Somebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery . Harry could hear two voices arguing , coming closer and closer . “
187908	187909	187833	187833	Crouch	219	” “
187940	187941	187927	187927	He	219	” “
187958	187959	187927	187927	He	219	” “
187979	188007	187977	187977	you	4142	” The Owlery door banged open . Fred and George came over the threshold , then froze at the sight of Harry , Ron , and Hermione . “
188014	188024	188010	188010	you	4142	” Ron and Fred said at the same time . “
188029	188037	188010	188010	you	4142	” said Harry and George in unison . “
188044	188053	187977	187977	you	4142	” said Hermione and Fred . Fred grinned . “
188073	188113	188067	188067	you	4142	” he said . He was holding a sealed envelope in his hands . Harry glanced at it , but Fred , whether accidentally or on purpose , shifted his hand so that the name on it was covered . “
188124	188143	188119	188119	us	4139	” Fred said , making a mock bow and pointing at the door . Ron did n’t move . “
188149	188174	188146	188146	you	4142	” he said . The grin vanished from Fred ’s face . Harry saw George half glance at Fred , before smiling at Ron . “
188185	188190	188180	188180	I	0	” he said easily . “
188197	188214	188215	188215	I	0	” said Ron . Fred and George looked at each other . Then Fred said abruptly , “
188245	188246	188240	188240	you	4142	” “
188257	188261	188252	188252	you	4142	” said Ron . “
188276	188277	188262	188262	George	193	” “
188285	188316	188281	188281	I	0	” said George . He walked over to Fred , pulled the letter out of his hands , and began attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl . “
188347	188348	188351	188351	I	0	” “
188355	188382	188351	188351	I	0	” said Ron hotly . George carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off . George turned around and grinned at Ron . “
188397	188416	188394	188394	you	4142	” He and Fred left the Owlery . Harry , Ron , and Hermione stared at one another . “
188431	188435	188421	188421	they	4148	” Hermione whispered . “
188441	188442	188437	188437	Crouch	219	” “
188445	188449	188437	188437	Crouch	219	” said Harry . “
188467	188476	188462	188462	They	4148	” Ron , however , was looking uncomfortable . “
188482	188487	188462	188462	They	4148	” Hermione asked him . “
188490	188495	188499	188499	they	4148	” said Ron slowly , “
188529	188530	188517	188517	I	0	” “
188536	188544	188531	188531	We	4151	” Harry finished the sentence for him . “
188550	188551	188569	188569	they	4148	” “
188562	188566	188569	188569	they	4148	” said Ron . “
188630	188637	188616	188616	Dad	189	” Hermione was looking uncomfortable now . “
188654	188655	188658	188658	they	4148	” “
188660	188667	188658	188658	they	4148	” said Ron , looking skeptical . “
188682	188683	188680	188680	they	4148	” “
188692	188699	188680	188680	they	4148	” said Hermione , looking scared . “
188728	188729	188731	188731	you	206	” “
188734	188738	188740	188740	Percy	206	” said Ron . “
188753	188772	188742	188742	He	206	” He stared at the window through which Fred and George ’s owl had departed , then said , “
188782	188783	188784	188784	D’you	4152	” “
188797	188808	188794	188795	Professor Moody	381	” Hermione said as they went down the spiral staircase . “
188811	188815	188794	188795	Professor Moody	381	” said Harry . “
188855	188998	188999	189000	Professor Moody	381	” History of Magic had rarely gone so slowly . Harry kept checking Ron ’s watch , having finally discarded his own , but Ron ’s was moving so slowly he could have sworn it had stopped working too . All three of them were so tired they could happily have put their heads down on the desks and slept ; even Hermione was n’t taking her usual notes , but was sitting with her head on her hand , gazing at Professor Binns with her eyes out of focus . When the bell finally rang , they hurried out into the corridors toward the Dark Arts classroom and found Professor Moody leaving it . He looked as tired as they felt . The eyelid of his normal eye was drooping , giving his face an even more lopsided appearance than usual . “
189002	189016	188999	189000	Professor Moody	381	” Harry called as they made their way toward him through the crowd . “
189021	189063	189019	189019	Potter	447	” growled Moody . His magical eye followed a couple of passing first years , who sped up , looking nervous ; it rolled into the back of Moody ’s head and watched them around the corner before he spoke again . “
189068	189090	189019	189019	Potter	447	” He stood back to let them into his empty classroom , limped in after them , and closed the door . “
189096	189102	189103	189104	Mr. Crouch	219	” Harry asked without preamble . “
189106	189107	189103	189104	Mr. Crouch	219	” “
189110	189141	189103	189104	Mr. Crouch	219	” said Moody . He moved over to his desk , sat down , stretched out his wooden leg with a slight groan , and pulled out his hip flask . “
189148	189152	189143	189143	you	381	” Harry said . “
189156	189167	189143	189143	you	381	” said Moody , taking a swig from his flask . “
189194	189195	189187	189187	He	381	” “
189201	189205	189197	189197	he	381	” said Ron . “
189216	189220	189214	189214	Ron	188	” said Hermione . “
189236	189248	189234	189234	Professor	5780	” Moody ’s magical eye quivered as it rested on Hermione . “
189263	189268	189249	189249	You	4160	” he told her . “
189277	189284	189275	189275	Granger	178	” Hermione flushed pink with pleasure . “
189292	189296	189287	189287	he	381	” said Harry . “
189312	189313	189303	189303	He	381	” “
189320	189325	189328	189328	someone	872	” said Hermione eagerly , “
189332	189333	189328	189328	someone	872	” “
189357	189382	189355	189355	they	872	” said Ron quickly , looking hopefully at Moody as if he too wanted to be told he had the makings of an Auror . “
189390	189394	189383	189383	We	4166	” growled Moody . “
189397	189401	189402	189402	d’you	4167	” said Ron , “
189410	189411	189404	189404	he	381	” “
189416	189424	189404	189404	he	381	” said Moody , shaking his head . “
189438	189464	189467	189467	Dumbledore	187	” He yawned widely , so that his scars stretched , and his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth . Then he said , “
189513	189514	189506	189506	your	447	” “
189517	189521	189506	189506	your	447	” said Harry . “
189525	189546	189506	189506	your	447	” He had n’t given the maze a single thought since he ’d left it with Krum the previous night . “
189557	189573	189506	189506	your	447	” said Moody , looking up at Harry and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin . “
189615	189616	189617	189617	We	4173	” “
189620	189625	189626	189626	Me	0	” Ron said quickly . “
189631	189635	189628	189628	Hermione	178	” Moody grinned . “
189657	189661	189646	189646	I	0	” said Moody . “
189674	189706	189707	189707	You	447	” He took another long draw from his hip flask , and his magical eye swiveled onto the window . The topmost sail of the Durmstrang ship was visible through it . “
189710	189722	189707	189707	You	447	” counseled Moody , his normal eye on Ron and Hermione , “
189754	189808	189745	189745	you	447	” Sirius sent their owl back the very next morning . It fluttered down beside Harry at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of Hermione , clutching a copy of the Daily Prophet in its beak . She took the newspaper , scanned the first few pages , said , “
189819	190029	189811	189811	She	4176	” then joined Ron and Harry in reading what Sirius had to say on the mysterious events of the night before last . Harry — what do you think you are playing at , walking off into the forest with Viktor Krum ? I want you to swear , by return owl , that you are not going to go walking with anyone else at night . There is somebody highly dangerous at Hogwarts . It is clear to me that they wanted to stop Crouch from seeing Dumbledore and you were probably feet away from them in the dark . You could have been killed . Your name did n’t get into the Goblet of Fire by accident . If someone ’s trying to attack you , they ’re on their last chance . Stay close to Ron and Hermione , do not leave Gryffindor Tower after hours , and arm yourself for the third task . Practice Stunning and Disarming . A few hexes would n’t go amiss either . There ’s nothing you can do about Crouch . Keep your head down and look after yourself . I ’m waiting for your letter giving me your word you wo n’t stray out - of - bounds again .
190030	190046	190048	190048	Harry	447	“ Who ’s he , to lecture me about being out - of - bounds ? ”
190066	190076	190048	190048	Harry	447	“ After all the stuff he did at school ! ”
190077	190084	190086	190086	Hermione	178	“ He ’s worried about you ! ”
190089	190101	190086	190086	Hermione	178	“ Just like Moody and Hagrid ! So listen to them ! ”
190102	190113	190115	190115	Harry	447	“ No one ’s tried to attack me all year , ”
190117	190128	190115	190115	Harry	447	“ No one ’s done anything to me at all — ”
190129	190140	190142	190142	Hermione	178	“ Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire , ”
190144	190181	190142	190142	Hermione	178	“ And they must ’ve done that for a reason , Harry . Snuffles is right . Maybe they ’ve been biding their time . Maybe this is the task they ’re going to get you . ”
190182	190185	190187	190187	Harry	447	“ Look , ”
190190	190254	190187	190187	Harry	447	“ let ’s say Sirius is right , and someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch . Well , they would ’ve been in the trees near us , would n’t they ? But they waited till I was out of the way until they acted , did n’t they ? So it does n’t look like I ’m their target , does it ? ”
190255	190275	190277	190277	Hermione	178	“ They could n’t have made it look like an accident if they ’d murdered you in the forest ! ”
190279	190288	190277	190277	Hermione	178	“ But if you die during a task — ”
190289	190301	190303	190303	Harry	447	“ They did n’t care about attacking Krum , did they ? ”
190305	190335	190303	190303	Harry	447	“ Why did n’t they just polish me off at the same time ? They could ’ve made it look like Krum and I had a duel or something . ”
190336	190346	190348	190348	Hermione	178	“ Harry , I do n’t understand it either , ”
190351	190418	190348	190348	Hermione	178	“ I just know there are a lot of odd things going on , and I do n’t like it ... Moody ’s right — Sirius is right — you ’ve got to get in training for the third task , straight away . And you make sure you write back to Sirius and promise him you ’re not going to go sneaking off alone again . ”
190504	190512	190513	190513	Ron	188	“ Ca n’t we kidnap Mrs. Norris ? ”
190549	190582	190584	190584	he	188	“ Let ’s Stun her for a bit . Or you could use Dobby , Harry , I bet he ’d do anything to help you . I ’m not complaining or anything ”
190595	190603	190584	190584	he	188	“ but I ’m aching all over ... ”
190604	190617	190619	190619	Hermione	178	“ Well , you keep missing the cushions , do n’t you ! ”

190651	190666	190668	190668	Ron	188	“ Once you ’re Stunned , you ca n’t aim too well , Hermione ! ”
190671	190680	190668	190668	Ron	188	“ Why do n’t you take a turn ? ”
190681	190694	190696	190696	Hermione	178	“ Well , I think Harry ’s got it now , anyway , ”
190699	190735	190736	190736	She	178	“ And we do n’t have to worry about Disarming , because he ’s been able to do that for ages ... I think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening . ”
190748	190757	190758	190758	she	178	“ I like the look of this one , ”
190761	190786	190758	190758	she	178	“ this Impediment Curse . Should slow down anything that ’s trying to attack you , Harry . We ’ll start with that one . ”
190808	190814	190819	190819	she	178	“ See you at dinner ! ”
190868	190887	190889	190889	Ron	188	“ It ’s going to be boiling in Trelawney ’s room , she never puts out that fire , ”
190991	190995	190997	190998	Professor Trelawney	324	“ My dears , ”
191023	191075	191076	191076	She	324	“ we have almost finished our work on planetary divination . Today , however , will be an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of Mars , for he is placed most interestingly at the present time . If you will all look this way , I will dim the lights ... ”
191394	191402	191532	191534	the cold voice	708	“ You are in luck , Wormtail , ”
191424	191442	191532	191534	the cold voice	708	“ You are very fortunate indeed . Your blunder has not ruined everything . He is dead . ”
191443	191447	191449	191453	the man on the floor	4202	“ My Lord ! ”
191455	191471	191449	191453	the man on the floor	4202	“ My Lord , I am ... I am so pleased ... and so sorry ... ”
191472	191475	191477	191479	the cold voice	708	“ Nagini , ”
191481	191513	191477	191479	the cold voice	708	“ you are out of luck . I will not be feeding Wormtail to you , after all ... but never mind , never mind ... there is still Harry Potter ... ”
191525	191530	191532	191534	the cold voice	708	“ Now , Wormtail , ”
191536	191552	191532	191534	the cold voice	708	“ perhaps one more little reminder why I will not tolerate another blunder from you ... ”
191553	191563	191589	191591	the cold voice	708	“ My Lord ... no ... I beg you ... ”
191584	191587	191589	191591	the cold voice	708	“ Crucio ! ”
191640	191645	191646	191646	Harry	447	“ Harry ! Harry ! ”
191707	191712	191713	191713	he	188	“ You all right ? ”
191716	191723	191725	191726	Professor Trelawney	324	“ Of course he is n’t ! ”
191743	191761	191732	191732	Her	324	“ What was it , Potter ? A premonition ? An apparition ? What did you see ? ”
191762	191765	191766	191766	Harry	447	“ Nothing , ”
191802	191809	191811	191812	Professor Trelawney	324	“ You were clutching your scar ! ”
191814	191838	191811	191812	Professor Trelawney	324	“ You were rolling on the floor , clutching your scar ! Come now , Potter , I have experience in these matters ! ”
191845	191858	191859	191859	he	447	“ I need to go to the hospital wing , I think , ”
191862	191866	191859	191859	he	447	“ Bad headache . ”
191867	191884	191886	191887	Professor Trelawney	324	“ My dear , you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room ! ”
191889	191908	191886	191887	Professor Trelawney	324	“ If you leave now , you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever — ”
191909	191922	191924	191924	Harry	447	“ I do n’t want to see anything except a headache cure , ”
191940	191945	191946	191946	Harry	447	“ See you later , ”
192205	192209	192210	192210	he	447	“ Lemon drop ? ”
192220	192223	192225	192225	Harry	447	“ Okay , ”
192231	192277	192278	192278	he	447	“ Pear Drop . Er — Licorice Wand . Fizzing Whizbee . Drooble ’s Best Blowing Gum . Bertie Bott ’s Every Flavor Beans ... oh no , he does n’t like them , does he ? ... oh just open , ca n’t you ? ”
192282	192294	192278	192278	he	447	“ I really need to see him , it ’s urgent ! ”
192315	192319	192320	192320	he	447	“ Chocolate Frog ! ”
192329	192336	192320	192320	he	447	“ Sugar Quill ! Cockroach Cluster ! ”
192349	192353	192354	192354	he	447	“ Cockroach Cluster ? ”
192359	192365	192354	192354	he	447	“ I was only joking ... ”
192430	192450	192419	192419	He	447	“ Dumbledore , I ’m afraid I do n’t see the connection , do n’t see it at all ! ”
192464	192519	192461	192462	Cornelius Fudge	280	“ Ludo says Bertha ’s perfectly capable of getting herself lost . I agree we would have expected to have found her by now , but all the same , we ’ve no evidence of foul play , Dumbledore , none at all . As for her disappearance being linked with Barty Crouch ’s ! ”
192520	192534	192536	192536	Moody	381	“ And what do you think ’s happened to Barty Crouch , Minister ? ”
192541	192549	192551	192551	Fudge	280	“ I see two possibilities , Alastor , ”
192553	192586	192551	192551	Fudge	280	“ Either Crouch has finally cracked — more than likely , I ’m sure you ’ll agree , given his personal history — lost his mind , and gone wandering off somewhere — ”
192587	192601	192603	192603	Dumbledore	187	“ He wandered extremely quickly , if that is the case , Cornelius , ”
192606	192612	192603	192603	Dumbledore	187	“ Or else — well ... ”
192617	192656	192613	192613	Fudge	280	“ Well , I ’ll reserve judgment until after I ’ve seen the place where he was found , but you say it was just past the Beauxbatons carriage ? Dumbledore , you know what that woman is ? ”
192657	192673	192675	192675	Dumbledore	187	“ I consider her to be a very able headmistress — and an excellent dancer , ”
192678	192683	192685	192685	Fudge	280	“ Dumbledore , come ! ”
192688	192730	192685	192685	Fudge	280	“ Do n’t you think you might be prejudiced in her favor because of Hagrid ? They do n’t all turn out harmless — if , indeed , you can call Hagrid harmless , with that monster fixation he ’s got — ”
192731	192741	192743	192743	Dumbledore	187	“ I no more suspect Madame Maxime than Hagrid , ”
192749	192764	192743	192743	Dumbledore	187	“ I think it possible that it is you who are prejudiced , Cornelius . ”
192765	192773	192775	192775	Moody	381	“ Can we wrap up this discussion ? ”
192777	192792	192794	192794	Fudge	280	“ Yes , yes , let ’s go down to the grounds , then , ”
192797	192805	192807	192807	Moody	381	“ No , it ’s not that , ”
192809	192830	192807	192807	Moody	381	“ it ’s just that Potter wants a word with you , Dumbledore . He ’s just outside the door . ”
192838	192843	192845	192845	Moody	381	“ Hello , Potter , ”
192847	192853	192845	192845	Moody	381	“ Come in , then . ”
192925	192928	192930	192930	Fudge	280	“ Harry ! ”
192936	192941	192930	192930	Fudge	280	“ How are you ? ”
192942	192945	192946	192946	Harry	447	“ Fine , ”
192949	192966	192968	192968	Fudge	280	“ We were just talking about the night when Mr. Crouch turned up on the grounds , ”
192970	192982	192968	192968	Fudge	280	“ It was you who found him , was it not ? ”
192983	192986	192988	192988	Harry	447	“ Yes , ”
193012	193035	193009	193009	he	447	“ I did n’t see Madame Maxime anywhere , though , and she ’d have a job hiding , would n’t she ? ”
193049	193054	193056	193056	Fudge	280	“ Yes , well , ”
193061	193093	193056	193056	Fudge	280	“ we ’re about to go for a short walk on the grounds , Harry , if you ’ll excuse us ... perhaps if you just go back to your class — ”
193094	193104	193105	193105	Harry	447	“ I wanted to talk to you , Professor , ”
193122	193130	193131	193131	he	187	“ Wait here for me , Harry , ”
193134	193145	193131	193131	he	187	“ Our examination of the grounds will not take long . ”
193184	193189	193190	193190	he	447	“ Hello , Fawkes , ”
194256	194259	194260	194260	Harry	447	“ Professor ! ”
194269	194297	194260	194260	Harry	447	“ I ’m sorry — I did n’t mean to — I was just looking at that basin in your cabinet — I — where are we ? ”
194868	194872	194900	194900	Crouch	219	“ Igor Karkaroff , ”
194919	194949	194976	194976	his	219	“ You have been brought from Azkaban to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic . You have given us to understand that you have important information for us . ”
194964	194970	194971	194971	he	219	“ I have , sir , ”
194993	195043	194971	194971	he	219	“ I wish to be of use to the Ministry . I wish to help . I — I know that the Ministry is trying to — to round up the last of the Dark Lord ’s supporters . I am eager to assist in any way I can ... ”
195089	195092	195093	195093	Harry	447	“ Filth . ”
195152	195161	195162	195162	Moody	332	“ Crouch is going to let him out , ”
195168	195220	195162	195162	Moody	332	“ He ’s done a deal with him . Took me six months to track him down , and Crouch is going to let him go if he ’s got enough new names . Let ’s hear his information , I say , and throw him straight back to the dementors . ”
195235	195254	195256	195256	Moody	332	“ Ah , I was forgetting ... you do n’t like the dementors , do you , Albus ? ”
195262	195265	195267	195267	Dumbledore	187	“ No , ”
195270	195293	195267	195267	Dumbledore	187	“ I ’m afraid I do n’t . I have long felt the Ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures . ”
195294	195301	195302	195302	Moody	332	“ But for filth like this ... ”
195306	195317	195319	195320	Mr. Crouch	219	“ You say you have names for us , Karkaroff , ”
195322	195330	195319	195320	Mr. Crouch	219	“ Let us hear them , please . ”
195331	195336	195338	195338	Karkaroff	417	“ You must understand , ”
195341	195390	195338	195338	Karkaroff	417	“ that He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named operated always in the greatest secrecy ... He preferred that we — I mean to say , his supporters — and I regret now , very deeply , that I ever counted myself among them — ”
195391	195397	195399	195399	Moody	332	“ Get on with it , ”
195401	195424	195399	195399	Moody	332	“ — we never knew the names of every one of our fellows — He alone knew exactly who we all were — ”
195425	195452	195454	195454	Moody	332	“ Which was a wise move , was n’t it , as it prevented someone like you , Karkaroff , from turning all of them in , ”
195456	195467	195469	195470	Mr. Crouch	219	“ Yet you say you have some names for us ? ”
195472	195478	195469	195470	Mr. Crouch	219	“ I — I do , ”
195483	195531	195480	195480	Karkaroff	417	“ And these were important supporters , mark you . People I saw with my own eyes doing his bidding . I give this information as a sign that I fully and totally renounce him , and am filled with a remorse so deep I can barely — ”
195532	195537	195539	195540	Mr. Crouch	219	“ These names are ? ”
195549	195555	195556	195556	he	417	“ There was Antonin Dolohov , ”
195559	195579	195556	195556	he	417	“ I — I saw him torture countless Muggles and — and non - supporters of the Dark Lord . ”
195580	195587	195589	195589	Moody	332	“ And helped him do it , ”
195591	195598	195600	195600	Crouch	219	“ We have already apprehended Dolohov , ”
195602	195610	195600	195600	Crouch	219	“ He was caught shortly after yourself . ”
195611	195614	195616	195616	Karkaroff	417	“ Indeed ? ”
195622	195632	195616	195616	Karkaroff	417	“ I — I am delighted to hear it ! ”
195662	195666	195668	195668	Crouch	219	“ Any others ? ”
195671	195680	195682	195682	Karkaroff	417	“ Why , yes ... there was Rosier , ”
195685	195689	195682	195682	Karkaroff	417	“ Evan Rosier . ”
195690	195695	195697	195697	Crouch	219	“ Rosier is dead , ”
195699	195724	195697	195697	Crouch	219	“ He was caught shortly after you were too . He preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was killed in the struggle . ”
195725	195736	195738	195738	Moody	332	“ Took a bit of me with him , though , ”
195766	195775	195777	195777	Karkaroff	417	“ No — no more than Rosier deserved ! ”
195833	195837	195839	195839	Crouch	219	“ Any more ? ”
195841	195844	195846	195846	Karkaroff	417	“ Yes ! ”
195848	195904	195846	195846	Karkaroff	417	“ There was Travers — he helped murder the McKinnons ! Mulciber — he specialized in the Imperius Curse , forced countless people to do horrific things ! Rookwood , who was a spy , and passed He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named useful information from inside the Ministry itself ! ”
195926	195929	195931	195932	Mr. Crouch	219	“ Rookwood ? ”
195953	195962	195948	195948	her	4303	“ Augustus Rookwood of the Department of Mysteries ? ”
195963	195968	195970	195970	Karkaroff	417	“ The very same , ”
195973	195997	195970	195970	Karkaroff	417	“ I believe he used a network of well - placed wizards , both inside the Ministry and out , to collect information — ”
195998	196006	196008	196009	Mr. Crouch	219	“ But Travers and Mulciber we have , ”
196011	196032	196008	196009	Mr. Crouch	219	“ Very well , Karkaroff , if that is all , you will be returned to Azkaban while we decide — ”
196033	196037	196039	196039	Karkaroff	417	“ Not yet ! ”
196045	196052	196039	196039	Karkaroff	417	“ Wait , I have more ! ”
196076	196079	196080	196080	he	417	“ Snape ! ”
196083	196087	196080	196080	he	417	“ Severus Snape ! ”
196088	196097	196099	196099	Crouch	219	“ Snape has been cleared by this council , ”
196102	196112	196099	196099	Crouch	219	“ He has been vouched for by Albus Dumbledore . ”
196113	196116	196118	196118	Karkaroff	417	“ No ! ”
196131	196143	196118	196118	Karkaroff	417	“ I assure you ! Severus Snape is a Death Eater ! ”
196151	196161	196162	196162	he	187	“ I have given evidence already on this matter , ”
196166	196209	196162	196162	he	187	“ Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater . However , he rejoined our side before Lord Voldemort ’s downfall and turned spy for us , at great personal risk . He is now no more a Death Eater than I am . ”
196233	196239	196240	196240	Crouch	219	“ Very well , Karkaroff , ”
196244	196266	196240	196240	Crouch	219	“ you have been of assistance . I shall review your case . You will return to Azkaban in the meantime ... ”
196577	196606	196608	196609	Mr. Crouch	219	“ Ludo Bagman , you have been brought here in front of the Council of Magical Law to answer charges relating to the activities of the Death Eaters , ”
196611	196642	196608	196609	Mr. Crouch	219	“ We have heard the evidence against you , and are about to reach our verdict . Do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce judgment ? ”
196657	196660	196662	196662	Bagman	545	“ Only , ”
196667	196681	196662	196662	Bagman	545	“ well — I know I ’ve been a bit of an idiot — ”
196722	196732	196733	196733	someone	872	“ You never spoke a truer word , boy , ”
196751	196777	196746	196746	Moody	332	“ If I did n’t know he ’d always been dim , I ’d have said some of those Bludgers had permanently affected his brain ... ”
196778	196793	196795	196796	Mr. Crouch	219	“ Ludovic Bagman , you were caught passing information to Lord Voldemort ’s supporters , ”
196798	196815	196795	196796	Mr. Crouch	219	“ For this , I suggest a term of imprisonment in Azkaban lasting no less than — ”
196852	196864	196865	196865	Bagman	546	“ But I ’ve told you , I had no idea ! ”
196880	196965	196874	196874	his	546	“ None at all ! Old Rookwood was a friend of my dad ’s ... never crossed my mind he was in with You - Know - Who ! I thought I was collecting information for our side ! And Rookwood kept talking about getting me a job in the Ministry later on ... once my Quidditch days are over , you know ... I mean , I ca n’t keep getting hit by Bludgers for the rest of my life , can I ? ”
196973	196982	196984	196985	Mr. Crouch	219	“ It will be put to the vote , ”
197000	197015	196988	196988	He	219	“ The jury will please raise their hands ... those in favor of imprisonment ... ”
197058	197061	197063	197063	Crouch	219	“ Yes ? ”
197065	197089	197090	197091	the witch	4329	“ We ’d just like to congratulate Mr. Bagman on his splendid performance for England in the Quidditch match against Turkey last Saturday , ”
197118	197121	197111	197111	his	221	“ Despicable , ”
197138	197162	197131	197131	Bagman	221	“ Rookwood get him a job indeed ... The day Ludo Bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the Ministry ... ”
197262	197267	197268	197268	he	219	“ Bring them in , ”
197486	197499	197500	197500	he	219	“ You have been brought here before the Council of Magical Law , ”
197504	197520	197500	197500	he	219	“ so that we may pass judgment on you , for a crime so heinous — ”
197521	197524	197526	197533	the boy with the straw - colored hair	4347	“ Father , ”
197535	197540	197526	197533	the boy with the straw - colored hair	4347	“ Father ... please ... ”
197541	197556	197558	197558	Crouch	219	“ — that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court , ”
197571	197628	197558	197558	Crouch	219	“ We have heard the evidence against you . The four of you stand accused of capturing an Auror — Frank Longbottom — and subjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse , believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master , He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named — ”
197629	197636	197638	197642	the boy in chains below	4349	“ Father , I did n’t ! ”
197644	197664	197638	197642	the boy in chains below	4349	“ I did n’t , I swear it , Father , do n’t send me back to the dementors — ”
197665	197671	197673	197674	Mr. Crouch	219	“ You are further accused , ”
197676	197735	197673	197674	Mr. Crouch	219	“ of using the Cruciatus Curse on Frank Longbottom ’s wife , when he would not give you information . You planned to restore He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named to power , and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong . I now ask the jury — ”
197736	197739	197741	197742	the boy	5057	“ Mother ! ”
197761	197780	197746	197751	the wispy little witch beside Crouch	4346	“ Mother , stop him , Mother , I did n’t do it , it was n’t me ! ”
197781	197788	197790	197791	Mr. Crouch	219	“ I now ask the jury , ”
197793	197816	197790	197791	Mr. Crouch	219	“ to raise their hands if they believe , as I do , that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban ! ”
197864	197899	197858	197859	The boy	5057	“ No ! Mother , no ! I did n’t do it , I did n’t do it , I did n’t know ! Do n’t send me there , do n’t let him ! ”
197935	197987	197920	197927	the woman with the heavy - lidded eyes	4361	“ The Dark Lord will rise again , Crouch ! Throw us into Azkaban ; we will wait ! He will rise again and will come for us , he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters ! We alone were faithful ! We alone tried to find him ! ”
198042	198048	198049	198049	he	5057	“ I ’m your son ! ”
198055	198061	198049	198049	he	5057	“ I ’m your son ! ”
198062	198070	198072	198073	Mr. Crouch	219	“ You are no son of mine ! ”
198080	198086	198075	198075	his	219	“ I have no son ! ”
198113	198118	198119	198119	Crouch	219	“ Take them away ! ”
198131	198142	198119	198119	Crouch	219	“ Take them away , and may they rot there ! ”
198143	198161	198119	198119	Crouch	219	“ Father ! Father , I was n’t involved ! No ! No ! Father , please ! ”
198162	198177	198119	198119	Crouch	219	“ I think , Harry , it is time to return to my office , ”
198238	198241	198243	198244	the Dumbledore	187	“ Come , ”
198337	198340	198341	198341	Harry	447	“ Professor , ”
198344	198366	198341	198341	Harry	447	“ I know I should n’t ’ve — I did n’t mean — the cabinet door was sort of open and — ”
198367	198372	198374	198374	Dumbledore	187	“ I quite understand , ”
198444	198449	198450	198450	Harry	447	“ What is it ? ”
198454	198463	198465	198465	Dumbledore	187	“ This ? It is called a Pensieve , ”
198467	198495	198465	198465	Dumbledore	187	“ I sometimes find , and I am sure you know the feeling , that I simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind . ”
198496	198499	198501	198501	Harry	447	“ Er , ”
198518	198523	198525	198525	Dumbledore	187	“ At these times , ”
198532	198582	198525	198525	Dumbledore	187	“ I use the Pensieve . One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one ’s mind , pours them into the basin , and examines them at one ’s leisure . It becomes easier to spot patterns and links , you understand , when they are in this form . ”
198583	198593	198594	198594	Harry	447	“ You mean ... that stuff ’s your thoughts ? ”
198607	198610	198612	198612	Dumbledore	187	“ Certainly , ”
198614	198620	198612	198612	Dumbledore	187	“ Let me show you . ”
198766	198782	198753	198753	his	431	“ It ’s coming back ... Karkaroff ’s too ... stronger and clearer than ever ... ”
198783	198793	198794	198794	Dumbledore	187	“ A connection I could have made without assistance , ”
198797	198802	198803	198803	He	187	“ but never mind . ”
198834	198873	198821	198821	Snape	431	“ I was using the Pensieve when Mr. Fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather hastily . Undoubtedly I did not fasten the cabinet door properly . Naturally , it would have attracted your attention . ”
198874	198879	198880	198880	Harry	447	“ I ’m sorry , ”
198888	198895	198896	198896	he	187	“ Curiosity is not a sin , ”
198899	198913	198896	198896	he	187	“ But we should exercise caution with our curiosity ... yes , indeed ... ”
199000	199035	198978	198978	her	4378	“ He put a hex on me , Professor Dumbledore , and I was only teasing him , sir , I only said I ’d seen him kissing Florence behind the greenhouses last Thursday ... ”
199036	199042	199044	199044	Dumbledore	187	“ But why , Bertha , ”
199056	199069	199044	199044	Dumbledore	187	“ why did you have to follow him in the first place ? ”
199070	199073	199074	199074	Harry	447	“ Bertha ? ”
199082	199091	199074	199074	Harry	447	“ Is that — was that Bertha Jorkins ? ”
199092	199095	199097	199097	Dumbledore	187	“ Yes , ”
199122	199133	199107	199107	Bertha	177	“ That was Bertha as I remember her at school . ”
199184	199189	199191	199191	Dumbledore	187	“ So , Harry , ”
199194	199210	199191	199191	Dumbledore	187	“ Before you got lost in my thoughts , you wanted to tell me something . ”
199211	199214	199216	199216	Harry	447	“ Yes , ”
199218	199236	199216	199216	Harry	447	“ Professor — I was in Divination just now , and — er — I fell asleep . ”
199253	199259	199249	199249	Dumbledore	187	“ Quite understandable . Continue . ”
199260	199268	199270	199270	Harry	447	“ Well , I had a dream , ”
199272	199289	199270	199270	Harry	447	“ A dream about Lord Voldemort . He was torturing Wormtail ... you know who Wormtail — ”
199290	199295	199297	199297	Dumbledore	187	“ I do know , ”
199300	199304	199297	199297	Dumbledore	187	“ Please continue . ”
199305	199382	199383	199383	Harry	447	“ Voldemort got a letter from an owl . He said something like , Wormtail ’s blunder had been repaired . He said someone was dead . Then he said , Wormtail would n’t be fed to the snake — there was a snake beside his chair . He said — he said he ’d be feeding me to it , instead . Then he did the Cruciatus Curse on Wormtail — and my scar hurt , ”
199386	199397	199383	199383	Harry	447	“ It woke me up , it hurt so badly . ”
199404	199411	199413	199413	Harry	447	“ Er — that ’s all , ”
199415	199419	199421	199421	Dumbledore	187	“ I see , ”
199424	199452	199421	199421	Dumbledore	187	“ I see . Now , has your scar hurt at any other time this year , excepting the time it woke you up over the summer ? ”
199453	199470	199472	199472	Harry	447	“ No , I — how did you know it woke me up over the summer ? ”
199476	199485	199487	199487	Dumbledore	187	“ You are not Sirius ’s only correspondent , ”
199489	199523	199487	199487	Dumbledore	187	“ I have also been in contact with him ever since he left Hogwarts last year . It was I who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay . ”
199590	199593	199594	199594	he	187	“ Professor ? ”
199612	199616	199617	199617	he	187	“ My apologies , ”
199629	199641	199621	199621	He	187	“ D’you — d’you know why my scar ’s hurting me ? ”
199656	199695	199642	199642	Dumbledore	187	“ I have a theory , no more than that ... It is my belief that your scar hurts both when Lord Voldemort is near you , and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred . ”
199696	199701	199642	199642	Dumbledore	187	“ But ... why ? ”
199702	199715	199717	199717	Dumbledore	187	“ Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed , ”
199719	199726	199717	199717	Dumbledore	187	“ That is no ordinary scar . ”
199727	199740	199642	199642	Dumbledore	187	“ So you think ... that dream ... did it really happen ? ”
199741	199746	199748	199748	Dumbledore	187	“ It is possible , ”
199750	199764	199748	199748	Dumbledore	187	“ I would say — probable . Harry — did you see Voldemort ? ”
199765	199768	199770	199770	Harry	447	“ No , ”
199772	199819	199820	199820	Harry	447	“ Just the back of his chair . But — there would n’t have been anything to see , would there ? I mean , he has n’t got a body , has he ? But ... but then how could he have held the wand ? ”
199824	199828	199830	199830	Dumbledore	187	“ How indeed ? ”
199832	199836	199830	199830	Dumbledore	187	“ How indeed ... ”
199882	199885	199886	199886	Harry	447	“ Professor , ”
199891	199900	199886	199886	Harry	447	“ do you think he ’s getting stronger ? ”
199901	199904	199906	199906	Dumbledore	187	“ Voldemort ? ”
199955	199969	199970	199970	Dumbledore	187	“ Once again , Harry , I can only give you my suspicions . ”
199985	199995	199996	199996	he	187	“ The years of Voldemort ’s ascent to power , ”
199999	200109	199996	199996	he	187	“ were marked with disappearances . Bertha Jorkins has vanished without a trace in the place where Voldemort was certainly known to be last . Mr. Crouch too has disappeared ... within these very grounds . And there was a third disappearance , one which the Ministry , I regret to say , do not consider of any importance , for it concerns a Muggle . His name was Frank Bryce , he lived in the village where Voldemort ’s father grew up , and he has not been seen since last August . You see , I read the Muggle newspapers , unlike most of my Ministry friends . ”
200117	200143	200110	200110	Dumbledore	187	“ These disappearances seem to me to be linked . The Ministry disagrees — as you may have heard , while waiting outside my office . ”
200179	200182	200183	200183	he	447	“ Professor ? ”
200187	200192	200194	200194	Dumbledore	187	“ Yes , Harry ? ”
200196	200216	200194	200194	Dumbledore	187	“ Er ... could I ask you about ... that court thing I was in ... in the Pensieve ? ”
200217	200221	200223	200223	Dumbledore	187	“ You could , ”
200226	200248	200223	200223	Dumbledore	187	“ I attended it many times , but some trials come back to me more clearly than others ... particularly now ... ”
200249	200279	200280	200280	Dumbledore	187	“ You know — you know the trial you found me in ? The one with Crouch ’s son ? Well ... were they talking about Neville ’s parents ? ”
200288	200304	200305	200305	he	187	“ Has Neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother ? ”
200338	200349	200351	200351	Dumbledore	187	“ Yes , they were talking about Neville ’s parents , ”
200353	200389	200351	200351	Dumbledore	187	“ His father , Frank , was an Auror just like Professor Moody . He and his wife were tortured for information about Voldemort ’s whereabouts after he lost his powers , as you heard . ”
200390	200396	200398	200398	Harry	447	“ So they ’re dead ? ”
200401	200404	200406	200406	Dumbledore	187	“ No , ”
200421	200460	200408	200408	his	187	“ They are insane . They are both in St. Mungo ’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries . I believe Neville visits them , with his grandmother , during the holidays . They do not recognize him . ”
200485	200492	200494	200494	Dumbledore	187	“ The Longbottoms were very popular , ”
200496	200561	200494	200494	Dumbledore	187	“ The attacks on them came after Voldemort ’s fall from power , just when everyone thought they were safe . Those attacks caused a wave of fury such as I have never known . The Ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it . Unfortunately , the Longbottoms ’ evidence was — given their condition — none too reliable . ”
200562	200574	200576	200576	Harry	447	“ Then Mr. Crouch ’s son might not have been involved ? ”
200584	200594	200581	200581	his	187	“ As to that , I have no idea . ”
200630	200633	200634	200634	he	447	“ Er , ”
200637	200641	200634	200634	he	447	“ Mr. Bagman ... ”
200642	200656	200658	200658	Dumbledore	187	“ . . . has never been accused of any Dark activity since , ”
200661	200664	200666	200666	Harry	447	“ Right , ”
200691	200696	200685	200685	Dumbledore	187	“ And ... er ... ”
200731	200738	200739	200739	he	187	“ No more has Professor Snape , ”
200770	200784	200785	200785	Dumbledore	187	“ What made you think he ’d really stopped supporting Voldemort , Professor ? ”
200799	200813	200785	200785	Dumbledore	187	“ That , Harry , is a matter between Professor Snape and myself . ”
200854	200857	200858	200858	he	187	“ Harry , ”
200866	200893	200858	200858	he	187	“ Please do not speak about Neville ’s parents to anybody else . He has the right to let people know , when he is ready . ”
200894	200899	200901	200901	Harry	447	“ Yes , Professor , ”
200907	200910	200911	200911	Harry	447	“ And — ”
200951	200959	200939	200939	He	187	“ Good luck with the third task . ”
200974	201108	200960	200960	Dumbledore	187	” Ron whispered . Everything Harry had seen in the Pensieve , nearly everything Dumbledore had told and shown him afterward , he had now shared with Ron and Hermione — and , of course , with Sirius , to whom Harry had sent an owl the moment he had left Dumbledore ’s office . Harry , Ron , and Hermione sat up late in the common room once again that night , talking it all over until Harry ’s mind was reeling , until he understood what Dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off . Ron stared into the common room fire . Harry thought he saw Ron shiver slightly , even though the evening was warm . “
201114	201118	201119	201119	He	4384	” Ron said . “
201134	201135	201126	201126	he	4384	” “
201138	201180	201126	201126	he	4384	” said Harry . Hermione had not spoken for ten minutes . She was sitting with her forehead in her hands , staring at her knees . Harry thought she too looked as though she could have done with a Pensieve . “
201184	201189	201181	201182	Rita Skeeter	322	” she muttered finally . “
201199	201207	201192	201192	you	4386	” said Ron , in utter disbelief . “
201215	201222	201223	201223	I	0	” Hermione said to her knees . “
201314	201315	201305	201305	he	221	” “
201330	201334	201328	201328	he	221	” Hermione shrugged . “
201343	201352	201338	201339	Madame Maxime	313	” Ron said , turning back to Harry . “
201355	201359	201361	201361	he	221	” said Harry , “
201374	201375	201367	201367	Crouch	219	” “
201385	201390	201383	201383	we	4391	” said Ron slowly . “
201410	201411	201402	201402	she	313	” “
201418	201426	201414	201414	she	313	” said Hermione sharply , looking up . “
201486	201493	201478	201478	I	0	” Hermione looked at her watch . “
201501	201508	201494	201494	We	4391	” she said , looking shocked . “
201541	201808	201532	201532	Harry	447	” Harry and Ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory . As Harry pulled on his pajamas , he looked over at Neville ’s bed . True to his word to Dumbledore , he had not told Ron and Hermione about Neville ’s parents . As Harry took off his glasses and climbed into his four - poster , he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you . He often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan , but as he listened to Neville ’s snores , he thought that Neville deserved it more than he did . Lying in the darkness , Harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured Mr. and Mrs. Longbottom ... He remembered the jeers of the crowd as Crouch ’s son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the dementors ... He understood how they had felt ... Then he remembered the milk - white face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later ... It was Voldemort , Harry thought , staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness , it all came back to Voldemort ... He was the one who had torn these families apart , who had ruined all these lives ... Ron and Hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams , which would finish on the day of the third task , but they were putting most of their efforts into helping Harry prepare . “
201815	201840	201532	201532	Harry	447	” Hermione said shortly when Harry pointed this out to them and said he did n’t mind practicing on his own for a while , “
201868	201869	201855	201855	We	4394	” “
201879	202178	201855	201855	We	4394	” said Ron excitedly , attempting the Impediment Curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it stop dead in midair . The mood in the castle as they entered June became excited and tense again . Everyone was looking forward to the third task , which would take place a week before the end of term . Harry was practicing hexes at every available moment . He felt more confident about this task than either of the others . Difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be , Moody was right : Harry had managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now , and this time he had some notice , some chance to prepare himself for what lay ahead . Tired of walking in on Harry , Hermione , and Ron all over the school , Professor McGonagall had given them permission to use the empty Transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes . Harry had soon mastered the Impediment Curse , a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers ; the Reductor Curse , which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way ; and the Four - Point Spell , a useful discovery of Hermione ’s that would make his wand point due north , therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze . He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm , though . This was supposed to cast a temporary , invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses ; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well - placed Jelly - Legs Jinx , and Harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counter - jinx . “
202188	202207	202179	202179	You	4396	” Hermione said encouragingly , looking down her list and crossing off those spells they had already learned . “
202218	202219	201855	201855	We	4394	” “
202226	202245	201855	201855	We	4394	” said Ron , who was standing by the window . He was staring down onto the grounds . “
202251	202303	202304	202304	He	281	” Harry and Hermione went to see . Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle were standing in the shadow of a tree below . Crabbe and Goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout ; both were smirking . Malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into it . “
202315	202320	202321	202321	He	281	” said Harry curiously . “
202326	202330	202321	202321	He	281	” said Hermione , “
202351	202371	202349	202349	Harry	447	” she added briskly , turning away from the window and moving back into the middle of the room , “
202380	202508	202373	202373	’s	4398	” Sirius was sending daily owls now . Like Hermione , he seemed to want to concentrate on getting Harry through the last task before they concerned themselves with anything else . He reminded Harry in every letter that whatever might be going on outside the walls of Hogwarts was not Harry ’s responsibility , nor was it within his power to influence it . If Voldemort is really getting stronger again , he wrote , my priority is to ensure your safety . He can not hope to lay hands on you while you are under Dumbledore ’s protection , but all the same , take no risks : Concentrate on getting through that maze safely , and then we can turn our attention to other matters .
202699	202702	202704	202704	Harry	447	“ What ? ”
202713	202716	202718	202718	Hermione	178	“ Nothing , ”
202743	202754	202735	202735	He	188	“ No way . Not today . That old cow . ”
202755	202758	202760	202760	Harry	447	“ What ? ”
202762	202767	202735	202735	He	188	“ Rita Skeeter again ? ”
202768	202771	202773	202773	Ron	188	“ No , ”
202790	202800	202802	202802	Harry	447	“ It ’s about me , is n’t it ? ”
202804	202807	202809	202809	Ron	188	“ No , ”
202839	202867	202868	202868	Malfoy	282	“ Hey , Potter ! Potter ! How ’s your head ? You feeling all right ? Sure you ’re not going to go berserk on us ? ”
202898	202904	202905	202905	Harry	447	“ Let me see it , ”
202910	202915	202905	202905	Harry	447	“ Give it here . ”
202945	202949	202943	202944	HARRY POTTER	447	“ DISTURBED AND DANGEROUS ”
203152	203159	203161	203162	one specialist	4408	“ He might even be pretending , ”
203164	203173	203161	203162	one specialist	4408	“ This could be a plea for attention . ”
203203	203209	203188	203189	Albus Dumbledore	187	“ Potter can speak Parseltongue , ”
203219	203292	203293	203293	Parseltongue	153	“ There were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago , and most people thought Potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy . It was all hushed up , though . But he ’s made friends with werewolves and giants too . We think he ’d do anything for a bit of power . ”
203356	203397	203347	203347	he	4417	“ as worthy of investigation . Personally , I would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes , as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of Dark Magic , and are historically associated with evildoers . ”
203400	203424	203347	203347	he	4417	“ anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence . ”
203474	203485	203487	203487	Harry	447	“ Gone off me a bit , has n’t she ? ”
203531	203542	203543	203543	Ron	188	“ How did she know your scar hurt in Divination ? ”
203546	203564	203543	203543	Ron	188	“ There ’s no way she was there , there ’s no way she could ’ve heard — ”
203565	203571	203573	203573	Harry	447	“ The window was open , ”
203575	203582	203573	203573	Harry	447	“ I opened it to breathe . ”
203583	203593	203594	203594	Hermione	178	“ You were at the top of North Tower ! ”
203597	203612	203594	203594	Hermione	178	“ Your voice could n’t have carried all the way down to the grounds ! ”
203613	203631	203633	203633	Harry	447	“ Well , you ’re the one who ’s supposed to be researching magical methods of bugging ! ”
203635	203644	203633	203633	Harry	447	“ You tell me how she did it ! ”
203645	203651	203653	203653	Hermione	178	“ I ’ve been trying ! ”
203655	203661	203653	203653	Hermione	178	“ But I ... but ... ”
203687	203693	203695	203695	Ron	188	“ Are you all right ? ”
203701	203704	203706	203706	Hermione	178	“ Yes , ”
203746	203753	203754	203754	Hermione	178	“ I ’ve had an idea , ”
203761	203826	203754	203754	Hermione	178	“ I think I know ... because then no one would be able to see ... even Moody ... and she ’d have been able to get onto the window ledge ... but she ’s not allowed ... she ’s definitely not allowed ... I think we ’ve got her ! Just give me two seconds in the library — just to make sure ! ”
203843	203846	203847	203847	Ron	188	“ Oi ! ”
203852	203867	203868	203868	he	188	“ We ’ve got our History of Magic exam in ten minutes ! Blimey , ”
203876	203907	203868	203868	he	188	“ she must really hate that Skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam . What ’re you going to do in Binns ’s class — read again ? ”
203945	203949	203950	203950	Harry	447	“ S’pose so , ”
203970	203986	203987	203987	she	343	“ Potter , the champions are congregating in the chamber off the Hall after breakfast , ”
203990	203999	204001	204001	Harry	447	“ But the task ’s not till tonight ! ”
204018	204027	204028	204028	she	343	“ I ’m aware of that , Potter , ”
204031	204058	204059	204059	She	343	“ The champions ’ families are invited to watch the final task , you know . This is simply a chance for you to greet them . ”
204068	204082	204083	204083	he	447	“ She does n’t expect the Dursleys to turn up , does she ? ”
204088	204091	204093	204093	Ron	188	“ Dunno , ”
204095	204116	204093	204093	Ron	188	“ Harry , I ’d better hurry , I ’m going to be late for Binns . See you later . ”
204238	204250	204234	204234	his	238	“ Harry , come on , they ’re waiting for you ! ”
204383	204386	204371	204371	Bill	209	“ Surprise ! ”
204401	204412	204413	204413	She	191	“ Thought we ’d come and watch you , Harry ! ”
204423	204428	204430	204430	Bill	209	“ You all right ? ”
204440	204463	204430	204430	Bill	209	“ Charlie wanted to come , but he could n’t get time off . He said you were incredible against the Horntail . ”
204500	204508	204509	204509	Harry	447	“ This is really nice of you , ”
204515	204525	204509	204509	Harry	447	“ I thought for a moment — the Dursleys — ”
204526	204529	204531	204532	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Hmm , ”
204561	204569	204571	204571	Bill	209	“ It ’s great being back here , ”
204594	204617	204571	204571	Bill	209	“ Have n’t seen this place for five years . Is that picture of the mad knight still around ? Sir Cadogan ? ”
204618	204622	204624	204624	Harry	447	“ Oh yeah , ”
204635	204641	204643	204643	Bill	209	“ And the Fat Lady ? ”
204645	204653	204655	204656	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ She was here in my time , ”
204658	204681	204655	204656	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ She gave me such a telling off one night when I got back to the dormitory at four in the morning — ”
204682	204697	204699	204699	Bill	209	“ What were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning ? ”
204715	204727	204728	204728	she	191	“ Your father and I had been for a nighttime stroll , ”
204731	204755	204728	204728	she	191	“ He got caught by Apollyon Pringle — he was the caretaker in those days — your father ’s still got the marks . ”
204756	204765	204767	204767	Bill	209	“ Fancy giving us a tour , Harry ? ”
204769	204774	204776	204776	Harry	447	“ Yeah , okay , ”
204802	204810	204811	204811	he	230	“ There you are , are you ? ”
204820	204843	204811	204811	he	230	“ Bet you ’re not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedric ’s caught you up on points , are you ? ”
204844	204847	204849	204849	Harry	447	“ What ? ”
204851	204855	204857	204857	Cedric	238	“ Ignore him , ”
204870	204900	204857	204857	Cedric	238	“ He ’s been angry ever since Rita Skeeter ’s article about the Triwizard Tournament — you know , when she made out you were the only Hogwarts champion . ”
204901	204914	204916	204917	Amos Diggory	230	“ Did n’t bother to correct her , though , did he ? ”
204940	204959	204938	204938	Bill	209	“ Still ... you ’ll show him , Ced . Beaten him once before , have n’t you ? ”
204960	204974	204975	204976	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble , Amos ! ”
204980	204995	204975	204976	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ I would have thought you ’d know that , working at the Ministry ! ”
205088	205093	205094	205094	Harry	447	“ How ’s Percy ? ”
205103	205107	205109	205109	Bill	209	“ Not good , ”
205111	205117	205119	205120	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ He ’s very upset , ”
205129	205209	205123	205123	her	191	“ The Ministry wants to keep Mr. Crouch ’s disappearance quiet , but Percy ’s been hauled in for questioning about the instructions Mr. Crouch has been sending in . They seem to think there ’s a chance they were n’t genuinely written by him . Percy ’s been under a lot of strain . They ’re not letting him fill in for Mr. Crouch as the fifth judge tonight . Cornelius Fudge is going to be doing it . ”
205218	205223	205225	205225	Ron	188	“ Mum — Bill ! ”
205237	205244	205225	205225	Ron	188	“ What ’re you doing here ? ”
205245	205255	205257	205258	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Come to watch Harry in the last task ! ”
205261	205282	205257	205258	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ I must say , it makes a lovely change , not having to cook . How was your exam ? ”
205283	205288	205290	205290	Ron	188	“ Oh ... okay , ”
205292	205314	205315	205315	he	188	“ Could n’t remember all the goblin rebels ’ names , so I invented a few . It ’s all right , ”
205331	205351	205326	205327	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ they ’re all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean ; it was n’t hard . ”
205421	205430	205412	205412	she	178	“ Are you going to tell us — ? ”
205442	205447	205449	205450	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Hello , Hermione , ”
205458	205461	205463	205463	Hermione	178	“ Hello , ”
205486	205513	205478	205478	Harry	447	“ Mrs. Weasley , you did n’t believe that rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote in Witch Weekly , did you ? Because Hermione ’s not my girlfriend . ”
205514	205517	205519	205520	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Oh ! ”
205522	205531	205519	205520	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ No — of course I did n’t ! ”
205687	205736	205737	205737	Harry	447	“ Ladies and gentlemen , in five minutes ’ time , I will be asking you to make your way down to the Quidditch field for the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament . Will the champions please follow Mr. Bagman down to the stadium now . ”
205778	205785	205786	205786	Bagman	221	“ Feeling all right , Harry ? ”
205799	205802	205786	205786	Bagman	221	“ Confident ? ”
205803	205808	205810	205810	Harry	447	“ I ’m okay , ”
206016	206029	206031	206032	Professor McGonagall	343	“ We are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze , ”
206037	206071	206031	206032	Professor McGonagall	343	“ If you get into difficulty , and wish to be rescued , send red sparks into the air , and one of us will come and get you , do you understand ? ”
206076	206083	206085	206085	Bagman	221	“ Off you go , then ! ”
206092	206098	206099	206099	Hagrid	198	“ Good luck , Harry , ”
206131	206134	206136	206136	his	221	“ Sonorus , ”
206145	206199	206136	206136	his	221	“ Ladies and gentlemen , the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament is about to begin ! Let me remind you how the points currently stand ! Tied in first place , with eighty - five points each — Mr. Cedric Diggory and Mr. Harry Potter , both of Hogwarts School ! ”
206216	206233	206257	206258	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ In second place , with eighty points — Mr. Viktor Krum , of Durmstrang Institute ! ”
206237	206251	206252	206252	Harry	447	“ And in third place — Miss Fleur Delacour , of Beauxbatons Academy ! ”
206290	206301	206303	206303	Bagman	221	“ So ... on my whistle , Harry and Cedric ! ”
206305	206312	206313	206313	He	221	“ Three — two — one — ”
206392	206395	206384	206384	He	447	“ Lumos , ”
206422	206426	206427	206427	Harry	447	“ See you , ”
206564	206568	206569	206569	he	447	“ Point Me , ”
206757	206765	206766	206766	he	238	“ Hagrid ’s Blast - Ended Skrewts ! ”
206769	206780	206766	206766	he	238	“ They ’re enormous — I only just got away ! ”

207201	207204	207205	207205	Harry	447	“ Fleur ? ”
207818	207821	207813	207813	he	447	“ Stupefy ! ”
207869	207872	207873	207873	Harry	447	“ Impedimenta ! ”
207898	207901	207888	207888	Harry	447	“ IMPEDIMENTA ! ”
208044	208050	208052	208052	Cedric	238	“ What are you doing ? ”
208056	208066	208052	208052	Cedric	238	“ What the hell d’you think you ’re doing ? ”
208075	208078	208071	208071	Krum	225	“ Crucio ! ”
208207	208210	208211	208211	Harry	447	“ Stupefy ! ”
208263	208269	208270	208270	Harry	447	“ Are you all right ? ”
208279	208282	208284	208284	Cedric	238	“ Yeah , ”
208286	208317	208284	208284	Cedric	238	“ Yeah ... I do n’t believe it ... he crept up behind me ... I heard him , I turned around , and he had his wand on me ... ”
208335	208349	208350	208350	Harry	447	“ I ca n’t believe this ... I thought he was all right , ”
208357	208362	208364	208364	Cedric	238	“ So did I , ”
208366	208374	208376	208376	Harry	447	“ Did you hear Fleur scream earlier ? ”
208378	208381	208383	208383	Cedric	238	“ Yeah , ”
208385	208395	208383	208383	Cedric	238	“ You do n’t think Krum got her too ? ”

208407	208414	208415	208415	Cedric	238	“ Should we leave him here ? ”
208418	208421	208423	208423	Harry	447	“ No , ”
208425	208451	208423	208423	Harry	447	“ I reckon we should send up red sparks . Someone’ll come and collect him ... otherwise he ’ll probably be eaten by a skrewt . ”
208452	208458	208459	208459	Cedric	238	“ He ’d deserve it , ”
208515	208526	208512	208512	Cedric	238	“ Well ... I s’pose we ’d better go on ... ”
208527	208530	208532	208532	Harry	447	“ What ? ”
208534	208541	208512	208512	Cedric	238	“ Oh ... yeah ... right ... ”
208867	208882	208857	208857	she	728	“ You are very near your goal . The quickest way is past me . ”
208883	208893	208895	208895	Harry	447	“ So ... so will you move , please ? ”
208906	208909	208910	208910	she	728	“ No , ”
208917	208956	208910	208910	she	728	“ Not unless you can answer my riddle . Answer on your first guess — I let you pass . Answer wrongly — I attack . Remain silent — I will let you walk away from me unscathed . ”
209014	209017	209018	209018	he	447	“ Okay , ”
209021	209028	209018	209018	he	447	“ Can I hear the riddle ? ”
209049	209132	209034	209034	her	4523	“ First think of the person who lives in disguise , Who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies . Next , tell me what ’s always the last thing to mend , The middle of middle and end of the end ? And finally give me the sound often heard During the search for a hard - to - find word . Now string them together , and answer me this , Which creature would you be unwilling to kiss ? ”
209138	209148	209149	209149	he	447	“ Could I have it again ... more slowly ? ”
209165	209181	209182	209182	Harry	447	“ All the clues add up to a creature I would n’t want to kiss ? ”
209197	209200	209185	209185	She	4523	“ yes . ”
209250	209256	209257	209257	Harry	447	“ A person in disguise , ”
209264	209309	209310	209310	She	4523	“ who lies ... er ... that ’d be a — an imposter . No , that ’s not my guess ! A — a spy ? I ’ll come back to that ... could you give me the next clue again , please ? ”
209319	209328	209329	209329	Harry	447	“ ‘ The last thing to mend , ’ ”
209332	209352	209353	209353	She	4523	“ Er ... no idea ... ‘ middle of middle ’ ... could I have the last bit again ? ”
209361	209380	209382	209382	Harry	447	“ ‘ The sound often heard during the search for a hard - to - find word , ’ ”
209384	209405	209382	209382	Harry	447	“ Er ... that ’d be ... er ... hang on — ‘ er ’ ! Er ’s a sound ! ”
209412	209421	209423	209423	Harry	447	“ Spy ... er ... spy ... er ... ”
209430	209443	209423	209423	Harry	447	“ A creature I would n’t want to kiss ... a spider ! ”

210063	210066	210067	210067	Harry	447	“ No , ”

210167	210178	210162	210162	Harry	447	“ Go on , take it . You ’re there . ”
210240	210260	210234	210234	Cedric	238	“ You take it . You should win . That ’s twice you ’ve saved my neck in here . ”
210261	210272	210273	210273	Harry	447	“ That ’s not how it ’s supposed to work , ”
210325	210358	210359	210359	Cedric	238	“ The one who reaches the cup first gets the points . That ’s you . I ’m telling you , I ’m not going to win any races on this leg . ”
210379	210382	210383	210383	he	238	“ No , ”
210386	210391	210393	210393	Harry	447	“ Stop being noble , ”
210396	210409	210393	210393	Harry	447	“ Just take it , then we can get out of here . ”
210422	210430	210431	210431	Cedric	238	“ You told me about the dragons , ”
210434	210454	210431	210431	Cedric	238	“ I would ’ve gone down in the first task if you had n’t told me what was coming . ”
210455	210463	210464	210464	Harry	447	“ I had help on that too , ”
210478	210490	210464	210464	Harry	447	“ You helped me with the egg — we ’re square . ”
210491	210503	210505	210505	Cedric	238	“ I had help on the egg in the first place , ”
210507	210513	210515	210515	Harry	447	“ We ’re still square , ”
210544	210556	210558	210558	Cedric	238	“ You should ’ve got more points on the second task , ”
210561	210577	210558	210558	Cedric	238	“ You stayed behind to get all the hostages . I should ’ve done that . ”
210578	210594	210596	210596	Harry	447	“ I was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously ! ”
210599	210605	210596	210596	Harry	447	“ Just take the cup ! ”
210606	210609	210611	210611	Cedric	238	“ No , ”
210651	210655	210656	210656	Cedric	238	“ Go on , ”
210766	210771	210772	210772	Harry	447	“ Both of us , ”
210775	210778	210772	210772	Harry	447	“ What ? ”
210779	210802	210803	210803	Cedric	238	“ We ’ll take it at the same time . It ’s still a Hogwarts victory . We ’ll tie for it . ”
210813	210819	210808	210808	He	447	“ You — you sure ? ”
210820	210823	210825	210825	Harry	447	“ Yeah , ”
210827	210853	210825	210825	Harry	447	“ Yeah ... we ’ve helped each other out , have n’t we ? We both got here . Let ’s just take it together . ”
210877	210882	210883	210883	he	238	“ You ’re on , ”
210886	210890	210883	210883	he	238	“ Come here . ”
210932	210938	210940	210940	Harry	447	“ On three , right ? ”
210942	210949	210950	210950	He	447	“ One — two — three — ”
211042	211047	211048	211048	he	447	“ Where are we ? ”
211167	211178	211179	211179	he	238	“ Did anyone tell you the Cup was a Portkey ? ”
211182	211185	211187	211187	Harry	447	“ Nope , ”
211204	211215	211189	211189	He	447	“ Is this supposed to be part of the task ? ”
211216	211220	211222	211222	Cedric	238	“ I dunno , ”
211229	211236	211224	211224	He	238	“ Wands out , d’you reckon ? ”
211237	211240	211242	211242	Harry	447	“ Yeah , ”
211282	211287	211288	211288	he	447	“ Someone ’s coming , ”
211547	211552	211581	211581	Harry	447	“ Kill the spare . ”
211569	211573	211581	211581	Harry	447	“ Avada Kedavra ! ”
211837	211840	211841	211841	he	447	“ You ! ”
212322	212325	212313	212313	Harry	447	“ Hurry ! ”
212346	212353	212359	212361	the cold voice	708	“ It is ready , Master . ”
212354	212357	212359	212361	the cold voice	708	“ Now ... ”
212670	212685	212655	212655	He	171	“ Bone of the father , unknowingly given , you will renew your son ! ”
212776	212796	212797	212797	He	171	“ Flesh — of the servant — w - willingly given — you will — revive — your master . ”
212966	212984	212958	212958	Wormtail	171	“ B - blood of the enemy ... forcibly taken ... you will ... resurrect your foe . ”
213293	213297	213299	213307	the high , cold voice from behind the steam	4581	“ Robe me , ”
213633	213637	213638	213638	he	171	“ My Lord ... ”
213641	213652	213638	213638	he	171	“ my Lord ... you promised ... you did promise ... ”
213653	213659	213661	213661	Voldemort	176	“ Hold out your arm , ”
213664	213673	213674	213674	He	171	“ Oh Master ... thank you , Master ... ”
213685	213692	213681	213681	Voldemort	176	“ The other arm , Wormtail . ”
213693	213700	213701	213701	Voldemort	176	“ Master , please ... please ... ”
213780	213785	213786	213786	he	176	“ It is back , ”
213790	213810	213786	213786	he	176	“ they will all have noticed it ... and now , we shall see ... now we shall know ... ”
213891	213905	213906	213906	he	176	“ How many will be brave enough to return when they feel it ? ”
213918	213930	213906	213906	he	176	“ And how many will be foolish enough to stay away ? ”
213972	213987	213988	213988	he	176	“ You stand , Harry Potter , upon the remains of my late father , ”
213992	214044	213988	213988	he	176	“ A Muggle and a fool ... very like your dear mother . But they both had their uses , did they not ? Your mother died to defend you as a child ... and I killed my father , and see how useful he has proved himself , in death ... ”
214073	214128	214129	214129	He	4587	“ You see that house upon the hillside , Potter ? My father lived there . My mother , a witch who lived here in this village , fell in love with him . But he abandoned her when she told him what she was ... He did n’t like magic , my father ... “
214188	214202	214185	214186	Tom Riddle	567	” Still he paced , his red eyes darting from grave to grave . “
214211	214216	214219	214219	I	0	” he said quietly , “
214235	214326	214327	214327	Master	5398	” The air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks . Between graves , behind the yew tree , in every shadowy space , wizards were Apparating . All of them were hooded and masked . And one by one they moved forward ... slowly , cautiously , as though they could hardly believe their eyes . Voldemort stood in silence , waiting for them . Then one of the Death Eaters fell to his knees , crawled toward Voldemort , and kissed the hem of his black robes . “
214331	214446	214329	214329	Master	5398	” he murmured . The Death Eaters behind him did the same ; each of them approaching Voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes , before backing away and standing up , forming a silent circle , which enclosed Tom Riddle ’s grave , Harry , Voldemort , and the sobbing and twitching heap that was Wormtail . Yet they left gaps in the circle , as though waiting for more people . Voldemort , however , did not seem to expect more . He looked around at the hooded faces , and though there was no wind , a rustling seemed to run around the circle , as though it had shivered . “
214452	214457	214449	214450	Death Eaters	320	” said Voldemort quietly . “
214494	214511	214512	214512	I	0	” He put back his terrible face and sniffed , his slit - like nostrils widening . “
214516	214520	214512	214512	I	0	” he said . “
214531	214559	214560	214560	I	0	” A second shiver ran around the circle , as though each member of it longed , but did not dare , to step back from him . “
214606	214630	214632	214632	I	0	” No one spoke . No one moved except Wormtail , who was upon the ground , still sobbing over his bleeding arm . “
214636	214640	214632	214632	I	0	” whispered Voldemort , “
214672	214734	214662	214662	they	4596	“ And then I ask myself , but how could they have believed I would not rise again ? They , who knew the steps I took , long ago , to guard myself against mortal death ? They , who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living ? “
214780	214808	214777	214778	Albus Dumbledore	187	” At the mention of Dumbledore ’s name , the members of the circle stirred , and some muttered and shook their heads . Voldemort ignored them . “
214821	214848	214849	214849	Master	5398	” One of the men suddenly flung himself forward , breaking the circle . Trembling from head to foot , he collapsed at Voldemort ’s feet . “
214851	214855	214856	214856	Master	5398	” he shrieked , “
214865	214876	214877	214877	Crucio	568	” Voldemort began to laugh . He raised his wand . “
214879	214932	214936	214936	Avery	523	” The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked ; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around ... Let the police come , he thought desperately ... anyone ... anything ... Voldemort raised his wand . The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground , gasping . “
214938	214943	214936	214936	Avery	523	” said Voldemort softly . “
214993	215005	214991	214991	Wormtail	171	” He looked down at Wormtail , who continued to sob . “
215040	215041	215032	215032	You	523	” “
215046	215050	215044	215044	Master	5398	” moaned Wormtail , “
215057	215058	215053	215053	Master	5398	” “
215068	215080	215060	215060	you	523	” said Voldemort coolly , watching Wormtail sob on the ground . “
215099	215227	215228	215229	My Lord	5037	” Voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air . A streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wand ’s wake . Momentarily shapeless , it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand , bright as moonlight , which soared downward and fixed itself upon Wormtail ’s bleeding wrist . Wormtail ’s sobbing stopped abruptly . His breathing harsh and ragged , he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand , now attached seamlessly to his arm , as though he were wearing a dazzling glove . He flexed the shining fingers , then , trembling , picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powder . “
215231	215235	215236	215236	Master	4608	” he whispered . “
215248	215264	215246	215246	you	4608	” He scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of Voldemort ’s robes . “
215274	215278	215272	215272	Wormtail	171	” said Voldemort . “
215289	215325	215326	215326	Lucius	281	” Wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle , staring at his powerful new hand , his face still shining with tears . Voldemort now approached the man on Wormtail ’s right . “
215332	215340	215326	215326	Lucius	281	” he whispered , halting before him . “
215421	215422	215423	215424	My Lord	5037	” “
215433	215445	215426	215426	I	0	” came Lucius Malfoy ’s voice swiftly from beneath the hood . “
215475	215476	215460	215460	I	0	” “
215498	215510	215479	215479	you	281	” said Voldemort lazily , and Mr. Malfoy stopped talking abruptly . “
215535	215536	215540	215541	my Lord	5037	” “
215553	215580	215546	215546	You	281	” Voldemort moved on , and stopped , staring at the space — large enough for two people — that separated Malfoy and the next man . “
215587	215592	215581	215582	The Lestranges	569	” said Voldemort quietly . “
215667	215692	215693	215693	Macnair	570	” He walked on . Some of the Death Eaters he passed in silence , but he paused before others and spoke to them . “
215725	215726	215720	215721	Lord Voldemort	176	” “
215735	215739	215733	215733	you	176	” murmured Macnair . “
215742	215754	215755	215755	we	4625	” — Voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures — “
215777	215785	215773	215773	you	523	” They bowed clumsily , muttering dully . “
215790	215791	215792	215792	We	4625	” “
215797	215798	215795	215795	Master	5398	” “
215807	215824	215805	215805	Nott	523	” said Voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in Mr. Goyle ’s shadow . “
215840	215841	215834	215834	I	0	” “
215846	215880	215834	215834	I	0	” said Voldemort . He had reached the largest gap of all , and he stood surveying it with his blank , red eyes , as though he could see people standing there . “
215943	215963	215964	215964	He	5267	” The Death Eaters stirred , and Harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their masks . “
215987	215990	215997	215997	his	176	“ Yes , ”
216012	216038	215997	215997	his	176	“ Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party . One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor . ”
216067	216099	216057	216058	Lucius Malfoy	281	“ Master , we crave to know ... we beg you to tell us ... how you have achieved this ... this miracle ... how you managed to return to us ... ”
216100	216111	216113	216113	Voldemort	176	“ Ah , what a story it is , Lucius , ”
216115	216129	216130	216130	He	176	“ And it begins — and ends — with my young friend here . ”
216161	216177	216178	216178	Voldemort	176	“ You know , of course , that they have called this boy my downfall ? ”
216202	216255	216260	216260	his	176	“ You all know that on the night I lost my powers and my body , I tried to kill him . His mother died in the attempt to save him — and unwittingly provided him with a protection I admit I had not foreseen ... I could not touch the boy . ”
216274	216314	216260	216260	his	176	“ His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice ... This is old magic , I should have remembered it , I was foolish to overlook it ... but no matter . I can touch him now . ”
216357	216539	216338	216338	Voldemort	176	“ I miscalculated , my friends , I admit it . My curse was deflected by the woman ’s foolish sacrifice , and it rebounded upon myself . Aaah ... pain beyond pain , my friends ; nothing could have prepared me for it . I was ripped from my body , I was less than spirit , less than the meanest ghost ... but still , I was alive . What I was , even I do not know ... I , who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality . You know my goal — to conquer death . And now , I was tested , and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked ... for I had not been killed , though the curse should have done it . Nevertheless , I was as powerless as the weakest creature alive , and without the means to help myself ... for I had no body , and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand ... “
216612	216635	216607	216607	I	0	” The shiver ran once more around the circle of listening Death Eaters . Voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuing . “
216728	216867	216885	216887	The Death Eaters	1643	“ Then ... four years ago ... the means for my return seemed assured . A wizard — young , foolish , and gullible — wandered across my path in the forest I had made my home . Oh , he seemed the very chance I had been dreaming of ... for he was a teacher at Dumbledore ’s school ... he was easy to bend to my will ... he brought me back to this country , and after a while , I took possession of his body , to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders . But my plan failed . I did not manage to steal the Sorcerer ’s Stone . I was not to be assured immortal life . I was thwarted ... thwarted , once again , by Harry Potter ... ”
216906	216928	216929	216929	Voldemort	176	“ The servant died when I left his body , and I was left as weak as ever I had been , ”
216932	217008	216929	216929	Voldemort	176	“ I returned to my hiding place far away , and I will not pretend to you that I did n’t then fear that I might never regain my powers ... Yes , that was perhaps my darkest hour ... I could not hope that I would be sent another wizard to possess ... and I had given up hope , now , that any of my Death Eaters cared what had become of me ... ”
217028	217172	217023	217023	Voldemort	176	“ And then , not even a year ago , when I had almost abandoned hope , it happened at last ... a servant returned to me . Wormtail here , who had faked his own death to escape justice , was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends , and decided to return to his master . He sought me in the country where it had long been rumored I was hiding ... helped , of course , by the rats he met along the way . Wormtail has a curious affinity with rats , do you not , Wormtail ? His filthy little friends told him there was a place , deep in an Albanian forest , that they avoided , where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them ... “
217239	217340	217341	217341	She	177	“ Now see the way that fate favors Lord Voldemort . This might have been the end of Wormtail , and of my last hope for regeneration . But Wormtail — displaying a presence of mind I would never have expected from him — convinced Bertha Jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll . He overpowered her ... he brought her to me . And Bertha Jorkins , who might have ruined all , proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams ... for — with a little persuasion — she became a veritable mine of information . “
217444	217458	217439	217439	I	0	” Voldemort smiled his terrible smile , his red eyes blank and pitiless . “
217567	217579	217565	217565	Nagini	172	” Voldemort ’s red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake , “
217610	217673	217674	217674	I	0	“ There was no hope of stealing the Sorcerer ’s Stone anymore , for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed . But I was willing to embrace mortal life again , before chasing immortality . I set my sights lower ... I would settle for my old body back again , and my old strength . “
217726	217853	217718	217718	Wormtail	171	“ My father ’s bone , naturally , meant that we would have to come here , where he was buried . But the blood of a foe ... Wormtail would have had me use any wizard , would you not , Wormtail ? Any wizard who had hated me ... as so many of them still do . But I knew the one I must use , if I was to rise again , more powerful than I had been when I had fallen . I wanted Harry Potter ’s blood . I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago ... for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too ... “
218010	218119	218120	218120	Voldemort	176	“ Why ... by using Bertha Jorkins ’s information , of course . Use my one faithful Death Eater , stationed at Hogwarts , to ensure that the boy ’s name was entered into the Goblet of Fire . Use my Death Eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament — that he touched the Triwizard Cup first — the Cup which my Death Eater had turned into a Portkey , which would bring him here , beyond the reach of Dumbledore ’s help and protection , and into my waiting arms . And here he is ... the boy you all believed had been my downfall ... ”
218135	218138	218130	218130	He	176	“ Crucio ! ”
218237	218261	218263	218263	Voldemort	176	“ You see , I think , how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me , ”
218265	218364	218365	218365	he	176	“ But I want there to be no mistake in anybody ’s mind . Harry Potter escaped me by a lucky chance . And I am now going to prove my power by killing him , here and now , in front of you all , when there is no Dumbledore to help him , and no mother to die for him . I will give him his chance . He will be allowed to fight , and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger . Just a little longer , Nagini , ”
218384	218398	218378	218380	the Death Eaters	1643	“ Now untie him , Wormtail , and give him back his wand . ”
218564	218576	218581	218581	his	176	“ You have been taught how to duel , Harry Potter ? ”
218625	218627	218581	218581	his	176	“ Expelliarmus ”
218718	218727	218729	218729	Voldemort	176	“ We bow to each other , Harry , ”
218744	218767	218737	218737	his	176	“ Come , the niceties must be observed ... Dumbledore would like you to show manners ... Bow to death , Harry ... ”
218811	218817	218818	218818	Voldemort	176	“ I said , bow , ”
218853	218857	218864	218864	he	176	“ Very good , ”
218877	218900	218864	218864	he	176	“ And now you face me , like a man ... straight - backed and proud , the way your father died ... “
218907	219047	218864	218864	he	176	” Voldemort raised his wand , and before Harry could do anything to defend himself , before he could even move , he had been hit again by the Cruciatus Curse . The pain was so intense , so all - consuming , that he no longer knew where he was ... White - hot knives were piercing every inch of his skin , his head was surely going to burst with pain , he was screaming more loudly than he ’d ever screamed in his life — And then it stopped . Harry rolled over and scrambled to his feet ; he was shaking as uncontrollably as Wormtail had done when his hand had been cut off ; he staggered sideways into the wall of watching Death Eaters , and they pushed him away , back toward Voldemort . “
219052	219065	218864	218864	he	176	” said Voldemort , the slit - like nostrils dilating with excitement , “
219092	219155	219090	219090	you	447	” Harry did n’t answer . He was going to die like Cedric , those pitiless red eyes were telling him so ... he was going to die , and there was nothing he could do about it ... but he was n’t going to play along . He was n’t going to obey Voldemort ... he was n’t going to beg ... “
219168	219173	219156	219156	I	0	” said Voldemort softly . “
219179	219276	219277	219277	I	0	” And Harry felt , for the third time in his life , the sensation that his mind had been wiped of all thought ... Ah , it was bliss , not to think , it was as though he were floating , dreaming ... just answer no ... say no ... just answer no ... I will not , said a stronger voice , in the back of his head , I wo n’t answer ... Just answer no ... I wo n’t do it , I wo n’t say it ... Just answer no ... “
219280	219344	219345	219345	You	447	” And these words burst from Harry ’s mouth ; they echoed through the graveyard , and the dream state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been thrown over him — back rushed the aches that the Cruciatus Curse had left all over his body — back rushed the realization of where he was , and what he was facing ... “
219349	219363	219345	219345	You	447	” said Voldemort quietly , and the Death Eaters were not laughing now . “
219392	219444	219445	219445	We	4683	” Voldemort raised his wand , but this time Harry was ready ; with the reflexes born of his Quidditch training , he flung himself sideways onto the ground ; he rolled behind the marble headstone of Voldemort ’s father , and he heard it crack as the curse missed him . “
219457	219475	219455	219455	Harry	447	” said Voldemort ’s soft , cold voice , drawing nearer , as the Death Eaters laughed . “
219541	219696	219536	219536	I	0	” Harry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had come . There was no hope ... no help to be had . And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still , he knew one thing only , and it was beyond fear or reason : He was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide - and - seek ; he was not going to die kneeling at Voldemort ’s feet ... he was going to die upright like his father , and he was going to die trying to defend himself , even if no defense was possible ... Before Voldemort could stick his snakelike face around the headstone , Harry stood up ... he gripped his wand tightly in his hand , thrust it out in front of him , and threw himself around the headstone , facing Voldemort . Voldemort was ready . As Harry shouted , “
219699	219703	219536	219536	I	0	” Voldemort cried , “
219707	219996	219536	219536	I	0	” A jet of green light issued from Voldemort ’s wand just as a jet of red light blasted from Harry ’s — they met in midair — and suddenly Harry ’s wand was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it ; his hand seized up around it ; he could n’t have released it if he ’d wanted to — and a narrow beam of light connected the two wands , neither red nor green , but bright , deep gold . Harry , following the beam with his astonished gaze , saw that Voldemort ’s long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating . And then — nothing could have prepared Harry for this — he felt his feet lift from the ground . He and Voldemort were both being raised into the air , their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light . They glided away from the tombstone of Voldemort ’s father and then came to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and free of graves ... The Death Eaters were shouting ; they were asking Voldemort for instructions ; they were closing in , reforming the circle around Harry and Voldemort , the snake slithering at their heels , some of them drawing their wands — The golden thread connecting Harry and Voldemort splintered ; though the wands remained connected , a thousand more beams arced high over Harry and Voldemort , crisscrossing all around them , until they were enclosed in a golden , dome - shaped web , a cage of light , beyond which the Death Eaters circled like jackals , their cries strangely muffled now ... “
220000	220058	219536	219536	I	0	” Voldemort shrieked to the Death Eaters , and Harry saw his red eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening , saw him fighting to break the thread of light still connecting his wand with Harry ’s ; Harry held onto his wand more tightly , with both hands , and the golden thread remained unbroken . “
220066	220752	220062	220062	I	0	” Voldemort shouted to the Death Eaters . And then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the air ... It was coming from every thread of the light - spun web vibrating around Harry and Voldemort . It was a sound Harry recognized , though he had heard it only once before in his life : phoenix song . It was the sound of hope to Harry ... the most beautiful and welcome thing he had ever heard in his life ... He felt as though the song were inside him instead of just around him ... It was the sound he connected with Dumbledore , and it was almost as though a friend were speaking in his ear ... Do n’t break the connection . I know , Harry told the music , I know I must n’t ... but no sooner had he thought it , than the thing became much harder to do . His wand began to vibrate more powerfully than ever ... and now the beam between him and Voldemort changed too ... it was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands — Harry felt his wand give a shudder under his hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his way ... The direction of the beam ’s movement was now toward him , from Voldemort , and he felt his wand shudder angrily ... As the closest bead of light moved nearer to Harry ’s wand - tip , the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame . The closer that bead moved , the harder Harry ’s wand vibrated ; he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it ; it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers — He concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back toward Voldemort , his ears full of phoenix song , his eyes furious , fixed ... and slowly , very slowly , the beads quivered to a halt , and then , just as slowly , they began to move the other way ... and it was Voldemort ’s wand that was vibrating extra - hard now ... Voldemort who looked astonished , and almost fearful ... One of the beads of light was quivering , inches from the tip of Voldemort ’s wand . Harry did n’t understand why he was doing it , did n’t know what it might achieve ... but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on forcing that bead of light right back into Voldemort ’s wand ... and slowly ... very slowly ... it moved along the golden thread ... it trembled for a moment ... and then it connected ... At once , Voldemort ’s wand began to emit echoing screams of pain ... then — Voldemort ’s red eyes widened with shock — a dense , smoky hand flew out of the tip of it and vanished ... the ghost of the hand he had made Wormtail ... more shouts of pain ... and then something much larger began to blossom from Voldemort ’s wand - tip , a great , grayish something , that looked as though it were made of the solidest , densest smoke ... It was a head ... now a chest and arms ... the torso of Cedric Diggory . If ever Harry might have released his wand from shock , it would have been then , but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly , so that the thread of golden light remained unbroken , even though the thick gray ghost of Cedric Diggory ( was it a ghost ? it looked so solid ) emerged in its entirety from the end of Voldemort ’s wand , as though it were squeezing itself out of a very narrow tunnel ... and this shade of Cedric stood up , and looked up and down the golden thread of light , and spoke . “
220758	220920	220756	220756	Harry	447	” it said . Its voice was distant and echoing . Harry looked at Voldemort ... his wide red eyes were still shocked ... he had no more expected this than Harry had ... and , very dimly , Harry heard the frightened yells of the Death Eaters , prowling around the edges of the golden dome ... More screams of pain from the wand ... and then something else emerged from its tip ... the dense shadow of a second head , quickly followed by arms and torso ... an old man Harry had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the wand just as Cedric had done ... and his ghost , or his shadow , or whatever it was , fell next to Cedric ’s , and surveyed Harry and Voldemort , and the golden web , and the connected wands , with mild surprise , leaning on his walking stick ... “
220929	220940	220923	220925	a real wizard	4686	” the old man said , his eyes on Voldemort . “
220954	221023	220948	220948	You	4688	” But already , yet another head was emerging ... and this head , gray as a smoky statue , was a woman ’s ... Harry , both arms shaking now as he fought to keep his wand still , saw her drop to the ground and straighten up like the others , staring ... The shadow of Bertha Jorkins surveyed the battle before her with wide eyes . “
221031	221049	220948	220948	You	4688	” she cried , and her voice echoed like Cedric ’s as though from very far away . “
221064	221235	221236	221237	Your father	5665	” She and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of the golden web , while the Death Eaters flitted around the outside of it ... and Voldemort ’s dead victims whispered as they circled the duelers , whispered words of encouragement to Harry , and hissed words Harry could n’t hear to Voldemort . And now another head was emerging from the tip of Voldemort ’s wand ... and Harry knew when he saw it who it would be ... he knew , as though he had expected it from the moment when Cedric had appeared from the wand ... knew , because the woman appearing was the one he ’d thought of more than any other tonight ... The smoky shadow of a young woman with long hair fell to the ground as Bertha had done , straightened up , and looked at him ... and Harry , his arms shaking madly now , looked back into the ghostly face of his mother . “
221241	221246	221236	221237	Your father	5665	” she said quietly . “
221262	221360	221236	221237	Your father	5665	” And he came ... first his head , then his body ... tall and untidy - haired like Harry , the smoky , shadowy form of James Potter blossomed from the end of Voldemort ’s wand , fell to the ground , and straightened like his wife . He walked close to Harry , looking down at him , and he spoke in the same distant , echoing voice as the others , but quietly , so that Voldemort , his face now livid with fear as his victims prowled around him , could not hear ... “
221401	221402	221399	221399	Harry	447	” “
221405	221428	221429	221429	Harry	447	” Harry gasped , fighting now to keep a hold on his wand , which was slipping and sliding beneath his fingers . “
221431	221438	221445	221445	you	447	” whispered the figure of Cedric , “
221455	221456	221457	221457	I	0	” “
221460	221476	221457	221457	I	0	” said Harry , his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wand . “
221481	221488	221457	221457	I	0	” whispered his father ’s voice , “
221498	221499	221445	221445	you	447	” “
221502	221645	221445	221445	you	447	” Harry yelled ; he did n’t think he could have held on for another moment anyway — he pulled his wand upward with an almighty wrench , and the golden thread broke ; the cage of light vanished , the phoenix song died — but the shadowy figures of Voldemort ’s victims did not disappear — they were closing in upon Voldemort , shielding Harry from his gaze — And Harry ran as he had never run in his life , knocking two stunned Death Eaters aside as he passed ; he zigzagged behind headstones , feeling their curses following him , hearing them hit the headstones — he was dodging curses and graves , pelting toward Cedric ’s body , no longer aware of the pain in his leg , his whole being concentrated on what he had to do — “
221649	221701	221445	221445	you	447	” he heard Voldemort scream . Ten feet from Cedric , Harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it . Gripping his wand more tightly , he dashed out from behind the angel — “
221704	221787	221445	221445	you	447	” he bellowed , pointing his wand wildly over his shoulder at the Death Eaters running at him . From a muffled yell , he thought he had stopped at least one of them , but there was no time to stop and look ; he jumped over the Cup and dived as he heard more wand blasts behind him ; more jets of light flew over his head as he fell , stretching out his hand to grab Cedric ’s arm — “
221800	221862	221791	221791	I	0	” shrieked Voldemort . Harry ’s hand had closed on Cedric ’s wrist ; one tombstone stood between him and Voldemort , but Cedric was too heavy to carry , and the Cup was out of reach — Voldemort ’s red eyes flamed in the darkness . Harry saw his mouth curl into a smile , saw him raise his wand . “
221865	221943	221791	221791	I	0	” Harry yelled , pointing his wand at the Triwizard Cup . It flew into the air and soared toward him . Harry caught it by the handle — He heard Voldemort ’s scream of fury at the same moment that he felt the jerk behind his navel that meant the Portkey had worked — it was speeding him away in a whirl of wind and color , and Cedric along with him ... They were going back .
222183	222188	222189	222189	He	447	“ Harry ! Harry ! ”
222310	222315	222316	222316	Harry	447	“ He ’s back , ”
222319	222326	222316	222316	Harry	447	“ He ’s back . Voldemort . ”
222327	222337	222341	222342	Cornelius Fudge	280	“ What ’s going on ? What ’s happened ? ”
222355	222361	222316	222316	Harry	447	“ My God — Diggory ! ”
222365	222372	222316	222316	Harry	447	“ Dumbledore — he ’s dead ! ”
222405	222410	222394	222394	others	1186	“ He ’s dead ! ”
222411	222416	222394	222394	others	1186	“ He ’s dead ! ”
222417	222423	222394	222394	others	1186	“ Cedric Diggory ! Dead ! ”
222424	222432	222435	222435	Fudge	280	“ Harry , let go of him , ”
222477	222494	222463	222463	Dumbledore	187	“ Harry , you ca n’t help him now . It ’s over . Let go . ”
222495	222504	222505	222505	Harry	447	“ He wanted me to bring him back , ”
222515	222527	222505	222505	Harry	447	“ He wanted me to bring him back to his parents ... ”
222528	222540	222541	222541	Dumbledore	187	“ That ’s right , Harry ... just let go now ... ”
222604	222609	222587	222590	The crowd around them	4708	“ What ’s happened ? ”
222610	222617	222587	222590	The crowd around them	4708	“ What ’s wrong with him ? ”
222618	222623	222587	222590	The crowd around them	4708	“ Diggory ’s dead ! ”
222624	222635	222636	222636	Fudge	280	“ He ’ll need to go to the hospital wing ! ”
222641	222666	222636	222636	Fudge	280	“ He ’s ill , he ’s injured — Dumbledore , Diggory ’s parents , they ’re here , they ’re in the stands ... ”
222667	222680	222587	222590	The crowd around them	4708	“ I ’ll take Harry , Dumbledore , I ’ll take him — ”
222681	222688	222587	222590	The crowd around them	4708	“ No , I would prefer — ”
222689	222716	222636	222636	Fudge	280	“ Dumbledore , Amos Diggory ’s running ... he ’s coming over ... Do n’t you think you should tell him — before he sees — ? ”
222717	222723	222587	222590	The crowd around them	4708	“ Harry , stay here — ”
222740	222759	222636	222636	Fudge	280	“ It ’s all right , son , I ’ve got you ... come on ... hospital wing ... ”
222760	222765	222767	222767	Harry	447	“ Dumbledore said stay , ”
222795	222806	222822	222824	the frightened crowd	4711	“ You need to lie down ... Come on now ... ”
222879	222885	222886	222887	the man	1756	“ What happened , Harry ? ”
222913	222919	222921	222921	Harry	447	“ Cup was a Portkey , ”
222929	222946	222921	222921	Harry	447	“ Took me and Cedric to a graveyard ... and Voldemort was there ... Lord Voldemort ... ”
222958	222969	222892	222892	he	1756	“ The Dark Lord was there ? What happened then ? ”
222970	222978	222892	222892	he	1756	“ Killed Cedric ... they killed Cedric ... ”
222979	222983	222984	222984	Clunk	571	“ And then ? ”
222994	223004	222892	222892	he	1756	“ Made a potion ... got his body back ... ”
223005	223018	222892	222892	he	1756	“ The Dark Lord got his body back ? He ’s returned ? ”
223019	223031	222892	222892	he	1756	“ And the Death Eaters came ... and then we dueled ... ”
223032	223040	222892	222892	he	1756	“ You dueled with the Dark Lord ? ”
223041	223066	222892	222892	he	1756	“ Got away ... my wand ... did something funny ... I saw my mum and dad ... they came out of his wand ... ”
223067	223090	223091	223091	Harry	447	“ In here , Harry ... in here , and sit down ... You ’ll be all right now ... drink this ... ”
223109	223133	223134	223134	Moody	332	“ Drink it ... you ’ll feel better ... come on , now , Harry , I need to know exactly what happened ... ”
223188	223208	223168	223168	He	332	“ Voldemort ’s back , Harry ? You ’re sure he ’s back ? How did he do it ? ”
223209	223226	223228	223228	Harry	447	“ He took stuff from his father ’s grave , and from Wormtail , and me , ”
223272	223282	223284	223284	Moody	332	“ What did the Dark Lord take from you ? ”
223286	223289	223291	223291	Harry	447	“ Blood , ”
223321	223330	223312	223312	his	332	“ And the Death Eaters ? They returned ? ”
223331	223334	223336	223336	Harry	447	“ Yes , ”
223338	223343	223336	223336	Harry	447	“ Loads of them ... ”
223344	223351	223352	223352	Moody	332	“ How did he treat them ? ”
223356	223362	223352	223352	Moody	332	“ Did he forgive them ? ”
223382	223418	223375	223375	he	447	“ There ’s a Death Eater at Hogwarts ! There ’s a Death Eater here — they put my name in the Goblet of Fire , they made sure I got through to the end — ”
223432	223441	223442	223442	he	332	“ I know who the Death Eater is , ”
223446	223449	223451	223451	Harry	447	“ Karkaroff ? ”
223454	223469	223451	223451	Harry	447	“ Where is he ? Have you got him ? Is he locked up ? ”
223470	223473	223475	223475	Moody	332	“ Karkaroff ? ”
223481	223531	223475	223475	Moody	332	“ Karkaroff fled tonight , when he felt the Dark Mark burn upon his arm . He betrayed too many faithful supporters of the Dark Lord to wish to meet them ... but I doubt he will get far . The Dark Lord has ways of tracking his enemies . ”
223532	223554	223451	223451	Harry	447	“ Karkaroff ’s gone ? He ran away ? But then — he did n’t put my name in the goblet ? ”
223555	223558	223560	223560	Moody	332	“ No , ”
223563	223577	223560	223560	Moody	332	“ No , he did n’t . It was I who did that . ”
223586	223593	223594	223594	he	447	“ No , you did n’t , ”
223597	223610	223594	223594	he	447	“ You did n’t do that ... you ca n’t have done ... ”
223611	223618	223620	223620	Moody	332	“ I assure you I did , ”
223665	223672	223673	223673	he	332	“ He forgave them , then ? ”
223676	223690	223673	223673	he	332	“ The Death Eaters who went free ? The ones who escaped Azkaban ? ”
223691	223694	223696	223696	Harry	447	“ What ? ”
223721	223726	223728	223728	Moody	332	“ I asked you , ”
223731	223796	223728	223728	Moody	332	“ whether he forgave the scum who never even went to look for him . Those treacherous cowards who would n’t even brave Azkaban for him . The faithless , worthless bits of filth who were brave enough to cavort in masks at the Quidditch World Cup , but fled at the sight of the Dark Mark when I fired it into the sky . ”
223797	223808	223673	223673	he	332	“ You fired ... What are you talking about ... ? ”
223809	223876	223877	223877	Moody	332	“ I told you , Harry ... I told you . If there ’s one thing I hate more than any other , it ’s a Death Eater who walked free . They turned their backs on my master when he needed them most . I expected him to punish them . I expected him to torture them . Tell me he hurt them , Harry ... ”
223888	223920	223877	223877	Moody	332	“ Tell me he told them that I , I alone remained faithful ... prepared to risk everything to deliver to him the one thing he wanted above all ... you . ”
223921	223934	223673	223673	he	332	“ You did n’t ... it — it ca n’t be you ... ”
223935	224008	224009	224009	Moody	332	“ Who put your name in the Goblet of Fire , under the name of a different school ? I did . Who frightened off every person I thought might try to hurt you or prevent you from winning the tournament ? I did . Who nudged Hagrid into showing you the dragons ? I did . Who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon ? I did . ”
224034	224184	224025	224025	His	447	“ It has n’t been easy , Harry , guiding you through these tasks without arousing suspicion . I have had to use every ounce of cunning I possess , so that my hand would not be detectable in your success . Dumbledore would have been very suspicious if you had managed everything too easily . As long as you got into that maze , preferably with a decent head start — then , I knew , I would have a chance of getting rid of the other champions and leaving your way clear . But I also had to contend with your stupidity . The second task ... that was when I was most afraid we would fail . I was keeping watch on you , Potter . I knew you had n’t worked out the egg ’s clue , so I had to give you another hint — ”
224185	224190	224191	224191	Harry	447	“ You did n’t , ”
224195	224202	224191	224191	Harry	447	“ Cedric gave me the clue — ”
224203	224387	224025	224025	His	447	“ Who told Cedric to open it underwater ? I did . I trusted that he would pass the information on to you . Decent people are so easy to manipulate , Potter . I was sure Cedric would want to repay you for telling him about the dragons , and so he did . But even then , Potter , even then you seemed likely to fail . I was watching all the time ... all those hours in the library . Did n’t you realize that the book you needed was in your dormitory all along ? I planted it there early on , I gave it to the Longbottom boy , do n’t you remember ? Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean . It would have told you all you needed to know about gillyweed . I expected you to ask everyone and anyone you could for help . Longbottom would have told you in an instant . But you did not ... you did not ... You have a streak of pride and independence that might have ruined all . “
224479	224509	224510	224510	You	4727	” Moody ’s wand was still pointing directly at Harry ’s heart . Over his shoulder , foggy shapes were moving in the Foe - Glass on the wall . “
224547	224567	224569	224569	Moody	332	“ You had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight , of course , ”
224571	224627	224569	224569	Moody	332	“ I was patrolling around it , able to see through the outer hedges , able to curse many obstacles out of your way . I Stunned Fleur Delacour as she passed . I put the Imperius Curse on Krum , so that he would finish Diggory and leave your path to the Cup clear . ”
224719	224738	224740	224740	Moody	332	“ The Dark Lord did n’t manage to kill you , Potter , and he so wanted to , ”
224742	224807	224740	224740	Moody	332	“ Imagine how he will reward me when he finds I have done it for him . I gave you to him — the thing he needed above all to regenerate — and then I killed you for him . I will be honored beyond all other Death Eaters . I will be his dearest , his closest supporter ... closer than a son ... ”
224840	224847	224849	224849	Moody	332	“ The Dark Lord and I , ”
224867	224932	224852	224852	he	332	“ have much in common . Both of us , for instance , had very disappointing fathers ... very disappointing indeed . Both of us suffered the indignity , Harry , of being named after those fathers . And both of us had the pleasure ... the very great pleasure ... of killing our fathers to ensure the continued rise of the Dark Order ! ”
224933	224938	224939	224939	Harry	447	“ You ’re mad , ”
224948	224953	224939	224939	Harry	447	“ you ’re mad ! ”
224954	224960	224962	224962	Moody	332	“ Mad , am I ? ”
224969	225015	224964	224964	his	332	“ We ’ll see ! We ’ll see who ’s mad , now that the Dark Lord has returned , with me at his side ! He is back , Harry Potter , you did not conquer him — and now — I conquer you ! ”
225035	225038	225026	225026	Harry	447	“ Stupefy ! ”
225293	225299	225300	225300	she	343	“ Come along , Potter , ”
225319	225326	225313	225313	she	343	“ Come along ... hospital wing ... ”
225327	225330	225332	225332	Dumbledore	187	“ No , ”
225335	225353	225332	225332	Dumbledore	187	“ Dumbledore , he ought to — look at him — he ’s been through enough tonight — ”
225354	225367	225369	225369	Dumbledore	187	“ He will stay , Minerva , because he needs to understand , ”
225372	225409	225369	225369	Dumbledore	187	“ Understanding is the first step to acceptance , and only with acceptance can there be recovery . He needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered tonight , and why . ”
225410	225413	225414	225414	Harry	447	“ Moody , ”
225427	225435	225417	225417	He	447	“ How can it have been Moody ? ”
225436	225443	225445	225445	Dumbledore	187	“ This is not Alastor Moody , ”
225448	225485	225445	225445	Dumbledore	187	“ You have never known Alastor Moody . The real Moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight . The moment he took you , I knew — and I followed . ”
225527	225603	225525	225525	Snape	357	“ Severus , please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion you possess , and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the house - elf called Winky . Minerva , kindly go down to Hagrid ’s house , where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch . Take the dog up to my office , tell him I will be with him shortly , then come back here . ”
225885	225897	225898	225898	he	187	“ Stunned — controlled by the Imperius Curse — very weak , ”
225901	225943	225880	225880	He	187	“ Of course , they would have needed to keep him alive . Harry , throw down the imposter ’s cloak — he ’s freezing . Madam Pomfrey will need to see him , but he seems in no immediate danger . ”
226002	226008	226010	226010	Dumbledore	187	“ Polyjuice Potion , Harry , ”
226012	226071	226010	226010	Dumbledore	187	“ You see the simplicity of it , and the brilliance . For Moody never does drink except from his hip flask , he ’s well known for it . The imposter needed , of course , to keep the real Moody close by , so that he could continue making the potion . You see his hair ... ”
226082	226137	226072	226072	Dumbledore	187	“ The imposter has been cutting it off all year , see where it is uneven ? But I think , in the excitement of tonight , our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he should have done ... on the hour ... every hour ... We shall see . ”
226387	226390	226391	226391	Snape	357	“ Crouch ! ”
226400	226404	226391	226391	Snape	357	“ Barty Crouch ! ”
226405	226409	226411	226412	Professor McGonagall	343	“ Good heavens , ”
226449	226462	226442	226442	she	278	“ Master Barty , Master Barty , what is you doing here ? ”
226474	226492	226465	226465	herself	278	“ You is killed him ! You is killed him ! You is killed Master ’s son ! ”
226493	226501	226503	226503	Dumbledore	187	“ He is simply Stunned , Winky , ”
226505	226518	226503	226503	Dumbledore	187	“ Step aside , please . Severus , you have the potion ? ”
226630	226633	226618	226618	he	187	“ Rennervate . ”
226662	226668	226650	226650	Dumbledore	187	“ Can you hear me ? ”
226679	226682	226683	226683	he	3874	“ Yes , ”
226686	226695	226697	226697	Dumbledore	187	“ I would like you to tell us , ”
226700	226715	226697	226697	Dumbledore	187	“ how you came to be here . How did you escape from Azkaban ? ”
226735	226817	226716	226716	Crouch	269	“ My mother saved me . She knew she was dying . She persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favor to her . He loved her as he had never loved me . He agreed . They came to visit me . They gave me a draught of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my mother ’s hairs . She took a draught of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my hairs . We took on each other ’s appearance . ”
226826	226846	226821	226821	her	278	“ Say no more , Master Barty , say no more , you is getting your father into trouble ! ”
226861	226910	226848	226848	Crouch	269	“ The dementors are blind . They sensed one healthy , one dying person entering Azkaban . They sensed one healthy , one dying person leaving it . My father smuggled me out , disguised as my mother , in case any prisoners were watching through their doors . “
226950	226957	226943	226943	Everyone	658	” The man ’s eyelids flickered . “
226974	226979	226968	226968	he	5665	” said Dumbledore quietly . “

227141	227148	227138	227139	Master Barty	573	” sobbed Winky through her hands . “

227175	227180	227166	227166	anybody	1900	” said Dumbledore softly . “

227197	227206	227166	227166	anybody	1900	” said Crouch , his eyelids flickering again . “
227316	227317	227308	227308	He	5772	” “
227331	227335	227320	227320	she	177	” sobbed Winky . “

227354	227358	227339	227339	she	177	” said Dumbledore . “
227366	227377	227378	227378	She	278	” said Crouch , still in the same monotonous voice . “
227465	227532	227459	227459	He	5772	“ It was carefully planned . My father led me and Winky up to the Top Box early in the day . Winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father . I was to sit there , invisible . When everyone had left the box , we would emerge . Winky would appear to be alone . Nobody would ever know . “
227660	227661	227654	227654	She	278	” “
227669	227679	227662	227663	Master Barty	573	” whispered Winky , tears trickling between her fingers . “
227686	227690	227681	227681	you	573	” said Dumbledore , “
227699	227700	227694	227694	you	573	” “
227708	227712	227701	227701	We	4813	” said Crouch . “

228045	228054	228038	228038	She	278	” Winky let out a wail of despair . “
228074	228092	228093	228093	My	0	” Crouch ’s head rolled on his neck , and an insane grin spread across his face . “
228099	228266	228093	228093	My	0	“ He arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant Wormtail . My master had found out that I was still alive . He had captured Bertha Jorkins in Albania . He had tortured her . She told him a great deal . She told him about the Triwizard Tournament . She told him the old Auror , Moody , was going to teach at Hogwarts . He tortured her until he broke through the Memory Charm my father had placed upon her . She told him I had escaped from Azkaban . She told him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from seeking my master . And so my master knew that I was still his faithful servant — perhaps the most faithful of all . My master conceived a plan , based upon the information Bertha had given him . He needed me . He arrived at our house near midnight . My father answered the door . ”
228304	228374	228297	228297	She	278	“ It was very quick . My father was placed under the Imperius Curse by my master . Now my father was the one imprisoned , controlled . My master forced him to go about his business as usual , to act as though nothing was wrong . And I was released . I awoke . I was myself again , alive as I had n’t been in years . ”
228375	228386	228388	228388	Dumbledore	187	“ And what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do ? ”
228390	228496	228388	228388	Dumbledore	187	“ He asked me whether I was ready to risk everything for him . I was ready . It was my dream , my greatest ambition , to serve him , to prove myself to him . He told me he needed to place a faithful servant at Hogwarts . A servant who would guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament without appearing to do so . A servant who would watch over Harry Potter . Ensure he reached the Triwizard Cup . Turn the Cup into a Portkey , which would take the first person to touch it to my master . But first — ”
228497	228503	228505	228505	Dumbledore	187	“ You needed Alastor Moody , ”
228519	228758	228514	228514	his	187	“ Wormtail and I did it . We had prepared the Polyjuice Potion beforehand . We journeyed to his house . Moody put up a struggle . There was a commotion . We managed to subdue him just in time . Forced him into a compartment of his own magical trunk . Took some of his hair and added it to the potion . I drank it ; I became Moody ’s double . I took his leg and his eye . I was ready to face Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had heard a disturbance . I made the dustbins move around the yard . I told Arthur Weasley I had heard intruders in my yard , who had set off the dustbins . Then I packed up Moody ’s clothes and Dark Detectors , put them in the trunk with Moody , and set off for Hogwarts . I kept him alive , under the Imperius Curse . I wanted to be able to question him . To find out about his past , learn his habits , so that I could fool even Dumbledore . I also needed his hair to make the Polyjuice Potion . The other ingredients were easy . I stole boomslang skin from the dungeons . When the Potions master found me in his office , I said I was under orders to search it . ”
228759	228770	228772	228772	Dumbledore	187	“ And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody ? ”
228774	228797	228772	228772	Dumbledore	187	“ Wormtail returned to care for my master , in my father ’s house , and to keep watch over my father . ”
228798	228804	228806	228806	Dumbledore	187	“ But your father escaped , ”
228808	228925	228806	228806	Dumbledore	187	“ Yes . After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I had done . There were periods when he knew what was happening . My master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the house . He forced him to send letters to the Ministry instead . He made him write and say he was ill . But Wormtail neglected his duty . He was not watchful enough . My father escaped . My master guessed that he was heading for Hogwarts . My father was going to tell Dumbledore everything , to confess . He was going to admit that he had smuggled me from Azkaban . “

I pulled on my Invisibility Cloak and went down to meet him . He was walking around the edge of the forest . Then Potter came , and Krum . I waited . I could not hurt Potter ; my master needed him . Potter ran to get Dumbledore . I Stunned Krum . I killed my father . ”
229147	229150	229152	229152	Winky	278	“ Noooo ! ”
229154	229166	229152	229152	Winky	278	“ Master Barty , Master Barty , what is you saying ? ”
229167	229173	229174	229174	Dumbledore	187	“ You killed your father , ”
229183	229192	229174	229174	Dumbledore	187	“ What did you do with the body ? ”
229193	229333	229152	229152	Winky	278	“ Carried it into the forest . Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak . I had the map with me . I watched Potter run into the castle . He met Snape . Dumbledore joined them . I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore out of the castle . I walked back out of the forest , doubled around behind them , went to meet them . I told Dumbledore , Snape had told me where to come . Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father . I went back to my father ’s body . Watched the map . When everyone was gone , I Transfigured my father ’s body . He became a bone ... I buried it , while wearing the Invisibility Cloak , in the freshly dug earth in front of Hagrid ’s cabin . ”
229351	229355	229348	229348	Dumbledore	187	“ And tonight ... ”
229356	229370	229372	229373	Barty Crouch	269	“ I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner , ”
229375	229406	229372	229373	Barty Crouch	269	“ Turned it into a Portkey . My master ’s plan worked . He is returned to power and I will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards . ”
229483	229500	229477	229477	He	187	“ Minerva , could I ask you to stand guard here while I take Harry upstairs ? ”
229501	229505	229507	229508	Professor McGonagall	343	“ Of course , ”
229546	229548	229540	229540	her	343	“ Severus ”
229555	229624	229550	229550	Dumbledore	187	“ please tell Madam Pomfrey to come down here ; we need to get Alastor Moody into the hospital wing . Then go down into the grounds , find Cornelius Fudge , and bring him up to this office . He will undoubtedly want to question Crouch himself . Tell him I will be in the hospital wing in half an hour ’s time if he needs me . ”
229635	229638	229639	229639	Dumbledore	187	“ Harry ? ”
229698	229712	229713	229713	he	187	“ I want you to come up to my office first , Harry , ”
229723	229731	229713	229713	he	187	“ Sirius is waiting for us there . ”
229853	229856	229857	229857	Harry	447	“ Professor , ”
229860	229868	229857	229857	Harry	447	“ where are Mr. and Mrs. Diggory ? ”
229869	229876	229878	229878	Dumbledore	187	“ They are with Professor Sprout , ”
229903	229917	229880	229880	His	187	“ She was Head of Cedric ’s House , and knew him best . ”
229986	230007	229980	229980	he	195	“ Harry , are you all right ? I knew it — I knew something like this — what happened ? ”
230024	230028	230029	230029	he	187	“ What happened ? ”
230119	230125	230127	230127	Harry	447	“ ’ Lo , Fawkes , ”
230200	230218	230220	230220	Dumbledore	187	“ I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze , Harry , ”
230222	230236	230238	230238	Sirius	195	“ We can leave that till morning , ca n’t we , Dumbledore ? ”
230251	230262	230241	230241	He	195	“ Let him have a sleep . Let him rest . ”
230302	230311	230312	230312	Dumbledore	187	“ If I thought I could help you , ”
230316	230402	230312	230312	Dumbledore	187	“ by putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight , I would do it . But I know better . Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it . You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you . I ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time . I ask you to tell us what happened . ”
230674	230692	230693	230693	Harry	447	“ He said my blood would make him stronger than if he ’d used someone else ’s , ”
230697	230734	230695	230695	Dumbledore	187	“ He said the protection my — my mother left in me — he ’d have it too . And he was right — he could touch me without hurting himself , he touched my face . ”
230792	230796	230797	230797	he	187	“ Very well , ”
230804	230818	230797	230797	he	187	“ Voldemort has overcome that particular barrier . Harry , continue , please . ”
230948	230953	230954	230954	he	195	“ The wands connected ? ”
230963	230966	230954	230954	he	195	“ Why ? ”
230983	230987	230988	230988	he	195	“ Priori Incantatem , ”
231012	231018	231020	231020	Sirius	195	“ The Reverse Spell effect ? ”
231023	231026	231028	231028	Dumbledore	187	“ Exactly , ”
231030	231061	231062	231062	he	195	“ Harry ’s wand and Voldemort ’s wand share cores . Each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix . This phoenix , in fact , ”
231084	231093	231094	231094	Harry	447	“ My wand ’s feather came from Fawkes ? ”
231099	231102	231104	231104	Dumbledore	187	“ Yes , ”
231106	231130	231104	231104	Dumbledore	187	“ Mr. Ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand , the moment you left his shop four years ago . ”
231131	231142	231144	231144	Sirius	195	“ So what happens when a wand meets its brother ? ”
231146	231156	231158	231158	Dumbledore	187	“ They will not work properly against each other , ”
231160	231215	231216	231216	He	195	“ If , however , the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle ... a very rare effect will take place . One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed — in reverse . The most recent first ... and then those which preceded it ... ”
231226	231230	231232	231232	Dumbledore	187	“ Which means , ”
231242	231252	231232	231232	Dumbledore	187	“ that some form of Cedric must have reappeared . ”
231257	231264	231266	231266	Sirius	195	“ Diggory came back to life ? ”
231269	231277	231279	231279	Dumbledore	187	“ No spell can reawaken the dead , ”
231282	231314	231279	231279	Dumbledore	187	“ All that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo . A shadow of the living Cedric would have emerged from the wand ... am I correct , Harry ? ”
231315	231321	231322	231322	Harry	447	“ He spoke to me , ”
231331	231345	231325	231325	He	447	“ The ... the ghost Cedric , or whatever he was , spoke . ”
231346	231350	231352	231352	Dumbledore	187	“ An echo , ”
231354	231379	231352	231352	Dumbledore	187	“ which retained Cedric ’s appearance and character . I am guessing other such forms appeared ... less recent victims of Voldemort ’s wand ... ”
231380	231385	231386	231386	Harry	447	“ An old man , ”
231394	231400	231386	231386	Harry	447	“ Bertha Jorkins . And ... ”
231401	231405	231407	231407	Dumbledore	187	“ Your parents ? ”
231410	231413	231415	231415	Harry	447	“ Yes , ”
231432	231440	231442	231442	Dumbledore	187	“ The last murders the wand performed , ”
231446	231481	231482	231482	Harry	447	“ In reverse order . More would have appeared , of course , had you maintained the connection . Very well , Harry , these echoes , these shadows ... what did they do ? ”
231622	231629	231631	231631	Dumbledore	187	“ I will say it again , ”
231649	231753	231754	231754	Sirius	195	“ You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you tonight , Harry . You have shown bravery equal to those who died fighting Voldemort at the height of his powers . You have shouldered a grown wizard ’s burden and found yourself equal to it — and you have now given us all that we have a right to expect . You will come with me to the hospital wing . I do not want you returning to the dormitory tonight . A Sleeping Potion , and some peace ... Sirius , would you like to stay with him ? ”
231862	231868	231852	231853	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ Harry ! Oh Harry ! ”
231882	231885	231886	231886	he	187	“ Molly , ”
231894	231946	231947	231947	he	187	“ please listen to me for a moment . Harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight . He has just had to relive it for me . What he needs now is sleep , and peace , and quiet . If he would like you all to stay with him , ”
231961	231988	231947	231947	he	187	“ you may do so . But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer , and certainly not this evening . ”
232017	232026	231998	231998	She	191	“ Did you hear ? He needs quiet ! ”
232027	232030	232032	232033	Madam Pomfrey	323	“ Headmaster , ”
232045	232052	232032	232033	Madam Pomfrey	323	“ may I ask what — ? ”
232053	232065	232067	232067	Dumbledore	187	“ This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while , ”
232070	232092	232067	232067	Dumbledore	187	“ I assure you , he is extremely well trained . Harry — I will wait while you get into bed . ”
232149	232168	232170	232170	Dumbledore	187	“ I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge , Harry , ”
232172	232189	232190	232190	He	187	“ I would like you to remain here tomorrow until I have spoken to the school . ”
232236	232241	232242	232242	Harry	447	“ Is he okay ? ”
232245	232251	232253	232254	Madam Pomfrey	323	“ He ’ll be fine , ”
232326	232332	232333	232333	he	447	“ I ’m all right , ”
232337	232341	232333	232333	he	447	“ Just tired . ”
232380	232392	232393	232393	she	323	“ You ’ll need to drink all of this , Harry , ”
232396	232405	232393	232393	she	323	“ It ’s a potion for dreamless sleep . ”
232553	232565	232589	232589	Someone	872	“ They ’ll wake him if they do n’t shut up ! ”
232566	232582	232583	232583	Harry	447	“ What are they shouting about ? Nothing else can have happened , can it ? ”
232616	232623	232624	232624	she	191	“ That ’s Fudge ’s voice , ”
232627	232646	232624	232624	she	191	“ And that ’s Minerva McGonagall ’s , is n’t it ? But what are they arguing about ? ”
232663	232673	232654	232654	people	5169	“ Regrettable , but all the same , Minerva — ”
232680	232691	232674	232675	Cornelius Fudge	280	“ You should never have brought it inside the castle ! ”
232696	232702	232703	232703	Harry	447	“ When Dumbledore finds out — ”
232762	232767	232768	232768	Fudge	280	“ Where ’s Dumbledore ? ”
232774	232780	232782	232783	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ He ’s not here , ”
232786	232805	232782	232783	Mrs. Weasley	191	“ This is a hospital wing , Minister , do n’t you think you ’d do better to — ”
232819	232824	232826	232826	Dumbledore	187	“ What has happened ? ”
232836	232862	232833	232834	Professor McGonagall	343	“ Why are you disturbing these people ? Minerva , I ’m surprised at you — I asked you to stand guard over Barty Crouch — ”
232863	232877	232878	232878	she	4886	“ There is no need to stand guard over him anymore , Dumbledore ! ”
232881	232889	232878	232878	she	4886	“ The Minister has seen to that ! ”
232925	232944	232946	232946	Snape	431	“ When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for tonight ’s events , ”
232953	232989	232946	232946	Snape	431	“ he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question . He insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle . He brought it up to the office where Barty Crouch — ”
232990	233001	233002	233003	Professor McGonagall	343	“ I told him you would not agree , Dumbledore ! ”
233006	233024	233002	233003	Professor McGonagall	343	“ I told him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle , but — ”
233025	233030	233032	233032	Fudge	551	“ My dear woman ! ”
233045	233069	233032	233032	Fudge	551	“ as Minister of Magic , it is my decision whether I wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous — ”
233079	233090	233091	233091	she	343	“ The moment that — that thing entered the room , ”
233102	233112	233091	233091	she	343	“ it swooped down on Crouch and — and — ”
233178	233188	233190	233190	Fudge	551	“ By all accounts , he is no loss ! ”
233192	233203	233190	233190	Fudge	551	“ It seems he has been responsible for several deaths ! ”
233204	233215	233217	233217	Dumbledore	187	“ But he can not now give testimony , Cornelius , ”
233236	233249	233219	233219	He	187	“ He can not give evidence about why he killed those people . ”
233250	233266	233268	233268	Fudge	280	“ Why he killed them ? Well , that ’s no mystery , is it ? ”
233270	233305	233268	233268	Fudge	280	“ He was a raving lunatic ! From what Minerva and Severus have told me , he seems to have thought he was doing it all on You - Know - Who ’s instructions ! ”
233306	233316	233317	233317	Dumbledore	187	“ Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions , Cornelius , ”
233320	233353	233317	233317	Dumbledore	187	“ Those people ’s deaths were mere by - products of a plan to restore Voldemort to full strength again . The plan succeeded . Voldemort has been restored to his body . ”
233401	233417	233391	233391	He	280	“ You - Know - Who ... returned ? Preposterous . Come now , Dumbledore ... ”
233418	233428	233430	233430	Dumbledore	187	“ As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you , ”
233432	233498	233430	233430	Dumbledore	187	“ we heard Barty Crouch confess . Under the influence of Veritaserum , he told us how he was smuggled out of Azkaban , and how Voldemort — learning of his continued existence from Bertha Jorkins — went to free him from his father and used him to capture Harry . The plan worked , I tell you . Crouch has helped Voldemort to return . ”
233499	233505	233507	233507	Fudge	280	“ See here , Dumbledore , ”
233523	233579	233510	233510	Harry	447	“ you — you ca n’t seriously believe that . You - Know - Who — back ? Come now , come now ... certainly , Crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon You - Know - Who ’s orders — but to take the word of a lunatic like that , Dumbledore ... ”
233580	233596	233598	233598	Dumbledore	187	“ When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight , he was transported straight to Voldemort , ”
233601	233625	233598	233598	Dumbledore	187	“ He witnessed Lord Voldemort ’s rebirth . I will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office . ”
233645	233659	233640	233640	his	187	“ I am afraid I can not permit you to question Harry tonight . ”
233681	233701	233666	233666	He	280	“ You are — er — prepared to take Harry ’s word on this , are you , Dumbledore ? ”
233730	233737	233739	233739	Dumbledore	187	“ Certainly , I believe Harry , ”
233747	233789	233741	233741	His	187	“ I heard Crouch ’s confession , and I heard Harry ’s account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup ; the two stories make sense , they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer . ”
233810	233837	233803	233803	he	280	“ You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned , on the word of a lunatic murderer , and a boy who ... well ... ”
233849	233860	233861	233861	he	280	“ You ’ve been reading Rita Skeeter , Mr. Fudge , ”
233902	233908	233909	233909	he	280	“ And if I have ? ”
233916	233948	233909	233909	he	280	“ If I have discovered that you ’ve been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet ? A Parselmouth , eh ? And having funny turns all over the place — ”
233949	233967	233969	233969	Dumbledore	187	“ I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar ? ”
233972	233985	233987	233987	Fudge	280	“ You admit that he has been having these pains , then ? ”
233990	233999	233987	233987	Fudge	280	“ Headaches ? Nightmares ? Possibly — hallucinations ? ”
234000	234007	234009	234009	Dumbledore	187	“ Listen to me , Cornelius , ”
234041	234078	234035	234035	Dumbledore	187	“ Harry is as sane as you or I. That scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains . I believe it hurts him when Lord Voldemort is close by , or feeling particularly murderous . ”
234096	234120	234090	234090	he	280	“ You ’ll forgive me , Dumbledore , but I ’ve never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before ... ”
234121	234130	234131	234131	Harry	447	“ Look , I saw Voldemort come back ! ”
234150	234167	234168	234168	Snape	431	“ I saw the Death Eaters ! I can give you their names ! Lucius Malfoy — ”
234189	234194	234196	234196	Fudge	280	“ Malfoy was cleared ! ”
234201	234212	234196	234196	Fudge	280	“ A very old family — donations to excellent causes — ”
234213	234216	234217	234217	Harry	447	“ Macnair ! ”
234220	234230	234217	234217	Harry	447	“ Also cleared ! Now working for the Ministry ! ”
234231	234240	234196	234196	Fudge	280	“ Avery — Nott — Crabbe — Goyle — ”
234241	234261	234263	234263	Fudge	280	“ You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being Death Eaters thirteen years ago ! ”
234266	234333	234263	234263	Fudge	280	“ You could have found those names in old reports of the trials ! For heaven ’s sake , Dumbledore — the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too — his tales are getting taller , and you ’re still swallowing them — the boy can talk to snakes , Dumbledore , and you still think he ’s trustworthy ? ”
234334	234338	234339	234340	Professor McGonagall	343	“ You fool ! ”
234343	234361	234339	234340	Professor McGonagall	343	“ Cedric Diggory ! Mr. Crouch ! These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic ! ”
234362	234371	234373	234373	Fudge	280	“ I see no evidence to the contrary ! ”
234384	234411	234380	234380	his	280	“ It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years ! ”
234484	234489	234490	234490	Dumbledore	187	“ Voldemort has returned , ”
234493	234536	234490	234490	Dumbledore	187	“ If you accept that fact straightaway , Fudge , and take the necessary measures , we may still be able to save the situation . The first and most essential step is to remove Azkaban from the control of the dementors — ”
234537	234540	234542	234542	Fudge	280	“ Preposterous ! ”
234545	234583	234542	234542	Fudge	280	“ Remove the dementors ? I ’d be kicked out of office for suggesting it ! Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing guard at Azkaban ! ”
234584	234624	234626	234626	Dumbledore	187	“ The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds , Cornelius , knowing that you have put Lord Voldemort ’s most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them ! ”
234628	234690	234626	234626	Dumbledore	187	“ They will not remain loyal to you , Fudge ! Voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can ! With the dementors behind him , and his old supporters returned to him , you will be hard - pressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago ! ”
234707	234719	234720	234720	Dumbledore	187	“ The second step you must take — and at once , ”
234724	234733	234720	234720	Dumbledore	187	“ is to send envoys to the giants . ”

234879	235033	234873	234873	his	187	“ by the love of the office you hold , Cornelius ! You place too much importance , and you always have done , on the so - called purity of blood ! You fail to recognize that it matters not what someone is born , but what they grow to be ! Your dementor has just destroyed the last remaining member of a pure - blood family as old as any — and see what that man chose to make of his life ! I tell you now — take the steps I have suggested , and you will be remembered , in office or out , as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers of Magic we have ever known . Fail to act — and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild ! ”

235204	235280	235196	235196	he	187	“ I ’ve given you free rein , always . I ’ve had a lot of respect for you . I might not have agreed with some of your decisions , but I ’ve kept quiet . There are n’t many who ’d have let you hire werewolves , or keep Hagrid , or decide what to teach your students without reference to the Ministry . But if you ’re going to work against me — ”
235281	235292	235294	235294	Dumbledore	187	“ The only one against whom I intend to work , ”
235296	235318	235294	235294	Dumbledore	187	“ is Lord Voldemort . If you are against him , then we remain , Cornelius , on the same side . ”

Every Death Eater had the sign burned into him by the Dark Lord . It was a means of distinguishing one another , and his means of summoning us to him . When he touched the Mark of any Death Eater , we were to Disapparate , and Apparate , instantly , at his side . This Mark has been growing clearer all year . Karkaroff ’s too . Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight ? We both felt the Mark burn . We both knew he had returned . Karkaroff fears the Dark Lord ’s vengeance . He betrayed too many of his fellow Death Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold . ”
235625	235680	235681	235681	He	280	“ I do n’t know what you and your staff are playing at , Dumbledore , but I have heard enough . I have no more to add . I will be in touch with you tomorrow , Dumbledore , to discuss the running of this school . I must return to the Ministry . ”

235847	235881	235843	235843	she	191	“ We know what Fudge is . It ’s Arthur ’s fondness for Muggles that has held him back at the Ministry all these years . Fudge thinks he lacks proper Wizarding pride . ”
235882	235893	235895	235895	Dumbledore	187	“ Then I need to send a message to Arthur , ”
235897	235931	235895	235895	Dumbledore	187	“ All those that we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately , and he is well placed to contact those at the Ministry who are not as shortsighted as Cornelius . ”

236354	236382	236348	236348	Dumbledore	187	“ as are you , Severus . I trust you both . It is time for you to lay aside your old differences and trust each other . ”
236405	236415	236417	236417	Dumbledore	187	“ I will settle , in the short term , ”
236428	236475	236425	236425	his	187	“ for a lack of open hostility . You will shake hands . You are on the same side now . Time is short , and unless the few of us who know the truth stand united , there is no hope for any of us . ”
236512	236522	236524	236524	Dumbledore	187	“ That will do to be going on with , ”
236532	236596	236524	236524	Dumbledore	187	“ Now I have work for each of you . Fudge ’s attitude , though not unexpected , changes everything . Sirius , I need you to set off at once . You are to alert Remus Lupin , Arabella Figg , Mundungus Fletcher — the old crowd . Lie low at Lupin ’s for a while ; I will contact you there . ”
236597	236600	236602	236602	Harry	447	“ But — ”

We ’ll fight . Migh ’ be able ter stop him before he gets a good hold . That ’s Dumbledore ’s plan , anyway . Great man , Dumbledore . ’S long as we ’ve got him , I ’m not too worried . ”

It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so — either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned , or because they think I should not tell you so , young as you are . It is my belief , however , that the truth is generally preferable to lies , and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident , or some sort of blunder of his own , is an insult to his memory . ”

I say to you all , once again — in the light of Lord Voldemort ’s return , we are only as strong as we are united , as weak as we are divided . Lord Voldemort ’s gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great . We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust .

240567	240587	240588	240588	he	225	“ He vos alvays polite to me . Alvays . Even though I vos from Durmstrang — with Karkaroff , ”
240593	240602	240604	240604	Harry	447	“ Have you got a new headmaster yet ? ”
240654	240661	240650	240650	Ron	188	“ Can I have your autograph ? ”
240932	241001	240921	240921	Hermione	178	“ There ’s nothing in there . You can look for yourself , but there ’s nothing at all . I ’ve been checking every day . Just a small piece the day after the third task saying you won the tournament . They did n’t even mention Cedric . Nothing about any of it . If you ask me , Fudge is forcing them to keep quiet . ”
241002	241010	241012	241012	Harry	447	“ He ’ll never keep Rita quiet , ”
241014	241022	241012	241012	Harry	447	“ Not on a story like this . ”
241023	241038	241040	241040	Hermione	178	“ Oh , Rita has n’t written anything at all since the third task , ”
241047	241054	241055	241055	she	178	“ As a matter of fact , ”
241064	241092	241055	241055	she	178	“ Rita Skeeter is n’t going to be writing anything at all for a while . Not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her . ”
241093	241100	241102	241102	Ron	188	“ What are you talking about ? ”
241104	241128	241130	241130	Hermione	178	“ I found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she was n’t supposed to be coming onto the grounds , ”
241166	241173	241175	241175	Harry	447	“ How was she doing it ? ”
241179	241186	241188	241188	Ron	188	“ How did you find out ? ”
241194	241211	241212	241212	she	178	“ Well , it was you , really , who gave me the idea , Harry , ”
241215	241219	241221	241221	Harry	447	“ Did I ? ”
241225	241228	241221	241221	Harry	447	“ How ? ”
241229	241232	241234	241234	Hermione	178	“ Bugging , ”
241237	241246	241234	241234	Hermione	178	“ But you said they did n’t work — ”
241247	241253	241255	241255	Hermione	178	“ Oh not electronic bugs , ”
241257	241265	241255	241255	Hermione	178	“ No , you see ... Rita Skeeter ”
241275	241285	241255	241255	Hermione	178	“ is an unregistered Animagus . She can turn — ”
241298	241304	241286	241286	Hermione	178	“ — into a beetle . ”
241305	241310	241312	241312	Ron	188	“ You ’re kidding , ”
241314	241323	241312	241312	Ron	188	“ You have n’t ... she ’s not ... ”
241324	241330	241332	241332	Hermione	178	“ Oh yes she is , ”
241355	241364	241365	241365	Ron	188	“ That ’s never — you ’re kidding — ”
241375	241382	241384	241384	Hermione	178	“ No , I ’m not , ”
241388	241422	241384	241384	Hermione	178	“ I caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing . Look very closely , and you ’ll notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears . ”
241438	241458	241433	241433	He	447	“ There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard Hagrid telling Madame Maxime about his mum ! ”
241459	241462	241464	241464	Hermione	178	“ Exactly , ”
241466	241520	241464	241464	Hermione	178	“ And Viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after we ’d had our conversation by the lake . And unless I ’m very much mistaken , Rita was perched on the windowsill of the Divination class the day your scar hurt . She ’s been buzzing around for stories all year . ”
241521	241530	241532	241532	Ron	188	“ When we saw Malfoy under that tree ... ”
241535	241546	241548	241548	Hermione	178	“ He was talking to her , in his hand , ”
241550	241598	241548	241548	Hermione	178	“ He knew , of course . That ’s how she ’s been getting all those nice little interviews with the Slytherins . They would n’t care that she was doing something illegal , as long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us and Hagrid . ”
241620	241637	241639	241639	Hermione	178	“ I ’ve told her I ’ll let her out when we get back to London , ”
241641	241694	241639	241639	Hermione	178	“ I ’ve put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar , you see , so she ca n’t transform . And I ’ve told her she ’s to keep her quill to herself for a whole year . See if she ca n’t break the habit of writing horrible lies about people . ”
241715	241721	241723	241724	Draco Malfoy	282	“ Very clever , Granger , ”
241757	241760	241762	241762	Malfoy	282	“ So , ”
241784	241803	241781	241781	his	282	“ You caught some pathetic reporter , and Potter ’s Dumbledore ’s favorite boy again . Big deal . ”
241813	241824	241826	241826	Malfoy	282	“ Trying not to think about it , are we ? ”
241837	241846	241826	241826	Malfoy	282	“ Trying to pretend it has n’t happened ? ”
241847	241851	241853	241853	Harry	447	“ Get out , ”
241900	241952	241953	241953	He	447	“ You ’ve picked the losing side , Potter ! I warned you ! I told you you ought to choose your company more carefully , remember ? When we met on the train , first day at Hogwarts ? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like this ! ”
241962	242000	241955	241955	his	447	“ Too late now , Potter ! They ’ll be the first to go , now the Dark Lord ’s back ! Mudbloods and Muggle - lovers first ! Well — second — Diggory was the f — ”
242092	242104	242106	242106	Fred	192	“ Thought we ’d see what those three were up to , ”
242145	242149	242151	242151	George	193	“ Interesting effect , ”
242158	242165	242151	242151	George	193	“ Who used the Furnunculus Curse ? ”
242166	242169	242171	242171	Harry	447	“ Me , ”
242173	242176	242178	242178	George	193	“ Odd , ”
242181	242228	242178	242178	George	193	“ I used Jelly - Legs . Looks as though those two should n’t be mixed . He seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face . Well , let ’s not leave them here , they do n’t add much to the decor . ”
242286	242292	242294	242294	Fred	192	“ Exploding Snap , anyone ? ”
242317	242326	242327	242327	he	447	“ You going to tell us , then ? ”
242332	242338	242327	242327	he	447	“ Who you were blackmailing ? ”
242339	242342	242344	242344	George	193	“ Oh , ”
242347	242350	242344	242344	George	193	“ That . ”
242351	242357	242359	242359	Fred	192	“ It does n’t matter , ”
242366	242378	242362	242362	his	5016	“ It was n’t anything important . Not now , anyway . ”
242379	242385	242387	242387	George	193	“ We ’ve given up , ”
242408	242427	242405	242405	Fred	192	“ All right , all right , if you really want to know ... it was Ludo Bagman . ”
242428	242431	242433	242433	Harry	447	“ Bagman ? ”
242436	242445	242433	242433	Harry	447	“ Are you saying he was involved in — ”
242446	242449	242451	242451	George	193	“ Nah , ”
242454	242469	242451	242451	George	193	“ Nothing like that . Stupid git . He would n’t have the brains . ”
242470	242477	242479	242479	Ron	188	“ Well , what , then ? ”
242487	242515	242481	242481	Fred	192	“ You remember that bet we had with him at the Quidditch World Cup ? About how Ireland would win , but Krum would get the Snitch ? ”
242516	242519	242521	242521	Harry	447	“ Yeah , ”
242526	242544	242523	242523	Ron	188	“ Well , the git paid us in leprechaun gold he ’d caught from the Irish mascots . ”
242545	242548	242481	242481	Fred	192	“ So ? ”
242549	242552	242554	242554	Fred	192	“ So , ”
242557	242573	242554	242554	Fred	192	“ it vanished , did n’t it ? By next morning , it had gone ! ”
242574	242588	242590	242590	Hermione	178	“ But — it must ’ve been an accident , must n’t it ? ”
242597	242665	242592	242592	George	193	“ Yeah , that ’s what we thought , at first . We thought if we just wrote to him , and told him he ’d made a mistake , he ’d cough up . But nothing doing . Ignored our letter . We kept trying to talk to him about it at Hogwarts , but he was always making some excuse to get away from us . ”
242666	242676	242678	242678	Fred	192	“ In the end , he turned pretty nasty , ”
242680	242698	242678	242678	Fred	192	“ Told us we were too young to gamble , and he was n’t giving us anything . ”
242699	242708	242710	242710	George	193	“ So we asked for our money back , ”
242714	242720	242722	242722	Hermione	178	“ He did n’t refuse ! ”
242724	242729	242731	242731	Fred	192	“ Right in one , ”
242733	242741	242743	242743	Ron	188	“ But that was all your savings ! ”
242745	242751	242753	242753	George	193	“ Tell me about it , ”
242755	242881	242753	242753	George	193	“ ’ Course , we found out what was going on in the end . Lee Jordan ’s dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off Bagman as well . Turns out he ’s in big trouble with the goblins . Borrowed loads of gold off them . A gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the gold he had , and it still was n’t enough to cover all his debts . They followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him . He ’s lost everything gambling . Has n’t got two Galleons to rub together . And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back ? ”
242882	242885	242887	242887	Harry	447	“ How ? ”
242889	242899	242901	242901	Fred	192	“ He put a bet on you , mate , ”
242903	242920	242901	242901	Fred	192	“ Put a big bet on you to win the tournament . Bet against the goblins . ”
242921	242934	242936	242936	Harry	447	“ So that ’s why he kept trying to help me win ! ”
242938	242957	242936	242936	Harry	447	“ Well — I did win , did n’t I ? So he can pay you your gold ! ”
242958	242961	242963	242963	George	193	“ Nope , ”
242969	243013	242966	242966	his	5017	“ The goblins play as dirty as him . They say you drew with Diggory , and Bagman was betting you ’d win outright . So Bagman had to run for it . He did run for it right after the third task . ”
243138	243147	243131	243131	Harry	447	“ Fred — George — wait a moment . ”
243164	243168	243169	243169	he	447	“ Take it , ”
243182	243185	243187	243187	Fred	192	“ What ? ”
243192	243196	243197	243197	Harry	447	“ Take it , ”
243201	243208	243197	243197	Harry	447	“ I do n’t want it . ”
243209	243214	243216	243216	George	193	“ You ’re mental , ”
243226	243233	243235	243235	Harry	447	“ No , I ’m not , ”
243237	243253	243235	243235	Harry	447	“ You take it , and get inventing . It ’s for the joke shop . ”
243254	243259	243260	243260	Fred	192	“ He is mental , ”
243268	243271	243273	243273	Harry	447	“ Listen , ”
243276	243339	243273	243273	Harry	447	“ If you do n’t take it , I ’m throwing it down the drain . I do n’t want it and I do n’t need it . But I could do with a few laughs . We could all do with a few laughs . I ’ve got a feeling we ’re going to need them more than usual before long . ”
243340	243343	243345	243345	George	193	“ Harry , ”
243356	243368	243345	243345	George	193	“ there ’s got to be a thousand Galleons in here . ”
243369	243372	243374	243374	Harry	447	“ Yeah , ”
243378	243387	243374	243374	Harry	447	“ Think how many Canary Creams that is . ”
243394	243427	243374	243374	Harry	447	“ Just do n’t tell your mum where you got it ... although she might not be so keen for you to join the Ministry anymore , come to think of it ... ”
243428	243431	243432	243432	Fred	192	“ Harry , ”
243442	243445	243446	243446	he	447	“ Look , ”
243450	243488	243446	243446	he	447	“ take it , or I ’ll hex you . I know some good ones now . Just do me one favor , okay ? Buy Ron some different dress robes and say they ’re from you . ”
243552	243573	243543	243543	she	191	“ I think Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer . Keep in touch , Harry . ”
243574	243580	243582	243582	Ron	188	“ See you , Harry , ”
243590	243596	243601	243601	she	178	“ ’ Bye , Harry ! ”
243617	243622	243623	243623	George	193	“ Harry — thanks , ”
