8	13	0	4	The villagers of Little Hangleton	540	“ the Riddle House , ”
98	101	88	90	The Little Hangletons	145	“ creepy . ”
476	483	484	484	she	581	“ Always thought he was odd , ”
496	530	484	484	she	581	“ Unfriendly , like . I ’m sure if I ’ve offered him a cuppa once , I ’ve offered it a hundred times . Never wanted to mix , he did n’t . ”
531	536	538	542	a woman at the bar	583	“ Ah , now , ”
544	565	538	542	a woman at the bar	583	“ he had a hard war , Frank . He likes the quiet life . That ’s no reason to — ”
566	579	581	582	the cook	581	“ Who else had a key to the back door , then ? ”
584	633	581	582	the cook	581	“ There ’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener ’s cottage far back as I can remember ! Nobody forced the door last night ! No broken windows ! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping ... ”
640	655	657	661	a man at the bar	586	“ I always thought he had a nasty look about him , right enough , ”
663	674	676	677	the landlord	587	“ War turned him funny , if you ask me , ”
679	701	703	708	an excited woman in the corner	588	“ Told you I would n’t like to get on the wrong side of Frank , did n’t I , Dot ? ”
710	714	716	716	Dot	151	“ Horrible temper , ”
721	731	716	716	Dot	151	“ I remember , when he was a kid ... ”
1069	1091	1093	1093	Dot	151	“ ’S far as I ’m concerned , he killed them , and I do n’t care what the police say , ”
1099	1121	1093	1093	Dot	151	“ And if he had any decency , he ’d leave here , knowing as how we knows he did it . ”
1221	1225	1211	1211	they	617	“ tax reasons , ”
1964	1983	1949	1950	a man	656	“ There is a little more in the bottle , my Lord , if you are still hungry . ”
1984	1987	1997	1998	a man	656	“ Later , ”
2036	2046	2030	2030	Frank	149	“ Move me closer to the fire , Wormtail . ”
2142	2147	2149	2151	the cold voice	660	“ Where is Nagini ? ”
2153	2164	2166	2168	the first voice	661	“ I — I do n’t know , my Lord , ”
2171	2183	2166	2168	the first voice	661	“ She set out to explore the house , I think ... ”
2184	2195	2197	2199	the second voice	662	“ You will milk her before we retire , Wormtail , ”
2201	2217	2197	2199	the second voice	662	“ I will need feeding in the night . The journey has tired me greatly . ”
2250	2266	2243	2245	the man called	663	“ My Lord , may I ask how long we are going to stay here ? ”
2267	2271	2273	2275	the cold voice	660	“ A week , ”
2277	2309	2273	2275	the cold voice	660	“ Perhaps longer . The place is moderately comfortable , and the plan can not proceed yet . It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over . ”
2338	2341	2273	2275	the cold voice	660	“ Quidditch , ”
2350	2361	2363	2363	Wormtail	153	“ The — the Quidditch World Cup , my Lord ? ”
2378	2400	2366	2366	Frank	149	“ Forgive me , but — I do not understand — why should we wait until the World Cup is over ? ”
2401	2468	2368	2368	his	149	“ Because , fool , at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world , and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty , on the watch for signs of unusual activity , checking and double - checking identities . They will be obsessed with security , lest the Muggles notice anything . So we wait . ”
2484	2489	2478	2478	He	149	“ Ministry of Magic , ”
2490	2493	2368	2368	his	149	“ wizards , ”
2495	2498	2478	2478	He	149	“ Muggles . ”
2546	2555	2556	2556	Wormtail	153	“ Your Lordship is still determined , then ? ”
2560	2568	2556	2556	Wormtail	153	“ Certainly I am determined , Wormtail . ”
2615	2627	2602	2602	he	153	“ It could be done without Harry Potter , my Lord . ”
2637	2642	2644	2646	the second voice	662	“ Without Harry Potter ? ”
2649	2653	2644	2646	the second voice	662	“ I see ... ”
2654	2670	2672	2672	Wormtail	153	“ My Lord , I do not say this out of concern for the boy ! ”
2679	2756	2674	2674	his	153	“ The boy is nothing to me , nothing at all ! It is merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard — any wizard — the thing could be done so much more quickly ! If you allowed me to leave you for a short while — you know that I can disguise myself most effectively — I could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person — ”
2757	2764	2766	2768	the cold voice	660	“ I could use another wizard , ”
2771	2776	2766	2768	the cold voice	660	“ that is true ... ”
2777	2785	2787	2787	Wormtail	153	“ My Lord , it makes sense , ”
2794	2811	2787	2787	Wormtail	153	“ Laying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult , he is so well protected — ”
2812	2859	2766	2768	the cold voice	660	“ And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute ? I wonder ... perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you , Wormtail ? Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me ? ”
2860	2878	2787	2787	Wormtail	153	“ My Lord ! I — I have no wish to leave you , none at all — ”
2879	2886	2888	2890	the second voice	662	“ Do not lie to me ! ”
2892	2932	2888	2890	the second voice	662	“ I can always tell , Wormtail ! You are regretting that you ever returned to me . I revolt you . I see you flinch when you look at me , feel you shudder when you touch me ... ”
2933	2942	2787	2787	Wormtail	153	“ No ! My devotion to Your Lordship — ”
2943	2987	2888	2890	the second voice	662	“ Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice . You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go . How am I to survive without you , when I need feeding every few hours ? Who is to milk Nagini ? ”
2988	2999	2787	2787	Wormtail	153	“ But you seem so much stronger , my Lord — ”
3000	3003	3005	3007	the second voice	662	“ Liar , ”
3009	3040	3005	3007	the second voice	662	“ I am no stronger , and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained under your clumsy care . Silence ! ”
3085	3173	3069	3071	the second man	672	“ I have my reasons for using the boy , as I have already explained to you , and I will use no other . I have waited thirteen years . A few more months will make no difference . As for the protection surrounding the boy , I believe my plan will be effective . All that is needed is a little courage from you , Wormtail — courage you will find , unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord Voldemort ’s wrath — ”
3174	3182	3184	3184	Wormtail	153	“ My Lord , I must speak ! ”
3192	3230	3184	3184	Wormtail	153	“ All through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head — my Lord , Bertha Jorkins ’s disappearance will not go unnoticed for long , and if we proceed , if I murder — ”
3231	3234	3236	3238	the second voice	662	“ If ? ”
3240	3325	3236	3238	the second voice	662	“ If ? If you follow the plan , Wormtail , the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died . You will do it quietly and without fuss ; I only wish that I could do it myself , but in my present condition ... Come , Wormtail , one more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear . I am not asking you to do it alone . By that time , my faithful servant will have rejoined us — ”
3326	3333	3335	3335	Wormtail	153	“ I am a faithful servant , ”
3346	3371	3343	3343	his	153	“ Wormtail , I need somebody with brains , somebody whose loyalty has never wavered , and you , unfortunately , fulfill neither requirement . ”
3372	3377	3379	3379	Wormtail	153	“ I found you , ”
3393	3408	3389	3389	his	153	“ I was the one who found you . I brought you Bertha Jorkins . ”
3409	3414	3416	3418	the second man	672	“ That is true , ”
3423	3463	3416	3418	the second man	672	“ A stroke of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you , Wormtail — though , if truth be told , you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her , were you ? ”
3464	3477	3483	3485	the second voice	662	“ I — I thought she might be useful , my Lord — ”
3478	3481	3483	3485	the second voice	662	“ Liar , ”
3496	3558	3483	3485	the second voice	662	“ However , I do not deny that her information was invaluable . Without it , I could never have formed our plan , and for that , you will have your reward , Wormtail . I will allow you to perform an essential task for me , one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform ... ”
3559	3570	3571	3571	Wormtail	153	“ R - really , my Lord ? What — ? ”
3576	3619	3483	3485	the second voice	662	“ Ah , Wormtail , you do n’t want me to spoil the surprise ? Your part will come at the very end ... but I promise you , you will have the honor of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins . ”
3620	3625	3626	3626	Wormtail	153	“ You ... you ... ”
3642	3653	3626	3626	Wormtail	153	“ You ... are going ... to kill me too ? ”
3654	3659	3661	3663	the cold voice	660	“ Wormtail , Wormtail , ”
3666	3745	3661	3663	the cold voice	660	“ why would I kill you ? I killed Bertha because I had to . She was fit for nothing after my questioning , quite useless . In any case , awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays . Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns ... ”
3776	3823	3761	3763	the second man	672	“ We could have modified her memory ? But Memory Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard , as I proved when I questioned her . It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her , Wormtail . ”
3963	4004	4013	4013	He	672	“ One more murder ... my faithful servant at Hogwarts ... Harry Potter is as good as mine , Wormtail . It is decided . There will be no more argument . But quiet ... I think I hear Nagini ... ”
4351	4359	4409	4409	Frank	149	“ Nagini has interesting news , Wormtail , ”
4363	4371	4373	4373	Wormtail	153	“ In - indeed , my Lord ? ”
4375	4380	4435	4452	A short , balding man with graying hair , a pointed nose , and small , watery eyes	696	“ Indeed , yes , ”
4385	4408	4435	4452	A short , balding man with graying hair , a pointed nose , and small , watery eyes	696	“ According to Nagini , there is an old Muggle standing right outside this room , listening to every word we say . ”
4467	4479	4464	4464	his	696	“ Invite him inside , Wormtail . Where are your manners ? ”
4610	4617	4619	4621	the cold voice	660	“ You heard everything , Muggle ? ”
4623	4632	4634	4634	Frank	149	“ What ’s that you ’re calling me ? ”
4671	4679	4619	4621	the cold voice	660	“ I am calling you a Muggle , ”
4685	4695	4619	4621	the cold voice	660	“ It means that you are not a wizard . ”
4696	4707	4709	4709	Frank	149	“ I do n’t know what you mean by wizard , ”
4716	4752	4753	4753	he	149	“ All I know is I ’ve heard enough to interest the police tonight , I have . You ’ve done murder and you ’re planning more ! And I ’ll tell you this too , ”
4761	4778	4753	4753	he	149	“ my wife knows I ’m up here , and if I do n’t come back — ”
4779	4785	4787	4789	the cold voice	660	“ You have no wife , ”
4794	4826	4787	4789	the cold voice	660	“ Nobody knows you are here . You told nobody that you were coming . Do not lie to Lord Voldemort , Muggle , for he knows ... he always knows ... ”
4827	4832	4834	4834	Frank	149	“ Is that right ? ”
4837	4872	4834	4834	Frank	149	“ Lord , is it ? Well , I do n’t think much of your manners , my Lord . Turn ’ round and face me like a man , why do n’t you ? ”
4873	4883	4787	4789	the cold voice	660	“ But I am not a man , Muggle , ”
4899	4928	4787	4789	the cold voice	660	“ I am much , much more than a man . However ... why not ? I will face you ... Wormtail , come turn my chair around . ”
4935	4942	4946	4946	his	705	“ You heard me , Wormtail . ”
6784	6823	6770	6771	Hermione Granger	168	“ Your scar hurt ? Harry , that ’s really serious ... Write to Professor Dumbledore ! And I ’ll go and check Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions ... Maybe there ’s something in there about curse scars ... ”
7075	7141	7053	7053	Ron	170	“ Your scar hurt ? But ... but You - Know - Who ca n’t be near you now , can he ? I mean ... you ’d know , would n’t you ? He ’d be trying to do you in again , would n’t he ? I dunno , Harry , maybe curse scars always twinge a bit ... I ’ll ask Dad ... ”
8229	8237	8241	8241	her	166	“ There you are , Diddy darling , ”
8308	8323	8304	8305	Uncle Vernon	165	“ he did n’t want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway . ”
8336	8352	8353	8354	Aunt Petunia	166	“ He ’s a boisterous little boy , but he would n’t hurt a fly ! ”
8589	8593	8586	8587	Uncle Vernon	165	“ rabbit food . ”
8934	8939	8940	8940	he	165	“ Is this it ? ”
9130	9133	9134	9134	he	165	“ You , ”
9139	9147	9134	9134	he	165	“ In the living room . Now . ”
9191	9194	9195	9195	he	165	“ So , ”
9219	9222	9195	9195	he	165	“ So . ”
9232	9236	9223	9223	Harry	157	“ So what ? ”
9277	9282	9284	9285	Uncle Vernon	165	“ This just arrived , ”
9298	9305	9287	9287	He	165	“ A letter . About you . ”
9370	9375	9376	9376	he	165	“ Look at this , ”
9433	9443	9445	9445	Harry	157	“ She did put enough stamps on , then , ”
9468	9473	9474	9474	he	165	“ The postman noticed , ”
9480	9509	9474	9474	he	165	“ Very interested to know where this letter came from , he was . That ’s why he rang the doorbell . Seemed to think it was funny . ”
9642	9650	9651	9651	he	157	“ So — can I go then ? ”
9778	9784	9785	9785	he	165	“ Who is this woman ? ”
9795	9801	9803	9803	Harry	157	“ You ’ve seen her , ”
9805	9833	9803	9803	Harry	157	“ She ’s my friend Ron ’s mother , she was meeting him off the Hog — off the school train at the end of last term . ”
9838	9842	9834	9834	He	157	“ Hogwarts Express , ”
9888	9894	9895	9895	he	165	“ Dumpy sort of woman ? ”
9899	9907	9895	9895	he	165	“ Load of children with red hair ? ”
9924	9927	9911	9911	He	157	“ dumpy , ”
9967	9970	9971	9971	he	165	“ Quidditch , ”
9977	9985	9971	9971	he	165	“ Quidditch — what is this rubbish ? ”
9994	10000	10001	10001	he	157	“ It ’s a sport , ”
10005	10010	10001	10001	he	157	“ Played on broom — ”
10011	10018	10020	10021	Uncle Vernon	165	“ All right , all right ! ”
10049	10051	10068	10068	his	157	“ broomsticks ”
10073	10084	10085	10085	He	157	“ send us your answer ... in the normal way . ”
10088	10100	10101	10101	he	157	“ What does she mean , ‘ the normal way ’ ? ”
10104	10109	10111	10111	Harry	157	“ Normal for us , ”
10124	10139	10121	10121	he	157	“ you know , owl post . That ’s what ’s normal for wizards . ”
10185	10204	10205	10205	he	165	“ How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof ? ”
10216	10234	10205	10205	he	165	“ You stand there , in the clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back — ”
10235	10243	10245	10245	Harry	157	“ Only after Dudley finished with them , ”
10294	10304	10306	10307	Uncle Vernon	165	“ I will not be spoken to like that ! ”
10389	10426	10378	10378	Harry	157	“ Okay , I ca n’t see the World Cup . Can I go now , then ? Only I ’ve got a letter to Sirius I want to finish . You know — my godfather . ”
10463	10476	10478	10479	Uncle Vernon	165	“ You ’re — you ’re writing to him , are you ? ”
10504	10509	10511	10511	Harry	157	“ Well — yeah , ”
10515	10545	10511	10511	Harry	157	“ It ’s been a while since he heard from me , and , you know , if he does n’t , he might start thinking something ’s wrong . ”
10673	10756	10766	10766	He	157	“ Well , all right then . You can go to this ruddy ... this stupid ... this World Cup thing . You write and tell these — these Weasleys they ’re to pick you up , mind . I have n’t got time to go dropping you off all over the country . And you can spend the rest of the summer there . And you can tell your — your godfather ... tell him ... tell him you ’re going . ”
10757	10761	10763	10763	Harry	157	“ Okay then , ”
10849	10860	10862	10862	Harry	157	“ That was an excellent breakfast , was n’t it ? ”
10864	10874	10862	10862	Harry	157	“ I feel really full , do n’t you ? ”
10955	10958	10960	10960	Harry	157	“ OUCH ! ”
11065	11068	11060	11060	Harry	157	“ Pig , ”
11114	11118	11119	11119	Harry	157	“ Calm down ! ”
11151	11164	11135	11135	Harry	157	“ Come here , I need you to take my answer back ! ”
11273	11281	11282	11282	he	157	“ Feeling up to a long journey ? ”
11296	11306	11307	11307	he	157	“ Can you take this to Sirius for me ? ”
11315	11326	11307	11307	he	157	“ Hang on ... I just want to finish it . ”
11403	11418	11419	11419	Harry	157	“ I ’ll be at Ron ’s when you get back , all right ? ”
11735	11748	11749	11749	he	165	“ I hope you told them to dress properly , these people , ”
11754	11782	11749	11749	he	165	“ I ’ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear . They ’d better have the decency to put on normal clothes , that ’s all . ”
11806	11809	11802	11803	the Dursleys	167	“ normal . ”
12090	12099	12100	12101	Uncle Vernon	165	“ They ’ll be driving , of course ? ”
12107	12110	12112	12112	Harry	157	“ Er , ”
12179	12184	12186	12186	Harry	157	“ I think so , ”
12434	12439	12440	12440	he	165	“ They ’re late ! ”
12445	12449	12451	12451	Harry	157	“ I know , ”
12453	12466	12451	12451	Harry	157	“ Maybe — er — the traffic ’s bad , or something . ”
12506	12512	12556	12556	him	165	“ No consideration at all . ”
12513	12521	12556	12556	him	165	“ We might ’ve had an engagement . ”
12522	12537	12556	12556	him	165	“ Maybe they think they ’ll get invited to dinner if they ’re late . ”
12538	12548	12550	12551	Uncle Vernon	165	“ Well , they most certainly wo n’t be , ”
12566	12625	12556	12556	him	165	“ They ’ll take the boy and go , there ’ll be no hanging around . That ’s if they ’re coming at all . Probably mistaken the day . I daresay their kind do n’t set much store by punctuality . Either that or they drive some tin - pot car that ’s broken d — AAAAAAAARRRRRGH ! ”
12668	12672	12674	12674	Harry	157	“ What happened ? ”
12676	12682	12674	12674	Harry	157	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
12745	12750	12752	12753	Aunt Petunia	166	“ What is it ? ”
12771	12778	12752	12753	Aunt Petunia	166	“ What is it , Vernon ? ”
12800	12844	12962	12962	He	157	“ Ouch ! Fred , no — go back , go back , there ’s been some kind of mistake — tell George not to — OUCH ! George , no , there ’s no room , go back quickly and tell Ron — ”
12845	12864	12962	12962	He	157	“ Maybe Harry can hear us , Dad — maybe he ’ll be able to let us out — ”
12880	12890	12962	12962	He	157	“ Harry ? Harry , can you hear us ? ”
12903	12908	12910	12911	Uncle Vernon	165	“ What is this ? ”
12913	12919	12910	12911	Uncle Vernon	165	“ What ’s going on ? ”
12920	12933	12935	12935	Harry	157	“ They — they ’ve tried to get here by Floo powder , ”
12944	12961	12935	12935	Harry	157	“ They can travel by fire — only you ’ve blocked the fireplace — hang on — ”
12972	12981	12962	12962	He	157	“ Mr. Weasley ? Can you hear me ? ”
12993	12996	12986	12990	Somebody inside the chimney piece	896	“ Shh ! ”
12997	13022	12962	12962	He	157	“ Mr. Weasley , it ’s Harry ... the fireplace has been blocked up . You wo n’t be able to get through there . ”
13023	13026	13028	13029	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Damn ! ”
13033	13047	13028	13029	Mr. Weasley	172	“ What on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for ? ”
13048	13056	13057	13057	Harry	157	“ They ’ve got an electric fire , ”
13060	13063	13065	13066	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Really ? ”
13071	13096	13065	13066	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Eclectic , you say ? With a plug ? Gracious , I must see that ... Let ’s think ... ouch , Ron ! ”
13106	13118	13097	13097	Ron	170	“ What are we doing here ? Has something gone wrong ? ”
13119	13125	13127	13127	Fred	174	“ Oh no , Ron , ”
13134	13147	13127	13127	Fred	174	“ No , this is exactly where we wanted to end up . ”
13148	13161	13163	13163	George	175	“ Yeah , we ’re having the time of our lives here , ”
13179	13184	13186	13187	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Boys , boys ... ”
13190	13210	13186	13187	Mr. Weasley	172	“ I ’m trying to think what to do ... Yes ... only way ... Stand back , Harry . ”
13225	13230	13231	13231	he	165	“ Wait a moment ! ”
13237	13245	13231	13231	he	165	“ What exactly are you going to — ”
13334	13339	13341	13342	Mr. Weasley	172	“ That ’s better , ”
13356	13368	13341	13342	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Ah — you must be Harry ’s aunt and uncle ! ”
13434	13443	13445	13446	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Er — yes — sorry about that , ”
13461	13584	13449	13449	his	172	“ It ’s all my fault . It just did n’t occur to me that we would n’t be able to get out at the other end . I had your fireplace connected to the Floo Network , you see — just for an afternoon , you know , so we could get Harry . Muggle fireplaces are n’t supposed to be connected , strictly speaking — but I ’ve got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel and he fixed it for me . I can put it right in a jiffy , though , do n’t worry . I ’ll light a fire to send the boys back , and then I can repair your fireplace before I Disapparate . ”
13623	13628	13630	13631	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Hello , Harry ! ”
13634	13640	13630	13631	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Got your trunk ready ? ”
13641	13646	13648	13648	Harry	157	“ It ’s upstairs , ”
13653	13659	13661	13661	Fred	174	“ We ’ll get it , ”
13720	13723	13729	13729	his	172	“ Well , ”
13746	13759	13734	13734	he	172	“ Very — erm — very nice place you ’ve got here . ”
13846	13855	13856	13856	he	172	“ They run off eckeltricity , do they ? ”
13860	13874	13875	13875	he	172	“ Ah yes , I can see the plugs . I collect plugs , ”
13881	13905	13875	13875	he	172	“ And batteries . Got a very large collection of batteries . My wife thinks I ’m mad , but there you are . ”
14025	14038	14040	14041	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Ah , this is your cousin , is it , Harry ? ”
14051	14054	14056	14056	Harry	157	“ Yep , ”
14058	14063	14056	14056	Harry	157	“ that ’s Dudley . ”
14159	14167	14168	14168	he	172	“ Having a good holiday , Dudley ? ”
14219	14224	14226	14227	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Ah , right , ”
14229	14235	14226	14227	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Better get cracking then . ”
14262	14265	14267	14268	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Incendio ! ”
14340	14348	14350	14351	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Off you go then , Fred , ”
14353	14356	14358	14358	Fred	174	“ Coming , ”
14360	14367	14358	14358	Fred	174	“ Oh no — hang on — ”
14428	14432	14433	14434	Aunt Petunia	166	“ the Burrow ! ”
14451	14457	14459	14460	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Right then , George , ”
14462	14468	14459	14460	Mr. Weasley	172	“ you and the trunk . ”
14503	14507	14500	14500	George	175	“ the Burrow ! ”

14523	14527	14529	14529	Ron	170	“ See you , ”
14548	14552	14535	14535	He	170	“ the Burrow ! ”
14564	14570	14571	14571	Harry	157	“ Well ... ’bye then , ”
14622	14631	14632	14632	he	172	“ Harry said good - bye to you , ”
14635	14642	14632	14632	he	172	“ Did n’t you hear him ? ”
14643	14649	14650	14650	Harry	157	“ It does n’t matter , ”
14656	14664	14650	14650	Harry	157	“ Honestly , I do n’t care . ”
14677	14690	14691	14691	he	172	“ You are n’t going to see your nephew till next summer , ”
14700	14711	14691	14691	he	172	“ Surely you ’re going to say good - bye ? ”
14775	14782	14769	14769	he	165	“ Good - bye , then . ”
14783	14787	14789	14789	Harry	157	“ See you , ”
14969	14980	14981	14981	he	172	“ Not to worry , I can sort him out ! ”
15013	15018	15020	15021	Mr. Weasley	172	“ No , really ! ”
15024	15067	15020	15021	Mr. Weasley	172	“ It ’s a simple process — it was the toffee — my son Fred — real practical joker — but it ’s only an Engorgement Charm — at least , I think it is — please , I can correct it — ”
15158	15162	15164	15165	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Now really ! ”
15172	15179	15164	15165	Mr. Weasley	172	“ I ’m trying to help ! ”
15193	15201	15202	15203	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Harry , go ! Just go ! ”
15212	15219	15202	15203	Mr. Weasley	172	“ I ’ll sort this out ! ”
15269	15273	15267	15267	he	165	“ the Burrow ! ”
15421	15427	15429	15429	Fred	174	“ Did he eat it ? ”
15443	15446	15448	15448	Harry	157	“ Yeah , ”
15453	15458	15448	15448	Harry	157	“ What was it ? ”
15459	15465	15467	15467	Fred	174	“ Ton - Tongue Toffee , ”
15470	15491	15467	15467	Fred	174	“ George and I invented them , and we ’ve been looking for someone to test them on all summer ... ”
15546	15554	15559	15560	the two	921	“ How ’re you doing , Harry ? ”
15851	15859	15860	15860	he	172	“ That was n’t funny , Fred ! ”
15863	15874	15860	15860	he	172	“ What on earth did you give that Muggle boy ? ”
15875	15883	15885	15885	Fred	174	“ I did n’t give him anything , ”
15892	15914	15885	15885	Fred	174	“ I just dropped it ... It was his fault he went and ate it , I never told him to . ”
15915	15922	15924	15925	Mr. Weasley	172	“ You dropped it on purpose ! ”
15927	15943	15924	15925	Mr. Weasley	172	“ You knew he ’d eat it , you knew he was on a diet — ”
15944	15952	15953	15953	George	175	“ How big did his tongue get ? ”
15957	15972	15924	15925	Mr. Weasley	172	“ It was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it ! ”
15982	15988	15989	15990	Mr. Weasley	172	“ It is n’t funny ! ”
15993	16022	15989	15990	Mr. Weasley	172	“ That sort of behavior seriously undermines wizard – Muggle relations ! I spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of Muggles , and my own sons — ”
16023	16037	16039	16039	Fred	174	“ We did n’t give it to him because he ’s a Muggle ! ”
16042	16058	16060	16060	George	175	“ No , we gave it to him because he ’s a great bullying git , ”
16062	16069	16060	16060	George	175	“ Is n’t he , Harry ? ”
16070	16079	16081	16081	Harry	157	“ Yeah , he is , Mr. Weasley , ”
16084	16091	16093	16094	Mr. Weasley	172	“ That ’s not the point ! ”
16096	16105	16093	16094	Mr. Weasley	172	“ You wait until I tell your mother — ”
16106	16111	16126	16126	She	173	“ Tell me what ? ”
16148	16156	16157	16157	she	173	“ Oh hello , Harry , dear , ”
16174	16181	16166	16166	her	173	“ Tell me what , Arthur ? ”
16314	16321	16322	16323	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Tell me what , Arthur ? ”
16333	16340	16342	16343	Mr. Weasley	172	“ It ’s nothing , Molly , ”
16345	16359	16342	16343	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Fred and George just — but I ’ve had words with them — ”
16360	16368	16370	16371	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ What have they done this time ? ”
16373	16387	16370	16371	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ If it ’s got anything to do with Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes — ”
16388	16402	16404	16404	Hermione	168	“ Why do n’t you show Harry where he ’s sleeping , Ron ? ”
16409	16417	16419	16419	Ron	170	“ He knows where he ’s sleeping , ”
16421	16431	16419	16419	Ron	170	“ in my room , he slept there last — ”
16432	16438	16440	16440	Hermione	168	“ We can all go , ”
16443	16446	16448	16448	Ron	170	“ Oh , ”
16453	16456	16448	16448	Ron	170	“ Right . ”
16457	16465	16467	16467	George	175	“ Yeah , we ’ll come too , ”
16469	16476	16478	16479	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ You stay where you are ! ”
16518	16526	16527	16527	Harry	157	“ What are Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes ? ”
16544	16562	16564	16564	Ron	170	“ Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George ’s room , ”
16567	16590	16592	16592	Ginny	190	“ We ’ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages , but we never thought they were actually making things , ”
16594	16615	16617	16617	Ron	170	“ Only , most of the stuff — well , all of it , really — was a bit dangerous , ”
16636	16645	16646	16646	Ginny	190	“ And then there was this big row , ”
16649	16679	16646	16646	Ginny	190	“ because Mum wants them to go into the Ministry of Magic like Dad , and they told her all they want to do is open a joke shop . ”
16706	16711	16713	16713	Harry	157	“ Hi , Percy , ”
16715	16721	16723	16723	Percy	186	“ Oh hello , Harry , ”
16725	16731	16733	16733	Ron	170	“ We ’re not thundering , ”
16736	16743	16745	16745	Harry	157	“ What are you working on ? ”
16747	16758	16760	16760	Percy	186	“ A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation , ”
16763	16798	16760	16760	Percy	186	“ We ’re trying to standardize cauldron thickness . Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin — leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year — ”
16799	16810	16812	16812	Ron	170	“ That ’ll change the world , that report will , ”
16814	16828	16812	16812	Ron	170	“ Front page of the Daily Prophet , I expect , cauldron leaks . ”
16834	16841	16842	16842	he	186	“ You might sneer , Ron , ”
16846	16875	16842	16842	he	186	“ but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy , shallow - bottomed products that seriously endanger — . ”
16876	16884	16886	16886	Ron	170	“ Yeah , yeah , all right , ”
17061	17067	17069	17069	Ron	170	“ Shut up , Pig , ”
17088	17107	17108	17108	he	170	“ Fred and George are in here with us , because Bill and Charlie are in their room , ”
17112	17129	17108	17108	he	170	“ Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he ’s got to work . ”
17130	17141	17142	17142	Harry	157	“ Er — why are you calling that owl Pig ? ”
17146	17153	17155	17155	Ginny	190	“ Because he ’s being stupid , ”
17157	17164	17155	17155	Ginny	190	“ Its proper name is Pigwidgeon . ”
17165	17178	17180	17180	Ron	170	“ Yeah , and that ’s not a stupid name at all , ”
17183	17188	17189	17189	he	170	“ Ginny named him , ”
17194	17252	17189	17189	he	170	“ She reckons it ’s sweet . And I tried to change it , but it was too late , he wo n’t answer to anything else . So now he ’s Pig . I ’ve got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes . He annoys me too , come to that . ”
17302	17307	17308	17308	Harry	157	“ Where ’s Crookshanks ? ”
17313	17322	17323	17323	she	168	“ Out in the garden , I expect , ”
17326	17339	17323	17323	she	168	“ He likes chasing gnomes . He ’s never seen any before . ”
17340	17348	17350	17350	Harry	157	“ Percy ’s enjoying work , then ? ”
17375	17379	17381	17381	Ron	170	“ Enjoying it ? ”
17384	17452	17381	17381	Ron	170	“ I do n’t reckon he ’d come home if Dad did n’t make him . He ’s obsessed . Just do n’t get him onto the subject of his boss . According to Mr. Crouch ... as I was saying to Mr. Crouch ... Mr. Crouch is of the opinion ... Mr. Crouch was telling me ... They ’ll be announcing their engagement any day now . ”
17453	17463	17465	17465	Hermione	168	“ Have you had a good summer , Harry ? ”
17467	17477	17465	17465	Hermione	168	“ Did you get our food parcels and everything ? ”
17478	17485	17487	17487	Harry	157	“ Yeah , thanks a lot , ”
17489	17498	17487	17487	Harry	157	“ They saved my life , those cakes . ”
17499	17507	17508	17508	Ron	170	“ And have you heard from — ? ”
17595	17603	17605	17605	Hermione	168	“ I think they ’ve stopped arguing , ”
17623	17635	17614	17614	Ginny	190	“ Shall we go down and help your mum with dinner ? ”
17636	17642	17644	17644	Ron	170	“ Yeah , all right , ”
17673	17682	17683	17683	she	173	“ We ’re eating out in the garden , ”
17690	17729	17730	17730	she	173	“ There ’s just not room for eleven people in here . Could you take the plates outside , girls ? Bill and Charlie are setting up the tables . Knives and forks , please , you two , ”
17774	17781	17782	17782	she	173	“ Oh for heaven ’s sake , ”
17810	17814	17815	17815	she	173	“ Those two ! ”
17839	17872	17815	17815	she	173	“ I do n’t know what ’s going to happen to them , I really do n’t . No ambition , unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly can ... ”
17908	17920	17921	17921	she	173	“ It ’s not as though they have n’t got brains , ”
17943	18004	17921	17921	she	173	“ but they ’re wasting them , and unless they pull themselves together soon , they ’ll be in real trouble . I ’ve had more owls from Hogwarts about them than the rest put together . If they carry on the way they ’re going , they ’ll end up in front of the Improper Use of Magic Office . ”
18060	18072	18079	18079	her	173	“ I do n’t know where we went wrong with them , ”
18090	18115	18079	18079	her	173	“ It ’s been the same for years , one thing after another , and they wo n’t listen to — OH NOT AGAIN ! ”
18141	18149	18150	18150	she	173	“ One of their fake wands again ! ”
18153	18168	18150	18150	she	173	“ How many times have I told them not to leave them lying around ? ”
18188	18192	18193	18193	Ron	170	“ C’m on , ”
18209	18219	18193	18193	Ron	170	“ let ’s go and help Bill and Charlie . ”
18482	18490	18491	18491	he	186	“ Will you keep it down ? ! ”
18494	18499	18501	18501	Bill	184	“ Sorry , Perce , ”
18505	18514	18501	18501	Bill	184	“ How ’re the cauldron bottoms coming on ? ”
18515	18519	18521	18521	Percy	186	“ Very badly , ”
18678	18693	18694	18694	Percy	186	“ I ’ve told Mr. Crouch that I ’ll have it ready by Tuesday , ”
18699	18778	18694	18694	Percy	186	“ That ’s a bit sooner than he expected it , but I like to keep on top of things . I think he ’ll be grateful I ’ve done it in good time , I mean , it ’s extremely busy in our department just now , what with all the arrangements for the World Cup . We ’re just not getting the support we need from the Department of Magical Games and Sports . Ludo Bagman — ”
18779	18784	18786	18787	Mr. Weasley	172	“ I like Ludo , ”
18790	18839	18786	18787	Mr. Weasley	172	“ He was the one who got us such good tickets for the Cup . I did him a bit of a favor : His brother , Otto , got into a spot of trouble — a lawnmower with unnatural powers — I smoothed the whole thing over . ”
18840	18850	18852	18852	Percy	186	“ Oh Bagman ’s likable enough , of course , ”
18855	18922	18852	18852	Percy	186	“ but how he ever got to be Head of Department ... when I compare him to Mr. Crouch ! I ca n’t see Mr. Crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out what ’s happened to them . You realize Bertha Jorkins has been missing for over a month now ? Went on holiday to Albania and never came back ? ”
18923	18933	18935	18936	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Yes , I was asking Ludo about that , ”
18940	18971	18935	18936	Mr. Weasley	172	“ He says Bertha ’s gotten lost plenty of times before now — though I must say , if it was someone in my department , I ’d be worried ... ”
18972	18981	18983	18983	Percy	186	“ Oh Bertha ’s hopeless , all right , ”
18985	19075	18983	18983	Percy	186	“ I hear she ’s been shunted from department to department for years , much more trouble than she ’s worth ... but all the same , Bagman ought to be trying to find her . Mr. Crouch has been taking a personal interest , she worked in our department at one time , you know , and I think Mr. Crouch was quite fond of her — but Bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in Australia instead of Albania . However ”
19091	19135	19077	19077	Percy	186	“ we ’ve got quite enough on our plates at the Department of International Magical Cooperation without trying to find members of other departments too . As you know , we ’ve got another big event to organize right after the World Cup . ”
19160	19172	19173	19173	He	186	“ You know the one I ’m talking about , Father . ”
19179	19186	19175	19175	his	186	“ The top - secret one . ”
19198	19227	19187	19187	Ron	170	“ He ’s been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work . Probably an exhibition of thick - bottomed cauldrons . ”
19253	19275	19235	19236	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ ... with a horrible great fang on it . Really , Bill , what do they say at the bank ? ”
19276	19300	19302	19302	Bill	184	“ Mum , no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I bring home plenty of treasure , ”
19305	19315	19317	19318	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ And your hair ’s getting silly , dear , ”
19325	19337	19321	19321	her	173	“ I wish you ’d let me give it a trim ... ”
19338	19343	19345	19345	Ginny	190	“ I like it , ”
19353	19376	19345	19345	Ginny	190	“ You ’re so old - fashioned , Mum . Anyway , it ’s nowhere near as long as Professor Dumbledore ’s ... ”
19397	19405	19407	19407	Charlie	185	“ It ’s got to be Ireland , ”
19416	19424	19407	19407	Charlie	185	“ They flattened Peru in the semifinals . ”
19425	19434	19436	19436	Fred	174	“ Bulgaria has got Viktor Krum , though , ”
19438	19450	19452	19452	Charlie	185	“ Krum ’s one decent player , Ireland has got seven , ”
19455	19470	19452	19452	Charlie	185	“ I wish England had got through . That was embarrassing , that was . ”
19471	19475	19477	19477	Harry	157	“ What happened ? ”
19498	19511	19513	19513	Charlie	185	“ Went down to Transylvania , three hundred and ninety to ten , ”
19516	19533	19513	19513	Charlie	185	“ Shocking performance . And Wales lost to Uganda , and Scotland was slaughtered by Luxembourg . ”
19699	19709	19692	19692	he	170	“ So — have you heard from Sirius lately ? ”
19717	19720	19722	19722	Harry	157	“ Yeah , ”
19725	19747	19722	19722	Harry	157	“ twice . He sounds okay . I wrote to him yesterday . He might write back while I ’m here . ”
19810	19816	19823	19823	her	173	“ Look at the time , ”
19826	19904	19823	19823	her	173	“ You really should be in bed , the whole lot of you — you ’ll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup . Harry , if you leave your school list out , I ’ll get your things for you tomorrow in Diagon Alley . I ’m getting everyone else ’s . There might not be time after the World Cup , the match went on for five days last time . ”
19905	19914	19916	19916	Harry	157	“ Wow — hope it does this time ! ”
19919	19927	19929	19929	Percy	186	“ Well , I certainly do n’t , ”
19932	19957	19929	19929	Percy	186	“ I shudder to think what the state of my in - tray would be if I was away from work for five days . ”
19958	19974	19976	19976	Fred	174	“ Yeah , someone might slip dragon dung in it again , eh , Perce ? ”
19978	19988	19990	19990	Percy	186	“ That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway ! ”
19999	20005	19990	19990	Percy	186	“ It was nothing personal ! ”
20006	20010	20011	20011	Fred	174	“ It was , ”
20023	20028	20011	20011	Fred	174	“ We sent it . ”
20054	20063	20064	20064	she	173	“ Time to go , Harry , dear , ”
20123	20129	20131	20131	Fred	174	“ ’S ’ time already ? ”
20244	20249	20250	20250	he	172	“ What d’you think ? ”
20254	20271	20250	20250	he	172	“ We ’re supposed to go incognito — do I look like a Muggle , Harry ? ”
20272	20275	20277	20277	Harry	157	“ Yeah , ”
20281	20285	20277	20277	Harry	157	“ very good . ”
20286	20299	20301	20301	George	175	“ Where ’re Bill and Charlie and Per - Per - Percy ? ”
20310	20321	20323	20324	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Well , they ’re Apparating , are n’t they ? ”
20342	20355	20323	20324	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ So they can have a bit of a lie - in . ”
20391	20399	20401	20401	Fred	174	“ So they ’re still in bed ? ”
20412	20420	20401	20401	Fred	174	“ Why ca n’t we Apparate too ? ”
20421	20436	20438	20439	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Because you ’re not of age and you have n’t passed your test , ”
20441	20450	20438	20439	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ And where have those girls got to ? ”
20465	20475	20476	20476	Harry	157	“ You have to pass a test to Apparate ? ”
20479	20483	20485	20486	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Oh yes , ”
20500	20554	20485	20486	Mr. Weasley	172	“ The Department of Magical Transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for Apparating without a license . It ’s not easy , Apparition , and when it ’s not done properly it can lead to nasty complications . This pair I ’m talking about went and Splinched themselves . ”
20563	20568	20570	20570	Harry	157	“ Er — Splinched ? ”
20572	20580	20582	20583	Mr. Weasley	172	“ They left half of themselves behind , ”
20595	20652	20582	20583	Mr. Weasley	172	“ So , of course , they were stuck . Could n’t move either way . Had to wait for the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad to sort them out . Meant a fair old bit of paperwork , I can tell you , what with the Muggles who spotted the body parts they ’d left behind ... ”
20675	20680	20681	20681	he	157	“ Were they okay ? ”
20686	20690	20692	20693	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Oh yes , ”
20700	20752	20692	20693	Mr. Weasley	172	“ But they got a heavy fine , and I do n’t think they ’ll be trying it again in a hurry . You do n’t mess around with Apparition . There are plenty of adult wizards who do n’t bother with it . Prefer brooms — slower , but safer . ”
20753	20765	20826	20827	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ But Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it ? ”
20766	20775	20777	20777	Fred	174	“ Charlie had to take the test twice , ”
20781	20812	20777	20777	Fred	174	“ He failed the first time , Apparated five miles south of where he meant to , right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping , remember ? ”
20813	20824	20826	20827	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Yes , well , he passed the second time , ”
20838	20846	20848	20848	George	175	“ Percy only passed two weeks ago , ”
20850	20866	20848	20848	George	175	“ He ’s been Apparating downstairs every morning since , just to prove he can . ”
20888	20899	20900	20900	Ginny	190	“ Why do we have to be up so early ? ”
20913	20923	20925	20926	Mr. Weasley	172	“ We ’ve got a bit of a walk , ”
20928	20931	20933	20933	Harry	157	“ Walk ? ”
20935	20946	20933	20933	Harry	157	“ What , are we walking to the World Cup ? ”
20947	20957	20959	20960	Mr. Weasley	172	“ No , no , that ’s miles away , ”
20964	21022	20959	20960	Mr. Weasley	172	“ We only need to walk a short way . It ’s just that it ’s very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting Muggle attention . We have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of times , and on a huge occasion like the Quidditch World Cup — ”
21023	21026	21028	21029	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ George ! ”
21037	21040	21042	21042	George	175	“ What ? ”
21052	21060	20959	20960	Mr. Weasley	172	“ What is that in your pocket ? ”
21061	21064	21077	21077	her	173	“ Nothing ! ”
21065	21073	20959	20960	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Do n’t you lie to me ! ”
21086	21089	21077	21077	her	173	“ Accio ! ”
21123	21131	21133	21134	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ We told you to destroy them ! ”
21148	21170	21133	21134	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ We told you to get rid of the lot ! Empty your pockets , go on , both of you ! ”
21213	21220	21221	21221	she	173	“ Accio ! Accio ! Accio ! ”
21251	21259	21260	21260	Fred	174	“ We spent six months developing those ! ”
21272	21282	21283	21283	she	173	“ Oh a fine way to spend six months ! ”
21286	21296	21283	21283	she	173	“ No wonder you did n’t get more O.W.L.s ! ”
21354	21362	21364	21365	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Well , have a lovely time , ”
21367	21372	21373	21373	she	173	“ and behave yourselves , ”
21391	21405	21373	21373	she	173	“ I ’ll send Bill , Charlie , and Percy along around midday , ”
21488	21501	21502	21502	he	157	“ So how does everyone get there without all the Muggles noticing ? ”
21526	21534	21536	21536	Harry	157	“ What sort of objects are Portkeys ? ”
21539	21547	21549	21550	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Well , they can be anything , ”
21552	21579	21549	21550	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Unobtrusive things , obviously , so Muggles do n’t go picking them up and playing with them ... stuff they ’ll just think is litter ... ”
21697	21700	21702	21703	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Whew , ”
21716	21731	21702	21703	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Well , we ’ve made good time — we ’ve got ten minutes ... ”
21749	21757	21759	21760	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Now we just need the Portkey , ”
21772	21782	21759	21760	Mr. Weasley	172	“ It wo n’t be big ... Come on ... ”
21811	21827	21855	21855	he	172	“ Over here , Arthur ! Over here , son , we ’ve got it ! ”
21845	21848	21855	21855	he	172	“ Amos ! ”
21902	21910	21912	21913	Mr. Weasley	172	“ This is Amos Diggory , everyone , ”
21915	21940	21912	21913	Mr. Weasley	172	“ He works for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures . And I think you know his son , Cedric ? ”
21966	21969	21971	21971	Cedric	208	“ Hi , ”
22015	22021	22022	22022	Cedric	208	“ Long walk , Arthur ? ”
22027	22032	22034	22035	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Not too bad , ”
22037	22052	22034	22035	Mr. Weasley	172	“ We live just on the other side of the village there . You ? ”
22053	22119	22120	22121	Amos Diggory	207	“ Had to get up at two , did n’t we , Ced ? I tell you , I ’ll be glad when he ’s got his Apparition test . Still ... not complaining ... Quidditch World Cup , would n’t miss it for a sackful of Galleons — and the tickets cost about that . Mind you , looks like I got off easy ... ”
22140	22147	22138	22138	Ginny	190	“ All these yours , Arthur ? ”
22148	22156	22158	22159	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Oh no , only the redheads , ”
22166	22182	22158	22159	Mr. Weasley	172	“ This is Hermione , friend of Ron ’s — and Harry , another friend — ”
22183	22188	22190	22191	Amos Diggory	207	“ Merlin ’s beard , ”
22197	22203	22193	22193	his	207	“ Harry ? Harry Potter ? ”
22204	22209	22211	22211	Harry	157	“ Er — yeah , ”
22252	22262	22264	22265	Amos Diggory	207	“ Ced ’s talked about you , of course , ”
22267	22305	22264	22265	Amos Diggory	207	“ Told us all about playing against you last year ... I said to him , I said — Ced , that ’ll be something to tell your grandchildren , that will ... You beat Harry Potter ! ”
22334	22343	22344	22344	he	208	“ Harry fell off his broom , Dad , ”
22347	22357	22344	22344	he	208	“ I told you ... it was an accident ... ”
22358	22371	22373	22373	Amos	207	“ Yes , but you did n’t fall off , did you ? ”
22383	22441	22373	22373	Amos	207	“ Always modest , our Ced , always the gentleman ... but the best man won , I ’m sure Harry’d say the same , would n’t you , eh ? One falls off his broom , one stays on , you do n’t need to be a genius to tell which one ’s the better flier ! ”
22442	22448	22450	22451	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Must be nearly time , ”
22460	22474	22456	22456	his	172	“ Do you know whether we ’re waiting for any more , Amos ? ”
22475	22495	22497	22498	Mr. Diggory	215	“ No , the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the Fawcetts could n’t get tickets , ”
22500	22515	22497	22498	Mr. Diggory	215	“ There are n’t any more of us in this area , are there ? ”
22516	22523	22525	22526	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Not that I know of , ”
22528	22543	22525	22526	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Yes , it ’s a minute off ... We ’d better get ready ... ”
22552	22570	22544	22544	He	172	“ You just need to touch the Portkey , that ’s all , a finger will do — ”
22657	22660	22662	22663	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Three ... ”
22672	22677	22662	22663	Mr. Weasley	172	“ two ... one ... ”
22812	22820	22829	22829	Ron	170	“ Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill , ”
22921	22926	22928	22929	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Morning , Basil , ”
22973	22979	22981	22981	Basil	217	“ Hello there , Arthur , ”
22984	22989	22995	22995	he	172	“ Thanks , Basil , ”
23130	23133	23135	23136	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Morning ! ”
23139	23142	23144	23145	the Muggle	160	“ Morning , ”
23147	23154	23118	23118	their	1047	“ Would you be Mr. Roberts ? ”
23155	23161	23163	23164	Mr. Roberts	219	“ Aye , I would , ”
23166	23172	23163	23164	Mr. Roberts	219	“ And who ’re you ? ”
23173	23186	23118	23118	their	1047	“ Weasley — two tents , booked a couple of days ago ? ”
23187	23190	23192	23193	Mr. Roberts	219	“ Aye , ”
23203	23220	23192	23193	Mr. Roberts	219	“ You ’ve got a space up by the wood there . Just the one night ? ”
23221	23226	23228	23229	Mr. Weasley	172	“ That ’s it , ”
23231	23240	23242	23243	Mr. Roberts	219	“ You ’ll be paying now , then ? ”
23245	23252	23254	23255	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Ah — right — certainly — ”
23271	23277	23278	23278	he	172	“ Help me , Harry , ”
23298	23327	23278	23278	he	172	“ This one ’s a — a — a ten ? Ah yes , I see the little number on it now ... So this is a five ? ”
23328	23332	23333	23333	Harry	157	“ A twenty , ”
23351	23370	23278	23278	he	172	“ Ah yes , so it is ... I do n’t know , these little bits of paper ... ”
23371	23375	23377	23378	Mr. Roberts	219	“ You foreign ? ”
23388	23391	23393	23394	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Foreign ? ”
23398	23412	23414	23415	Mr. Roberts	219	“ You ’re not the first one who ’s had trouble with money , ”
23422	23442	23418	23419	Mr. Weasley	172	“ I had two try and pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago . ”
23443	23448	23450	23451	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Did you really ? ”
23465	23471	23472	23472	he	219	“ Never been this crowded , ”
23484	23497	23472	23472	he	219	“ Hundreds of pre - bookings . People usually just turn up ... ”
23498	23503	23505	23506	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Is that right ? ”
23526	23529	23530	23530	he	219	“ Aye , ”
23534	23568	23530	23530	he	219	“ People from all over . Loads of foreigners . And not just foreigners . Weirdos , you know ? There ’s a bloke walking ’ round in a kilt and a poncho . ”
23569	23574	23576	23577	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Should n’t he ? ”
23580	23597	23599	23600	Mr. Roberts	219	“ It ’s like some sort of ... I dunno ... like some sort of rally , ”
23602	23616	23599	23600	Mr. Roberts	219	“ They all seem to know each other . Like a big party . ”
23640	23643	23644	23644	he	1068	“ Obliviate ! ”
23695	23704	23705	23706	Mr. Roberts	219	“ A map of the campsite for you , ”
23713	23718	23705	23706	Mr. Roberts	219	“ And your change . ”
23719	23724	23726	23727	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Thanks very much , ”
23778	23848	23772	23772	he	219	“ Been having a lot of trouble with him . Needs a Memory Charm ten times a day to keep him happy . And Ludo Bagman ’s not helping . Trotting around talking about Bludgers and Quaffles at the top of his voice , not a worry about anti - Muggle security . Blimey , I ’ll be glad when this is over . See you later , Arthur . ”
23852	23865	23867	23867	Ginny	190	“ I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games and Sports , ”
23872	23889	23867	23867	Ginny	190	“ He should know better than to talk about Bludgers near Muggles , should n’t he ? ”
23890	23894	23896	23897	Mr. Weasley	172	“ He should , ”
23911	23963	23896	23897	Mr. Weasley	172	“ but Ludo ’s always been a bit ... well ... lax about security . You could n’t wish for a more enthusiastic Head of the sports department though . He played Quidditch for England himself , you know . And he was the best Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had . ”
24101	24106	24108	24109	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Always the same , ”
24113	24137	24108	24109	Mr. Weasley	172	“ We ca n’t resist showing off when we get together . Ah , here we are , look , this is us . ”
24173	24181	24183	24184	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Could n’t have a better spot ! ”
24187	24210	24211	24211	He	172	“ The field is just on the other side of the wood there , we ’re as close as we could be . ”
24219	24222	24223	24223	he	172	“ Right , ”
24227	24282	24223	24223	he	172	“ no magic allowed , strictly speaking , not when we ’re out in these numbers on Muggle land . We ’ll be putting these tents up by hand ! Should n’t be too difficult ... Muggles do it all the time ... Here , Harry , where do you reckon we should start ? ”
24450	24458	24459	24459	he	172	“ We ’ll be a bit cramped , ”
24462	24478	24459	24459	he	172	“ but I think we ’ll all squeeze in . Come and have a look . ”
24552	24561	24567	24567	his	172	“ Well , it ’s not for long , ”
24587	24611	24567	24567	his	172	“ I borrowed this from Perkins at the office . Does n’t camp much anymore , poor fellow , he ’s got lumbago . ”
24623	24629	24612	24612	He	172	“ We ’ll need water ... ”
24630	24644	24646	24646	Ron	170	“ There ’s a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave us , ”
24665	24676	24646	24646	Ron	170	“ It ’s on the other side of the field . ”
24677	24696	24698	24699	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Well , why do n’t you , Harry , and Hermione go and get us some water then ”
24710	24724	24698	24699	Mr. Weasley	172	“ and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire ? ”
24725	24733	24735	24735	Ron	170	“ But we ’ve got an oven , ”
24737	24744	24735	24735	Ron	170	“ Why ca n’t we just — ”
24745	24753	24755	24756	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Ron , anti - Muggle security ! ”
24764	24783	24758	24758	his	172	“ When real Muggles camp , they cook on fires outdoors . I ’ve seen them at it ! ”
24983	25003	25004	25004	She	821	“ How many times , Kevin ? You do n’t — touch — Daddy ’s — wand — yecchh ! ”
25033	25042	25015	25015	Her	821	“ You bust slug ! You bust slug ! ”
25103	25118	25099	25099	he	1122	“ In broad daylight ! Parents having a lie - in , I suppose — ”
25261	25275	25277	25277	Ron	170	“ Er — is it my eyes , or has everything gone green ? ”
25348	25355	25345	25345	their	1128	“ Harry ! Ron ! Hermione ! ”
25405	25410	25412	25412	Seamus	227	“ Like the decorations ? ”
25416	25424	25412	25412	Seamus	227	“ The Ministry ’s not too happy . ”
25425	25436	25438	25439	Mrs. Finnigan	228	“ Ah , why should n’t we show our colors ? ”
25441	25465	25466	25466	she	228	“ You should see what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents . You ’ll be supporting Ireland , of course ? ”
25501	25513	25498	25498	Ron	170	“ Like we ’d say anything else surrounded by that lot . ”
25514	25528	25530	25530	Hermione	168	“ I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents ? ”
25532	25541	25543	25543	Harry	157	“ Let ’s go and have a look , ”
25628	25631	25633	25633	Ron	170	“ Krum , ”
25636	25639	25641	25641	Hermione	168	“ What ? ”
25643	25646	25648	25648	Ron	170	“ Krum ! ”
25650	25658	25648	25648	Ron	170	“ Viktor Krum , the Bulgarian Seeker ! ”
25659	25665	25667	25667	Hermione	168	“ He looks really grumpy , ”
25681	25687	25688	25688	Ron	170	“ ‘ Really grumpy ’ ? ”
25696	25734	25688	25688	Ron	170	“ Who cares what he looks like ? He ’s unbelievable . He ’s really young too . Only just eighteen or something . He ’s a genius , you wait until tonight , you ’ll see . ”
25812	25844	25797	25797	he	937	“ Just put them on , Archie , there ’s a good chap . You ca n’t walk around like that , the Muggle at the gate ’s already getting suspicious — ”
25845	25854	25856	25858	the old wizard	1150	“ I bought this in a Muggle shop , ”
25861	25866	25856	25858	the old wizard	1150	“ Muggles wear them . ”
25867	25883	25890	25890	he	1151	“ Muggle women wear them , Archie , not the men , they wear these , ”
25896	25904	25906	25907	old Archie	229	“ I ’m not putting them on , ”
25911	25924	25906	25907	old Archie	229	“ I like a healthy breeze ’ round my privates , thanks . ”
26130	26137	26138	26138	he	157	“ Who d’you reckon they are ? ”
26141	26152	26138	26138	he	157	“ They do n’t go to Hogwarts , do they ? ”
26153	26163	26165	26165	Ron	170	“ ’ Spect they go to some foreign school , ”
26167	26245	26165	26165	Ron	170	“ I know there are others . Never met anyone who went to one , though . Bill had a penfriend at a school in Brazil ... this was years and years ago ... and he wanted to go on an exchange trip but Mum and Dad could n’t afford it . His penfriend got all offended when he said he was n’t going and sent him a cursed hat . It made his ears shrivel up . ”
26327	26333	26335	26335	George	175	“ You ’ve been ages , ”
26347	26353	26355	26355	Ron	170	“ Met a few people , ”
26362	26371	26355	26355	Ron	170	“ You not got that fire started yet ? ”
26372	26381	26383	26383	Fred	174	“ Dad ’s having fun with the matches , ”
26429	26432	26433	26433	he	172	“ Oops ! ”
26449	26456	26458	26458	Hermione	168	“ Come here , Mr. Weasley , ”
26576	26647	26545	26546	Mr. Weasley	172	“ That was Cuthbert Mockridge , Head of the Goblin Liaison Office ... Here comes Gilbert Wimple ; he ’s with the Committee on Experimental Charms ; he ’s had those horns for a while now ... Hello , Arnie ... Arnold Peasegood , he ’s an Obliviator — member of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad , you know ... and that ’s Bode and Croaker ... they ’re Unspeakables ... ”
26648	26653	26725	26725	They	1174	“ They ’re what ? ”
26654	26672	26545	26546	Mr. Weasley	172	“ From the Department of Mysteries , top secret , no idea what they get up to ... ”
26706	26712	26714	26714	Percy	186	“ Just Apparated , Dad , ”
26717	26724	26714	26714	Percy	186	“ Ah , excellent , lunch ! ”
26755	26758	26759	26759	he	172	“ Aha ! ”
26762	26771	26759	26759	he	172	“ The man of the moment ! Ludo ! ”
26900	26904	26905	26905	Bagman	201	“ Ahoy there ! ”
26934	26940	26941	26941	he	201	“ Arthur , old man , ”
26949	26989	26941	26941	he	201	“ what a day , eh ? What a day ! Could we have asked for more perfect weather ? A cloudless night coming ... and hardly a hiccough in the arrangements ... Not much for me to do ! ”
27058	27063	27065	27066	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Ah — yes , ”
27070	27122	27065	27066	Mr. Weasley	172	“ this is my son Percy . He ’s just started at the Ministry — and this is Fred — no , George , sorry — that ’s Fred — Bill , Charlie , Ron — my daughter , Ginny — and Ron ’s friends , Hermione Granger and Harry Potter . ”
27153	27156	27157	27158	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Everyone , ”
27161	27185	27157	27158	Mr. Weasley	172	“ this is Ludo Bagman , you know who he is , it ’s thanks to him we ’ve got such good tickets — ”
27201	27211	27212	27212	he	201	“ Fancy a flutter on the match , Arthur ? ”
27238	27292	27212	27212	he	201	“ I ’ve already got Roddy Pontner betting me Bulgaria will score first — I offered him nice odds , considering Ireland ’s front three are the strongest I ’ve seen in years — and little Agatha Timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a week - long match . ”
27293	27300	27302	27303	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Oh ... go on then , ”
27305	27317	27302	27303	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Let ’s see ... a Galleon on Ireland to win ? ”
27318	27322	27323	27324	Ludo Bagman	201	“ A Galleon ? ”
27333	27344	27331	27331	himself	201	“ Very well , very well ... any other takers ? ”
27345	27355	27357	27358	Mr. Weasley	172	“ They ’re a bit young to be gambling , ”
27360	27366	27357	27358	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Molly would n’t like — ”
27367	27382	27384	27384	Fred	174	“ We ’ll bet thirty - seven Galleons , fifteen Sickles , three Knuts , ”
27395	27417	27384	27384	Fred	174	“ that Ireland wins — but Viktor Krum gets the Snitch . Oh and we ’ll throw in a fake wand . ”
27418	27432	27433	27433	Percy	186	“ You do n’t want to go showing Mr. Bagman rubbish like that — ”
27487	27508	27482	27482	Bagman	201	“ Excellent ! I have n’t seen one that convincing in years ! I ’d pay five Galleons for that ! ”
27518	27521	27526	27526	his	172	“ Boys , ”
27529	27546	27526	27526	his	172	“ I do n’t want you betting ... That ’s all your savings ... Your mother — ”
27547	27556	27558	27559	Ludo Bagman	201	“ Do n’t be a spoilsport , Arthur ! ”
27566	27623	27558	27559	Ludo Bagman	201	“ They ’re old enough to know what they want ! You reckon Ireland will win but Krum’ll get the Snitch ? Not a chance , boys , not a chance ... I ’ll give you excellent odds on that one ... We ’ll add five Galleons for the funny wand , then , shall we ... ”
27647	27650	27652	27652	George	175	“ Cheers , ”
27677	27734	27668	27668	Bagman	201	“ Could n’t do me a brew , I suppose ? I ’m keeping an eye out for Barty Crouch . My Bulgarian opposite number ’s making difficulties , and I ca n’t understand a word he ’s saying . Barty’ll be able to sort it out . He speaks about a hundred and fifty languages . ”
27735	27739	27741	27741	Percy	186	“ Mr. Crouch ? ”
27758	27771	27741	27741	Percy	186	“ He speaks over two hundred ! Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll ... ”
27772	27778	27780	27780	Fred	174	“ Anyone can speak Troll , ”
27783	27794	27780	27780	Fred	174	“ All you have to do is point and grunt . ”
27816	27826	27827	27828	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet , Ludo ? ”
27842	27848	27850	27850	Bagman	201	“ Not a dicky bird , ”
27853	27901	27850	27850	Bagman	201	“ But she ’ll turn up . Poor old Bertha ... memory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction . Lost , you take my word for it . She ’ll wander back into the office sometime in October , thinking it ’s still July . ”
27902	27919	27920	27921	Mr. Weasley	172	“ You do n’t think it might be time to send someone to look for her ? ”
27931	27938	27940	27940	Bagman	201	“ Barty Crouch keeps saying that , ”
27948	27969	27940	27940	Bagman	201	“ but we really ca n’t spare anyone at the moment . Oh — talk of the devil ! Barty ! ”
28116	28126	28128	28128	Ludo	201	“ Pull up a bit of grass , Barty , ”
28137	28144	28146	28146	Crouch	242	“ No thank you , Ludo , ”
28159	28182	28146	28146	Crouch	242	“ I ’ve been looking for you everywhere . The Bulgarians are insisting we add another twelve seats to the Top Box . ”
28183	28192	28194	28194	Bagman	201	“ Oh is that what they ’re after ? ”
28196	28216	28194	28194	Bagman	201	“ I thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers . Bit of a strong accent . ”
28217	28221	28223	28223	Percy	186	“ Mr. Crouch ! ”
28242	28251	28223	28223	Percy	186	“ Would you like a cup of tea ? ”
28252	28255	28257	28258	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Oh , ”
28268	28276	28257	28258	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Yes — thank you , Weatherby . ”
28300	28315	28317	28318	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Oh and I ’ve been wanting a word with you too , Arthur , ”
28328	28349	28320	28320	his	199	“ Ali Bashir ’s on the warpath . He wants a word with you about your embargo on flying carpets . ”
28357	28403	28320	28320	his	199	“ I sent him an owl about that just last week . If I ’ve told him once I ’ve told him a hundred times : Carpets are defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects , but will he listen ? ”
28404	28409	28411	28412	Mr. Crouch	199	“ I doubt it , ”
28420	28428	28411	28412	Mr. Crouch	199	“ He ’s desperate to export here . ”
28429	28443	28445	28445	Bagman	201	“ Well , they ’ll never replace brooms in Britain , will they ? ”
28447	28462	28464	28465	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Ali thinks there ’s a niche in the market for a family vehicle , ”
28467	28491	28464	28465	Mr. Crouch	199	“ I remember my grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve — but that was before carpets were banned , of course . ”
28515	28524	28526	28526	Bagman	201	“ So , been keeping busy , Barty ? ”
28529	28532	28534	28535	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Fairly , ”
28538	28551	28534	28535	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Organizing Portkeys across five continents is no mean feat , Ludo . ”
28552	28565	28567	28568	Mr. Weasley	172	“ I expect you ’ll both be glad when this is over ? ”
28575	28618	28619	28620	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Glad ! Do n’t know when I ’ve had more fun ... Still , it ’s not as though we have n’t got anything to look forward to , eh , Barty ? Eh ? Plenty left to organize , eh ? ”
28627	28640	28622	28622	his	199	“ We agreed not to make the announcement until all the details — ”
28641	28645	28647	28647	Bagman	201	“ Oh details ! ”
28659	28696	28647	28647	Bagman	201	“ They ’ve signed , have n’t they ? They ’ve agreed , have n’t they ? I bet you anything these kids’ll know soon enough anyway . I mean , it ’s happening at Hogwarts — ”
28697	28710	28712	28713	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Ludo , we need to meet the Bulgarians , you know , ”
28722	28731	28712	28713	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Thank you for the tea , Weatherby . ”
28769	28775	28776	28776	he	199	“ See you all later ! ”
28779	28795	28796	28796	He	199	“ You ’ll be up in the Top Box with me — I ’m commentating ! ”
28810	28819	28821	28821	Fred	174	“ What ’s happening at Hogwarts , Dad ? ”
28825	28832	28821	28821	Fred	174	“ What were they talking about ? ”
28833	28841	28843	28844	Mr. Weasley	172	“ You ’ll find out soon enough , ”
28848	28865	28867	28867	Percy	247	“ It ’s classified information , until such time as the Ministry decides to release it , ”
28870	28881	28867	28867	Percy	247	“ Mr. Crouch was quite right not to disclose it . ”
28882	28889	28891	28891	Fred	174	“ Oh shut up , Weatherby , ”
29068	29079	29080	29080	Ron	170	“ Been saving my pocket money all summer for this , ”
29143	29150	29152	29152	Harry	157	“ Wow , look at these ! ”
29182	29185	29187	29188	the saleswizard	1207	“ Omnioculars , ”
29191	29223	29187	29188	the saleswizard	1207	“ You can replay action ... slow everything down ... and they flash up a play - by - play breakdown if you need it . Bargain — ten Galleons each . ”
29224	29233	29235	29235	Ron	170	“ Wish I had n’t bought this now , ”
29250	29254	29256	29256	Harry	157	“ Three pairs , ”
29262	29269	29271	29271	Ron	170	“ No — do n’t bother , ”
29304	29314	29315	29315	Harry	157	“ You wo n’t be getting anything for Christmas , ”
29328	29336	29315	29315	Harry	157	“ For about ten years , mind . ”
29337	29341	29343	29343	Ron	170	“ Fair enough , ”
29347	29354	29356	29356	Hermione	168	“ Oooh , thanks , Harry , ”
29358	29369	29356	29356	Hermione	168	“ And I ’ll get us some programs , look — ”
29455	29460	29462	29463	Mr. Weasley	172	“ It ’s time ! ”
29473	29481	29462	29463	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Come on , let ’s go ! ”
29604	29610	29612	29613	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Seats a hundred thousand , ”
29624	29628	29637	29637	she	1219	“ Prime seats ! ”
29642	29659	29637	29637	she	1219	“ Top Box ! Straight upstairs , Arthur , and as high as you can go . ”
30052	30055	30057	30057	Harry	157	“ Dobby ? ”

38729	38738	38739	38739	Hermione	168	“ It ’s people like you , Ron , ”
38743	38760	38739	38739	Hermione	168	“ who prop up rotten and unjust systems , just because they ’re too lazy to — ”
38772	38782	38784	38784	Ron	170	“ Let ’s just keep moving , shall we ? ”
38946	38959	38960	38962	one of them	1146	“ I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a year ! ”
38965	38981	38960	38962	one of them	1146	“ I ’m a dragon killer for the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures . ”
38982	38989	38991	38992	his friend	1511	“ No , you ’re not ! ”
38994	39019	38991	38992	his friend	1511	“ You ’re a dishwasher at the Leaky Cauldron ... but I ’m a vampire hunter , I ’ve killed about ninety so far — ”
39044	39061	39020	39038	A third young wizard , whose pimples were visible even by the dim , silvery light of the veela	1512	“ I ’m about to become the youngest - ever Minister of Magic , I am . ”
39117	39132	39113	39113	Ron	170	“ Did I tell you I ’ve invented a broomstick that ’ll reach Jupiter ? ”
39133	39136	39141	39141	she	168	“ Honestly ! ”
39201	39222	39197	39197	Harry	157	“ I reckon we can just wait here , you know . We ’ll hear anyone coming a mile off . ”
39293	39298	39299	39299	he	157	“ Who ’s that ? ”
39314	39325	39299	39299	he	157	“ What are you doing in here , all alone ? ”
39334	39346	39348	39348	Ron	170	“ Well — there ’s a sort of riot going on , ”
39355	39358	39350	39350	Bagman	201	“ What ? ”
39359	39375	39376	39376	Bagman	201	“ At the campsite ... some people have got hold of a family of Muggles ... ”
39380	39384	39385	39385	he	201	“ Damn them ! ”
39404	39418	39420	39420	Hermione	168	“ Not exactly on top of things , Mr. Bagman , is he ? ”
39424	39433	39435	39435	Ron	170	“ He was a great Beater , though , ”
39464	39482	39435	39435	Ron	170	“ The Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them . ”
39557	39565	39567	39567	Hermione	168	“ I hope the others are okay , ”
39572	39578	39580	39580	Ron	170	“ They ’ll be fine , ”
39582	39590	39592	39592	Harry	157	“ Imagine if your dad catches Lucius , ”
39612	39626	39605	39605	Krum	204	“ He ’s always said he ’d like to get something on him . ”
39627	39642	39644	39644	Ron	170	“ That ’d wipe the smirk off old Draco ’s face , all right , ”
39646	39653	39655	39655	Hermione	168	“ Those poor Muggles , though , ”
39658	39668	39655	39655	Hermione	168	“ What if they ca n’t get them down ? ”
39669	39673	39675	39675	Ron	170	“ They will , ”
39678	39685	39675	39675	Ron	170	“ They ’ll find a way . ”
39686	39707	39709	39709	Hermione	168	“ Mad , though , to do something like that when the whole Ministry of Magic ’s out here tonight ! ”
39711	39738	39709	39709	Hermione	168	“ I mean , how do they expect to get away with it ? Do you think they ’ve been drinking , or are they just — ”
39794	39797	39799	39799	Harry	157	“ Hello ? ”
39839	39844	39845	39845	he	157	“ Who ’s there ? ”
39886	39889	39845	39845	he	157	“ MORSMORDRE ! ”
39924	39929	39931	39931	Ron	170	“ What the — ? ”
40086	40091	40092	40092	he	157	“ Who ’s there ? ”
40096	40104	40105	40105	Hermione	168	“ Harry , come on , move ! ”
40119	40125	40132	40132	her	168	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
40139	40148	40149	40149	Hermione	168	“ It ’s the Dark Mark , Harry ! ”
40160	40169	40157	40157	she	168	“ You - Know - Who ’s sign ! ”
40170	40175	40157	40157	she	168	“ Voldemort ’s — ? ”
40176	40182	40157	40157	she	168	“ Harry , come on ! ”
40279	40282	40276	40276	he	157	“ DUCK ! ”
40296	40299	40301	40302	twenty voices	1537	“ Stupefy ! ”
40368	40371	40402	40407	The wizard in front of him	1540	“ Stop ! ”
40378	40386	40402	40407	The wizard in front of him	1540	“ Stop ! That ’s my son ! ”
40427	40431	40433	40433	his	1540	“ Ron — Harry ”
40438	40446	40433	40433	his	1540	“ Hermione — are you all right ? ”
40447	40455	40465	40466	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Out of the way , Arthur , ”
40498	40505	40506	40506	he	199	“ Which of you did it ? ”
40516	40525	40506	40506	he	199	“ Which of you conjured the Dark Mark ? ”
40526	40533	40535	40535	Harry	157	“ We did n’t do that ! ”
40543	40550	40552	40552	Ron	170	“ We did n’t do anything ! ”
40566	40576	40552	40552	Ron	170	“ What did you want to attack us for ? ”
40577	40584	40586	40587	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Do not lie , sir ! ”
40609	40621	40604	40604	he	199	“ You have been discovered at the scene of the crime ! ”
40622	40625	40627	40634	a witch in a long woolen dressing gown	1543	“ Barty , ”
40636	40651	40627	40634	a witch in a long woolen dressing gown	1543	“ they ’re kids , Barty , they ’d never have been able to — ”
40652	40663	40665	40666	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Where did the Mark come from , you three ? ”
40669	40673	40675	40675	Hermione	168	“ Over there , ”
40689	40704	40675	40675	Hermione	168	“ There was someone behind the trees ... they shouted words — an incantation — ”
40705	40715	40717	40718	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Oh , stood over there , did they ? ”
40735	40757	40732	40732	his	199	“ Said an incantation , did they ? You seem very well informed about how that Mark is summoned , missy — ”
40818	40824	40835	40835	her	1548	“ We ’re too late , ”
40838	40844	40835	40835	her	1548	“ They ’ll have Disapparated . ”
40845	40852	40854	40860	a wizard with a scrubby brown beard	1549	“ I do n’t think so , ”
40871	40889	40864	40865	Amos Diggory	207	“ Our Stunners went right through those trees ... There ’s a good chance we got them ... ”
40890	40896	40898	40902	a few of the wizards	1551	“ Amos , be careful ! ”
40948	40969	40944	40945	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Yes ! We got them ! There ’s someone here ! Unconscious ! It ’s — but — blimey ... ”
40970	40976	40978	40979	Mr. Crouch	199	“ You ’ve got someone ? ”
40985	40992	40978	40979	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Who ? Who is it ? ”
41102	41110	41111	41111	he	199	“ This — can not — be , ”
41115	41118	41111	41111	he	199	“ No — ”
41137	41144	41149	41149	him	199	“ No point , Mr. Crouch , ”
41151	41159	41145	41146	Mr. Diggory	215	“ There ’s no one else there . ”
41194	41198	41199	41200	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Bit embarrassing , ”
41212	41225	41199	41200	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Barty Crouch ’s house - elf ... I mean to say ... ”
41226	41233	41235	41236	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Come off it , Amos , ”
41239	41264	41235	41236	Mr. Weasley	172	“ you do n’t seriously think it was the elf ? The Dark Mark ’s a wizard ’s sign . It requires a wand . ”
41265	41268	41270	41271	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Yeah , ”
41273	41280	41270	41271	Mr. Diggory	215	“ and she had a wand . ”
41281	41284	41286	41287	Mr. Weasley	172	“ What ? ”
41289	41294	41295	41296	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Here , look . ”
41308	41346	41305	41306	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Had it in her hand . So that ’s clause three of the Code of Wand Use broken , for a start . No non - human creature is permitted to carry or use a wand . ”
41384	41389	41390	41390	he	201	“ The Dark Mark ! ”
41404	41421	41397	41397	he	201	“ Who did it ? Did you get them ? Barty ! What ’s going on ? ”
41448	41456	41458	41458	Bagman	201	“ Where have you been , Barty ? ”
41460	41481	41458	41458	Bagman	201	“ Why were n’t you at the match ? Your elf was saving you a seat too — gulping gargoyles ! ”
41492	41498	41486	41486	Winky	252	“ What happened to her ? ”
41499	41507	41509	41510	Mr. Crouch	199	“ I have been busy , Ludo , ”
41525	41533	41509	41510	Mr. Crouch	199	“ And my elf has been Stunned . ”
41534	41548	41486	41486	Winky	252	“ Stunned ? By you lot , you mean ? But why — ? ”
41577	41580	41581	41581	he	201	“ No ! ”
41584	41608	41581	41581	he	201	“ Winky ? Conjure the Dark Mark ? She would n’t know how ! She ’d need a wand , for a start ! ”
41609	41615	41617	41618	Mr. Diggory	215	“ And she had one , ”
41620	41654	41617	41618	Mr. Diggory	215	“ I found her holding one , Ludo . If it ’s all right with you , Mr. Crouch , I think we should hear what she ’s got to say for herself . ”
41691	41694	41677	41677	He	201	“ Rennervate ! ”
41801	41804	41806	41807	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Elf ! ”
41810	41834	41806	41807	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Do you know who I am ? I ’m a member of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures ! ”
41866	41884	41886	41887	Mr. Diggory	215	“ As you see , elf , the Dark Mark was conjured here a short while ago , ”
41889	41908	41886	41887	Mr. Diggory	215	“ And you were discovered moments later , right beneath it ! An explanation , if you please ! ”
41909	41922	41923	41923	Winky	252	“ I — I — I is not doing it , sir ! ”
41926	41935	41923	41923	Winky	252	“ I is not knowing how , sir ! ”
41936	41947	41949	41950	Mr. Diggory	215	“ You were found with a wand in your hand ! ”
41981	41988	41989	41989	he	157	“ Hey — that ’s mine ! ”
42000	42004	42006	42007	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Excuse me ? ”
42011	42017	42019	42019	Harry	157	“ That ’s my wand ! ”
42021	42026	42019	42019	Harry	157	“ I dropped it ! ”
42027	42032	42034	42035	Mr. Diggory	215	“ You dropped it ? ”
42039	42055	42034	42035	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Is this a confession ? You threw it aside after you conjured the Mark ? ”
42056	42066	42068	42069	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Amos , think who you ’re talking to ! ”
42074	42085	42068	42069	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Is Harry Potter likely to conjure the Dark Mark ? ”
42086	42093	42095	42096	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Er — of course not , ”
42098	42104	42095	42096	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Sorry ... carried away ... ”
42105	42115	42117	42117	Harry	157	“ I did n’t drop it there , anyway , ”
42129	42141	42120	42120	his	157	“ I missed it right after we got into the wood . ”
42142	42145	42147	42148	Mr. Diggory	215	“ So , ”
42167	42195	42154	42154	he	215	“ You found this wand , eh , elf ? And you picked it up and thought you ’d have some fun with it , did you ? ”
42196	42207	42209	42209	Winky	252	“ I is not doing magic with it , sir ! ”
42223	42255	42209	42209	Winky	252	“ I is ... I is ... I is just picking it up , sir ! I is not making the Dark Mark , sir , I is not knowing how ! ”
42256	42262	42266	42266	She	168	“ It was n’t her ! ”
42287	42308	42309	42309	She	168	“ Winky ’s got a squeaky little voice , and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper ! ”
42322	42334	42309	42309	She	168	“ It did n’t sound anything like Winky , did it ? ”
42335	42338	42340	42340	Harry	157	“ No , ”
42346	42356	42340	42340	Harry	157	“ It definitely did n’t sound like an elf . ”
42357	42366	42368	42368	Ron	170	“ Yeah , it was a human voice , ”
42370	42378	42380	42381	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Well , we ’ll soon see , ”
42386	42408	42380	42381	Mr. Diggory	215	“ There ’s a simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed , elf , did you know that ? ”
42439	42443	42445	42446	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Prior Incantato ! ”
42504	42507	42508	42509	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Deletrius ! ”
42523	42526	42528	42529	Mr. Diggory	215	“ So , ”
42548	42555	42556	42556	she	252	“ I is not doing it ! ”
42565	42598	42556	42556	she	252	“ I is not , I is not , I is not knowing how ! I is a good elf , I is n’t using wands , I is n’t knowing how ! ”
42599	42610	42611	42612	Mr. Diggory	215	“ You ’ve been caught red - handed , elf ! ”
42615	42625	42611	42612	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Caught with the guilty wand in your hand ! ”
42626	42629	42631	42632	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Amos , ”
42635	42657	42631	42632	Mr. Weasley	172	“ think about it ... precious few wizards know how to do that spell ... Where would she have learned it ? ”
42658	42664	42666	42667	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Perhaps Amos is suggesting , ”
42675	42688	42666	42667	Mr. Crouch	199	“ that I routinely teach my servants to conjure the Dark Mark ? ”
42701	42711	42696	42697	Amos Diggory	207	“ Mr. Crouch ... not ... not at all ... ”
42712	42736	42738	42739	Mr. Crouch	199	“ You have now come very close to accusing the two people in this clearing who are least likely to conjure that Mark ! ”
42741	42761	42738	42739	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Harry Potter — and myself ! I suppose you are familiar with the boy ’s story , Amos ? ”
42762	42769	42771	42772	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Of course — everyone knows — ”
42778	42810	42811	42812	Mr. Crouch	199	“ And I trust you remember the many proofs I have given , over a long career , that I despise and detest the Dark Arts and those who practice them ? ”
42820	42837	42838	42839	Amos Diggory	207	“ Mr. Crouch , I — I never suggested you had anything to do with it ! ”
42851	42864	42866	42867	Mr. Crouch	199	“ If you accuse my elf , you accuse me , Diggory ! ”
42869	42880	42866	42867	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Where else would she have learned to conjure it ? ”
42881	42892	42846	42846	his	207	“ She — she might ’ve picked it up anywhere — ”
42893	42898	42900	42901	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Precisely , Amos , ”
42903	42914	42915	42915	he	172	“ She might have picked it up anywhere ... Winky ? ”
42936	42946	42929	42929	he	172	“ Where exactly did you find Harry ’s wand ? ”
42966	42980	42981	42981	she	252	“ I — I is finding it ... finding it there , sir ... ”
42984	42993	42981	42981	she	252	“ there ... in the trees , sir ... ”
42994	43000	43002	43003	Mr. Weasley	172	“ You see , Amos ? ”
43005	43062	43002	43003	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Whoever conjured the Mark could have Disapparated right after they ’d done it , leaving Harry ’s wand behind . A clever thing to do , not using their own wand , which could have betrayed them . And Winky here had the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick it up . ”
43063	43081	43083	43084	Mr. Diggory	215	“ But then , she ’d have been only a few feet away from the real culprit ! ”
43087	43095	43083	43084	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Elf ? Did you see anyone ? ”
43127	43139	43122	43122	she	252	“ I is seeing no one , sir ... no one ... ”
43140	43143	43145	43146	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Amos , ”
43149	43189	43145	43146	Mr. Crouch	199	“ I am fully aware that , in the ordinary course of events , you would want to take Winky into your department for questioning . I ask you , however , to allow me to deal with her . ”
43231	43242	43243	43244	Mr. Crouch	199	“ You may rest assured that she will be punished , ”
43248	43255	43256	43256	Winky	252	“ M - m - master ... ”
43271	43284	43265	43265	her	252	“ M - m - master , p - p - please ... ”
43311	43326	43327	43327	he	199	“ Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible , ”
43331	43368	43327	43327	he	199	“ I told her to remain in the tent . I told her to stay there while I went to sort out the trouble . And I find that she disobeyed me . This means clothes . ”
43369	43372	43374	43374	Winky	252	“ No ! ”
43384	43395	43374	43374	Winky	252	“ No , master ! Not clothes , not clothes ! ”
43439	43445	43446	43446	Hermione	168	“ But she was frightened ! ”
43456	43487	43453	43454	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Your elf ’s scared of heights , and those wizards in masks were levitating people ! You ca n’t blame her for wanting to get out of their way ! ”
43524	43538	43539	43539	he	199	“ I have no use for a house - elf who disobeys me , ”
43548	43572	43539	43539	he	199	“ I have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master , and to her master ’s reputation . ”
43604	43646	43597	43598	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Well , I think I ’ll take my lot back to the tent , if nobody ’s got any objections . Amos , that wand ’s told us all it can — if Harry could have it back , please — ”
43658	43665	43666	43667	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Come on , you three , ”
43690	43693	43681	43681	her	168	“ Hermione ! ”
43718	43727	43729	43729	Hermione	168	“ What ’s going to happen to Winky ? ”
43739	43745	43747	43748	Mr. Weasley	172	“ I do n’t know , ”
43750	43758	43760	43760	Hermione	168	“ The way they were treating her ! ”
43763	43821	43760	43760	Hermione	168	“ Mr. Diggory , calling her ‘ elf ’ all the time ... and Mr. Crouch ! He knows she did n’t do it and he ’s still going to sack her ! He did n’t care how frightened she ’d been , or how upset she was — it was like she was n’t even human ! ”
43822	43829	43831	43831	Ron	170	“ Well , she ’s not , ”
43838	43857	43760	43760	Hermione	168	“ That does n’t mean she has n’t got feelings , Ron . It ’s disgusting the way — ”
43858	43866	43868	43869	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Hermione , I agree with you , ”
43876	43908	43873	43873	her	168	“ but now is not the time to discuss elf rights . I want to get back to the tent as fast as we can . What happened to the others ? ”
43909	43917	43919	43919	Ron	170	“ We lost them in the dark , ”
43921	43934	43919	43919	Ron	170	“ Dad , why was everyone so uptight about that skull thing ? ”
43935	43945	43947	43948	Mr. Weasley	172	“ I ’ll explain everything back at the tent , ”
43996	44004	43990	43992	many of them	1580	“ What ’s going on in there ? ”
44005	44010	43984	43985	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Who conjured it ? ”
44011	44020	43990	43992	many of them	1580	“ Arthur — it ’s not — Him ? ”
44021	44029	44031	44032	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Of course it ’s not Him , ”
44035	44063	44031	44032	Mr. Weasley	172	“ We do n’t know who it was ; it looks like they Disapparated . Now excuse me , please , I want to get to bed . ”
44115	44123	44124	44124	he	172	“ Dad , what ’s going on ? ”
44130	44145	44124	44124	he	172	“ Fred , George , and Ginny got back okay , but the others — ”
44146	44153	44155	44156	Mr. Weasley	172	“ I ’ve got them here , ”
44225	44233	44235	44235	Bill	184	“ Did you get them , Dad ? ”
44238	44246	44235	44235	Bill	184	“ The person who conjured the Mark ? ”
44247	44250	44252	44253	Mr. Weasley	172	“ No , ”
44255	44280	44252	44253	Mr. Weasley	172	“ We found Barty Crouch ’s elf holding Harry ’s wand , but we ’re none the wiser about who actually conjured the Mark . ”
44281	44284	44286	44286	Bill	184	“ What ? ”
44294	44299	44301	44301	Fred	174	“ Harry ’s wand ? ”
44303	44309	44311	44311	Percy	247	“ Mr. Crouch ’s elf ? ”
44348	44365	44366	44366	he	247	“ Well , Mr. Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that ! ”
44369	44413	44366	44366	he	247	“ Running away when he ’d expressly told her not to ... embarrassing him in front of the whole Ministry ... how would that have looked , if she ’d been brought up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control — ”
44414	44433	44434	44434	Hermione	168	“ She did n’t do anything — she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time ! ”
44465	44492	44494	44494	Percy	247	“ Hermione , a wizard in Mr. Crouch ’s position ca n’t afford a house - elf who ’s going to run amok with a wand ! ”
44500	44507	44509	44509	Hermione	168	“ She did n’t run amok ! ”
44511	44521	44509	44509	Hermione	168	“ She just picked it up off the ground ! ”
44522	44535	44537	44537	Ron	170	“ Look , can someone just explain what that skull thing was ? ”
44540	44555	44537	44537	Ron	170	“ It was n’t hurting anyone ... Why ’s it such a big deal ? ”
44556	44573	44575	44575	Hermione	168	“ I told you , it ’s You - Know - Who ’s symbol , Ron , ”
44583	44598	44575	44575	Hermione	168	“ I read about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts . ”
44599	44610	44612	44613	Mr. Weasley	172	“ And it has n’t been seen for thirteen years , ”
44616	44635	44612	44613	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Of course people panicked ... it was almost like seeing You - Know - Who back again . ”
44636	44643	44645	44645	Ron	170	“ I do n’t get it , ”
44649	44663	44645	44645	Ron	170	“ I mean ... it ’s still only a shape in the sky ... ”
44664	44686	44688	44689	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Ron , You - Know - Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air whenever they killed , ”
44691	44731	44688	44689	Mr. Weasley	172	“ The terror it inspired ... you have no idea , you ’re too young . Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house , and knowing what you ’re about to find inside ... ”
44736	44746	44732	44733	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Everyone ’s worst fear ... the very worst ... ”
44771	44833	44755	44755	Bill	184	“ Well , it did n’t help us tonight , whoever conjured it . It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it . They all Disapparated before we ’d got near enough to unmask any of them . We caught the Robertses before they hit the ground , though . They ’re having their memories modified right now . ”
44834	44838	44840	44840	Harry	157	“ Death Eaters ? ”
44842	44848	44840	44840	Harry	157	“ What are Death Eaters ? ”
44849	44863	44865	44865	Bill	184	“ It ’s what You - Know - Who ’s supporters called themselves , ”
44867	44892	44865	44865	Bill	184	“ I think we saw what ’s left of them tonight — the ones who managed to keep themselves out of Azkaban , anyway . ”
44893	44904	44906	44907	Mr. Weasley	172	“ We ca n’t prove it was them , Bill , ”
44909	44915	44916	44916	he	172	“ Though it probably was , ”
44920	44928	44930	44930	Ron	170	“ Yeah , I bet it was ! ”
44933	44977	44930	44930	Ron	170	“ Dad , we met Draco Malfoy in the woods , and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks ! And we all know the Malfoys were right in with You - Know - Who ! ”
44978	44986	44987	44987	Harry	157	“ But what were Voldemort ’s supporters — ”
45009	45012	45014	45014	Harry	157	“ Sorry , ”
45017	45041	45014	45014	Harry	157	“ What were You - Know - Who ’s supporters up to , levitating Muggles ? I mean , what was the point ? ”
45042	45046	45048	45049	Mr. Weasley	172	“ The point ? ”
45055	45115	45116	45116	he	157	“ Harry , that ’s their idea of fun . Half the Muggle killings back when You - Know - Who was in power were done for fun . I suppose they had a few drinks tonight and could n’t resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large . A nice little reunion for them , ”
45120	45140	45142	45142	Ron	170	“ But if they were the Death Eaters , why did they Disapparate when they saw the Dark Mark ? ”
45144	45158	45142	45142	Ron	170	“ They ’d have been pleased to see it , would n’t they ? ”
45159	45166	45168	45168	Bill	184	“ Use your brains , Ron , ”
45170	45270	45168	45168	Bill	184	“ If they really were Death Eaters , they worked very hard to keep out of Azkaban when You - Know - Who lost power , and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people . I bet they ’d be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back . They denied they ’d ever been involved with him when he lost his powers , and went back to their daily lives ... I do n’t reckon he ’d be over - pleased with them , do you ? ”
45271	45280	45282	45282	Hermione	168	“ So ... whoever conjured the Dark Mark ... ”
45285	45304	45282	45282	Hermione	168	“ were they doing it to show support for the Death Eaters , or to scare them away ? ”
45305	45316	45318	45319	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Your guess is as good as ours , Hermione , ”
45321	45410	45318	45319	Mr. Weasley	172	“ But I ’ll tell you this ... it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it . I ’d be very surprised if the person who did it had n’t been a Death Eater once , even if they ’re not now ... Listen , it ’s very late , and if your mother hears what ’s happened she ’ll be worried sick . We ’ll get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early Portkey out of here . ”
45632	45636	45625	45625	he	219	“ Merry Christmas . ”
45637	45644	45646	45647	Mr. Weasley	172	“ He ’ll be all right , ”
45657	45691	45646	45647	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Sometimes , when a person ’s memory ’s modified , it makes him a bit disorientated for a while ... and that was a big thing they had to make him forget . ”
45833	45841	45901	45901	She	173	“ Oh thank goodness , thank goodness ! ”
45888	45900	45868	45868	her	173	“ Arthur — I ’ve been so worried — so worried — ”
45960	45966	45967	45968	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ You ’re all right , ”
45985	45993	45967	45968	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ you ’re alive ... Oh boys ... ”
46020	46030	46000	46000	she	173	“ Ouch ! Mum — you ’re strangling us — ”
46031	46040	46041	46042	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ I shouted at you before you left ! ”
46049	46093	46041	46042	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ It ’s all I ’ve been thinking about ! What if You - Know - Who had got you , and the last thing I ever said to you was that you did n’t get enough O.W.L.s ? Oh Fred ... George ... ”
46094	46108	46110	46111	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Come on , now , Molly , we ’re all perfectly okay , ”
46127	46130	46131	46131	he	172	“ Bill , ”
46137	46151	46131	46131	he	172	“ pick up that paper , I want to see what it says ... ”
46209	46214	46216	46217	Mr. Weasley	172	“ I knew it , ”
46220	46251	46216	46217	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Ministry blunders ... culprits not apprehended ... lax security ... Dark wizards running unchecked ... national disgrace ... Who wrote this ? Ah ... of course ... Rita Skeeter . ”
46252	46265	46267	46267	Percy	247	“ That woman ’s got it in for the Ministry of Magic ! ”
46270	46318	46267	46267	Percy	247	“ Last week she was saying we ’re wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness , when we should be stamping out vampires ! As if it was n’t specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non - Wizard Part - Humans — ”
46319	46327	46329	46329	Bill	184	“ Do us a favor , Perce , ”
46333	46338	46329	46329	Bill	184	“ and shut up . ”
46339	46344	46346	46347	Mr. Weasley	172	“ I ’m mentioned , ”
46366	46369	46371	46372	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Where ? ”
46381	46396	46371	46372	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ If I ’d seen that , I ’d have known you were alive ! ”
46397	46402	46404	46405	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Not by name , ”
46413	46436	46407	46407	He	172	“ Molly , I ’m going to have to go into the office ; this is going to take some smoothing over . ”
46437	46446	46448	46448	Percy	247	“ I ’ll come with you , Father , ”
46451	46472	46448	46448	Percy	247	“ Mr. Crouch will need all hands on deck . And I can give him my cauldron report in person . ”
46486	46516	46480	46481	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Arthur , you ’re supposed to be on holiday ! This has n’t got anything to do with your office ; surely they can handle this without you ? ”
46517	46526	46528	46529	Mr. Weasley	172	“ I ’ve got to go , Molly , ”
46531	46551	46528	46529	Mr. Weasley	172	“ I ’ve made things worse . I ’ll just change into my robes and I ’ll be off ... ”
46552	46556	46558	46558	Harry	157	“ Mrs. Weasley , ”
46566	46580	46558	46558	Harry	157	“ Hedwig has n’t arrived with a letter for me , has she ? ”
46581	46586	46588	46589	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Hedwig , dear ? ”
46592	46606	46588	46589	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ No ... no , there has n’t been any post at all . ”
46626	46642	46623	46623	he	157	“ All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room , Ron ? ”
46643	46651	46653	46653	Ron	170	“ Yeah ... think I will too , ”
46657	46660	46653	46653	Ron	170	“ Hermione ? ”
46661	46664	46665	46665	she	168	“ Yes , ”
46684	46691	46693	46693	Ron	170	“ What ’s up , Harry ? ”
46709	46719	46720	46720	Harry	157	“ There ’s something I have n’t told you , ”
46723	46737	46720	46720	Harry	157	“ On Saturday morning , I woke up with my scar hurting again . ”
46794	46830	46789	46789	Ron	170	“ But — he was n’t there , was he ? You - Know - Who ? I mean — last time your scar kept hurting , he was at Hogwarts , was n’t he ? ”
46831	46842	46844	46844	Harry	157	“ I ’m sure he was n’t on Privet Drive , ”
46846	46881	46844	46844	Harry	157	“ But I was dreaming about him ... him and Peter — you know , Wormtail . I ca n’t remember all of it now , but they were plotting to kill ... someone . ”
46893	46896	46882	46882	He	157	“ me , ”
46914	46921	46923	46923	Ron	170	“ It was only a dream , ”
46926	46931	46923	46923	Ron	170	“ Just a nightmare . ”
46932	46941	46943	46943	Harry	157	“ Yeah , but was it , though ? ”
46957	46994	46943	46943	Harry	157	“ It ’s weird , is n’t it ? ... My scar hurts , and three days later the Death Eaters are on the march , and Voldemort ’s sign ’s up in the sky again . ”
46995	47005	47006	47006	Ron	170	“ Do n’t — say — his — name ! ”
47012	47020	47021	47021	Harry	157	“ And remember what Professor Trelawney said ? ”
47028	47036	47021	47021	Harry	157	“ At the end of last year ? ”
47059	47077	47052	47052	she	168	“ Oh Harry , you are n’t going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says ? ”
47078	47084	47086	47086	Harry	157	“ You were n’t there , ”
47088	47154	47086	47086	Harry	157	“ You did n’t hear her . This time was different . I told you , she went into a trance — a real one . And she said the Dark Lord would rise again ... greater and more terrible than ever before ... and he ’d manage it because his servant was going to go back to him ... and that night Wormtail escaped . ”
47173	47185	47186	47186	Hermione	168	“ Why were you asking if Hedwig had come , Harry ? ”
47189	47196	47186	47186	Hermione	168	“ Are you expecting a letter ? ”
47197	47205	47207	47207	Harry	157	“ I told Sirius about my scar , ”
47211	47219	47207	47207	Harry	157	“ I ’m waiting for his answer . ”
47220	47224	47226	47226	Ron	170	“ Good thinking ! ”
47232	47241	47226	47226	Ron	170	“ I bet Sirius’ll know what to do ! ”
47242	47253	47255	47255	Harry	157	“ I hoped he ’d get back to me quickly , ”
47257	47279	47281	47281	Hermione	168	“ But we do n’t know where Sirius is ... he could be in Africa or somewhere , could n’t he ? ”
47284	47298	47281	47281	Hermione	168	“ Hedwig ’s not going to manage that journey in a few days . ”
47299	47305	47307	47307	Harry	157	“ Yeah , I know , ”
47332	47346	47348	47348	Ron	170	“ Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard , Harry , ”
47350	47376	47348	47348	Ron	170	“ Come on — three on three , Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will play ... You can try out the Wronski Feint ... ”
47377	47380	47382	47382	Hermione	168	“ Ron , ”
47403	47431	47382	47382	Hermione	168	“ Harry does n’t want to play Quidditch right now ... He ’s worried , and he ’s tired ... We all need to go to bed ... ”
47432	47441	47443	47443	Harry	157	“ Yeah , I want to play Quidditch , ”
47446	47456	47443	47443	Harry	157	“ Hang on , I ’ll get my Firebolt . ”
47469	47472	47457	47457	Hermione	168	“ Boys . ”
47510	47518	47519	47519	Percy	247	“ It ’s been an absolute uproar , ”
47535	47581	47519	47519	Percy	247	“ I ’ve been putting out fires all week . People keep sending Howlers , and of course , if you do n’t open a Howler straight away , it explodes . Scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to cinders . ”
47582	47590	47592	47592	Ginny	190	“ Why are they all sending Howlers ? ”
47619	47628	47630	47630	Percy	247	“ Complaining about security at the World Cup , ”
47632	47682	47630	47630	Percy	247	“ They want compensation for their ruined property . Mundungus Fletcher ’s put in a claim for a twelve - bedroomed tent with en - suite Jacuzzi , but I ’ve got his number . I know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks . ”
47755	47758	47826	47827	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Home , ”
47759	47762	47826	47827	Mr. Weasley	172	“ school , ”

47847	47870	47871	47871	she	173	“ Your father has n’t had to go into the office on weekends since the days of You - Know - Who , ”
47874	47898	47871	47871	she	173	“ They ’re working him far too hard . His dinner ’s going to be ruined if he does n’t come home soon . ”
47899	47921	47923	47923	Percy	247	“ Well , Father feels he ’s got to make up for his mistake at the match , does n’t he ? ”
47925	47951	47923	47923	Percy	247	“ If truth be told , he was a tad unwise to make a public statement without clearing it with his Head of Department first — ”
47952	47968	47970	47971	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Do n’t you dare blame your father for what that wretched Skeeter woman wrote ! ”
47978	48003	48005	48005	Bill	184	“ If Dad had n’t said anything , old Rita would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from the Ministry had commented , ”
48014	48045	48005	48005	Bill	184	“ Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look good . Remember , she interviewed all the Gringotts Charm Breakers once , and called me ‘ a long - haired pillock ’ ? ”
48046	48057	48059	48060	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Well , it is a bit long , dear , ”
48063	48071	48059	48060	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ If you ’d just let me — ”

48218	48229	48231	48231	George	175	“ Yeah , we ’ve left it a bit late , ”
48233	48250	48252	48253	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ You ’re not by any chance writing out a new order form , are you ? ”
48256	48275	48252	48253	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ You would n’t be thinking of re - starting Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes , by any chance ? ”
48276	48281	48283	48283	Fred	174	“ Now , Mum , ”
48297	48331	48294	48294	his	1638	“ If the Hogwarts Express crashed tomorrow , and George and I died , how would you feel to know that the last thing we ever heard from you was an unfounded accusation ? ”

48477	48489	48491	48491	Percy	247	“ Mr. Crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks , ”
48494	48507	48509	48510	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Crouch is very lucky Rita has n’t found out about Winky , ”
48513	48539	48509	48510	Mr. Weasley	172	“ There ’d be a week ’s worth of headlines in his house - elf being caught holding the wand that conjured the Dark Mark . ”
48540	48560	48562	48562	Percy	247	“ I thought we were all agreed that that elf , while irresponsible , did not conjure the Mark ? ”
48565	48590	48592	48592	Hermione	168	“ If you ask me , Mr. Crouch is very lucky no one at the Daily Prophet knows how mean he is to elves ! ”
48595	48602	48604	48604	Percy	247	“ Now look here , Hermione ! ”
48606	48623	48604	48604	Percy	247	“ A high - ranking Ministry official like Mr. Crouch deserves unswerving obedience from his servants — ”
48624	48631	48633	48633	Hermione	168	“ His slave , you mean ! ”
48640	48651	48635	48635	her	168	“ because he did n’t pay Winky , did he ? ”
48652	48669	48671	48672	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ I think you ’d all better go upstairs and check that you ’ve packed properly ! ”
48679	48688	48671	48672	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Come on now , all of you ... ”
48777	48784	48786	48786	Ron	170	“ Bung him some Owl Treats , ”
48795	48802	48786	48786	Ron	170	“ It might shut him up . ”
48834	48842	48843	48843	Harry	157	“ It ’s been over a week , ”
48853	48868	48843	48843	Harry	157	“ Ron , you do n’t reckon Sirius has been caught , do you ? ”
48869	48881	48883	48883	Ron	170	“ Nah , it would ’ve been in the Daily Prophet , ”
48885	48901	48883	48883	Ron	170	“ The Ministry would want to show they ’d caught someone , would n’t they ? ”
48902	48908	48843	48843	Harry	157	“ Yeah , I suppose ... ”
48909	48945	48946	48946	He	170	“ Look , here ’s the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon Alley . And she ’s got some gold out of your vault for you ... and she ’s washed all your socks . ”
49048	49056	49038	49038	Ron	170	“ What is that supposed to be ? ”
49112	49117	49118	49118	she	173	“ Here you are , ”
49127	49141	49118	49118	she	173	“ Now , mind you pack them properly so they do n’t crease . ”
49142	49154	49156	49156	Ron	170	“ Mum , you ’ve given me Ginny ’s new dress , ”
49164	49171	49173	49174	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Of course I have n’t , ”
49176	49185	49173	49174	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ That ’s for you . Dress robes . ”
49186	49189	49191	49191	Ron	170	“ What ? ”
49198	49202	49204	49205	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Dress robes ! ”
49207	49230	49204	49205	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ It says on your school list that you ’re supposed to have dress robes this year ... robes for formal occasions . ”
49231	49239	49241	49241	Ron	170	“ You ’ve got to be kidding , ”
49245	49255	49241	49241	Ron	170	“ I ’m not wearing that , no way . ”
49256	49263	49265	49266	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Everyone wears them , Ron ! ”
49269	49285	49265	49266	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ They ’re all like that ! Your father ’s got some for smart parties ! ”
49286	49297	49299	49299	Ron	170	“ I ’ll go starkers before I put that on , ”
49302	49309	49311	49312	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Do n’t be so silly , ”
49314	49341	49311	49312	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ You ’ve got to have dress robes , they ’re on your list ! I got some for Harry too ... show him , Harry ... ”
49406	49421	49423	49424	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ I thought they ’d bring out the color of your eyes , dear , ”
49427	49434	49436	49436	Ron	170	“ Well , they ’re okay ! ”
49445	49455	49436	49436	Ron	170	“ Why could n’t I have some like that ? ”
49456	49477	49479	49480	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Because ... well , I had to get yours secondhand , and there was n’t a lot of choice ! ”
49513	49520	49521	49521	Ron	170	“ I ’m never wearing them , ”
49526	49529	49521	49521	Ron	170	“ Never . ”
49530	49533	49535	49536	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Fine , ”
49538	49564	49535	49536	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Go naked . And , Harry , make sure you get a picture of him . Goodness knows I could do with a laugh . ”
49595	49603	49605	49605	Ron	170	“ Why is everything I own rubbish ? ”
49706	49709	49710	49710	she	173	“ Arthur ! ”
49716	49725	49710	49710	she	173	“ Arthur ! Urgent message from the Ministry ! ”
49772	49781	49764	49765	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ I ’ve got a quill here somewhere ! ”
49852	49887	49831	49831	It	207	“ ... Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting , so they went and called those what - d’you - call-’ems — please - men . Arthur , you ’ve got to get over there — ”
49888	49891	49893	49894	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Here ! ”
49918	49932	49934	49935	Mr. Diggory	215	“ — it ’s a real stroke of luck I heard about it , ”
49939	49979	49934	49935	Mr. Diggory	215	“ I had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls , and I found the Improper Use of Magic lot all setting off — if Rita Skeeter gets hold of this one , Arthur — ”
49980	49989	49991	49992	Mr. Weasley	172	“ What does Mad - Eye say happened ? ”
50018	50043	50010	50011	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Says he heard an intruder in his yard . Says he was creeping toward the house , but was ambushed by his dustbins . ”
50044	50051	50053	50054	Mr. Weasley	172	“ What did the dustbins do ? ”
50059	50078	50080	50081	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere , as far as I can tell , ”
50083	50100	50080	50081	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Apparently one of them was still rocketing around when the please - men turned up — ”
50105	50112	50010	50011	Mr. Diggory	215	“ And what about the intruder ? ”
50113	50122	50124	50125	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Arthur , you know Mad - Eye , ”
50134	50214	50124	50125	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Someone creeping into his yard in the dead of night ? More likely there ’s a very shell - shocked cat wandering around somewhere , covered in potato peelings . But if the Improper Use of Magic lot get their hands on Mad - Eye , he ’s had it — think of his record — we ’ve got to get him off on a minor charge , something in your department — what are exploding dustbins worth ? ”
50215	50221	50223	50224	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Might be a caution , ”
50235	50252	50231	50231	his	172	“ Mad - Eye did n’t use his wand ? He did n’t actually attack anyone ? ”
50253	50273	50275	50276	Mr. Diggory	215	“ I ’ll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach through the window , ”
50278	50294	50275	50276	Mr. Diggory	215	“ but they ’ll have a job proving it , there are n’t any casualties . ”
50295	50303	50304	50305	Mr. Weasley	172	“ All right , I ’m off , ”
50339	50346	50304	50305	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Sorry about this , Molly , ”
50353	50397	50304	50305	Mr. Weasley	172	“ bothering you so early and everything ... but Arthur ’s the only one who can get Mad - Eye off , and Mad - Eye ’s supposed to be starting his new job today . Why he had to choose last night ... ”
50398	50404	50406	50407	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Never mind , Amos , ”
50409	50425	50406	50407	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Sure you wo n’t have a bit of toast or anything before you go ? ”
50426	50433	50435	50436	Mr. Diggory	215	“ Oh go on , then , ”
50470	50473	50474	50474	he	215	“ Fanks , ”
50538	50552	50554	50555	Mr. Weasley	172	“ I ’d better hurry — you have a good term , boys , ”
50576	50594	50554	50555	Mr. Weasley	172	“ Molly , are you going to be all right taking the kids to King ’s Cross ? ”
50595	50601	50602	50602	she	1664	“ Of course I will , ”
50605	50619	50602	50602	she	1664	“ You just look after Mad - Eye , we ’ll be fine . ”
50632	50640	50641	50641	Bill	184	“ Did someone say Mad - Eye ? ”
50644	50653	50641	50641	Bill	184	“ What ’s he been up to now ? ”
50654	50667	50669	50670	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ He says someone tried to break into his house last night , ”
50672	50678	50680	50680	George	175	“ Mad - Eye Moody ? ”
50689	50696	50680	50680	George	175	“ Is n’t he that nutter — ”
50697	50709	50711	50712	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Your father thinks very highly of Mad - Eye Moody , ”
50715	50728	50730	50730	Fred	174	“ Yeah , well , Dad collects plugs , does n’t he ? ”
50739	50745	50733	50734	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Birds of a feather ... ”
50746	50756	50758	50758	Bill	184	“ Moody was a great wizard in his time , ”
50760	50774	50776	50776	Charlie	185	“ He ’s an old friend of Dumbledore ’s , is n’t he ? ”
50778	50793	50795	50795	Fred	174	“ Dumbledore ’s not what you ’d call normal , though , is he ? ”
50797	50810	50795	50795	Fred	174	“ I mean , I know he ’s a genius and everything ... ”
50811	50818	50820	50820	Harry	157	“ Who is Mad - Eye ? ”
50822	50834	50836	50836	Charlie	185	“ He ’s retired , used to work at the Ministry , ”
50838	50868	50869	50869	he	185	“ I met him once when Dad took me in to work with him . He was an Auror — one of the best ... a Dark wizard catcher , ”
50878	50933	50869	50869	he	185	“ Half the cells in Azkaban are full because of him . He made himself loads of enemies , though ... the families of people he caught , mainly ... and I heard he ’s been getting really paranoid in his old age . Does n’t trust anyone anymore . Sees Dark wizards everywhere . ”
50967	50981	50982	50982	he	247	“ I just ca n’t justify taking more time off at the moment , ”
50986	50997	50982	50982	he	247	“ Mr. Crouch is really starting to rely on me . ”
50998	51007	51009	51009	George	175	“ Yeah , you know what , Percy ? ”
51012	51022	51009	51009	George	175	“ I reckon he ’ll know your name soon . ”
51046	51056	51057	51058	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Arthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us , ”
51085	51106	51057	51058	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ But there were n’t any to spare ... Oh dear , they do n’t look happy , do they ? ”
51486	51498	51500	51500	Charlie	185	“ I might be seeing you all sooner than you think , ”
51512	51515	51517	51517	Fred	174	“ Why ? ”
51520	51525	51527	51527	Charlie	185	“ You ’ll see , ”
51529	51561	51527	51527	Charlie	185	“ Just do n’t tell Percy I mentioned it ... it ’s ‘ classified information , until such time as the Ministry sees fit to release it , ’ after all . ”
51562	51577	51579	51579	Bill	184	“ Yeah , I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this year , ”
51593	51596	51598	51598	George	175	“ Why ? ”
51601	51611	51613	51613	Bill	184	“ You ’re going to have an interesting year , ”
51619	51635	51615	51615	his	184	“ I might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it ... ”
51636	51642	51644	51644	Ron	170	“ A bit of what ? ”
51665	51676	51678	51678	Hermione	168	“ Thanks for having us to stay , Mrs. Weasley , ”
51700	51710	51712	51712	Harry	157	“ Yeah , thanks for everything , Mrs. Weasley , ”
51714	51723	51725	51726	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Oh it was my pleasure , dears , ”
51728	51761	51725	51726	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ I ’d invite you for Christmas , but ... well , I expect you ’re all going to want to stay at Hogwarts , what with ... one thing and another . ”
51762	51765	51767	51767	Ron	170	“ Mum ! ”
51770	51780	51767	51767	Ron	170	“ What d’you three know that we do n’t ? ”
51781	51792	51794	51795	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ You ’ll find out this evening , I expect , ”
51799	51821	51794	51795	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ It ’s going to be very exciting — mind you , I ’m very glad they ’ve changed the rules — ”
51822	51826	51828	51828	Harry	157	“ What rules ? ”
51838	51867	51794	51795	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ I ’m sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you ... Now , behave , wo n’t you ? Wo n’t you , Fred ? And you , George ? ”
51879	51888	51889	51889	Fred	174	“ Tell us what ’s happening at Hogwarts ! ”
51908	51915	51902	51902	Charlie	185	“ What rules are they changing ? ”
51993	52005	52006	52006	he	170	“ Bagman wanted to tell us what ’s happening at Hogwarts , ”
52016	52035	52006	52006	he	170	“ At the World Cup , remember ? But my own mother wo n’t say . Wonder what — ”
52036	52039	52040	52040	Hermione	168	“ Shh ! ”
52098	52111	52112	52112	she	168	“ So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him , does he ? ”
52116	52134	52112	52112	she	168	“ I wish he had gone , then we would n’t have to put up with him . ”
52135	52142	52144	52144	Harry	157	“ Durmstrang ’s another Wizarding school ? ”
52146	52149	52151	52151	Hermione	168	“ Yes , ”
52154	52184	52151	52151	Hermione	168	“ and it ’s got a horrible reputation . According to An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe , it puts a lot of emphasis on the Dark Arts . ”
52185	52194	52196	52196	Ron	170	“ I think I ’ve heard of it , ”
52199	52207	52196	52196	Ron	170	“ Where is it ? What country ? ”
52208	52217	52222	52222	her	168	“ Well , nobody knows , do they ? ”
52225	52231	52233	52233	Harry	157	“ Er — why not ? ”
52235	52265	52267	52267	Hermione	168	“ There ’s traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools . Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal their secrets , ”
52274	52279	52281	52281	Ron	170	“ Come off it , ”
52287	52311	52281	52281	Ron	170	“ Durmstrang ’s got to be about the same size as Hogwarts — how are you going to hide a great big castle ? ”
52312	52318	52320	52320	Hermione	168	“ But Hogwarts is hidden , ”
52325	52343	52320	52320	Hermione	168	“ Everyone knows that ... well , everyone who ’s read Hogwarts : A History , anyway . ”
52344	52350	52352	52352	Ron	170	“ Just you , then , ”
52354	52367	52352	52352	Ron	170	“ So go on — how d’you hide a place like Hogwarts ? ”
52368	52373	52375	52375	Hermione	168	“ It ’s bewitched , ”
52377	52408	52375	52375	Hermione	168	“ If a Muggle looks at it , all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying DANGER , DO NOT ENTER , UNSAFE . ”
52409	52422	52352	52352	Ron	170	“ So Durmstrang’ll just look like a ruin to an outsider too ? ”
52423	52426	52428	52428	Hermione	168	“ Maybe , ”
52432	52466	52428	52428	Hermione	168	“ or it might have Muggle - repelling charms on it , like the World Cup stadium . And to keep foreign wizards from finding it , they ’ll have made it Unplottable — ”
52467	52471	52352	52352	Ron	170	“ Come again ? ”
52472	52494	52428	52428	Hermione	168	“ Well , you can enchant a building so it ’s impossible to plot on a map , ca n’t you ? ”
52495	52503	52505	52505	Harry	157	“ Er ... if you say so , ”
52507	52520	52522	52522	Hermione	168	“ But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north , ”
52525	52542	52522	52522	Hermione	168	“ Somewhere very cold , because they ’ve got fur capes as part of their uniforms . ”
52543	52551	52553	52553	Ron	170	“ Ah , think of the possibilities , ”
52556	52583	52553	52553	Ron	170	“ It would ’ve been so easy to push Malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an accident ... Shame his mother likes him ... ”
52706	52713	52732	52732	Hermione	168	“ Troy — Mullet — Moran ! ”
52780	52788	52789	52789	he	313	“ Gran did n’t want to go , ”
52793	52804	52789	52789	he	313	“ Would n’t buy tickets . It sounded amazing though . ”
52805	52809	52811	52811	Ron	170	“ It was , ”
52813	52820	52811	52811	Ron	170	“ Look at this , Neville ... ”
52841	52845	52847	52847	Neville	313	“ Oh wow , ”
52858	52869	52871	52871	Ron	170	“ We saw him right up close , as well , ”
52873	52881	52871	52871	Ron	170	“ We were in the Top Box — ”
52882	52895	52896	52897	Draco Malfoy	256	“ For the first and last time in your life , Weasley . ”
52951	52963	52965	52965	Harry	157	“ Do n’t remember asking you to join us , Malfoy , ”
52968	52975	52977	52977	Malfoy	256	“ Weasley ... what is that ? ”
53037	53042	53044	53044	Malfoy	256	“ Look at this ! ”
53059	53084	53055	53055	Crabbe	315	“ Weasley , you were n’t thinking of wearing these , were you ? I mean — they were very fashionable in about 1890 ... ”
53085	53091	53093	53093	Ron	170	“ Eat dung , Malfoy ! ”
53125	53171	53055	53055	Crabbe	315	“ So ... going to enter , Weasley ? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name ? There ’s money involved as well , you know ... you ’d be able to afford some decent robes if you won ... ”
53172	53179	53181	53181	Ron	170	“ What are you talking about ? ”
53183	53190	53191	53191	Malfoy	256	“ Are you going to enter ? ”
53194	53214	53191	53191	Malfoy	256	“ I suppose you will , Potter ? You never miss a chance to show off , do you ? ”
53215	53229	53231	53231	Hermione	168	“ Either explain what you ’re on about or go away , Malfoy , ”
53257	53267	53268	53268	he	256	“ Do n’t tell me you do n’t know ? ”
53272	53351	53268	53268	he	256	“ You ’ve got a father and brother at the Ministry and you do n’t even know ? My God , my father told me about it ages ago ... heard it from Cornelius Fudge . But then , Father ’s always associated with the top people at the Ministry ... Maybe your father ’s too junior to know about it , Weasley ... yes ... they probably do n’t talk about important stuff in front of him ... ”
53390	53393	53395	53395	Hermione	168	“ Ron ! ”
53406	53409	53399	53399	she	168	“ Reparo ! ”
53426	53441	53442	53442	Ron	170	“ Well ... making it look like he knows everything and we do n’t ... ”
53445	53478	53442	53442	Ron	170	“ ‘ Father ’s always associated with the top people at the Ministry . ’ ... Dad could ’ve got a promotion any time ... he just likes it where he is ... ”
53479	53485	53487	53487	Hermione	168	“ Of course he does , ”
53490	53501	53487	53487	Hermione	168	“ Do n’t let Malfoy get to you , Ron — ”
53502	53513	53515	53515	Ron	170	“ Him ! Get to me ! ? As if ! ”
53654	53659	53660	53660	Harry	157	“ Hi , Hagrid ! ”
53675	53682	53683	53683	Hagrid	180	“ All righ ’ , Harry ? ”
53689	53701	53683	53683	Hagrid	180	“ See yeh at the feast if we don ’ drown ! ”
53716	53730	53732	53732	Hermione	168	“ Oooh , I would n’t fancy crossing the lake in this weather , ”
53963	53966	53968	53968	Ron	170	“ Blimey , ”
53978	53996	53968	53968	Ron	170	“ if that keeps up the lake ’s going to overflow . I ’m soak — ARRGH ! ”
54128	54131	54167	54167	she	318	“ Peeves ! ”
54137	54146	54167	54167	she	318	“ Peeves , come down here at ONCE ! ”
54185	54193	54167	54167	she	318	“ Ouch — sorry , Miss Granger — ”
54194	54202	54203	54203	Hermione	168	“ That ’s all right , Professor ! ”
54210	54218	54220	54221	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Peeves , get down here NOW ! ”
54237	54242	54244	54244	Peeves	317	“ Not doing nothing ! ”
54266	54279	54281	54281	he	317	“ Already wet , are n’t they ? Little squirts ! Wheeeeeeeeee ! ”
54296	54303	54305	54306	Professor McGonagall	318	“ I shall call the headmaster ! ”
54308	54316	54305	54306	Professor McGonagall	318	“ I ’m warning you , Peeves — ”
54345	54353	54355	54356	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Well , move along , then ! ”
54363	54372	54355	54356	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Into the Great Hall , come on ! ”
54585	54589	54590	54590	he	323	“ Good evening , ”
54597	54601	54603	54603	Harry	157	“ Says who ? ”
54615	54628	54603	54603	Harry	157	“ Hope they hurry up with the Sorting . I ’m starving . ”
54688	54693	54696	54697	Colin Creevey	324	“ Hiya , Harry ! ”
54711	54716	54718	54718	Harry	157	“ Hi , Colin , ”
54721	54741	54696	54697	Colin Creevey	324	“ Harry , guess what ? Guess what , Harry ? My brother ’s starting ! My brother Dennis ! ”
54742	54747	54749	54749	Harry	157	“ Er — good , ”
54751	54757	54759	54759	Colin	324	“ He ’s really excited ! ”
54770	54788	54759	54759	Colin	324	“ I just hope he ’s in Gryffindor ! Keep your fingers crossed , eh , Harry ? ”
54789	54797	54799	54799	Harry	157	“ Er — yeah , all right , ”
54814	54829	54830	54830	he	157	“ Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses , do n’t they ? ”
54850	54857	54859	54859	Hermione	168	“ Oh no , not necessarily , ”
54861	54887	54859	54859	Hermione	168	“ Parvati Patil ’s twin ’s in Ravenclaw , and they ’re identical . You ’d think they ’d be together , would n’t you ? ”
54957	54969	54971	54971	Hermione	168	“ Where ’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ? ”
55035	55043	55045	55045	Hermione	168	“ Maybe they could n’t get anyone ! ”
55337	55342	55343	55343	Ron	170	“ Oh hurry up , ”
55349	55356	55343	55343	Ron	170	“ I could eat a hippogriff . ”
55655	55668	55670	55670	Harry	157	“ That ’s not the song it sang when it Sorted us , ”
55678	55686	55688	55688	Ron	170	“ Sings a different one every year , ”
55690	55721	55688	55688	Ron	170	“ It ’s got to be a pretty boring life , has n’t it , being a hat ? I suppose it spends all year making up the next one . ”
55733	55753	55754	55754	she	318	“ When I call out your name , you will put on the hat and sit on the stool , ”
55760	55782	55754	55754	she	318	“ When the hat announces your House , you will go and sit at the appropriate table . Ackerley , Stewart ! ”
56075	56082	56083	56083	he	325	“ Colin , I fell in ! ”
56094	56114	56083	56083	he	325	“ It was brilliant ! And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat ! ”
56115	56118	56120	56120	Colin	324	“ Cool ! ”
56126	56136	56120	56120	Colin	324	“ It was probably the giant squid , Dennis ! ”
56137	56140	56142	56142	Dennis	325	“ Wow ! ”
56181	56211	56120	56120	Colin	324	“ Dennis ! Dennis ! See that boy down there ? The one with the black hair and glasses ? See him ? Know who he is , Dennis ? ”
56267	56272	56273	56273	Ron	170	“ Oh hurry up , ”
56280	56294	56296	56298	Nearly Headless Nick	323	“ Now , Ron , the Sorting ’s much more important than food , ”
56300	56305	56296	56298	Nearly Headless Nick	323	“ Madley , Laura ! ”
56310	56321	56323	56323	Ron	170	“ ’ Course it is , if you ’re dead , ”
56325	56340	56342	56344	Nearly Headless Nick	323	“ I do hope this year ’s batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch , ”
56348	56353	56342	56344	Nearly Headless Nick	323	“ McDonald , Natalie ! ”
56359	56373	56342	56344	Nearly Headless Nick	323	“ We do n’t want to break our winning streak , do we ? ”
56395	56398	56342	56344	Nearly Headless Nick	323	“ Whitby , Kevin!”(“HUFFLEPUFF
56400	56421	56342	56344	Nearly Headless Nick	323	” ) , the Sorting ended . Professor McGonagall picked up the Sorint hat and the stool and carried them away .
56422	56426	56428	56428	Ron	170	“ About time , ”
56466	56477	56478	56478	he	169	“ I have only two words to say to you , ”
56490	56494	56478	56478	he	169	“ Tuck in . ”
56495	56500	56502	56502	Harry	157	“ Hear , hear ! ”
56533	56541	56543	56543	Ron	170	“ Aaah , ’ at ’s be’er , ”
56553	56568	56570	56572	Nearly Headless Nick	323	“ You ’re lucky there ’s a feast at all tonight , you know , ”
56574	56583	56570	56572	Nearly Headless Nick	323	“ There was trouble in the kitchens earlier . ”
56584	56592	56594	56594	Harry	157	“ Why ? Wha ’ ’ appened ? ”
56603	56609	56611	56613	Nearly Headless Nick	323	“ Peeves , of course , ”
56635	56715	56623	56623	He	323	“ The usual argument , you know . He wanted to attend the feast — well , it ’s quite out of the question , you know what he ’s like , utterly uncivilized , ca n’t see a plate of food without throwing it . We held a ghost ’s council — the Fat Friar was all for giving him the chance — but most wisely , in my opinion , the Bloody Baron put his foot down . ”
56747	56759	56761	56761	Ron	170	“ Yeah , we thought Peeves seemed hacked off about something , ”
56764	56774	56761	56761	Ron	170	“ So what did he do in the kitchens ? ”
56775	56780	56782	56784	Nearly Headless Nick	323	“ Oh the usual , ”
56788	56814	56782	56784	Nearly Headless Nick	323	“ Wreaked havoc and mayhem . Pots and pans everywhere . Place swimming in soup . Terrified the house - elves out of their wits — ”
56847	56855	56856	56856	she	168	“ There are house - elves here ? ”
56870	56875	56856	56856	she	168	“ Here at Hogwarts ? ”
56876	56879	56881	56883	Nearly Headless Nick	323	“ Certainly , ”
56891	56908	56881	56883	Nearly Headless Nick	323	“ The largest number in any dwelling in Britain , I believe . Over a hundred . ”
56909	56916	56918	56918	Hermione	168	“ I ’ve never seen one ! ”
56920	56935	56937	56939	Nearly Headless Nick	323	“ Well , they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day , do they ? ”
56941	57000	56937	56939	Nearly Headless Nick	323	“ They come out at night to do a bit of cleaning ... see to the fires and so on ... I mean , you ’re not supposed to see them , are you ? That ’s the mark of a good house - elf , is n’t it , that you do n’t know it ’s there ? ”
57006	57012	57013	57013	she	168	“ But they get paid ? ”
57016	57037	57013	57013	she	168	“ They get holidays , do n’t they ? And — and sick leave , and pensions , and everything ? ”
57073	57079	57080	57080	he	323	“ Sick leave and pensions ? ”
57099	57111	57080	57080	he	323	“ House - elves do n’t want sick leave and pensions ! ”
57139	57151	57153	57153	Ron	170	“ Oh c’m on , ’ Er - my - knee , ”
57164	57172	57173	57173	He	170	“ Oops — sorry , ’ Arry — ”
57176	57188	57173	57173	He	170	“ You wo n’t get them sick leave by starving yourself ! ”
57189	57193	57195	57195	Hermione	168	“ Slave labor , ”
57203	57214	57195	57195	Hermione	168	“ That ’s what made this dinner . Slave labor . ”
57271	57277	57279	57279	Ron	170	“ Treacle tart , Hermione ! ”
57288	57297	57279	57279	Ron	170	“ Spotted dick , look ! Chocolate gateau ! ”
57370	57373	57375	57375	Dumbledore	169	“ So ! ”
57383	57386	57387	57387	Harry	157	“ What ? ”
57423	57478	57419	57419	Dumbledore	169	“ This is due to an event that will be starting in October , and continuing throughout the school year , taking up much of the teachers ’ time and energy — but I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely . I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts — ”
57966	57979	57981	57981	Dumbledore	169	“ May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ? ”
57987	57991	57981	57981	Dumbledore	169	“ Professor Moody . ”
58060	58063	58064	58064	Harry	157	“ Moody ? ”
58069	58085	58064	58064	Harry	157	“ Mad - Eye Moody ? The one your dad went to help this morning ? ”
58086	58090	58092	58092	Ron	170	“ Must be , ”
58100	58106	58107	58107	Hermione	168	“ What happened to him ? ”
58110	58117	58107	58107	Hermione	168	“ What happened to his face ? ”
58118	58121	58122	58122	Ron	170	“ Dunno , ”
58222	58228	58229	58229	he	169	“ As I was saying , ”
58254	58306	58249	58252	Mad - Eye Moody	294	“ we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months , an event that has not been held for over a century . It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year . ”
58307	58312	58314	58315	Fred Weasley	174	“ You ’re JOKING ! ”
58342	58351	58352	58352	he	169	“ I am not joking , Mr. Weasley , ”
58355	58389	58352	58352	he	169	“ though now that you mention it , I did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll , a hag , and a leprechaun who all go into a bar ... ”
58397	58401	58402	58402	Hermione	168	“ Death toll ? ”
58461	58468	58476	58476	his	169	“ I ’m going for it ! ”
58583	58590	58592	58593	George Weasley	175	“ They ca n’t do that ! ”
58615	58630	58592	58593	George Weasley	175	“ We ’re seventeen in April , why ca n’t we have a shot ? ”
58631	58639	58641	58641	Fred	174	“ They ’re not stopping me entering , ”
58651	58677	58641	58641	Fred	174	“ The champions’ll get to do all sorts of stuff you ’d never be allowed to do normally . And a thousand Galleons prize money ! ”
58678	58681	58683	58683	Ron	170	“ Yeah , ”
58692	58699	58683	58683	Ron	170	“ Yeah , a thousand Galleons ... ”
58700	58704	58706	58706	Hermione	168	“ Come on , ”
58708	58723	58706	58706	Hermione	168	“ we ’ll be the only ones left here if you do n’t move . ”
58762	58778	58780	58780	Harry	157	“ Who ’s this impartial judge who ’s going to decide who the champions are ? ”
58782	58785	58787	58787	Fred	174	“ Dunno , ”
58789	58815	58787	58787	Fred	174	“ but it ’s them we ’ll have to fool . I reckon a couple of drops of Aging Potion might do it , George ... ”
58816	58827	58829	58829	Ron	170	“ Dumbledore knows you ’re not of age , though , ”
58831	58850	58852	58852	Fred	174	“ Yeah , but he ’s not the one who decides who the champion is , is he ? ”
58855	58895	58852	58852	Fred	174	“ Sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter , he ’ll choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are . Dumbledore ’s trying to stop us giving our names . ”
58896	58903	58905	58905	Hermione	168	“ People have died , though ! ”
58928	58931	58933	58933	Fred	174	“ Yeah , ”
58936	58978	58933	58933	Fred	174	“ but that was years ago , was n’t it ? Anyway , where ’s the fun without a bit of risk ? Hey , Ron , what if we find out how to get ’ round Dumbledore ? Fancy entering ? ”
58979	58984	58985	58985	Ron	170	“ What d’you reckon ? ”
58989	59015	58987	58987	Harry	157	“ Be cool to enter , would n’t it ? But I s’pose they might want someone older ... Dunno if we ’ve learned enough ... ”
59016	59022	59024	59024	Neville	313	“ I definitely have n’t , ”
59034	59069	59024	59024	Neville	313	“ I expect my gran’d want me to try , though . She ’s always going on about how I should be upholding the family honor . I ’ll just have to — oops ... ”
59149	59155	59157	59157	Ron	170	“ Shut it , you , ”

59463	59474	59475	59475	Ron	170	“ I might go in for it , you know , ”
59482	59502	59475	59475	Ron	170	“ if Fred and George find out how to ... the tournament ... you never know , do you ? ”
59503	59507	59475	59475	Ron	170	“ S’pose not ... ”
59687	59697	59699	59699	Ron	170	“ Today ’s not bad ... outside all morning , ”
59710	59731	59699	59699	Ron	170	“ Herbology with the Hufflepuffs and Care of Magical Creatures ... damn it , we ’re still with the Slytherins ... ”
59732	59738	59739	59739	Harry	157	“ Double Divination this afternoon , ”
59770	59784	59786	59786	Hermione	168	“ You should have given it up like me , should n’t you ? ”
59794	59805	59786	59786	Hermione	168	“ Then you ’d be doing something sensible like Arithmancy . ”
59806	59815	59817	59817	Ron	170	“ You ’re eating again , I notice , ”
59831	59847	59849	59849	Hermione	168	“ I ’ve decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights , ”
59852	59860	59862	59862	Ron	170	“ Yeah ... and you were hungry , ”
60108	60111	60112	60113	Professor Sprout	329	“ Bubotubers , ”
60118	60129	60112	60113	Professor Sprout	329	“ They need squeezing . You will collect the pus — ”
60130	60134	60136	60137	Seamus Finnigan	227	“ The what ? ”
60142	60149	60151	60152	Professor Sprout	329	“ Pus , Finnigan , pus , ”
60154	60201	60151	60152	Professor Sprout	329	“ and it ’s extremely valuable , so do n’t waste it . You will collect the pus , I say , in these bottles . Wear your dragon - hide gloves ; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted , bubotuber pus . ”
60260	60268	60270	60271	Professor Sprout	329	“ This ’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy , ”
60281	60309	60270	60271	Professor Sprout	329	“ An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne , bubotuber pus . Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples . ”
60310	60316	60318	60319	Hannah Abbott	350	“ Like poor Eloise Midgen , ”
60329	60337	60318	60319	Hannah Abbott	350	“ She tried to curse hers off . ”
60338	60342	60344	60345	Professor Sprout	329	“ Silly girl , ”
60351	60364	60348	60348	her	329	“ But Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end . ”

60518	60538	60506	60506	Hagrid	180	“ Be’er wait fer the Slytherins , they won ’ want ter miss this — Blast - Ended Skrewts ! ”
60539	60543	60545	60545	Ron	170	“ Come again ? ”
60554	60557	60559	60560	Lavender Brown	352	“ Eurgh ! ”

60696	60718	60693	60693	Hagrid	180	“ so yeh’ll be able ter raise ’em yerselves ! Thought we ’d make a bit of a project of it ! ”
60719	60729	60756	60756	Hagrid	180	“ And why would we want to raise them ? ”
60763	60772	60774	60774	Malfoy	256	“ I mean , what do they do ? ”
60776	60784	60774	60774	Malfoy	256	“ What is the point of them ? ”
60807	60879	60803	60803	he	180	“ Tha ’s next lesson , Malfoy . Yer jus ’ feedin ’ ’em today . Now , yeh’ll wan ’ ter try ’em on a few diff’rent things — I ’ve never had ’em before , not sure what they ’ll go fer — I got ant eggs an ’ frog livers an ’ a bit o ’ grass snake — just try ’em out with a bit of each . ”
60880	60887	60889	60889	Seamus	227	“ First pus and now this , ”
60951	60954	60956	60957	Dean Thomas	147	“ Ouch ! ”
60963	60968	60956	60957	Dean Thomas	147	“ It got me ! ”
60978	60983	60985	60985	Dean	147	“ Its end exploded ! ”
60996	61009	61011	61011	Hagrid	180	“ Ah , yeah , that can happen when they blast off , ”
61015	61018	61020	61021	Lavender Brown	352	“ Eurgh ! ”
61024	61037	61020	61021	Lavender Brown	352	“ Eurgh , Hagrid , what ’s that pointy thing on it ? ”
61038	61048	61050	61050	Hagrid	180	“ Ah , some of ’em have got stings , ”
61063	61090	61050	61050	Hagrid	180	“ I reckon they ’re the males ... The females’ve got sorta sucker things on their bellies ... I think they might be ter suck blood . ”
61091	61107	61109	61109	Malfoy	256	“ Well , I can certainly see why we ’re trying to keep them alive , ”
61112	61130	61109	61109	Malfoy	256	“ Who would n’t want pets that can burn , sting , and bite all at once ? ”
61131	61149	61150	61150	Hermione	168	“ Just because they ’re not very pretty , it does n’t mean they ’re not useful , ”
61153	61174	61150	61150	Hermione	168	“ Dragon blood ’s amazingly magical , but you would n’t want a dragon for a pet , would you ? ”
61253	61263	61265	61265	Ron	170	“ Well , at least the skrewts are small , ”
61282	61287	61289	61289	Hermione	168	“ They are now , ”
61295	61315	61289	61289	Hermione	168	“ but once Hagrid ’s found out what they eat , I expect they ’ll be six feet long . ”
61316	61336	61338	61338	Ron	170	“ Well , that wo n’t matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something , will it ? ”
61345	61359	61361	61361	Hermione	168	“ You know perfectly well I only said that to shut Malfoy up , ”
61363	61396	61361	61361	Hermione	168	“ As a matter of fact I think he ’s right . The best thing to do would be to stamp on the lot of them before they start attacking us all . ”
61427	61439	61441	61441	Ron	170	“ Er — is this the new stand on elf rights ? ”
61443	61453	61441	61441	Ron	170	“ You ’re going to make yourself puke instead ? ”
61454	61457	61466	61466	she	168	“ No , ”
61476	61486	61466	61466	she	168	“ I just want to get to the library . ”
61487	61490	61492	61492	Ron	170	“ What ? ”
61496	61514	61492	61492	Ron	170	“ Hermione — it ’s the first day back ! We have n’t even got homework yet ! ”
61542	61548	61534	61534	she	168	“ See you at dinner ! ”
61689	61693	61699	61700	Professor Trelawney	304	“ Good day , ”
61766	61774	61775	61775	she	1903	“ You are preoccupied , my dear , ”
61781	61840	61775	61775	she	1903	“ My inner eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within . And I regret to say that your worries are not baseless . I see difficult times ahead for you , alas ... most difficult ... I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass ... and perhaps sooner than you think ... ”
61903	61917	61918	61918	she	1903	“ My dears , it is time for us to consider the stars , ”
61972	61987	61965	61965	she	1903	“ ‘ I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass ... ’ ”
62111	62114	62115	62115	Ron	170	“ Harry ! ”
62118	62121	62115	62115	Ron	170	“ What ? ”
62154	62174	62176	62177	Professor Trelawney	304	“ I was saying , my dear , that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn , ”
62201	62209	62211	62211	Harry	157	“ Born under — what , sorry ? ”
62213	62222	62224	62225	Professor Trelawney	304	“ Saturn , dear , the planet Saturn ! ”
62239	62295	62231	62231	he	157	“ I was saying that Saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your birth ... Your dark hair ... your mean stature ... tragic losses so young in life ... I think I am right in saying , my dear , that you were born in midwinter ? ”
62296	62299	62301	62301	Harry	157	“ No , ”
62303	62310	62301	62301	Harry	157	“ I was born in July . ”
62369	62377	62379	62379	Harry	157	“ I ’ve got two Neptunes here , ”
62392	62402	62379	62379	Harry	157	“ that ca n’t be right , can it ? ”
62403	62406	62408	62408	Ron	170	“ Aaaaah , ”
62417	62442	62408	62408	Ron	170	“ when two Neptunes appear in the sky , it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born , Harry ... ”
62468	62492	62465	62466	Lavender Brown	352	“ Oh Professor , look ! I think I ’ve got an unaspected planet ! Oooh , which one ’s that , Professor ? ”
62493	62501	62503	62504	Professor Trelawney	304	“ It is Uranus , my dear , ”
62512	62524	62526	62526	Ron	170	“ Can I have a look at Uranus too , Lavender ? ”
62558	62583	62584	62584	she	304	“ A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you , with reference to your personal chart , ”
62601	62616	62584	62584	she	304	“ I want it ready to hand in next Monday , and no excuses ! ”
62617	62622	62624	62624	Ron	170	“ Miserable old bat , ”
62642	62652	62624	62624	Ron	170	“ That ’ll take all weekend , that will ... ”
62653	62658	62660	62660	Hermione	168	“ Lots of homework ? ”
62668	62679	62660	62660	Hermione	168	“ Professor Vector did n’t give us any at all ! ”
62680	62688	62690	62690	Ron	170	“ Well , bully for Professor Vector , ”
62727	62734	62740	62740	Hermione	168	“ Weasley ! Hey , Weasley ! ”
62760	62763	62765	62765	Ron	170	“ What ? ”
62768	62778	62780	62780	Malfoy	256	“ Your dad ’s in the paper , Weasley ! ”
62805	62811	62780	62780	Malfoy	256	“ Listen to this ! . ”
62816	62843	62844	62844	he	256	“ Imagine them not even getting his name right , Weasley . It ’s almost as though he ’s a complete nonentity , is n’t it ? ”
62847	62856	62858	62858	Malfoy	256	“ And there ’s a picture , Weasley ! ”
62869	62902	62858	62858	Malfoy	256	“ A picture of your parents outside their house — if you can call it a house ! Your mother could do with losing a bit of weight , could n’t she ? ”
62915	62921	62923	62923	Harry	157	“ Get stuffed , Malfoy , ”
62925	62931	62923	62923	Harry	157	“ C’m on , Ron ... ”
62932	62950	62952	62952	Malfoy	256	“ Oh yeah , you were staying with them this summer , were n’t you , Potter ? ”
62954	62973	62952	62952	Malfoy	256	“ So tell me , is his mother really that porky , or is it just the picture ? ”
62974	62982	62984	62984	Harry	157	“ You know your mother , Malfoy ? ”
63007	63040	63003	63003	himself	157	“ that expression she ’s got , like she ’s got dung under her nose ? Has she always looked like that , or was it just because you were with her ? ”
63049	63060	63003	63003	himself	157	“ Do n’t you dare insult my mother , Potter . ”
63061	63070	63072	63072	Harry	157	“ Keep your fat mouth shut , then , ”
63132	63140	63141	63141	Harry	157	“ OH NO YOU DON’T , LADDIE ! ”
63234	63240	63241	63241	Moody	344	“ Did he get you ? ”
63251	63254	63256	63256	Harry	157	“ No , ”
63258	63261	63256	63256	Harry	157	“ missed . ”
63262	63266	63267	63267	Moody	344	“ LEAVE IT ! ”
63270	63275	63276	63276	Harry	157	“ Leave — what ? ”
63281	63287	63288	63288	Moody	344	“ Not you — him ! ”
63360	63367	63369	63369	Moody	344	“ I do n’t think so ! ”
63402	63418	63420	63420	Moody	344	“ I do n’t like people who attack when their opponent ’s back ’s turned , ”
63433	63443	63420	63420	Moody	344	“ Stinking , cowardly , scummy thing to do ... ”
63458	63467	63469	63469	Moody	344	“ Never — do — that — again — ”
63486	63490	63541	63541	her	318	“ Professor Moody ! ”
63511	63517	63519	63519	Moody	344	“ Hello , Professor McGonagall , ”
63528	63536	63538	63539	Professor McGonagall	318	“ What — what are you doing ? ”
63553	63556	63558	63558	Moody	344	“ Teaching , ”
63560	63570	63572	63573	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Teach — Moody , is that a student ? ”
63583	63586	63588	63588	Moody	344	“ Yep , ”
63590	63593	63595	63596	Professor McGonagall	318	“ No ! ”
63651	63662	63664	63665	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Moody , we never use Transfiguration as a punishment ! ”
63668	63676	63664	63665	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Surely Professor Dumbledore told you that ? ”
63677	63686	63688	63688	Moody	344	“ He might ’ve mentioned it , yeah , ”
63695	63704	63688	63688	Moody	344	“ but I thought a good sharp shock — ”
63705	63722	63664	63665	Professor McGonagall	318	“ We give detentions , Moody ! Or speak to the offender ’s Head of House ! ”
63723	63731	63733	63733	Moody	344	“ I ’ll do that , then , ”
63767	63770	63664	63665	Professor McGonagall	318	“ my father ”
63774	63778	63780	63780	Moody	344	“ Oh yeah ? ”
63801	63845	63793	63793	his	344	“ Well , I know your father of old , boy ... You tell him Moody ’s keeping a close eye on his son ... you tell him that from me ... Now , your Head of House’ll be Snape , will it ? ”
63846	63849	63851	63851	Malfoy	256	“ Yes , ”
63854	63859	63861	63861	Moody	344	“ Another old friend , ”
63863	63881	63861	63861	Moody	344	“ I ’ve been looking forward to a chat with old Snape ... Come on , you ... ”
63931	63938	63939	63939	Ron	170	“ Do n’t talk to me , ”
63972	63976	63978	63978	Hermione	168	“ Why not ? ”
63982	63994	63996	63996	Ron	170	“ Because I want to fix that in my memory forever , ”
64009	64018	63996	63996	Ron	170	“ Draco Malfoy , the amazing bouncing ferret ... ”
64037	64047	64048	64048	she	168	“ He could have really hurt Malfoy , though , ”
64051	64064	64048	64048	she	168	“ It was good , really , that Professor McGonagall stopped it — ”
64065	64068	64070	64070	Ron	170	“ Hermione ! ”
64079	64090	64070	64070	Ron	170	“ you ’re ruining the best moment of my life ! ”
64105	64120	64122	64122	Harry	157	“ Do n’t tell me you ’re going back to the library this evening ? ”
64127	64131	64133	64133	Hermione	168	“ Got to , ”
64136	64141	64133	64133	Hermione	168	“ Loads to do . ”
64142	64150	64133	64133	Hermione	168	“ But you told us Professor Vector — ”
64151	64157	64158	64158	she	168	“ It ’s not schoolwork , ”
64187	64190	64191	64191	he	1932	“ Moody ! ”
64194	64200	64191	64191	he	1932	“ How cool is he ? ”
64201	64205	64207	64207	George	175	“ Beyond cool , ”
64214	64217	64225	64226	Lee Jordan	347	“ Supercool , ”
64235	64242	64243	64243	he	347	“ We had him this afternoon , ”
64249	64255	64257	64257	Harry	157	“ What was it like ? ”
64336	64352	64354	64354	Ron	170	“ You know why Snape ’s in such a foul mood , do n’t you ? ”
64376	64379	64381	64381	Harry	157	“ Yeah , ”
64383	64386	64381	64381	Harry	157	“ Moody . ”
64484	64498	64499	64499	Harry	157	“ I reckon Snape ’s a bit scared of him , you know , ”
64503	64514	64516	64516	Ron	170	“ Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad , ”
64523	64532	64516	64516	Ron	170	“ and bounced him all around his dungeon ... ”
64584	64589	64625	64626	the teacher	1946	“ Been in the — ”
64590	64593	64594	64594	Harry	157	“ Library . ”
64601	64615	64594	64594	Harry	157	“ C’m on , quick , or we wo n’t get decent seats . ”
64694	64701	64702	64702	he	344	“ You can put those away , ”
64714	64724	64702	64702	he	344	“ those books . You wo n’t need them . ”
64791	64795	64796	64796	he	344	“ Right then , ”
64808	64855	64796	64796	he	344	“ I ’ve had a letter from Professor Lupin about this class . Seems you ’ve had a pretty thorough grounding in tackling Dark creatures — you ’ve covered boggarts , Red Caps , hinkypunks , grindylows , Kappas , and werewolves , is that right ? ”
64864	64878	64880	64880	Moody	344	“ But you ’re behind — very behind — on dealing with curses , ”
64882	64916	64880	64880	Moody	344	“ So I ’m here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other . I ’ve got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark — ”
64917	64925	64926	64926	Ron	170	“ What , are n’t you staying ? ”
65002	65013	65014	65014	Moody	344	“ You ’ll be Arthur Weasley ’s son , eh ? ”
65017	65059	65014	65014	Moody	344	“ Your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago ... Yeah , I ’m staying just the one year . Special favor to Dumbledore ... One year , and then back to my quiet retirement . ”
65074	65113	65069	65069	his	344	“ So — straight into it . Curses . They come in many strengths and forms . Now , according to the Ministry of Magic , I ’m supposed to teach you countercurses and leave it at that . ”
65153	65171	65187	65187	Moody	344	“ So ... do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by Wizarding law ? ”
65202	65205	65207	65207	Ron	170	“ Er , ”
65210	65228	65207	65207	Ron	170	“ my dad told me about one ... Is it called the Imperius Curse , or something ? ”
65229	65234	65236	65236	Moody	344	“ Ah , yes , ”
65239	65262	65236	65236	Moody	344	“ Your father would know that one . Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time , the Imperius Curse . ”
65345	65348	65335	65335	He	344	“ Imperio ! ”
65438	65447	65448	65448	he	344	“ Think it ’s funny , do you ? ”
65451	65467	65448	65448	he	344	“ You ’d like it , would you , if I did it to you ? ”
65475	65479	65481	65481	Moody	344	“ Total control , ”
65497	65519	65481	65481	Moody	344	“ I could make it jump out of the window , drown itself , throw itself down one of your throats ... ”
65526	65545	65547	65547	Moody	344	“ Years back , there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the Imperius Curse , ”
65567	65638	65639	65639	he	344	“ Some job for the Ministry , trying to sort out who was being forced to act , and who was acting of their own free will . The Imperius Curse can be fought , and I ’ll be teaching you how , but it takes real strength of character , and not everyone ’s got it . Better avoid being hit with it if you can . CONSTANT VIGILANCE ! ”
65660	65670	65646	65646	Moody	344	“ Anyone else know one ? Another illegal curse ? ”
65719	65722	65724	65724	Moody	344	“ Yes ? ”
65737	65746	65748	65748	Neville	313	“ There ’s one — the Cruciatus Curse , ”
65770	65776	65777	65777	he	344	“ Your name ’s Longbottom ? ”
65837	65842	65844	65844	Moody	344	“ The Cruciatus Curse , ”
65846	65860	65861	65861	he	344	“ Needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea , ”
65871	65874	65861	65861	he	344	“ Engorgio ! ”
65922	65925	65907	65907	Moody	344	“ Crucio ! ”
65996	66000	66001	66001	Hermione	168	“ Stop it ! ”
66073	66076	66077	66077	Moody	344	“ Reducio , ”
66098	66101	66103	66103	Moody	344	“ Pain , ”
66106	66140	66103	66103	Moody	344	“ You do n’t need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse ... That one was very popular once too . Right ... anyone know any others ? ”
66188	66191	66193	66193	Moody	344	“ Yes ? ”
66199	66203	66204	66204	Hermione	168	“ Avada Kedavra , ”
66218	66221	66223	66223	Moody	344	“ Ah , ”
66233	66248	66229	66229	his	344	“ Yes , the last and worst . Avada Kedavra ... the Killing Curse . ”
66323	66327	66328	66328	Moody	344	“ Avada Kedavra ! ”
66409	66413	66414	66414	he	344	“ Not nice , ”
66418	66453	66414	66414	he	344	“ Not pleasant . And there ’s no countercurse . There ’s no blocking it . Only one known person has ever survived it , and he ’s sitting right in front of me . ”
66836	66843	66826	66827	Most people	1980	“ Did you see it twitch ? ”
66844	66856	66857	66857	They	913	“ — and when he killed it — just like that ! ”
66896	66900	66901	66901	she	168	“ Hurry up , ”
66909	66916	66918	66918	Ron	170	“ Not the ruddy library again ? ”
66920	66923	66925	66925	Hermione	168	“ No , ”
66934	66937	66925	66925	Hermione	168	“ Neville . ”
66975	66978	66979	66979	Hermione	168	“ Neville ? ”
66987	66991	66992	66992	he	313	“ Oh hello , ”
67002	67028	66992	66992	he	313	“ Interesting lesson , was n’t it ? I wonder what ’s for dinner , I ’m — I ’m starving , are n’t you ? ”
67029	67037	67039	67039	Hermione	168	“ Neville , are you all right ? ”
67041	67049	67050	67050	Neville	313	“ Oh yes , I ’m fine , ”
67059	67073	67050	67050	Neville	313	“ Very interesting dinner — I mean lesson — what ’s for eating ? ”
67081	67087	67074	67074	Ron	170	“ Neville , what — ? ”
67139	67147	67148	67148	he	344	“ It ’s all right , sonny , ”
67153	67175	67148	67148	he	344	“ Why do n’t you come up to my office ? Come on ... we can have a cup of tea ... ”
67203	67213	67195	67195	Moody	344	“ You all right , are you , Potter ? ”
67214	67217	67219	67219	Harry	157	“ Yes , ”
67242	67283	67239	67239	he	344	“ You ’ve got to know . It seems harsh , maybe , but you ’ve got to know . No point pretending ... well ... come on , Longbottom , I ’ve got some books that might interest you . ”
67326	67332	67334	67334	Ron	170	“ What was that about ? ”
67344	67350	67352	67352	Hermione	168	“ I do n’t know , ”
67357	67365	67367	67367	Ron	170	“ Some lesson , though , eh ? ”
67379	67420	67367	67367	Ron	170	“ Fred and George were right , were n’t they ? He really knows his stuff , Moody , does n’t he ? When he did Avada Kedavra , the way that spider just died , just snuffed it right — ”
67529	67550	67551	67551	Harry	157	“ Would n’t Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with the Ministry if they knew we ’d seen the curses ? ”
67560	67565	67567	67567	Ron	170	“ Yeah , probably , ”
67569	67610	67567	67567	Ron	170	“ But Dumbledore ’s always done things his way , has n’t he , and Moody ’s been getting in trouble for years , I reckon . Attacks first and asks questions later — look at his dustbins . Balderdash . ”
67637	67647	67649	67649	Harry	157	“ Shall we get our Divination stuff , then ? ”
67651	67655	67656	67656	Ron	170	“ I s’pose , ”
67712	67719	67720	67720	Harry	157	“ You all right , Neville ? ”
67724	67728	67730	67730	Neville	313	“ Oh yes , ”
67732	67748	67730	67730	Neville	313	“ I ’m fine , thanks . Just reading this book Professor Moody lent me ... ”
67762	67777	67778	67778	Neville	313	“ Apparently , Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I ’m really good at Herbology , ”
67799	67807	67789	67789	his	313	“ He thought I ’d like this . ”
67934	67949	67950	67950	he	157	“ I have n’t got a clue what this lot ’s supposed to mean , ”
67962	67966	67968	67968	Ron	170	“ You know , ”
67990	68002	67968	67968	Ron	170	“ I think it ’s back to the old Divination standby . ”
68003	68010	68045	68045	he	170	“ What — make it up ? ”
68011	68014	68016	68016	Ron	170	“ Yeah , ”
68040	68044	68045	68045	he	170	“ Next Monday , ”
68051	68070	68071	68071	He	170	“ I am likely to develop a cough , owing to the unlucky conjunction of Mars and Jupiter . ”
68077	68095	68071	68071	He	170	“ You know her — just put in loads of misery , she ’ll lap it up . ”
68096	68099	68101	68101	Harry	157	“ Right , ”
68125	68142	68101	68101	Harry	157	“ Okay ... on Monday , I will be in danger of — er — burns . ”
68143	68150	68152	68152	Ron	170	“ Yeah , you will be , ”
68155	68174	68152	68152	Ron	170	“ we ’re seeing the skrewts again on Monday . Okay , Tuesday , I ’ll ... erm ... ”
68175	68181	68183	68183	Harry	157	“ Lose a treasured possession , ”
68195	68199	68201	68201	Ron	170	“ Good one , ”
68207	68232	68201	68201	Ron	170	“ Because of ... erm ... Mercury . Why do n’t you get stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend ? ”
68233	68238	68240	68240	Harry	157	“ Yeah ... cool ... ”
68246	68256	68240	68240	Harry	157	“ because ... Venus is in the twelfth house . ”
68257	68273	68201	68201	Ron	170	“ And on Wednesday , I think I ’ll come off worst in a fight . ”
68274	68293	68240	68240	Harry	157	“ Aaah , I was going to have a fight . Okay , I ’ll lose a bet . ”
68294	68307	68201	68201	Ron	170	“ Yeah , you ’ll be betting I ’ll win my fight ... ”
68580	68596	68560	68560	his	2001	“ No — that sounds like we ’re accusing him . Got to be careful ... ”
68698	68701	68702	68702	she	168	“ Hello , ”
68705	68711	68702	68702	she	168	“ I ’ve just finished ! ”
68712	68717	68719	68719	Ron	170	“ So have I ! ”
68750	68763	68764	68764	she	168	“ Not going to have a very good month , are you ? ”
68775	68785	68786	68786	Ron	170	“ Ah well , at least I ’m forewarned , ”
68789	68797	68799	68799	Hermione	168	“ You seem to be drowning twice , ”
68801	68806	68808	68808	Ron	170	“ Oh am I ? ”
68816	68832	68834	68834	Hermione	168	“ Do n’t you think it ’s a bit obvious you ’ve made these up ? ”
68836	68841	68843	68843	Ron	170	“ How dare you ! ”
68854	68861	68863	68863	Ron	170	“ It ’s just an expression , ”
68883	68890	68891	68891	he	157	“ What ’s in the box ? ”
68898	68904	68906	68906	Hermione	168	“ Funny you should ask , ”
68945	68950	68952	68952	Harry	157	“ ‘ Spew ’ ? ”
68963	68967	68969	68969	Hermione	168	“ Not spew , ”
68972	68978	68980	68980	Ron	170	“ Never heard of it , ”
68982	68991	68993	68993	Hermione	168	“ Well , of course you have n’t , ”
68996	69004	68993	68993	Hermione	168	“ I ’ve only just started it . ”
69005	69008	69010	69010	Ron	170	“ Yeah ? ”
69015	69023	69010	69010	Ron	170	“ How many members have you got ? ”
69024	69034	69036	69036	Hermione	168	“ Well — if you two join — three , ”
69038	69057	69059	69059	Ron	170	“ And you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying ‘ spew , ’ do you ? ”
69061	69070	69072	69072	Hermione	168	“ S - P - E - W ! ”
69075	69115	69072	69072	Hermione	168	“ I was going to put Stop the Outrageous Abuse of Our Fellow Magical Creatures and Campaign for a Change in Their Legal Status — but it would n’t fit . So that ’s the heading of our manifesto . ”
69125	69156	69116	69116	She	168	“ I ’ve been researching it thoroughly in the library . Elf enslavement goes back centuries . I ca n’t believe no one ’s done anything about it before now . ”
69157	69164	69166	69166	Ron	170	“ Hermione — open your ears , ”
69169	69181	69166	69166	Ron	170	“ They . Like . It . They like being enslaved ! ”
69182	69189	69191	69191	Hermione	168	“ Our short - term aims , ”
69211	69263	69204	69204	she	168	“ are to secure house - elves fair wages and working conditions . Our long - term aims include changing the law about non - wand use , and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures , because they ’re shockingly underrepresented . ”
69264	69273	69274	69274	Harry	157	“ And how do we do all this ? ”
69277	69284	69286	69286	Hermione	168	“ We start by recruiting members , ”
69289	69354	69286	69286	Hermione	168	“ I thought two Sickles to join — that buys a badge — and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign . You ’re treasurer , Ron — I ’ve got you a collecting tin upstairs — and Harry , you ’re secretary , so you might want to write down everything I ’m saying now , as a record of our first meeting . ”
69444	69447	69448	69448	he	157	“ Hedwig ! ”
69490	69494	69496	69496	Harry	157	“ About time ! ”
69502	69509	69511	69511	Ron	170	“ She ’s got an answer ! ”
69547	69553	69554	69554	Hermione	168	“ What does it say ? ”
69596	69602	69603	69603	Hermione	168	“ He ’s flying north ? ”
69606	69612	69603	69603	Hermione	168	“ He ’s coming back ? ”
69613	69620	69622	69622	Ron	170	“ Dumbledore ’s reading what signs ? ”
69627	69634	69622	69622	Ron	170	“ Harry — what ’s up ? ”
69655	69663	69664	69664	Harry	157	“ I should n’t ’ve told him ! ”
69668	69675	69677	69677	Ron	170	“ What are you on about ? ”
69681	69694	69696	69696	Harry	157	“ It ’s made him think he ’s got to come back ! ”
69720	69749	69750	69750	Harry	157	“ Coming back , because he thinks I ’m in trouble ! And there ’s nothing wrong with me ! And I have n’t got anything for you , ”
69762	69777	69758	69758	her	162	“ you ’ll have to go up to the Owlery if you want food . ”
69806	69809	69810	69810	Hermione	168	“ Harry , ”
69820	69827	69829	69829	Harry	157	“ I ’m going to bed , ”
69832	69839	69829	69829	Harry	157	“ See you in the morning . ”
70328	70336	70337	70337	Harry	157	“ Just find him , all right ? ”
70359	70365	70337	70337	Harry	157	“ Before the dementors do . ”
70442	70450	70452	70452	Hermione	168	“ That was a lie , Harry , ”
70468	70481	70452	70452	Hermione	168	“ You did n’t imagine your scar hurting and you know it . ”
70482	70486	70488	70488	Harry	157	“ So what ? ”
70490	70502	70488	70488	Harry	157	“ He ’s not going back to Azkaban because of me . ”
70503	70507	70509	70509	Ron	170	“ Drop it , ”
70700	70712	70714	70714	Hermione	168	“ But — but you said it ’s illegal , Professor , ”
70741	70753	70726	70726	his	344	“ You said — to use it against another human was — ”
70754	70764	70766	70766	Moody	344	“ Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like , ”
70784	70820	70768	70768	his	344	“ If you ’d rather learn the hard way — when someone ’s putting it on you so they can control you completely — fine by me . You ’re excused . Off you go . ”
70971	70974	70975	70975	Moody	344	“ Potter , ”
70978	70982	70975	70975	Moody	344	“ you next . ”
71016	71019	71003	71003	Moody	344	“ Imperio ! ”
71231	71240	71242	71242	Moody	344	“ Now , that ’s more like it ! ”
71278	71344	71261	71261	He	157	“ Look at that , you lot ... Potter fought ! He fought it , and he damn near beat it ! We ’ll try that again , Potter , and the rest of you , pay attention — watch his eyes , that ’s where you see it — very good , Potter , very good indeed ! They ’ll have trouble controlling you ! ”
71345	71351	71352	71352	Harry	157	“ The way he talks , ”
71395	71409	71370	71370	Moody	344	“ you ’d think we were all going to be attacked any second . ”
71410	71416	71418	71418	Ron	170	“ Yeah , I know , ”
71452	71457	71458	71458	Ron	170	“ Talk about paranoid ... ”
71477	71539	71467	71467	Moody	344	“ No wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the Ministry . Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who shouted ‘ Boo ’ behind him on April Fools ’ Day ? And when are we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else we ’ve got to do ? ”
71585	71599	71600	71600	she	318	“ You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education ! ”
71613	71622	71600	71600	she	318	“ Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer — ”
71623	71633	71635	71636	Dean Thomas	147	“ We do n’t take O.W.L.s till fifth year ! ”
71639	71702	71600	71600	she	318	“ Maybe not , Thomas , but believe me , you need all the preparation you can get ! Miss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion . I might remind you that your pincushion , Thomas , still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin ! ”
71923	71926	71914	71914	Hagrid	180	“ project , ”
71950	71955	71957	71958	Draco Malfoy	256	“ I will not , ”
71982	71995	71969	71970	Father Christmas	203	“ I see enough of these foul things during lessons , thanks . ”
72004	72012	72013	72013	he	180	“ Yeh’ll do wha ’ yer told , ”
72016	72041	72013	72013	he	180	“ or I ’ll be takin ’ a leaf outta Professor Moody ’s book ... I hear yeh made a good ferret , Malfoy . ”
72188	72191	72193	72193	Harry	157	“ Brilliant ! ”
72195	72214	72193	72193	Harry	157	“ It ’s Potions last thing on Friday ! Snape wo n’t have time to poison us all ! ”
72215	72221	72223	72223	Ernie	231	“ Only a week away ! ”
72237	72252	72226	72226	Hufflepuff	231	“ I wonder if Cedric knows ? Think I ’ll go and tell him ... ”
72253	72256	72258	72258	Ron	170	“ Cedric ? ”
72265	72268	72270	72270	Harry	157	“ Diggory , ”
72272	72280	72270	72270	Harry	157	“ He must be entering the tournament . ”
72281	72288	72290	72290	Ron	170	“ That idiot , Hogwarts champion ? ”
72304	72324	72326	72326	Hermione	168	“ He ’s not an idiot . You just do n’t like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch , ”
72328	72345	72326	72326	Hermione	168	“ I ’ve heard he ’s a really good student — and he ’s a prefect . ”
72355	72365	72367	72367	Ron	170	“ You only like him because he ’s handsome , ”
72370	72385	72387	72387	Hermione	168	“ Excuse me , I do n’t like people just because they ’re handsome ! ”
72401	72404	72390	72390	Ron	170	“ Lockhart ! ”
72592	72616	72617	72618	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Longbottom , kindly do not reveal that you ca n’t even perform a simple Switching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang ! ”
72794	72803	72804	72804	George	175	“ It ’s a bummer , all right , ”
72811	72850	72804	72804	George	175	“ But if he wo n’t talk to us in person , we ’ll have to send him the letter after all . Or we ’ll stuff it into his hand . He ca n’t avoid us forever . ”
72851	72857	72859	72859	Ron	170	“ Who ’s avoiding you ? ”
72867	72872	72874	72874	Fred	174	“ Wish you would , ”
72882	72888	72889	72889	Ron	170	“ What ’s a bummer ? ”
72893	72904	72906	72906	George	175	“ Having a nosy git like you for a brother , ”
72908	72920	72921	72921	Harry	157	“ You two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament yet ? ”
72924	72933	72921	72921	Harry	157	“ Thought any more about trying to enter ? ”
72934	72949	72951	72951	George	175	“ I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she was n’t telling , ”
72954	72970	72951	72951	George	175	“ She just told me to shut up and get on with Transfiguring my raccoon . ”
72971	72981	72983	72983	Ron	170	“ Wonder what the tasks are going to be ? ”
72986	73006	72983	72983	Ron	170	“ You know , I bet we could do them , Harry . We ’ve done dangerous stuff before ... ”
73007	73021	73023	73023	Fred	174	“ Not in front of a panel of judges , you have n’t , ”
73025	73043	73023	73023	Fred	174	“ McGonagall says the champions get awarded points according to how well they ’ve done the tasks . ”
73044	73050	73051	73051	Harry	157	“ Who are the judges ? ”
73054	73069	73071	73071	Hermione	168	“ Well , the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel , ”
73083	73112	73078	73078	her	168	“ because all three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792 , when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage . ”
73140	73194	73124	73124	her	168	“ It ’s all in Hogwarts : A History . Though , of course , that book ’s not entirely reliable . A Revised History of Hogwarts would be a more accurate title . Or A Highly Biased and Selective History of Hogwarts , Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School . ”
73195	73202	73204	73204	Ron	170	“ What are you on about ? ”
73215	73220	73224	73224	her	168	“ House - elves ! ”
73228	73257	73224	73224	her	168	“ Not once , in over a thousand pages , does Hogwarts : A History mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slaves ! ”
73390	73424	73425	73425	she	168	“ You do realize that your sheets are changed , your fires lit , your classrooms cleaned , and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid and enslaved ? ”
73528	73542	73519	73519	George	175	“ Listen , have you ever been down in the kitchens , Hermione ? ”
73543	73550	73552	73552	Hermione	168	“ No , of course not , ”
73555	73564	73552	73552	Hermione	168	“ I hardly think students are supposed to — ”
73565	73571	73573	73573	George	175	“ Well , we have , ”
73578	73610	73573	73573	George	175	“ loads of times , to nick food . And we ’ve met them , and they ’re happy . They think they ’ve got the best job in the world — ”
73611	73621	73622	73622	Hermione	168	“ That ’s because they ’re uneducated and brainwashed ! ”
73745	73754	73755	73755	Ron	170	“ Why d’you have to keep changing owls ? ”
73762	73769	73771	73771	Hermione	168	“ Hedwig’ll attract too much attention , ”
73775	73804	73771	73771	Hermione	168	“ She stands out . A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he ’s hiding ... I mean , they ’re not native birds , are they ? ”
73876	73881	73882	73882	he	157	“ Thanks , Hedwig , ”
74026	74033	74034	74035	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Weasley , straighten your hat , ”
74040	74053	74034	74035	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Miss Patil , take that ridiculous thing out of your hair . ”
74069	74075	74077	74078	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Follow me , please , ”
74080	74089	74077	74078	Professor McGonagall	318	“ First years in front ... no pushing ... ”
74159	74163	74165	74165	Ron	170	“ Nearly six , ”
74183	74194	74165	74165	Ron	170	“ How d’you reckon they ’re coming ? The train ? ”
74195	74200	74202	74202	Hermione	168	“ I doubt it , ”
74204	74211	74212	74212	Harry	157	“ How , then ? Broomsticks ? ”
74222	74235	74165	74165	Ron	170	“ I do n’t think so ... not from that far away ... ”
74236	74240	74241	74241	Ron	170	“ A Portkey ? ”
74244	74264	74241	74241	Ron	170	“ Or they could Apparate — maybe you ’re allowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come from ? ”
74265	74284	74286	74286	Hermione	168	“ You ca n’t Apparate inside the Hogwarts grounds , how often do I have to tell you ? ”
74353	74369	74339	74340	Mr. Weasley	172	“ always the same — we ca n’t resist showing off when we get together ... ”
74387	74403	74380	74380	he	169	“ Aha ! Unless I am very much mistaken , the delegation from Beauxbatons approaches ! ”
74404	74407	74409	74410	many students	2112	“ Where ? ”
74419	74422	74424	74431	a sixth year , pointing over the forest	2113	“ There ! ”
74467	74473	74482	74482	her	2116	“ It ’s a dragon ! ”
74486	74498	74500	74501	Dennis Creevey	325	“ Do n’t be stupid ... it ’s a flying house ! ”
75025	75031	75032	75032	he	169	“ My dear Madame Maxime , ”
75035	75040	75032	75032	he	169	“ Welcome to Hogwarts . ”
75041	75046	75048	75049	Madame Maxime	291	“ Dumbly - dorr , ”
75055	75064	75048	75049	Madame Maxime	291	“ I ’ ope I find you well ? ”
75065	75074	75076	75076	Dumbledore	169	“ In excellent form , I thank you , ”
75078	75082	75084	75085	Madame Maxime	291	“ My pupils , ”
75216	75223	75224	75225	Madame Maxime	291	“ ’ As Karkaroff arrived yet ? ”
75228	75236	75238	75238	Dumbledore	169	“ He should be here any moment , ”
75240	75263	75238	75238	Dumbledore	169	“ Would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle ? ”
75264	75271	75273	75274	Madame Maxime	291	“ Warm up , I think , ”
75276	75282	75273	75274	Madame Maxime	291	“ But ze ’ orses — ”
75283	75299	75301	75301	Dumbledore	169	“ Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them , ”
75303	75328	75301	75301	Dumbledore	169	“ the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other — er — charges . ”
75329	75332	75333	75333	Ron	170	“ Skrewts , ”
75340	75351	75353	75354	Madame Maxime	291	“ My steeds require — er — forceful ’ andling , ”
75377	75383	75359	75359	she	291	“ Zey are very strong ... ”
75384	75398	75400	75400	Dumbledore	169	“ I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job , ”
75404	75408	75410	75411	Madame Maxime	291	“ Very well , ”
75416	75435	75410	75411	Madame Maxime	291	“ Will you please inform zis ’ Agrid zat ze ’ orses drink only single - malt whiskey ? ”
75436	75443	75445	75445	Dumbledore	169	“ It will be attended to , ”
75450	75453	75455	75456	Madame Maxime	291	“ Come , ”
75480	75493	75494	75495	Seamus Finnigan	227	“ How big d’you reckon Durmstrang ’s horses are going to be ? ”
75509	75531	75533	75533	Harry	157	“ Well , if they ’re any bigger than this lot , even Hagrid wo n’t be able to handle them , ”
75535	75555	75533	75533	Harry	157	“ That ’s if he has n’t been attacked by his skrewts . Wonder what ’s up with them ? ”
75556	75562	75564	75564	Ron	170	“ Maybe they ’ve escaped , ”
75567	75574	75576	75576	Hermione	168	“ Oh do n’t say that , ”
75581	75590	75576	75576	Hermione	168	“ Imagine that lot loose on the grounds ... ”
75639	75645	75647	75647	Ron	170	“ Can you hear something ? ”
75688	75692	75694	75695	Lee Jordan	347	“ The lake ! ”
75702	75708	75694	75695	Lee Jordan	347	“ Look at the lake ! ”
75834	75840	75841	75841	he	157	“ It ’s a mast ! ”
76065	76068	76069	76069	he	2169	“ Dumbledore ! ”
76079	76092	76069	76069	he	2169	“ How are you , my dear fellow , how are you ? ”
76093	76102	76103	76103	Dumbledore	169	“ Blooming , thank you , Professor Karkaroff , ”
76179	76184	76185	76185	he	373	“ Dear old Hogwarts , ”
76221	76256	76206	76206	his	373	“ How good it is to be here , how good ... Viktor , come along , into the warmth ... you do n’t mind , Dumbledore ? Viktor has a slight head cold ... ”
76309	76322	76323	76323	Ron	170	“ Harry — it ’s Krum ! I do n’t believe it ! ”
76346	76354	76323	76323	Ron	170	“ Krum , Harry ! Viktor Krum ! ”
76355	76370	76372	76372	Hermione	168	“ For heaven ’s sake , Ron , he ’s only a Quidditch player , ”
76374	76380	76381	76381	Ron	170	“ Only a Quidditch player ? ”
76396	76420	76381	76381	Ron	170	“ Hermione — he ’s one of the best Seekers in the world ! I had no idea he was still at school ! ”
76481	76499	76467	76471	Several sixth - year girls	2183	“ Oh I do n’t believe it , I have n’t got a single quill on me — ”
76500	76511	76467	76471	Several sixth - year girls	2183	“ D’you think he ’d sign my hat in lipstick ? ”
76512	76515	76516	76516	Hermione	168	“ Really , ”
76531	76541	76543	76543	Ron	170	“ I ’m getting his autograph if I can , ”
76545	76558	76543	76543	Ron	170	“ You have n’t got a quill , have you , Harry ? ”
76559	76569	76571	76571	Harry	157	“ Nope , they ’re upstairs in my bag , ”
76656	76663	76665	76665	Hermione	168	“ It ’s not that cold , ”
76668	76676	76665	76665	Hermione	168	“ Why did n’t they bring cloaks ? ”
76677	76687	76688	76688	Ron	170	“ Over here ! Come and sit over here ! ”
76691	76704	76688	76688	Ron	170	“ Over here ! Hermione , budge up , make a space — ”
76705	76708	76688	76688	Ron	170	“ What ? ”
76709	76713	76715	76715	Ron	170	“ Too late , ”
76760	76774	76776	76776	Ron	170	“ Yeah , that ’s right , smarm up to him , Malfoy , ”
76779	76840	76776	76776	Ron	170	“ I bet Krum can see right through him , though ... bet he gets people fawning over him all the time ... Where d’you reckon they ’re going to sleep ? We could offer him a space in our dormitory , Harry ... I would n’t mind giving him my bed , I could kip on a camp bed . ”
76844	76855	76857	76857	Harry	157	“ They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot , ”
76947	76956	76957	76957	Harry	157	“ But there are only two extra people , ”
76960	76974	76957	76957	Harry	157	“ Why ’s Filch putting out four chairs , who else is coming ? ”
76975	76978	76980	76980	Ron	170	“ Eh ? ”
77100	77116	77118	77118	Dumbledore	169	“ Good evening , ladies and gentlemen , ghosts and — most particularly — guests , ”
77127	77154	77118	77118	Dumbledore	169	“ I have great pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts . I hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable . ”
77175	77183	77184	77184	Hermione	168	“ No one ’s making you stay ! ”
77191	77205	77207	77207	Dumbledore	169	“ The tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast , ”
77209	77226	77207	77207	Dumbledore	169	“ I now invite you all to eat , drink , and make yourselves at home ! ”
77297	77302	77304	77304	Ron	170	“ What ’s that ? ”
77329	77332	77334	77334	Hermione	168	“ Bouillabaisse , ”
77336	77340	77342	77342	Ron	170	“ Bless you , ”
77344	77349	77351	77351	Hermione	168	“ It ’s French , ”
77353	77368	77351	77351	Hermione	168	“ I had it on holiday summer before last . It ’s very nice . ”
77369	77378	77380	77380	Ron	170	“ I ’ll take your word for it , ”
77496	77504	77505	77505	Harry	157	“ Skrewts doing all right , Hagrid ? ”
77508	77512	77513	77513	Hagrid	180	“ Thrivin ’ , ”
77518	77528	77530	77530	Ron	170	“ Yeah , I ’ll just bet they are , ”
77533	77553	77530	77530	Ron	170	“ Looks like they ’ve finally found a food they like , does n’t it ? Hagrid ’s fingers . ”
77562	77572	77587	77587	She	2213	“ Excuse me , are you wanting ze bouillabaisse ? ”
77649	77655	77657	77657	Harry	157	“ Yeah , have it , ”
77666	77674	77657	77657	Harry	157	“ You ’ ave finished wiz it ? ”
77675	77678	77679	77679	Ron	170	“ Yeah , ”
77683	77690	77679	77679	Ron	170	“ Yeah , it was excellent . ”
77739	77745	77746	77746	he	170	“ She ’s a veela ! ”
77752	77759	77761	77761	Hermione	168	“ Of course she is n’t ! ”
77764	77778	77761	77761	Hermione	168	“ I do n’t see anyone else gaping at her like an idiot ! ”
77816	77829	77831	77831	Ron	170	“ I ’m telling you , that ’s not a normal girl ! ”
77845	77856	77836	77836	he	170	“ They do n’t make them like that at Hogwarts ! ”
77857	77865	77867	77867	Harry	157	“ They make them okay at Hogwarts , ”
77889	77900	77902	77902	Hermione	168	“ When you ’ve both put your eyes back in , ”
77905	77917	77902	77902	Hermione	168	“ you ’ll be able to see who ’s just arrived . ”
77963	77970	77972	77972	Harry	157	“ What are they doing here ? ”
77976	77987	77989	77989	Hermione	168	“ They organized the Triwizard Tournament , did n’t they ? ”
77991	78004	77989	77989	Hermione	168	“ I suppose they wanted to be here to see it start . ”
78135	78141	78143	78143	Dumbledore	169	“ The moment has come , ”
78154	78180	78143	78143	Dumbledore	169	“ The Triwizard Tournament is about to start . I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket — ”
78181	78185	78186	78186	Harry	157	“ The what ? ”
78192	78234	78143	78143	Dumbledore	169	“ — just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year . But first , let me introduce , for those who do not know them , Mr. Bartemius Crouch , Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation ”
78244	78260	78143	78143	Dumbledore	169	“ and Mr. Ludo Bagman , Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports . ”
78359	78381	78382	78382	Dumbledore	169	“ Mr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the Triwizard Tournament , ”
78385	78410	78382	78382	Dumbledore	169	“ and they will be joining myself , Professor Karkaroff , and Madame Maxime on the panel that will judge the champions ’ efforts . ”
78417	78420	78443	78443	he	169	“ champions , ”
78446	78459	78440	78440	he	169	“ The casket , then , if you please , Mr. Filch . ”
78530	78553	78555	78555	Dumbledore	169	“ The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman , ”
78568	78627	78557	78557	Filch	375	“ and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge . There will be three tasks , spaced throughout the school year , and they will test the champions in many different ways ... their magical prowess — their daring — their powers of deduction — and , of course , their ability to cope with danger . ”
78649	78661	78662	78662	Dumbledore	169	“ As you know , three champions compete in the tournament , ”
78667	78721	78662	78662	Dumbledore	169	“ one from each of the participating schools . They will be marked on how well they perform each of the tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup . The champions will be chosen by an impartial selector : the Goblet of Fire . ”
78807	78834	78836	78836	Dumbledore	169	“ Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet , ”
78838	78843	78844	78845	Fred Weasley	174	“ An Age Line ! ”
78869	78909	78848	78848	his	2236	“ Well , that should be fooled by an Aging Potion , should n’t it ? And once your name ’s in that goblet , you ’re laughing — it ca n’t tell whether you ’re seventeen or not ! ”
78910	78924	78926	78926	Hermione	168	“ But I do n’t think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance , ”

79456	79482	79453	79453	Moody	294	“ And unless you ’ve got anything to say to Potter , Karkaroff , you might want to move . You ’re blocking the doorway . ”
79665	79673	79674	79674	Ron	170	“ Anyone put their name in yet ? ”

79705	79723	79725	79725	Harry	157	“ Bet some of them put it in last night after we ’d all gone to bed , ”
79727	79756	79725	79725	Harry	157	“ I would ’ve if it had been me ... would n’t have wanted everyone watching . What if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again ? ”
79786	79790	79791	79791	Fred	174	“ Done it , ”

She is already tending to Miss Fawcett , of Ravenclaw , and Mr. Summers , of Hufflepuff , both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too . Though I must say , neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours . ”
80358	80376	80377	80377	Dean	147	“ There ’s a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name in , ”
80381	80393	80377	80377	Dean	147	“ That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth . ”
80409	80418	80404	80404	his	157	“ We ca n’t have a Slytherin champion ! ”
80419	80429	80431	80431	Seamus	227	“ And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory , ”
80434	80451	80431	80431	Seamus	227	“ But I would n’t have thought he ’d have wanted to risk his good looks . ”

80758	80775	80754	80754	she	168	“ Wait for me , will you , while I nip upstairs and get the badges ? ”

81655	81693	81653	81653	Hagrid	180	“ But it ’s gon na be spectacular , I ’ll tell yeh that . Them champions’re going ter have their work cut out . Never thought I ’d live ter see the Triwizard Tournament played again ! ”
81845	81856	81857	81857	he	180	“ It ’d be doin’ ’em an unkindness , Hermione , ”
81871	81914	81857	81857	he	180	“ It ’s in their nature ter look after humans , that ’s what they like , see ? Yeh’d be makin ’ ’em unhappy ter take away their work , an ’ insultin ’ ’em if yeh tried ter pay ’em . ”
81915	81931	81933	81933	Hermione	168	“ But Harry set Dobby free , and he was over the moon about it ! ”

82479	82508	82476	82476	Ron	170	“ Well , if they end up having children , they ’ll be setting a world record — bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton . ”
82545	82553	82554	82554	Hermione	168	“ Ooh it ’s them , look ! ”
82678	82684	82686	82686	Fred	174	“ Hope it ’s Angelina , ”

82707	82715	82704	82704	Hermione	168	“ Well , we ’ll soon know ! ”
82892	82905	82907	82907	Dumbledore	169	“ Well , the goblet is almost ready to make its decision , ”
82909	82957	82959	82959	he	169	“ I estimate that it requires one more minute . Now , when the champions ’ names are called , I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall , walk along the staff table , and go through into the next chamber ”
82968	82978	82959	82959	he	169	“ where they will be receiving their first instructions . ”
83060	83064	83065	83066	Lee Jordan	347	“ Any second , ”

83518	83521	83523	83523	Ron	170	“ No ! ”
83604	83607	83608	83608	Dumbledore	169	“ Excellent ! ”
83619	83675	83608	83608	Dumbledore	169	“ Well , we now have our three champions . I am sure I can count upon all of you , including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang , to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster . By cheering your champion on , you will contribute in a very real — ”

84572	84575	84576	84576	Bagman	384	“ Joke ? ”
84581	84602	84576	84576	Bagman	384	“ No , no , not at all ! Harry ’s name just came out of the Goblet of Fire ! ”
84620	84630	84631	84631	she	383	“ But evidently zair ’ as been a mistake , ”

84672	84742	84660	84660	Bagman	384	“ But , as you know , the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure . And as his name ’s come out of the goblet ... I mean , I do n’t think there can be any ducking out at this stage ... It ’s down in the rules , you ’re obliged ... Harry will just have to do the best he — ”

84905	84917	84922	84922	He	373	“ I ’d rather like to know that myself , Dumbledore , ”
84939	84969	84930	84930	his	373	“ Two Hogwarts champions ? I do n’t remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions — or have I not read the rules carefully enough ? ”
84978	84982	84984	84985	Madame Maxime	291	“ C’est impossible , ”

85018	85036	85038	85038	Karkaroff	373	“ We were under the impression that your Age Line would keep out younger contestants , Dumbledore , ”
85055	85077	85038	85038	Karkaroff	373	“ Otherwise , we would , of course , have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools . ”

85239	85257	85259	85260	Professor Dumbledore	169	“ Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you ? ”
85265	85268	85270	85270	Harry	157	“ No , ”
85273	85284	85286	85287	Madame Maxime	291	“ Ah , but of course ’ e is lying ! ”

85362	85376	85378	85379	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Dumbledore , you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake ! ”
85382	85428	85378	85379	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Really , what nonsense ! Harry could not have crossed the line himself , and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him , I ’m sure that should be good enough for everybody else ! ”
85439	85446	85450	85450	his	373	“ Mr. Crouch ... Mr. Bagman , ”
85456	85476	85450	85450	his	373	“ you are our — er — objective judges . Surely you will agree that this is most irregular ? ”
85547	85579	85542	85542	his	199	“ We must follow the rules , and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament . ”
85580	85592	85594	85594	Bagman	201	“ Well , Barty knows the rule book back to front , ”
85614	85628	85630	85630	Karkaroff	373	“ I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students , ”
85652	85684	85643	85643	His	373	“ You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more , and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions . It ’s only fair , Dumbledore . ”
85685	85696	85698	85698	Bagman	201	“ But Karkaroff , it does n’t work like that , ”
85700	85722	85698	85698	Bagman	201	“ The Goblet of Fire ’s just gone out — it wo n’t reignite until the start of the next tournament — ”
85723	85735	85737	85737	Karkaroff	373	“ — in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing ! ”
85739	85768	85737	85737	Karkaroff	373	“ After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises , I little expected something of this nature to occur ! I have half a mind to leave now ! ”
85769	85775	85698	85698	Bagman	201	“ Empty threat , Karkaroff , ”
85784	85818	85698	85698	Bagman	201	“ You ca n’t leave your champion now . He ’s got to compete . They ’ve all got to compete . Binding magical contract , like Dumbledore said . Convenient , eh ? ”
85846	85849	85851	85851	Karkaroff	373	“ Convenient ? ”
85853	85865	85851	85851	Karkaroff	373	“ I ’m afraid I do n’t understand you , Moody . ”
85902	85907	85909	85909	Moody	294	“ Do n’t you ? ”
85912	85939	85909	85909	Moody	294	“ It ’s very simple , Karkaroff . Someone put Potter ’s name in that goblet knowing he ’d have to compete if it came out . ”
85940	85957	85959	85960	Madame Maxime	291	“ Evidently , someone ’ oo wished to give ’ Ogwarts two bites at ze apple ! ”
85962	85970	85972	85972	Karkaroff	373	“ I quite agree , Madame Maxime , ”
85978	85996	85972	85972	Karkaroff	373	“ I shall be lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic and the International Confederation of Wizards — ”
85997	86010	86012	86012	Moody	294	“ If anyone ’s got reason to complain , it ’s Potter , ”
86014	86029	86012	86012	Moody	294	“ but ... funny thing ... I do n’t hear him saying a word ... ”
86030	86037	86044	86044	her	383	“ Why should ’ e complain ? ”
86047	86099	86044	86044	her	383	“ ’ E ’ as ze chance to compete , ’ asn’t ’ e ? We ’ ave all been ’ oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks ! Ze honor for our schools ! A thousand Galleons in prize money — zis is a chance many would die for ! ”
86100	86113	86115	86115	Moody	294	“ Maybe someone ’s hoping Potter is going to die for it , ”
86154	86166	86149	86149	his	201	“ Moody , old man ... what a thing to say ! ”
86167	86190	86192	86192	Karkaroff	373	“ We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if he has n’t discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime , ”
86195	86230	86192	86192	Karkaroff	373	“ Apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too . An odd quality in a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher , Dumbledore , but no doubt you had your reasons . ”
86231	86238	86240	86240	Moody	344	“ Imagining things , am I ? ”
86242	86265	86240	86240	Moody	344	“ Seeing things , eh ? It was a skilled witch or wizard who put the boy ’s name in that goblet ... ”
86266	86276	86278	86279	Madame Maxime	291	“ Ah , what evidence is zere of zat ? ”
86287	86297	86299	86299	Moody	344	“ Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object ! ”
86301	86351	86299	86299	Moody	344	“ It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament ... I ’m guessing they submitted Potter ’s name under a fourth school , to make sure he was the only one in his category ... ”
86352	86367	86369	86369	Karkaroff	373	“ You seem to have given this a great deal of thought , Moody , ”
86372	86433	86369	86369	Karkaroff	373	“ and a very ingenious theory it is — though of course , I heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg , and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock . So you ’ll understand if we do n’t take you entirely seriously ... ”
86434	86447	86448	86448	Moody	344	“ There are those who ’ll turn innocent occasions to their advantage , ”
86455	86476	86448	86448	Moody	344	“ It ’s my job to think the way Dark wizards do , Karkaroff — as you ought to remember ... ”
86477	86480	86482	86482	Dumbledore	169	“ Alastor ! ”
86499	86503	86491	86491	he	157	“ Mad - Eye ”
86530	86541	86543	86543	Dumbledore	169	“ How this situation arose , we do not know , ”
86553	86592	86543	86543	Dumbledore	169	“ It seems to me , however , that we have no choice but to accept it . Both Cedric and Harry have been chosen to compete in the tournament . This , therefore , they will do ... ”
86593	86601	86633	86633	she	291	“ Ah , but Dumbly - dorr — ”
86602	86622	86543	86543	Dumbledore	169	“ My dear Madame Maxime , if you have an alternative , I would be delighted to hear it . ”
86660	86670	86671	86671	he	201	“ Well , shall we crack on , then ? ”
86684	86705	86671	86671	he	201	“ Got to give our champions their instructions , have n’t we ? Barty , want to do the honors ? ”
86717	86720	86721	86721	he	199	“ Yes , ”
86724	86733	86721	86721	he	199	“ instructions . Yes ... the first task ... ”
86778	86789	86790	86791	Mr. Crouch	199	“ The first task is designed to test your daring , ”
86810	86822	86802	86803	Mr. Crouch	199	“ I think that ’s all , is it , Albus ? ”
86823	86828	86830	86830	Dumbledore	169	“ I think so , ”
86842	86858	86830	86830	Dumbledore	169	“ Are you sure you would n’t like to stay at Hogwarts tonight , Barty ? ”
86859	86872	86874	86875	Mr. Crouch	199	“ No , Dumbledore , I must get back to the Ministry , ”
86877	86911	86874	86875	Mr. Crouch	199	“ It is a very busy , very difficult time at the moment ... I ’ve left young Weatherby in charge ... Very enthusiastic ... a little overenthusiastic , if truth be told ... ”
86912	86927	86929	86929	Dumbledore	169	“ You ’ll come and have a drink before you go , at least ? ”
86931	86941	86943	86943	Bagman	201	“ Come on , Barty , I ’m staying ! ”
86946	86967	86943	86943	Bagman	201	“ It ’s all happening at Hogwarts now , you know , much more exciting here than at the office ! ”
86968	86975	86977	86977	Crouch	242	“ I think not , Ludo , ”
86986	86996	86998	86998	Dumbledore	169	“ Professor Karkaroff — Madame Maxime — a nightcap ? ”
87057	87070	87072	87072	Dumbledore	169	“ Harry , Cedric , I suggest you go up to bed , ”
87080	87117	87072	87072	Dumbledore	169	“ I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you , and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise . ”
87157	87160	87162	87162	Cedric	208	“ So , ”
87169	87178	87162	87162	Cedric	208	“ We ’re playing against each other again ! ”
87179	87183	87185	87185	Harry	157	“ I s’pose , ”
87217	87223	87225	87225	Cedric	208	“ So ... tell me ... ”
87249	87258	87225	87225	Cedric	208	“ How did you get your name in ? ”
87259	87264	87266	87266	Harry	157	“ I did n’t , ”
87273	87287	87266	87266	Harry	157	“ I did n’t put it in . I was telling the truth . ”
87288	87293	87295	87295	Cedric	208	“ Ah ... okay , ”
87306	87314	87300	87300	Cedric	208	“ Well ... see you , then . ”
87778	87785	87787	87789	the Fat Lady	1991	“ Well , well , well , ”
87791	87810	87787	87789	the Fat Lady	1991	“ Violet ’s just told me everything . Who ’s just been chosen as school champion , then ? ”
87811	87814	87816	87816	Harry	157	“ Balderdash , ”
87819	87826	87828	87830	the pale witch	2422	“ It most certainly is n’t ! ”
87833	87845	87847	87849	the Fat Lady	391	“ No , no , Vi , it ’s the password , ”
87926	87936	87938	87938	Fred	174	“ You should ’ve told us you ’d entered ! ”
87949	87962	87964	87964	George	175	“ How did you do it without getting a beard ? Brilliant ! ”
87966	87971	87972	87972	Harry	157	“ I did n’t , ”
87975	87982	87972	87972	Harry	157	“ I do n’t know how — ”
87992	88008	87984	87984	Angelina	380	“ Oh if it could n’t be me , at least it ’s a Gryffindor — ”
88009	88026	88028	88029	Katie Bell	393	“ You ’ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch match , Harry ! ”
88037	88050	87984	87984	Angelina	380	“ We ’ve got food , Harry , come and have some — ”
88051	88064	88028	88029	Katie Bell	393	“ I ’m not hungry , I had enough at the feast — ”
88202	88207	88208	88208	he	157	“ I did n’t , ”
88216	88225	88208	88208	he	157	“ I do n’t know how it happened . ”
88245	88250	88251	88251	he	157	“ I ’m tired ! ”
88261	88274	88251	88251	he	157	“ No , seriously , George — I ’m going to bed — ”
88384	88390	88391	88391	Harry	157	“ Where ’ve you been ? ”
88394	88398	88400	88400	Ron	170	“ Oh hello , ”
88467	88470	88471	88471	he	170	“ So , ”
88488	88491	88471	88471	he	170	“ Congratulations . ”
88492	88499	88501	88501	Harry	157	“ What d’you mean , congratulations ? ”
88526	88538	88540	88540	Ron	170	“ Well ... no one else got across the Age Line , ”
88542	88558	88540	88540	Ron	170	“ Not even Fred and George . What did you use — the Invisibility Cloak ? ”
88559	88572	88574	88574	Harry	157	“ The Invisibility Cloak would n’t have got me over that line , ”
88577	88581	88583	88583	Ron	170	“ Oh right , ”
88585	88621	88583	88583	Ron	170	“ I thought you might ’ve told me if it was the Cloak ... because it would ’ve covered both of us , would n’t it ? But you found another way , did you ? ”
88622	88625	88627	88627	Harry	157	“ Listen , ”
88629	88647	88627	88627	Harry	157	“ I did n’t put my name in that goblet . Someone else must ’ve done it . ”
88653	88661	88650	88650	his	170	“ What would they do that for ? ”
88662	88666	88668	88668	Harry	157	“ I dunno , ”
88680	88685	88668	88668	Harry	157	“ To kill me . ”
88703	88718	88719	88719	he	170	“ It ’s okay , you know , you can tell me the truth , ”
88722	88805	88719	88719	he	170	“ If you do n’t want everyone else to know , fine , but I do n’t know why you ’re bothering to lie , you did n’t get into trouble for it , did you ? That friend of the Fat Lady ’s , that Violet , she ’s already told us all Dumbledore ’s letting you enter . A thousand Galleons prize money , eh ? And you do n’t have to do end - of - year tests either ... ”
88806	88817	88819	88819	Harry	157	“ I did n’t put my name in that goblet ! ”
88826	88831	88833	88833	Ron	170	“ Yeah , okay , ”
88844	88874	88833	88833	Ron	170	“ Only you said this morning you ’d have done it last night , and no one would ’ve seen you ... I ’m not stupid , you know . ”
88875	88886	88887	88887	Harry	157	“ You ’re doing a really good impression of it , ”
88890	88893	88895	88895	Ron	170	“ Yeah ? ”
88915	88943	88895	88895	Ron	170	“ You want to get to bed , Harry . I expect you ’ll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo - call or something . ”
89186	89189	89190	89190	she	168	“ Hello , ”
89208	89221	89190	89190	she	168	“ I brought you this ... Want to go for a walk ? ”
89222	89226	89228	89228	Harry	157	“ Good idea , ”
89318	89331	89332	89332	she	168	“ Well , of course I knew you had n’t entered yourself , ”
89350	89408	89332	89332	she	168	“ The look on your face when Dumbledore read out your name ! But the question is , who did put it in ? Because Moody ’s right , Harry ... I do n’t think any student could have done it ... they ’d never be able to fool the goblet , or get over Dumbledore ’s — ”
89409	89415	89416	89416	Harry	157	“ Have you seen Ron ? ”
89422	89432	89433	89433	she	168	“ Erm ... yes ... he was at breakfast , ”
89436	89445	89332	89332	she	168	“ Does he still think I entered myself ? ”
89446	89460	89462	89462	Hermione	168	“ Well ... no , I do n’t think so ... not really , ”
89465	89478	89332	89332	she	168	“ What ’s that supposed to mean , ‘ not really ’ ? ”
89479	89488	89489	89489	Hermione	168	“ Oh Harry , is n’t it obvious ? ”
89493	89498	89489	89489	Hermione	168	“ He ’s jealous ! ”
89499	89502	89503	89503	Harry	157	“ Jealous ? ”
89507	89530	89503	89503	Harry	157	“ Jealous of what ? He wants to make a prat of himself in front of the whole school , does he ? ”
89531	89534	89536	89536	Hermione	168	“ Look , ”
89539	89563	89564	89564	she	168	“ it ’s always you who gets all the attention , you know it is . I know it ’s not your fault , ”
89575	89578	89580	89580	Harry	157	“ Great , ”
89583	89618	89580	89580	Harry	157	“ Really great . Tell him from me I ’ll swap any time he wants . Tell him from me he ’s welcome to it ... People gawping at my forehead everywhere I go ... ”
89619	89627	89628	89628	Hermione	168	“ I ’m not telling him anything , ”
89632	89647	89628	89628	Hermione	168	“ Tell him yourself . It ’s the only way to sort this out . ”
89648	89663	89664	89664	Harry	157	“ I ’m not running around after him trying to make him grow up ! ”
89681	89700	89664	89664	Harry	157	“ Maybe he ’ll believe I ’m not enjoying myself once I ’ve got my neck broken or — ”
89701	89707	89709	89709	Hermione	168	“ That ’s not funny , ”
89712	89720	89721	89721	She	168	“ That ’s not funny at all . ”
89726	89759	89721	89721	She	168	“ Harry , I ’ve been thinking — you know what we ’ve got to do , do n’t you ? Straight away , the moment we get back to the castle ? ”
89760	89771	89664	89664	Harry	157	“ Yeah , give Ron a good kick up the — ”
89772	89827	89721	89721	She	168	“ Write to Sirius . You ’ve got to tell him what ’s happened . He asked you to keep him posted on everything that ’s going on at Hogwarts ... It ’s almost as if he expected something like this to happen . I brought some parchment and a quill out with me — ”
89828	89833	89835	89835	Harry	157	“ Come off it , ”
89855	89890	89835	89835	Harry	157	“ He came back to the country just because my scar twinged . He ’ll probably come bursting right into the castle if I tell him someone ’s entered me in the Triwizard Tournament — ”
89891	89900	89902	89902	Hermione	168	“ He ’d want you to tell him , ”
89905	89914	89902	89902	Hermione	168	“ He ’s going to find out anyway — ”
89915	89918	89721	89721	She	168	“ How ? ”
89919	89931	89933	89933	Hermione	168	“ Harry , this is n’t going to be kept quiet , ”
89938	89998	89933	89933	Hermione	168	“ This tournament ’s famous , and you ’re famous . I ’ll be really surprised if there is n’t anything in the Daily Prophet about you competing ... You ’re already in half the books about You - Know - Who , you know ... and Sirius would rather hear it from you , I know he would . ”
89999	90010	90012	90012	Harry	157	“ Okay , okay , I ’ll write to him , ”
90059	90068	90069	90069	Harry	157	“ Whose owl am I going to use ? ”
90077	90087	90069	90069	Harry	157	“ He told me not to use Hedwig again . ”
90088	90096	90139	90139	Hermione	168	“ Ask Ron if you can borrow — ”
90097	90106	90107	90107	Harry	157	“ I ’m not asking Ron for anything , ”
90111	90128	90130	90130	Hermione	168	“ Well , borrow one of the school owls , then , anyone can use them , ”
90243	90246	90247	90247	he	157	“ Finished , ”
90278	90285	90286	90286	Harry	157	“ I ca n’t use you , ”
90297	90307	90286	90286	Harry	157	“ I ’ve got to use one of these ... ”
90381	90388	90390	90390	Harry	157	“ First Ron , then you , ”
90393	90400	90390	90390	Harry	157	“ This is n’t my fault . ”
90745	90757	90758	90758	he	256	“ Ah , look , boys , it ’s the champion , ”
90773	90826	90758	90758	he	256	“ Got your autograph books ? Better get a signature now , because I doubt he ’s going to be around much longer ... Half the Triwizard champions have died ... how long d’you reckon you ’re going to last , Potter ? Ten minutes into the first task ’s my bet . ”
90933	90941	90942	90942	he	256	“ Take this thing for a walk ? ”
90954	90978	90942	90942	he	256	“ And where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash ? Around the sting , the blasting end , or the sucker ? ”
90979	90985	90987	90987	Hagrid	180	“ Roun ’ the middle , ”
90991	91029	90987	90987	Hagrid	180	“ Er — yeh might want ter put on yer dragon - hide gloves , jus ’ as an extra precaution , like . Harry — you come here an ’ help me with this big one ... ”
91072	91088	91050	91050	He	180	“ So — yer competin ’ , Harry . In the tournament . School champion . ”
91089	91095	91096	91096	Harry	157	“ One of the champions , ”
91114	91126	91110	91110	his	180	“ No idea who put yeh in fer it , Harry ? ”

92324	92357	92315	92315	Malfoy	256	“ I ’ve got loads . But do n’t touch my hand , now . I ’ve just washed it , you see ; do n’t want a Mudblood sliming it up . ”
92410	92413	92414	92414	Hermione	168	“ Harry ! ”
92418	92426	92433	92433	his	256	“ Go on , then , Potter , ”

92692	92695	92681	92681	Snape	331	“ Explain . ”
92696	92703	92681	92681	Snape	331	“ Potter attacked me , sir — ”
92704	92714	92715	92715	Harry	157	“ We attacked each other at the same time ! ”
92718	92727	92715	92715	Harry	157	“ — and he hit Goyle — look — ”
92750	92756	92757	92757	Snape	331	“ Hospital wing , Goyle , ”
92761	92766	92767	92767	Ron	170	“ Malfoy got Hermione ! ”

92952	92981	92944	92944	he	331	“ Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley . Now get inside , or it ’ll be a week ’s worth of detentions . ”
93145	93148	93150	93150	Snape	331	“ Antidotes ! ”
93165	93197	93150	93150	Snape	331	“ You should all have prepared your recipes now . I want you to brew them carefully , and then , we will be selecting someone on whom to test one ... ”
93289	93292	93294	93294	Snape	331	“ Yes ? ”
93297	93311	93265	93265	he	324	“ Please , sir , I ’m supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs . ”
93329	93339	93341	93341	Snape	331	“ Potter has another hour of Potions to complete , ”
93344	93355	93341	93341	Snape	331	“ He will come upstairs when this class is finished . ”
93360	93370	93371	93371	he	324	“ Sir — sir , Mr. Bagman wants him , ”
93375	93392	93371	93371	he	324	“ All the champions have got to go , I think they want to take photographs ... ”
93427	93434	93435	93435	Snape	331	“ Very well , very well , ”
93438	93458	93435	93435	Snape	331	“ Potter , leave your things here , I want you back down here later to test your antidote . ”
93459	93474	93476	93476	Colin	324	“ Please , sir — he ’s got to take his things with him , ”
93478	93483	93476	93476	Colin	324	“ All the champions — ”
93484	93488	93490	93490	Snape	331	“ Very well ! ”
93492	93505	93490	93490	Snape	331	“ Potter — take your bag and get out of my sight ! ”
93540	93551	93553	93553	Colin	324	“ It ’s amazing , is n’t it , Harry ? ”
93569	93580	93560	93560	Harry	157	“ Is n’t it , though ? You being champion ? ”
93581	93587	93589	93589	Harry	157	“ Yeah , really amazing , ”
93603	93613	93589	93589	Harry	157	“ What do they want photos for , Colin ? ”
93614	93622	93560	93560	Harry	157	“ The Daily Prophet , I think ! ”
93623	93626	93628	93628	Harry	157	“ Great , ”
93631	93640	93628	93628	Harry	157	“ Exactly what I need . More publicity . ”
93641	93645	93647	93647	Colin	324	“ Good luck ! ”
93852	93898	93839	93839	Bagman	201	“ Ah , here he is ! Champion number four ! In you come , Harry , in you come ... nothing to worry about , it ’s just the wand weighing ceremony , the rest of the judges will be here in a moment — ”
93899	93903	93904	93904	Harry	157	“ Wand weighing ? ”
93908	93938	93940	93940	Bagman	201	“ We have to check that your wands are fully functional , no problems , you know , as they ’re your most important tools in the tasks ahead , ”
93942	93968	93969	93969	he	201	“ The expert ’s upstairs now with Dumbledore . And then there ’s going to be a little photo shoot . This is Rita Skeeter , ”
93980	93995	93969	93969	he	201	“ She ’s doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily Prophet ... ”
93996	94004	94009	94009	her	302	“ Maybe not that small , Ludo , ”
94058	94074	94075	94075	she	302	“ I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start ? ”
94087	94102	94075	94075	she	302	“ The youngest champion , you know ... to add a bit of color ? ”
94103	94106	94108	94108	Bagman	201	“ Certainly ! ”
94110	94120	94108	94108	Bagman	201	“ That is — if Harry has no objection ? ”
94121	94124	94126	94126	Harry	157	“ Er — ”
94128	94131	94133	94134	Rita Skeeter	302	“ Lovely , ”
94173	94187	94188	94188	she	302	“ We do n’t want to be in there with all that noise , ”
94191	94206	94188	94188	she	302	“ Let ’s see ... ah , yes , this is nice and cozy . ”
94218	94230	94237	94237	herself	302	“ Come along , dear — that ’s right — lovely , ”
94262	94268	94237	94237	herself	302	“ Let ’s see now ... ”
94308	94335	94285	94285	she	302	“ You wo n’t mind , Harry , if I use a Quick - Quotes Quill ? It leaves me free to talk to you normally ... ”
94336	94340	94342	94342	Harry	157	“ A what ? ”
94438	94451	94398	94398	She	302	“ Testing ... my name is Rita Skeeter , Daily Prophet reporter . ”
94499	94502	94504	94505	Rita Skeeter	302	“ Lovely , ”
94539	94554	94532	94532	she	302	“ So , Harry ... what made you decide to enter the Triwizard Tournament ? ”
94555	94558	94560	94560	Harry	157	“ Er — ”
94620	94627	94629	94630	Rita Skeeter	302	“ Ignore the quill , Harry , ”
94642	94656	94635	94635	Harry	157	“ Now — why did you decide to enter the tournament , Harry ? ”
94657	94662	94664	94664	Harry	157	“ I did n’t , ”
94666	94689	94664	94664	Harry	157	“ I do n’t know how my name got into the Goblet of Fire . I did n’t put it in there . ”
94698	94741	94690	94691	Rita Skeeter	302	“ Come now , Harry , there ’s no need to be scared of getting into trouble . We all know you should n’t really have entered at all . But do n’t worry about that . Our readers love a rebel . ”
94742	94749	94750	94750	Harry	157	“ But I did n’t enter , ”
94753	94760	94750	94750	Harry	157	“ I do n’t know who — ”
94761	94771	94773	94774	Rita Skeeter	302	“ How do you feel about the tasks ahead ? ”
94776	94781	94773	94774	Rita Skeeter	302	“ Excited ? Nervous ? ”
94782	94796	94798	94798	Harry	157	“ I have n’t really thought ... yeah , nervous , I suppose , ”
94808	94820	94822	94823	Rita Skeeter	302	“ Champions have died in the past , have n’t they ? ”
94826	94835	94822	94823	Rita Skeeter	302	“ Have you thought about that at all ? ”
94836	94852	94854	94854	Harry	157	“ Well ... they say it ’s going to be a lot safer this year , ”
94874	94891	94893	94894	Rita Skeeter	302	“ Of course , you ’ve looked death in the face before , have n’t you ? ”
94900	94910	94893	94894	Rita Skeeter	302	“ How would you say that ’s affected you ? ”
94911	94914	94916	94916	Harry	157	“ Er , ”
94921	94962	94893	94894	Rita Skeeter	302	“ Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove yourself ? To live up to your name ? Do you think that perhaps you were tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because — ”
94963	94969	94971	94971	Harry	157	“ I did n’t enter , ”
94978	94987	94989	94990	Rita Skeeter	302	“ Can you remember your parents at all ? ”
94996	94999	95001	95001	Harry	157	“ No , ”
95003	95028	94989	94990	Rita Skeeter	302	“ How do you think they ’d feel if they knew you were competing in the Triwizard Tournament ? Proud ? Worried ? Angry ? ”
95098	95108	95110	95110	Harry	157	“ I have NOT got tears in my eyes ! ”
95158	95161	95163	95164	Rita Skeeter	302	“ Dumbledore ! ”
95210	95215	95216	95216	she	302	“ How are you ? ”
95234	95253	95216	95216	she	302	“ I hope you saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards ’ Conference ? ”
95254	95258	95260	95260	Dumbledore	169	“ Enchantingly nasty , ”
95266	95279	95262	95262	his	169	“ I particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat . ”
95288	95317	95280	95281	Rita Skeeter	302	“ I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old - fashioned , Dumbledore , and that many wizards in the street — ”
95318	95333	95335	95335	Dumbledore	169	“ I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness , Rita , ”
95345	95387	95335	95335	Dumbledore	169	“ but I ’m afraid we will have to discuss the matter later . The Weighing of the Wands is about to start , and it can not take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard . ”
95503	95510	95515	95515	his	169	“ May I introduce Mr. Ollivander ? ”
95528	95547	95515	95515	his	169	“ He will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament . ”
95600	95612	95614	95615	Mr. Ollivander	402	“ Mademoiselle Delacour , could we have you first , please ? ”
95642	95645	95646	95646	he	402	“ Hmmm ... ”
95684	95687	95688	95688	he	402	“ Yes , ”
95692	95709	95688	95688	he	402	“ nine and a half inches ... inflexible ... rosewood ... and containing ... dear me ... ”
95710	95722	95724	95724	Fleur	383	“ An ’ air from ze ’ ead of a veela , ”
95726	95733	95724	95724	Fleur	383	“ One of my grandmuzzer ’s . ”
95762	95765	95767	95768	Mr. Ollivander	402	“ Yes , ”
95770	95806	95767	95768	Mr. Ollivander	402	“ yes , I ’ve never used veela hair myself , of course . I find it makes for rather temperamental wands ... however , to each his own , and if this suits you ... ”
95827	95830	95824	95824	he	402	“ Orchideous ! ”
95843	95857	95859	95860	Mr. Ollivander	402	“ Very well , very well , it ’s in fine working order , ”
95875	95882	95870	95870	Fleur	383	“ Mr. Diggory , you next . ”
95898	95913	95915	95916	Mr. Ollivander	402	“ Ah , now , this is one of mine , is n’t it ? ”
95930	95992	95924	95924	Cedric	208	“ Yes , I remember it well . Containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn ... must have been seventeen hands ; nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked his tail . Twelve and a quarter inches ... ash ... pleasantly springy . It ’s in fine condition ... You treat it regularly ? ”
95993	95999	96001	96001	Cedric	208	“ Polished it last night , ”
96091	96099	96084	96084	himself	402	“ Mr. Krum , if you please . ”
96138	96141	96143	96144	Mr. Ollivander	402	“ Hmm , ”
96146	96174	96143	96144	Mr. Ollivander	402	“ this is a Gregorovitch creation , unless I ’m much mistaken ? A fine wandmaker , though the styling is never quite what I ... however ... ”
96193	96201	96202	96202	he	402	“ Yes ... hornbeam and dragon heartstring ? ”
96210	96229	96202	96202	he	402	“ Rather thicker than one usually sees ... quite rigid ... ten and a quarter inches ... Avis ! ”
96264	96267	96269	96270	Mr. Ollivander	402	“ Good , ”
96278	96285	96269	96270	Mr. Ollivander	402	“ Which leaves ... Mr. Potter . ”
96305	96310	96312	96313	Mr. Ollivander	402	“ Aaaah , yes , ”
96321	96333	96315	96315	his	402	“ Yes , yes , yes . How well I remember . ”
96453	96456	96457	96457	he	402	“ Curious , ”
96461	96464	96457	96457	he	402	“ curious , ”
96636	96641	96643	96643	Dumbledore	169	“ Thank you all , ”
96653	96683	96643	96643	Dumbledore	169	“ You may go back to your lessons now — or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner , as they are about to end — ”
96714	96721	96723	96723	Bagman	201	“ Photos , Dumbledore , photos ! ”
96726	96740	96723	96723	Bagman	201	“ All the judges and champions , what do you think , Rita ? ”
96741	96752	96754	96755	Rita Skeeter	302	“ Er — yes , let ’s do those first , ”
96764	96772	96754	96755	Rita Skeeter	302	“ And then perhaps some individual shots . ”
96974	96981	96983	96983	Ron	170	“ You ’ve had an owl , ”
97009	97014	97016	97016	Harry	157	“ Oh — right , ”
97018	97034	97036	97036	Ron	170	“ And we ’ve got to do our detentions tomorrow night , Snape ’s dungeon , ”
97656	97659	97666	97666	She	302	“ er ’s ”
97759	97774	97741	97741	people	1036	“ Want a hanky , Potter , in case you start crying in Transfiguration ? ”
97775	97805	97741	97741	people	1036	“ Since when have you been one of the top students in the school , Potter ? Or is this a school you and Longbottom have set up together ? ”
97806	97811	97741	97741	people	1036	“ Hey — Harry ! ”
97812	97819	97820	97820	Harry	157	“ Yeah , that ’s right ! ”
97838	97863	97822	97822	himself	157	“ I ’ve just been crying my eyes out over my dead mum , and I ’m just off to do a bit more ... ”
97864	97876	97820	97820	Harry	157	“ No — it was just — you dropped your quill . ”
97890	97897	97898	97898	he	157	“ Oh — right — sorry , ”
97906	97914	97915	97915	she	2598	“ Er ... good luck on Tuesday , ”
97918	97926	97915	97915	she	2598	“ I really hope you do well . ”

98005	98015	97988	97988	she	398	“ What was she judging against — a chipmunk ? ”
98016	98020	98021	98021	Hermione	168	“ Ignore it , ”
98049	98056	98043	98043	she	168	“ Just ignore it , Harry . ”
98199	98206	98207	98207	Harry	157	“ I did n’t start this , ”
98211	98217	98207	98207	Harry	157	“ It ’s his problem . ”
98218	98223	98224	98224	Hermione	168	“ You miss him ! ”
98228	98236	98224	98224	Hermione	168	“ And I know he misses you — ”
98237	98241	98243	98243	Harry	157	“ Miss him ? ”
98245	98252	98243	98243	Harry	157	“ I do n’t miss him ... ”
98418	98427	98428	98428	she	168	“ He ’s not even good - looking ! ”
98439	98467	98428	98428	she	168	“ They only like him because he ’s famous ! They would n’t look twice at him if he could n’t do that Wonky - Faint thing — ”
98468	98472	98474	98474	Harry	157	“ Wronski Feint , ”
98646	98653	98654	98654	he	157	“ What about Ron , though ? ”
98657	98667	98654	98654	he	157	“ Do n’t you want to go with him ? ”
98668	98673	98674	98674	Hermione	168	“ Oh ... well ... ”
98679	98693	98674	98674	Hermione	168	“ I thought we might meet up with him in the Three Broomsticks ... ”
98694	98697	98699	98699	Harry	157	“ No , ”
98702	98711	98674	98674	Hermione	168	“ Oh Harry , this is so stupid — ”
98712	98732	98674	98674	Hermione	168	“ I ’ll come , but I ’m not meeting Ron , and I ’m wearing my Invisibility Cloak . ”
98733	98739	98740	98740	Hermione	168	“ Oh all right then ... ”
98743	98766	98740	98740	Hermione	168	“ but I hate talking to you in that Cloak , I never know if I ’m looking at you or not . ”
98842	98850	98852	98852	Hermione	168	“ People keep looking at me now , ”
98870	98879	98852	98852	Hermione	168	“ They think I ’m talking to myself . ”
98880	98890	98852	98852	Hermione	168	“ Do n’t move your lips so much then . ”
98891	98914	98852	98852	Hermione	168	“ Come on , please just take off your Cloak for a bit , no one ’s going to bother you here . ”
98915	98919	98921	98921	Harry	157	“ Oh yeah ? ”
98923	98928	98921	98921	Harry	157	“ Look behind you . ”
98988	99007	98985	98985	Harry	157	“ She ’s staying in the village . I bet she ’s coming to watch the first task . ”
99057	99062	99064	99064	Hermione	168	“ She ’s gone , ”
99077	99111	99112	99112	she	168	“ Why do n’t we go and have a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks , it ’s a bit cold , is n’t it ? You do n’t have to talk to Ron ! ”
99300	99314	99315	99315	she	168	“ I look like such an idiot , sitting here on my own , ”
99318	99326	99315	99315	she	168	“ Lucky I brought something to do . ”
99389	99407	99408	99408	Hermione	168	“ You know , maybe I should try and get some of the villagers involved in S.P.E.W. , ”
99417	99422	99424	99424	Harry	157	“ Yeah , right , ”
99436	99451	99426	99426	He	157	“ Hermione , when are you going to give up on this spew stuff ? ”
99452	99464	99465	99465	she	168	“ When house - elves have decent wages and working conditions ! ”
99469	99496	99465	99465	she	168	“ You know , I ’m starting to think it ’s time for more direct action . I wonder how you get into the school kitchens ? ”
99497	99506	99508	99508	Harry	157	“ No idea , ask Fred and George , ”
99847	99854	99856	99856	Hermione	168	“ Look , it ’s Hagrid ! ”
100111	100117	100119	100119	Hagrid	180	“ All right , Hermione ? ”
100122	100125	100127	100127	Hermione	168	“ Hello , ”
100154	100160	100151	100151	he	344	“ Nice Cloak , Potter . ”
100189	100201	100186	100186	Moody	344	“ Can your eye — I mean , can you — ? ”
100202	100212	100213	100213	Moody	344	“ Yeah , it can see through Invisibility Cloaks , ”
100217	100232	100213	100213	Moody	344	“ And it ’s come in useful at times , I can tell you . ”
100288	100304	100259	100259	Hagrid	180	“ Harry , meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin . Wear that Cloak . ”
100312	100320	100308	100308	Hagrid	180	“ Nice ter see yeh , Hermione , ”
100330	100342	100343	100343	Harry	157	“ Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight ? ”
100349	100353	100355	100355	Hermione	168	“ Does he ? ”
100360	100380	100381	100381	She	168	“ I wonder what he ’s up to ? I do n’t know whether you should go , Harry ... ”
100388	100397	100381	100381	She	168	“ It might make you late for Sirius . ”
100633	100636	100626	100626	He	157	“ Thanks ! ”
100693	100699	100700	100700	Hagrid	180	“ You there , Harry ? ”
100710	100713	100715	100715	Harry	157	“ Yeah , ”
100730	100735	100715	100715	Harry	157	“ What ’s up ? ”
100736	100743	100745	100745	Hagrid	180	“ Got summat ter show yeh , ”
100806	100813	100814	100814	Harry	157	“ What ’re you showing me ? ”
100845	100862	100864	100864	Hagrid	180	“ Come with me , keep quiet , an ’ keep yerself covered with that Cloak , ”
100866	100879	100864	100864	Hagrid	180	“ We won ’ take Fang , he won ’ like it ... ”
100880	100905	100912	100912	he	180	“ Listen , Hagrid , I ca n’t stay long ... I ’ve got to be back up at the castle by one o’clock — ”
100947	100953	100938	100938	Hagrid	180	“ Hagrid , what — ? ”
100954	100957	100959	100959	Hagrid	180	“ Shhh ! ”
100999	101009	100995	100995	she	291	“ Ah , ’ Agrid ... it is time ? ”
101010	101015	101017	101017	Hagrid	180	“ Bong - sewer , ”
101131	101143	101127	101127	she	291	“ Wair is it you are taking me , ’ Agrid ? ”
101144	101149	101151	101151	Hagrid	180	“ Yeh’ll enjoy this , ”
101154	101182	101151	101151	Hagrid	180	“ worth seein ’ , trust me . On’y — don ’ go tellin ’ anyone I showed yeh , right ? Yeh’re not s’posed ter know . ”
101183	101188	101190	101191	Madame Maxime	291	“ Of course not , ”
101596	101603	101605	101609	a wizard near the fence	2696	“ Keep back there , Hagrid ! ”
101619	101642	101605	101609	a wizard near the fence	2696	“ They can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet , you know ! I ’ve seen this Horntail do forty ! ”
101643	101649	101651	101651	Hagrid	180	“ Is’n ’ it beautiful ? ”
101654	101660	101662	101663	another wizard	4765	“ It ’s no good ! ”
101665	101675	101662	101663	another wizard	4765	“ Stunning Spells , on the count of three ! ”
101688	101691	101692	101692	they	2698	“ Stupefy ! ”
101841	101848	101849	101849	Hagrid	180	“ Wan ’ a closer look ? ”
101893	101899	101900	101900	he	157	“ All right , Hagrid ? ”
101908	101961	101900	101900	he	157	“ They should be okay now — we put them out with a Sleeping Draught on the way here , thought it might be better for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet — but , like you saw , they were n’t happy , not happy at all — ”
101962	101971	101973	101973	Hagrid	180	“ What breeds you got here , Charlie ? ”
102012	102019	102021	102021	Charlie	185	“ This is a Hungarian Horntail , ”
102023	102058	102021	102021	Charlie	185	“ There ’s a Common Welsh Green over there , the smaller one — a Swedish Short - Snout , that blue - gray — and a Chinese Fireball , that ’s the red . ”
102081	102093	102094	102094	Charlie	185	“ I did n’t know you were bringing her , Hagrid , ”
102099	102123	102094	102094	Charlie	185	“ The champions are n’t supposed to know what ’s coming — she ’s bound to tell her student , is n’t she ? ”
102124	102135	102137	102137	Hagrid	180	“ Jus ’ thought she ’d like ter see ’em , ”
102148	102155	102157	102157	Charlie	185	“ Really romantic date , Hagrid , ”
102163	102166	102168	102168	Hagrid	180	“ Four ... ”
102170	102195	102168	102168	Hagrid	180	“ so it ’s one fer each o ’ the champions , is it ? What ’ve they got ta do — fight ’em ? ”
102196	102205	102207	102207	Charlie	185	“ Just get past them , I think , ”
102209	102269	102207	102207	Charlie	185	“ We ’ll be on hand if it gets nasty , Extinguishing Spells at the ready . They wanted nesting mothers , I do n’t know why ... but I tell you this , I do n’t envy the one who gets the Horntail . Vicious thing . Its back end ’s as dangerous as its front , look . ”
102342	102351	102353	102353	Charlie	185	“ I ’ve got them counted , Hagrid , ”
102360	102365	102357	102357	he	185	“ How ’s Harry ? ”
102366	102369	102371	102371	Hagrid	180	“ Fine , ”
102381	102395	102397	102397	Charlie	185	“ Just hope he ’s still fine after he ’s faced this lot , ”
102652	102659	102694	102694	Karkaroff	373	“ Ouch ! Who ’s there ? ”
102696	102701	102703	102703	Karkaroff	373	“ Who ’s there ? ”
102969	102972	102973	102973	he	157	“ Balderdash ! ”
102993	102999	103000	103000	she	2720	“ If you say so , ”
103200	103208	103184	103184	he	157	“ Sirius — how ’re you doing ? ”
103289	103298	103300	103300	Sirius	177	“ Never mind me , how are you ? ”
103303	103307	103333	103333	he	157	“ I ’m — ”
103316	103318	103312	103312	Harry	157	“ fine ”
103399	103429	103430	103430	he	157	“ ... and now Hagrid ’s just shown me what ’s coming in the first task , and it ’s dragons , Sirius , and I ’m a goner , ”
103480	103537	103477	103477	he	177	“ Dragons we can deal with , Harry , but we ’ll get to that in a minute — I have n’t got long here ... I ’ve broken into a Wizarding house to use the fire , but they could be back at any time . There are things I need to warn you about . ”
103538	103541	103543	103543	Harry	157	“ What ? ”
103564	103567	103569	103569	Sirius	177	“ Karkaroff , ”
103571	103591	103569	103569	Sirius	177	“ Harry , he was a Death Eater . You know what Death Eaters are , do n’t you ? ”
103592	103599	103477	103477	he	177	“ Yes — he — what ? ”
103600	103653	103569	103569	Sirius	177	“ He was caught , he was in Azkaban with me , but he got released . I ’d bet everything that ’s why Dumbledore wanted an Auror at Hogwarts this year — to keep an eye on him . Moody caught Karkaroff . Put him into Azkaban in the first place . ”
103654	103659	103660	103660	Harry	157	“ Karkaroff got released ? ”
103679	103686	103660	103660	Harry	157	“ Why did they release him ? ”
103687	103698	103700	103700	Sirius	177	“ He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic , ”
103703	103787	103700	103700	Sirius	177	“ He said he ’d seen the error of his ways , and then he named names ... he put a load of other people into Azkaban in his place ... He ’s not very popular in there , I can tell you . And since he got out , from what I can tell , he ’s been teaching the Dark Arts to every student who passes through that school of his . So watch out for the Durmstrang champion as well . ”
103788	103791	103793	103793	Harry	157	“ Okay , ”
103796	103836	103793	103793	Harry	157	“ But ... are you saying Karkaroff put my name in the goblet ? Because if he did , he ’s a really good actor . He seemed furious about it . He wanted to stop me from competing . ”
103837	103846	103848	103848	Sirius	177	“ We know he ’s a good actor , ”
103850	103882	103848	103848	Sirius	177	“ because he convinced the Ministry of Magic to set him free , did n’t he ? Now , I ’ve been keeping an eye on the Daily Prophet , Harry — ”
103883	103893	103895	103895	Harry	157	“ — you and the rest of the world , ”
103898	103937	103938	103938	Sirius	177	“ — and reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman ’s article last month , Moody was attacked the night before he started at Hogwarts . Yes , I know she says it was another false alarm , ”
103948	104033	103938	103938	Sirius	177	“ but I do n’t think so , somehow . I think someone tried to stop him from getting to Hogwarts . I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around . And no one ’s going to look into it too closely ; Mad - Eye ’s heard intruders a bit too often . But that does n’t mean he ca n’t still spot the real thing . Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had . ”
104034	104042	104044	104044	Harry	157	“ So ... what are you saying ? ”
104047	104059	104044	104044	Harry	157	“ Karkaroff ’s trying to kill me ? But — why ? ”
104063	104073	104074	104074	he	177	“ I ’ve been hearing some very strange things , ”
104078	104130	104074	104074	he	177	“ The Death Eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately . They showed themselves at the Quidditch World Cup , did n’t they ? Someone set off the Dark Mark ... and then — did you hear about that Ministry of Magic witch who ’s gone missing ? ”
104131	104135	104137	104137	Harry	157	“ Bertha Jorkins ? ”
104139	104175	104074	104074	he	177	“ Exactly ... she disappeared in Albania , and that ’s definitely where Voldemort was rumored to be last ... and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up , would n’t she ? ”
104176	104197	104199	104199	Harry	157	“ Yeah , but ... it ’s not very likely she ’d have walked straight into Voldemort , is it ? ”
104201	104209	104211	104211	Sirius	177	“ Listen , I knew Bertha Jorkins , ”
104214	104272	104211	104211	Sirius	177	“ She was at Hogwarts when I was , a few years above your dad and me . And she was an idiot . Very nosy , but no brains , none at all . It ’s not a good combination , Harry . I ’d say she ’d be very easy to lure into a trap . ”
104273	104286	104288	104288	Harry	157	“ So ... so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament ? ”
104290	104307	104288	104288	Harry	157	“ Is that what you mean ? You think Karkaroff might be here on his orders ? ”
104308	104314	104316	104316	Sirius	177	“ I do n’t know , ”
104319	104390	104316	104316	Sirius	177	“ I just do n’t know ... Karkaroff does n’t strike me as the type who ’d go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was powerful enough to protect him . But whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a reason , and I ca n’t help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to attack you and make it look like an accident . ”
104391	104404	104406	104406	Harry	157	“ Looks like a really good plan from where I ’m standing , ”
104411	104427	104406	104406	Harry	157	“ They ’ll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff . ”
104428	104434	104436	104436	Sirius	177	“ Right — these dragons , ”
104443	104492	104436	104436	Sirius	177	“ There ’s a way , Harry . Do n’t be tempted to try a Stunning Spell — dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner , you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon — ”
104493	104503	104505	104505	Harry	157	“ Yeah , I know , I just saw , ”
104507	104515	104517	104517	Sirius	177	“ But you can do it alone , ”
104519	104536	104517	104517	Sirius	177	“ There is a way , and a simple spell ’s all you need . Just — ”
104569	104572	104573	104573	he	157	“ Go ! ”
104578	104586	104573	104573	he	157	“ Go ! There ’s someone coming ! ”
104713	104720	104721	104721	he	170	“ Who were you talking to ? ”
104724	104734	104735	104735	Harry	157	“ What ’s that got to do with you ? ”
104738	104751	104735	104735	Harry	157	“ What are you doing down here at this time of night ? ”
104752	104759	104760	104760	Ron	170	“ I just wondered where you — ”
104766	104776	104760	104760	Ron	170	“ Nothing . I ’m going back to bed . ”
104777	104789	104790	104790	Harry	157	“ Just thought you ’d come nosing around , did you ? ”
104846	104851	104853	104853	Ron	170	“ Sorry about that , ”
104897	104902	104903	104903	Harry	157	“ There you go , ”
104906	104938	104903	104903	Harry	157	“ Something for you to wear on Tuesday . You might even have a scar now , if you ’re lucky ... That ’s what you want , is n’t it ? ”
105159	105172	105173	105173	she	168	“ Let ’s just try and keep you alive until Tuesday evening , ”
105177	105186	105173	105173	she	168	“ and then we can worry about Karkaroff . ”
105251	105283	105349	105349	He	157	“ ‘ Talon - clipping by charms ... treating scale - rot ... ’ This is no good , this is for nutters like Hagrid who want to keep them healthy ... ”
105284	105325	105349	105349	He	157	“ ‘ Dragons are extremely difficult to slay , owing to the ancient magic that imbues their thick hides , which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate ... ’ But Sirius said a simple one would do it ... ”
105326	105336	105338	105338	Harry	157	“ Let ’s try some simple spellbooks , then , ”
105380	105383	105384	105384	Harry	157	“ Hermione , ”
105391	105408	105384	105384	Harry	157	“ will you shut up for a bit , please ? I ’m trying to concentrate . ”
105493	105512	105514	105514	Hermione	168	“ Oh no , he ’s back again , why ca n’t he read on his stupid ship ? ”
105546	105573	105535	105535	himself	204	“ Come on , Harry , we ’ll go back to the common room ... his fan club’ll be here in a moment , twittering away ... ”
105792	105803	105804	105804	Harry	157	“ Hermione , I ’ll see you in the greenhouses , ”
105819	105829	105804	105804	Harry	157	“ Go on , I ’ll catch you up . ”
105830	105845	105809	105809	his	157	“ Harry , you ’ll be late , the bell ’s about to ring — ”
105846	105855	105804	105804	Harry	157	“ I ’ll catch you up , okay ? ”
105985	105990	105992	105992	Cedric	208	“ Do n’t bother , ”
106006	106016	105992	105992	Cedric	208	“ Tell Flitwick I ’m coming , go on ... ”
106064	106067	106069	106069	Cedric	208	“ Hi , ”

106108	106115	106106	106106	Harry	157	“ the first task is dragons . ”
106116	106119	106121	106121	Cedric	208	“ What ? ”
106126	106129	106131	106131	Harry	157	“ Dragons , ”
106150	106171	106138	106139	Professor Flitwick	328	“ They ’ve got four , one for each of us , and we ’ve got to get past them . ”
106197	106202	106203	106203	Cedric	208	“ Are you sure ? ”
106210	106214	106216	106216	Harry	157	“ Dead sure , ”
106218	106224	106216	106216	Harry	157	“ I ’ve seen them . ”
106225	106240	106250	106250	he	157	“ But how did you find out ? We ’re not supposed to know ... ”
106241	106245	106247	106247	Harry	157	“ Never mind , ”
106263	106291	106247	106247	Harry	157	“ But I ’m not the only one who knows . Fleur and Krum will know by now — Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the dragons too . ”
106334	106341	106342	106342	he	208	“ Why are you telling me ? ”
106389	106400	106401	106401	he	157	“ It ’s just ... fair , is n’t it ? ”
106406	106423	106401	106401	he	157	“ We all know now ... we ’re on an even footing , are n’t we ? ”
106460	106467	106468	106468	he	157	“ Come with me , Potter , ”
106471	106478	106468	106468	he	157	“ Diggory , off you go . ”
106490	106503	106486	106486	he	157	“ Er — Professor , I ’m supposed to be in Herbology — ”
106504	106517	106520	106520	him	294	“ Never mind that , Potter . In my office , please ... ”
106636	106649	106650	106650	Moody	294	“ That was a very decent thing you just did , Potter , ”
106673	106677	106679	106679	Moody	294	“ Sit down , ”
106887	106896	106898	106898	Moody	294	“ Like my Dark Detectors , do you ? ”
106906	106911	106912	106912	Harry	157	“ What ’s that ? ”
106922	107007	107008	107008	he	2780	“ Secrecy Sensor . Vibrates when it detects concealment and lies ... no use here , of course , too much interference — students in every direction lying about why they have n’t done their homework . Been humming ever since I got here . I had to disable my Sneakoscope because it would n’t stop whistling . It ’s extra - sensitive , picks up stuff about a mile around . Of course , it could be picking up more than kid stuff , ”
107060	107072	107049	107049	Moody	294	“ So ... found out about the dragons , have you ? ”
107107	107113	107115	107115	Moody	294	“ It ’s all right , ”
107129	107144	107115	107115	Moody	294	“ Cheating ’s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been . ”
107145	107151	107153	107153	Harry	157	“ I did n’t cheat , ”
107156	107169	107153	107153	Harry	157	“ It was — a sort of accident that I found out . ”
107173	107245	107170	107170	Moody	294	“ I was n’t accusing you , laddie . I ’ve been telling Dumbledore from the start , he can be as high - minded as he likes , but you can bet old Karkaroff and Maxime wo n’t be . They ’ll have told their champions everything they can . They want to win . They want to beat Dumbledore . They ’d like to prove he ’s only human . ”
107269	107286	107288	107288	Moody	294	“ So ... got any ideas how you ’re going to get past your dragon yet ? ”
107290	107293	107295	107295	Harry	157	“ No , ”
107297	107308	107310	107310	Moody	294	“ Well , I ’m not going to tell you , ”
107313	107346	107310	107310	Moody	294	“ I do n’t show favoritism , me . I ’m just going to give you some good , general advice . And the first bit is — play to your strengths . ”
107347	107354	107356	107356	Harry	157	“ I have n’t got any , ”
107364	107368	107370	107370	Moody	294	“ Excuse me , ”
107372	107394	107370	107370	Moody	294	“ you ’ve got strengths if I say you ’ve got them . Think now . What are you best at ? ”
107414	107417	107418	107418	he	157	“ Quidditch , ”
107422	107430	107418	107418	he	157	“ and a fat lot of help — ”
107431	107436	107438	107438	Moody	294	“ That ’s right , ”
107454	107467	107438	107438	Moody	294	“ You ’re a damn good flier from what I ’ve heard . ”
107468	107473	107474	107474	Harry	157	“ Yeah , but ... ”
107479	107494	107474	107474	Harry	157	“ I ’m not allowed a broom , I ’ve only got my wand — ”
107495	107503	107505	107505	Moody	294	“ My second piece of general advice , ”
107511	107530	107505	107505	Moody	294	“ is to use a nice , simple spell that will enable you to get what you need . ”
107542	107548	107550	107550	Moody	294	“ Come on , boy ... ”
107552	107563	107550	107550	Moody	294	“ Put them together ... it ’s not that difficult ... ”
107600	107603	107604	107604	Harry	157	“ Hermione , ”
107630	107640	107604	107604	Harry	157	“ Hermione — I need you to help me . ”
107641	107654	107655	107655	she	329	“ What d’you think I ’ve been trying to do , Harry ? ”
107676	107694	107655	107655	she	329	“ Hermione , I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by tomorrow afternoon . ”
107756	107763	107818	107818	Arithmancy	416	“ Concentrate , Harry , concentrate ... ”
107764	107774	107776	107776	Harry	157	“ What d’you think I ’m trying to do ? ”
107779	107799	107776	107776	Harry	157	“ A great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason ... Okay , try again ... ”
107877	107884	107886	107886	Harry	157	“ Well , that ’s good , ”
107897	107916	107886	107886	Harry	157	“ just as long as it ’s not drawn - out . I do n’t want to suffer . ”
108156	108168	108169	108169	Hermione	168	“ That ’s better , Harry , that ’s loads better , ”
108178	108196	108197	108197	Harry	157	“ Well , now we know what to do next time I ca n’t manage a spell , ”
108214	108223	108224	108224	He	157	“ threaten me with a dragon . Right ... ”
108231	108235	108224	108224	He	157	“ Accio Dictionary ! ”
108256	108267	108269	108269	Hermione	168	“ Harry , I really think you ’ve got it ! ”
108272	108281	108282	108282	Harry	157	“ Just as long as it works tomorrow , ”
108285	108322	108282	108282	Harry	157	“ The Firebolt ’s going to be much farther away than the stuff in here , it ’s going to be in the castle , and I ’m going to be out there on the grounds ... ”
108323	108329	108331	108331	Hermione	168	“ That does n’t matter , ”
108334	108369	108331	108331	Hermione	168	“ Just as long as you ’re concentrating really , really hard on it , it ’ll come . Harry , we ’d better get some sleep ... you ’re going to need it . ”
108473	108484	108465	108465	they	2800	“ We ’ll have a box of tissues ready , Potter ”
108610	108634	108604	108606	Lots of people	2803	“ Potter , the champions have to come down onto the grounds now ... You have to get ready for your first task . ”

113280	113377	113277	113277	he	106	“ Remember what Malfoy said on the train , about his dad being friends with Karkaroff ? Now we know where they knew each other . They were probably running around in masks together at the World Cup ... I ’ll tell you one thing , though , Harry , if it was Karkaroff who put your name in the goblet , he ’s going to be feeling really stupid now , is n’t he ? Did n’t work , did it ? You only got a scratch ! Come here — I ’ll do it — ”
113421	113443	113444	113444	Ron	170	“ There ’s no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous , how could they be ? ”
113455	113474	113448	113448	he	170	“ You know what ? I reckon you could win this tournament , Harry , I ’m serious . ”
113522	113537	113538	113538	she	168	“ Harry ’s got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament , ”
113542	113559	113538	113538	she	168	“ If that was the first task , I hate to think what ’s coming next . ”
113560	113571	113573	113573	Ron	170	“ Right little ray of sunshine , are n’t you ? ”
113575	113585	113573	113573	Ron	170	“ You and Professor Trelawney should get together sometime . ”
113664	113693	113661	113661	Ron	170	“ Well , we ’d better get downstairs for your surprise party , Harry — Fred and George should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by now . ”
113860	113867	113869	113870	Lee Jordan	347	“ Blimey , this is heavy , ”
113893	113911	113869	113870	Lee Jordan	347	“ Open it , Harry , go on ! Let ’s just see what ’s inside it ! ”
113912	113925	113926	113926	Hermione	168	“ He ’s supposed to work out the clue on his own , ”
113930	113938	113926	113926	Hermione	168	“ It ’s in the tournament rules ... ”
113939	113957	113958	113958	Harry	157	“ I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too , ”
113974	113985	113986	113987	several people	1918	“ Yeah , go on , Harry , open it ! ”
114075	114079	114080	114080	Fred	174	“ Shut it ! ”
114089	114094	114096	114097	Seamus Finnigan	227	“ What was that ? ”
114110	114130	114096	114097	Seamus Finnigan	227	“ Sounded like a banshee ... Maybe you ’ve got to get past one of those next , Harry ! ”
114131	114138	114140	114140	Neville	313	“ It was someone being tortured ! ”
114156	114168	114140	114140	Neville	313	“ You ’re going to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse ! ”
114169	114182	114184	114184	George	175	“ Do n’t be a prat , Neville , that ’s illegal , ”
114186	114224	114184	114184	George	175	“ They would n’t use the Cruciatus Curse on the champions . I thought it sounded a bit like Percy singing ... maybe you ’ve got to attack him while he ’s in the shower , Harry . ”
114225	114233	114235	114235	Fred	174	“ Want a jam tart , Hermione ? ”
114251	114257	114258	114258	he	157	“ It ’s all right , ”
114261	114281	114258	114258	he	157	“ I have n’t done anything to them . It ’s the custard creams you ’ve got to watch — ”
114302	114310	114299	114299	Fred	174	“ Just my little joke , Neville ... ”
114321	114333	114318	114318	she	168	“ Did you get all this from the kitchens , Fred ? ”
114334	114337	114339	114339	Fred	174	“ Yep , ”
114360	114392	114345	114345	He	157	“ ‘ Anything we can get you , sir , anything at all ! ’ They ’re dead helpful ... get me a roast ox if I said I was peckish . ”
114393	114401	114402	114402	Hermione	168	“ How do you get in there ? ”
114412	114415	114417	114417	Fred	174	“ Easy , ”
114419	114441	114442	114442	He	157	“ concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit . Just tickle the pear , and it giggles and — ”
114450	114453	114442	114442	He	157	“ Why ? ”
114454	114457	114459	114459	Hermione	168	“ Nothing , ”
114462	114480	114482	114482	George	175	“ Going to try and lead the house - elves out on strike now , are you ? ”
114484	114502	114482	114482	George	175	“ Going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion ? ”
114512	114531	114533	114533	Fred	174	“ Do n’t you go upsetting them and telling them they ’ve got to take clothes and salaries ! ”
114536	114545	114533	114533	Fred	174	“ You ’ll put them off their cooking ! ”
114561	114568	114569	114569	Fred	174	“ Oh — sorry , Neville ! ”
114576	114588	114569	114569	Fred	174	“ I forgot — it was the custard creams we hexed — ”
114619	114623	114624	114624	Fred	174	“ Canary Creams ! ”
114631	114645	114624	114624	Fred	174	“ George and I invented them — seven Sickles each , a bargain ! ”
114882	114893	114894	114894	Hagrid	180	“ I ’m not sure whether they hibernate or not , ”
114907	114934	114894	114894	Hagrid	180	“ Thought we ’d jus ’ try an ’ see if they fancied a kip ... we ’ll jus ’ settle ’em down in these boxes ... ”
115027	115037	115038	115038	Hagrid	180	“ We ’ll jus ’ lead ’em in here , ”
115041	115056	115038	115038	Hagrid	180	“ an ’ put the lids on , and we ’ll see what happens . ”
115088	115099	115083	115083	Hagrid	180	“ Don ’ panic , now , don ’ panic ! ”
115200	115208	115209	115209	Hagrid	180	“ Don ’ frighten him , now ! ”
115245	115270	115209	115209	Hagrid	180	“ Jus ’ try an ’ slip the rope ’ round his sting , so he won ’ hurt any o ’ the others ! ”
115271	115280	115281	115281	Ron	170	“ Yeah , we would n’t want that ! ”
115306	115319	115281	115281	Ron	170	“ Well , well , well ... this does look like fun . ”
115396	115401	115402	115402	Hagrid	180	“ Who ’re you ? ”
115422	115430	115431	115431	Rita	302	“ Rita Skeeter , Daily Prophet reporter , ”
115443	115456	115458	115458	Hagrid	180	“ Thought Dumbledore said you weren ’ allowed inside the school anymore , ”
115492	115500	115501	115501	she	302	“ What are these fascinating creatures called ? ”
115509	115515	115517	115517	Hagrid	180	“ Blast - Ended Skrewts , ”
115519	115522	115524	115524	Rita	302	“ Really ? ”
115532	115547	115524	115524	Rita	302	“ I ’ve never heard of them before ... where do they come from ? ”
115591	115607	115577	115586	Hermione , who seemed to be thinking along these lines	2932	“ They ’re very interesting , are n’t they ? Are n’t they , Harry ? ”
115608	115618	115620	115620	Harry	157	“ What ? Oh yeah ... ouch ... interesting , ”
115628	115637	115642	115642	she	302	“ Ah , you ’re here , Harry ! ”
115646	115664	115642	115642	she	302	“ So you like Care of Magical Creatures , do you ? One of your favorite lessons ? ”
115665	115668	115670	115670	Harry	157	“ Yes , ”
115678	115681	115683	115683	Rita	302	“ Lovely , ”
115685	115693	115694	115694	she	302	“ Really lovely . Been teaching long ? ”
115765	115773	115775	115775	Hagrid	180	“ This is on’y me second year , ”
115777	115832	115775	115775	Hagrid	180	“ Lovely ... I do n’t suppose you ’d like to give an interview , would you ? Share some of your experience of magical creatures ? The Prophet does a zoological column every Wednesday , as I ’m sure you know . We could feature these — er — Bang - Ended Scoots . ”
115833	115839	115840	115840	Hagrid	180	“ Blast - Ended Skrewts , ”
115844	115852	115840	115840	Hagrid	180	“ Er — yeah , why not ? ”
115924	115933	115934	115935	Rita Skeeter	302	“ Well , good - bye , Harry ! ”
115949	115958	115934	115935	Rita Skeeter	302	“ Until Friday night , then , Hagrid ! ”
115959	115967	115968	115968	Harry	157	“ She ’ll twist everything he says , ”
115974	115989	115991	115991	Hermione	168	“ Just as long as he did n’t import those skrewts illegally or anything , ”
116011	116028	116030	116030	Ron	170	“ Hagrid ’s been in loads of trouble before , and Dumbledore ’s never sacked him , ”
116033	116059	116030	116030	Ron	170	“ Worst that can happen is Hagrid’ll have to get rid of the skrewts . Sorry ... did I say worst ? I meant best . ”
116157	116162	116163	116163	she	304	“ I would think , ”
116178	116183	116185	116185	she	304	“ that some of us ”
116192	116261	116185	116185	she	304	“ might be a little less frivolous had they seen what I have seen during my crystal gazing last night . As I sat here , absorbed in my needlework , the urge to consult the orb overpowered me . I arose , I settled myself before it , and I gazed into its crystalline depths ... and what do you think I saw gazing back at me ? ”
116262	116271	116272	116272	Ron	170	“ An ugly old bat in outsize specs ? ”
116287	116293	116278	116278	Harry	157	“ Death , my dears . ”
116308	116311	116313	116314	Professor Trelawney	304	“ Yes , ”
116319	116342	116313	116314	Professor Trelawney	304	“ it comes , ever closer , it circles overhead like a vulture , ever lower ... ever lower over the castle ... ”
116356	116375	116376	116376	Harry	157	“ It ’d be a bit more impressive if she had n’t done it about eighty times before , ”
116394	116419	116376	116376	Harry	157	“ But if I ’d dropped dead every time she ’s told me I ’m going to , I ’d be a medical miracle . ”
116420	116432	116434	116434	Ron	170	“ You ’d be a sort of extra - concentrated ghost , ”
116456	116482	116450	116450	his	5404	“ At least we did n’t get homework . I hope Hermione got loads off Professor Vector , I love not working when she is ... ”
116572	116580	116581	116581	Ron	170	“ Wonder where she ’s got to ? ”
116593	116598	116581	116581	Ron	170	“ Dunno ... balderdash . ”
116622	116625	116626	116626	she	1991	“ Harry ! ”
116648	116672	116626	116626	she	1991	“ Harry , you ’ve got to come — you ’ve got to come , the most amazing thing ’s happened — please — ”
116690	116696	116697	116697	Harry	157	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
116700	116716	116673	116673	She	1991	“ I ’ll show you when we get there — oh come on , quick — ”
116731	116734	116735	116735	Harry	157	“ Okay , ”
116753	116760	116761	116763	the Fat Lady	1991	“ Oh do n’t mind me ! ”
116769	116794	116761	116763	the Fat Lady	1991	“ Do n’t apologize for bothering me ! I ’ll just hang here , wide open , until you get back , shall I ? ”
116795	116800	116801	116801	Ron	170	“ Yeah , thanks ! ”
116807	116815	116816	116816	Harry	157	“ Hermione , where are we going ? ”
116840	116852	116854	116854	Hermione	168	“ You ’ll see , you ’ll see in a minute ! ”
116957	116962	116964	116964	Harry	157	“ Oh hang on ... ”
116972	116979	116964	116964	Harry	157	“ Wait a minute , Hermione ... ”
116980	116983	116984	116984	She	168	“ What ? ”
116998	117006	117008	117008	Harry	157	“ I know what this is about , ”
117030	117033	117035	117035	Ron	170	“ Hermione ! ”
117040	117053	117035	117035	Ron	170	“ You ’re trying to rope us into that spew stuff again ! ”
117054	117063	117064	117064	she	168	“ No , no , I ’m not ! ”
117068	117077	117064	117064	she	168	“ And it ’s not spew , Ron — ”
117078	117086	117088	117088	Ron	170	“ Changed the name , have you ? ”
117094	117130	117088	117088	Ron	170	“ What are we now , then , the House - Elf Liberation Front ? I ’m not barging into that kitchen and trying to make them stop work , I ’m not doing it — ”
117131	117139	117140	117140	Hermione	168	“ I ’m not asking you to ! ”
117144	117174	117140	117140	Hermione	168	“ I came down here just now , to talk to them all , and I found — oh come on , Harry , I want to show you ! ”
117305	117314	117327	117329	the squealing elf	2967	“ Harry Potter , sir ! Harry Potter ! ”
117348	117353	117354	117354	Harry	157	“ D - Dobby ? ”
117357	117367	117327	117329	the squealing elf	2967	“ It is Dobby , sir , it is ! ”
117377	117402	117327	117329	the squealing elf	2967	“ Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter , sir , and Harry Potter has come to see him , sir ! ”
117609	117618	117619	117619	Harry	157	“ Dobby , what ’re you doing here ? ”
117624	117635	117636	117636	Dobby	425	“ Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts , sir ! ”
117640	117651	117636	117636	Dobby	425	“ Professor Dumbledore gave Dobby and Winky jobs , sir ! ”
117652	117655	117657	117657	Harry	157	“ Winky ? ”
117659	117665	117657	117657	Harry	157	“ She ’s here too ? ”
117666	117673	117675	117675	Dobby	425	“ Yes , sir , yes ! ”
117833	117838	117839	117839	he	425	“ Winky , sir ! ”
117941	117946	117948	117948	Harry	157	“ Hello , Winky , ”
117986	117990	117994	117994	She	168	“ Oh dear , ”
118009	118020	117996	117996	Ron	170	“ Winky , do n’t cry , please do n’t ... ”
118040	118050	118051	118051	he	425	“ Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea ? ”
118060	118067	118069	118069	Harry	157	“ Er — yeah , okay , ”
118114	118118	118119	118119	Ron	170	“ Good service ! ”
118146	118156	118157	118157	Harry	157	“ How long have you been here , Dobby ? ”
118166	118176	118178	118178	Dobby	425	“ Only a week , Harry Potter , sir ! ”
118181	118221	118178	118178	Dobby	425	“ Dobby came to see Professor Dumbledore , sir . You see , sir , it is very difficult for a house - elf who has been dismissed to get a new position , sir , very difficult indeed — ”
118253	118271	118272	118272	Dobby	425	“ Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years , sir , trying to find work ! ”
118275	118291	118272	118272	Dobby	425	“ But Dobby has n’t found work , sir , because Dobby wants paying now ! ”
118333	118340	118327	118327	Hermione	168	“ Good for you , Dobby ! ”
118341	118347	118349	118349	Dobby	425	“ Thank you , miss ! ”
118356	118424	118349	118349	Dobby	425	“ But most wizards does n’t want a house - elf who wants paying , miss . ‘ That ’s not the point of a house - elf , ’ they says , and they slammed the door in Dobby ’s face ! Dobby likes work , but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid , Harry Potter ... Dobby likes being free ! ”
118468	118492	118494	118494	Dobby	425	“ And then , Harry Potter , Dobby goes to visit Winky , and finds out Winky has been freed too , sir ! ”
118565	118642	118552	118552	Dobby	425	“ And then Dobby had the idea , Harry Potter , sir ! ‘ Why does n’t Dobby and Winky find work together ? ’ Dobby says . ‘ Where is there enough work for two house - elves ? ’ says Winky . And Dobby thinks , and it comes to him , sir ! Hogwarts ! So Dobby and Winky came to see Professor Dumbledore , sir , and Professor Dumbledore took us on ! ”
118657	118698	118715	118715	Winky	252	“ And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby , sir , if Dobby wants paying ! And so Dobby is a free elf , sir , and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month ! ”
118699	118706	118707	118707	Hermione	168	“ That ’s not very much ! ”
118724	118738	118740	118740	Dobby	425	“ Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week , and weekends off , ”
118761	118791	118740	118740	Dobby	425	“ but Dobby beat him down , miss ... Dobby likes freedom , miss , but he is n’t wanting too much , miss , he likes work better . ”
118792	118804	118805	118805	Hermione	168	“ And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you , Winky ? ”
118854	118869	118870	118870	she	168	“ Winky is a disgraced elf , but Winky is not yet getting paid ! ”
118873	118891	118870	118870	she	168	“ Winky is not sunk so low as that ! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed ! ”
118892	118895	118897	118897	Hermione	168	“ Ashamed ? ”
118900	118934	118897	118897	Hermione	168	“ But — Winky , come on ! It ’s Mr. Crouch who should be ashamed , not you ! You did n’t do anything wrong , he was really horrible to you — ”

119002	119012	119014	119014	Dobby	425	“ Winky is having trouble adjusting , Harry Potter , ”
119017	119045	119014	119014	Dobby	425	“ Winky forgets she is not bound to Mr. Crouch anymore ; she is allowed to speak her mind now , but she wo n’t do it . ”
119046	119061	119062	119062	Harry	157	“ Ca n’t house - elves speak their minds about their masters , then ? ”
119065	119073	119075	119075	Dobby	425	“ Oh no , sir , no , ”
119081	119142	119075	119075	Dobby	425	“ ’ Tis part of the house - elf ’s enslavement , sir . We keeps their secrets and our silence , sir . We upholds the family ’s honor , and we never speaks ill of them — though Professor Dumbledore told Dobby he does not insist upon this . Professor Dumbledore said we is free to — to — ”
119159	119180	119156	119156	Dobby	425	“ He said we is free to call him a — a barmy old codger if we likes , sir ! ”
119189	119200	119201	119201	he	425	“ But Dobby is not wanting to , Harry Potter , ”
119218	119241	119201	119201	he	425	“ Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore very much , sir , and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him . ”
119242	119255	119256	119256	Harry	157	“ But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now ? ”
119273	119279	119280	119280	he	425	“ Dobby — Dobby could , ”
119290	119308	119284	119284	He	425	“ Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were — were — bad Dark wizards ! ”
119347	119354	119328	119328	he	425	“ Bad Dobby ! Bad Dobby ! ”
119372	119382	119384	119384	Dobby	425	“ Thank you , Harry Potter , thank you , ”
119391	119400	119401	119401	Harry	157	“ You just need a bit of practice , ”
119404	119407	119409	119409	Winky	252	“ Practice ! ”
119412	119431	119409	119409	Winky	252	“ You is ought to be ashamed of yourself , Dobby , talking that way about your masters ! ”
119432	119442	119444	119444	Dobby	425	“ They is n’t my masters anymore , Winky ! ”
119447	119457	119444	119444	Dobby	425	“ Dobby does n’t care what they think anymore ! ”
119458	119468	119470	119470	Winky	252	“ Oh you is a bad elf , Dobby ! ”
119480	119483	119485	119485	Hermione	168	“ Winky , ”
119488	119511	119485	119485	Hermione	168	“ I ’m quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you . We ’ve seen him , you know — ”
119512	119519	119521	119521	Winky	252	“ You is seeing my master ? ”
119539	119548	119537	119537	Hermione	168	“ You is seeing him here at Hogwarts ? ”
119549	119552	119554	119554	Hermione	168	“ Yes , ”
119556	119568	119554	119554	Hermione	168	“ he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Triwizard Tournament . ”
119569	119575	119577	119577	Winky	252	“ Mr. Bagman comes too ? ”
119607	119634	119602	119602	she	252	“ Mr. Bagman is a bad wizard ! A very bad wizard ! My master is n’t liking him , oh no , not at all ! ”
119635	119640	119642	119642	Harry	157	“ Bagman — bad ? ”
119644	119648	119649	119649	Winky	252	“ Oh yes , ”
119657	119681	119653	119653	her	252	“ My master is telling Winky some things ! But Winky is not saying ... Winky — Winky keeps her master ’s secrets ... ”
119698	119713	119692	119692	her	252	“ Poor master , poor master , no Winky to help him no more ! ”
119754	119767	119768	119768	he	425	“ Dobby is going to buy a sweater next , Harry Potter ! ”
119778	119785	119787	119787	Ron	170	“ Tell you what , Dobby , ”
119801	119831	119787	119787	Ron	170	“ I ’ll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas , I always get one from her . You do n’t mind maroon , do you ? ”
119836	119849	119850	119850	Ron	170	“ We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you , ”
119854	119865	119850	119850	Ron	170	“ but it ’ll go well with your tea cozy . ”
119921	119926	119927	119927	Harry	157	“ Thanks a lot ! ”
119945	119951	119927	119927	Harry	157	“ See you , Dobby ! ”
119952	119966	119967	119967	Dobby	425	“ Harry Potter ... can Dobby come and see you sometimes , sir ? ”
119971	119977	119979	119979	Harry	157	“ ’ Course you can , ”
119985	119990	119992	119992	Ron	170	“ You know what ? ”
120017	120057	120000	120000	Harry	157	“ All these years I ’ve been really impressed with Fred and George , nicking food from the kitchens — well , it ’s not exactly difficult , is it ? They ca n’t wait to give it away ! ”
120058	120077	120079	120079	Hermione	168	“ I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves , you know , ”
120090	120126	120079	120079	Hermione	168	“ Dobby coming to work here , I mean . The other elves will see how happy he is , being free , and slowly it ’ll dawn on them that they want that too ! ”
120127	120140	120142	120142	Harry	157	“ Let ’s hope they do n’t look too closely at Winky , ”
120144	120151	120156	120156	she	168	“ Oh she ’ll cheer up , ”
120162	120192	120156	120156	she	168	“ Once the shock ’s worn off , and she ’s got used to Hogwarts , she ’ll see how much better off she is without that Crouch man . ”
120193	120200	120202	120202	Ron	170	“ She seems to love him , ”
120215	120228	120230	120230	Harry	157	“ Does n’t think much of Bagman , though , does she ? ”
120232	120242	120230	120230	Harry	157	“ Wonder what Crouch says at home about him ? ”
120243	120256	120258	120258	Hermione	168	“ Probably says he ’s not a very good Head of Department , ”
120260	120277	120258	120258	Hermione	168	“ and let ’s face it ... he ’s got a point , has n’t he ? ”
120278	120290	120292	120292	Ron	170	“ I ’d still rather work for him than old Crouch , ”
120294	120305	120292	120292	Ron	170	“ At least Bagman ’s got a sense of humor . ”
120306	120316	120317	120317	Hermione	168	“ Do n’t let Percy hear you saying that , ”
120323	120345	120347	120347	Ron	170	“ Yeah , well , Percy would n’t want to work for anyone with a sense of humor , would he ? ”
120356	120377	120347	120347	Ron	170	“ Percy would n’t recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby ’s tea cozy . ”
120378	120388	120389	120390	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Potter ! Weasley ! Will you pay attention ? ”
120517	120532	120534	120535	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age , ”
120630	120637	120638	120639	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Dress robes will be worn , ”
120642	120666	120638	120639	Professor McGonagall	318	“ and the ball will start at eight o’clock on Christmas Day , finishing at midnight in the Great Hall . Now then — ”
120675	120696	120697	120697	she	318	“ The Yule Ball is of course a chance for us all to — er — let our hair down , ”
120758	120765	120766	120767	Professor McGonagall	318	“ But that does NOT mean , ”
120771	120804	120766	120767	Professor McGonagall	318	“ that we will be relaxing the standards of behavior we expect from Hogwarts students . I will be most seriously displeased if a Gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any way . ”
120836	120846	120829	120830	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Potter — a word , if you please . ”
120884	120893	120868	120869	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Potter , the champions and their partners — ”
120894	120898	120900	120900	Harry	157	“ What partners ? ”
120920	120930	120931	120931	she	318	“ Your partners for the Yule Ball , Potter , ”
120935	120940	120931	120931	she	318	“ Your dance partners . ”
120951	120955	120956	120956	He	157	“ Dance partners ? ”
120962	120968	120969	120969	he	157	“ I do n’t dance , ”
120973	120980	120982	120983	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Oh yes , you do , ”
120986	121006	120982	120983	Professor McGonagall	318	“ That ’s what I ’m telling you . Traditionally , the champions and their partners open the ball . ”
121043	121049	121050	121050	he	157	“ I ’m not dancing , ”
121053	121058	121060	121061	Professor McGonagall	318	“ It is traditional , ”
121064	121098	121060	121061	Professor McGonagall	318	“ You are a Hogwarts champion , and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the school . So make sure you get yourself a partner , Potter . ”
121099	121106	121116	121117	Professor McGonagall	318	“ But — I do n’t — ”
121107	121114	121116	121117	Professor McGonagall	318	“ You heard me , Potter , ”
121328	121338	121339	121339	Harry	157	“ Why do they have to move in packs ? ”
121358	121373	121343	121347	a dozen or so girls	3019	“ How ’re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them ? ”
121374	121378	121379	121379	Ron	170	“ Lasso one ? ”
121382	121393	121379	121379	Ron	170	“ Got any idea who you ’re going to try ? ”
121461	121498	121448	121448	Ron	170	“ Listen , you ’re not going to have any trouble . You ’re a champion . You ’ve just beaten a Hungarian Horntail . I bet they ’ll be queuing up to go with you . ”
121646	121654	121656	121656	Ron	170	“ She was quite good - looking , ”
121665	121674	121676	121676	Harry	157	“ She was a foot taller than me , ”
121681	121694	121676	121676	Harry	157	“ Imagine what I ’d look like trying to dance with her . ”
121706	121716	121699	121699	Krum	204	“ They only like him because he ’s famous ! ”
121920	121937	121938	121938	Hagrid	180	“ She didn ’ seem very int’rested in magical creatures , ter tell yeh the truth , ”

122038	122113	122031	122031	Hagrid	180	“ Well , I told her we ’d been friends since I went ter fetch yeh from the Dursleys . ‘ Never had to tell him off in four years ? ’ she said . ‘ Never played you up in lessons , has he ? ’ I told her no , an ’ she didn ’ seem happy at all . Yeh’d think she wanted me to say yeh were horrible , Harry . ”
122114	122120	122122	122122	Harry	157	“ ’ Course she did , ”
122144	122164	122137	122137	his	157	“ She ca n’t keep writing about what a tragic little hero I am , it ’ll get boring . ”
122165	122174	122176	122176	Ron	170	“ She wants a new angle , Hagrid , ”
122184	122196	122176	122176	Ron	170	“ You were supposed to say Harry ’s a mad delinquent ! ”
122197	122203	122205	122205	Hagrid	180	“ But he ’s not ! ”
122211	122218	122220	122220	Harry	157	“ She should ’ve interviewed Snape , ”
122223	122251	122220	122220	Harry	157	“ He ’d give her the goods on me any day . ‘ Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school ... ’ ”
122252	122259	122261	122261	Hagrid	180	“ Said that , did he ? ”

123601	123627	123596	123596	Hermione	168	“ So basically , you ’re going to take the best - looking girl who ’ll have you , even if she ’s completely horrible ? ”
123628	123638	123640	123640	Ron	170	“ Er — yeah , that sounds about right , ”
123642	123649	123650	123650	Hermione	168	“ I ’m going to bed , ”

129635	129641	129633	129633	Harry	157	“ See you in a minute ”
129925	129930	129931	129931	she	168	“ Hi , Harry ! ”

130434	130441	130442	130442	Harry	157	“ Why did n’t he come ? ”
130460	130477	130402	130402	he	186	“ I ’m afraid to say Mr. Crouch is n’t well , not well at all . ”
130491	130493	130485	130486	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Weatherby ”

130679	130702	130703	130703	he	157	“ Vell , ve have a castle also , not as big as this , nor as comfortable , I am thinking , ”
130708	130767	130703	130703	he	157	“ Ve have just four floors , and the fires are lit only for magical purposes . But ve have grounds larger even than these — though in vinter , ve have very little daylight , so ve are not enjoying them . But in summer ve are flying every day , over the lakes and the mountains — ”
130768	130775	130777	130777	Karkaroff	373	“ Now , now , Viktor ! ”
130789	130812	130777	130777	Karkaroff	373	“ do n’t go giving away anything else , now , or your charming friend will know exactly where to find us ! ”
130820	130837	130813	130813	Dumbledore	169	“ Igor , all this secrecy ... one would almost think you did n’t want visitors . ”
130838	130843	130845	130845	Karkaroff	373	“ Well , Dumbledore , ”
130856	130908	130845	130845	Karkaroff	373	“ we are all protective of our private domains , are we not ? Do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us ? Are we not right to be proud that we alone know our school ’s secrets , and right to protect them ? ”
130909	130926	130928	130928	Dumbledore	169	“ Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts ’ secrets , Igor , ”
130931	131034	130928	130928	Dumbledore	169	“ Only this morning , for instance , I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before , containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots . When I went back to investigate more closely , I discovered that the room had vanished . But I must keep an eye out for it . Possibly it is only accessible at five - thirty in the morning . Or it may only appear at the quarter moon — or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder . ”
131072	131077	131078	131078	she	383	“ Zis is nothing , ”
131093	131189	131190	131190	She	383	“ At ze Palace of Beauxbatons , we ’ ave ice sculptures all around ze dining chamber at Chreestmas . Zey do not melt , of course ... zey are like ’ uge statues of diamond , glittering around ze place . And ze food is seemply superb . And we ’ ave choirs of wood nymphs , ’ oo serenade us as we eat . We ’ ave none of zis ugly armor in ze ’ alls , and eef a poltergeist ever entaired into Beauxbatons , ’ e would be expelled like zat . ”
131245	131249	131250	131250	he	157	“ Absolutely right , ”
131267	131273	131250	131250	he	157	“ Like that . Yeah . ”
131348	131353	131344	131344	he	204	“ Hermy - own . ”
131354	131363	131364	131364	she	168	“ Her - my - oh - nee , ”
131370	131377	131344	131344	he	204	“ Herm - own - ninny . ”
131378	131382	131383	131383	she	168	“ Close enough , ”
131555	131559	131560	131560	Parvati	326	“ Come on ! ”
131563	131570	131560	131560	Parvati	326	“ We ’re supposed to dance ! ”

131815	131830	131832	131832	Harry	157	“ Oh — yeah , Dobby the house - elf knitted them for me , ”
131836	131842	131843	131843	Parvati	326	“ He is so creepy ! ”
131850	131861	131843	131843	Parvati	326	“ I do n’t think that eye should be allowed ! ”
131897	131906	131889	131889	Harry	157	“ Let ’s sit down , shall we ? ”
131907	131919	131920	131920	Parvati	326	“ Oh — but — this is a really good one ! ”
131937	131946	131947	131947	Harry	157	“ No , I do n’t like it , ”
131994	132000	132001	132001	Harry	157	“ How ’s it going ? ”
132098	132109	132110	132110	Parvati	326	“ You do n’t mind , do you , Harry ? ”
132113	132116	132118	132118	Harry	157	“ What ? ”
132128	132133	132135	132135	Parvati	326	“ Oh never mind , ”
132180	132183	132185	132185	Harry	157	“ Hi , ”
132193	132202	132207	132207	herself	168	“ It ’s hot , is n’t it ? ”
132212	132222	132207	132207	herself	168	“ Viktor ’s just gone to get some drinks . ”
132230	132233	132234	132234	he	170	“ Viktor ? ”
132237	132249	132234	132234	he	170	“ Has n’t he asked you to call him Vicky yet ? ”
132257	132264	132265	132265	she	168	“ What ’s up with you ? ”
132268	132275	132277	132277	Ron	170	“ If you do n’t know , ”
132280	132289	132277	132277	Ron	170	“ I ’m not going to tell you . ”
132302	132308	132290	132290	Hermione	168	“ Ron , what — ? ”
132309	132315	132317	132317	Ron	170	“ He ’s from Durmstrang ! ”
132319	132334	132335	132335	Ron	170	“ He ’s competing against Harry ! Against Hogwarts ! You — you ’re — ”
132350	132363	132335	132335	Ron	170	“ fraternizing with the enemy , that ’s what you ’re doing ! ”
132370	132377	132378	132378	she	168	“ Do n’t be so stupid ! ”
132384	132425	132378	132378	she	168	“ The enemy ! Honestly — who was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive ? Who was the one who wanted his autograph ? Who ’s got a model of him up in their dormitory ? ”
132432	132450	132426	132426	Ron	170	“ I s’pose he asked you to come with him while you were both in the library ? ”
132451	132457	132459	132459	Hermione	168	“ Yes , he did , ”
132471	132475	132459	132459	Hermione	168	“ So what ? ”
132476	132491	132426	132426	Ron	170	“ What happened — trying to get him to join spew , were you ? ”
132492	132539	132459	132459	Hermione	168	“ No , I was n’t ! If you really want to know , he — he said he ’d been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me , but he had n’t been able to pluck up the courage ! ”
132561	132571	132573	132573	Ron	170	“ Yeah , well — that ’s his story , ”
132576	132585	132459	132459	Hermione	168	“ And what ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
132586	132635	132636	132636	Hermione	168	“ Obvious , is n’t it ? He ’s Karkaroff ’s student , is n’t he ? He knows who you hang around with ... He ’s just trying to get closer to Harry — get inside information on him — or get near enough to jinx him — ”
132653	132672	132646	132646	she	168	“ For your information , he has n’t asked me one single thing about Harry , not one — ”
132682	132714	132673	132673	Ron	170	“ Then he ’s hoping you ’ll help him find out what his egg means ! I suppose you ’ve been putting your heads together during those cozy little library sessions — ”
132715	132726	132728	132728	Hermione	168	“ I ’d never help him work out that egg ! ”
132733	132762	132728	132728	Hermione	168	“ Never . How could you say something like that — I want Harry to win the tournament , Harry knows that , do n’t you , Harry ? ”
132763	132774	132776	132776	Ron	170	“ You ’ve got a funny way of showing it , ”
132778	132798	132800	132800	Hermione	168	“ This whole tournament ’s supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards and making friends with them ! ”
132803	132809	132811	132811	Ron	170	“ No it is n’t ! ”
132813	132819	132811	132811	Ron	170	“ It ’s about winning ! ”
132828	132831	132833	132833	Harry	157	“ Ron , ”
132836	132849	132833	132833	Harry	157	“ I have n’t got a problem with Hermione coming with Krum — ”
132856	132874	132876	132876	Ron	170	“ Why do n’t you go and find Vicky , he ’ll be wondering where you are , ”
132878	132885	132876	132876	Ron	170	“ Do n’t call him Vicky ! ”
132919	132931	132932	132932	Padma	432	“ Are you going to ask me to dance at all ? ”
132936	132939	132941	132941	Ron	170	“ No , ”
132948	132951	132953	132953	Padma	432	“ Fine , ”
132996	133005	132986	132986	he	157	“ Vare is Herm - own - ninny ? ”
133021	133025	133027	133027	Ron	170	“ No idea , ”
133035	133042	133027	133027	Ron	170	“ Lost her , have you ? ”
133049	133063	133064	133064	he	204	“ Vell , if you see her , tell her I haff drinks , ”
133072	133084	133085	133085	Percy	247	“ Made friends with Viktor Krum , have you , Ron ? ”
133099	133115	133085	133085	Percy	247	“ Excellent ! That ’s the whole point , you know — international magical cooperation ! ”
133217	133231	133232	133232	Percy	247	“ What do they think they ’re doing , annoying senior Ministry members ? ”
133241	133245	133232	133232	Percy	247	“ No respect ... ”
133271	133284	133286	133286	Percy	247	“ I hope my brothers were n’t bothering you , Mr. Bagman ? ”
133290	133302	133304	133304	Bagman	201	“ What ? Oh not at all , not at all ! ”
133306	133355	133304	133304	Bagman	201	“ No , they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs . Wondering if I could advise them on the marketing . I ’ve promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at Zonko ’s Joke Shop ... ”
133425	133451	133453	133453	he	201	“ How do you feel the tournament ’s going , Mr. Bagman ? Our department ’s quite satisfied — the hitch with the Goblet of Fire ”
133458	133482	133453	133453	he	201	“ was a little unfortunate , of course , but it seems to have gone very smoothly since , do n’t you think ? ”
133483	133487	133488	133488	Bagman	201	“ Oh yes , ”
133492	133512	133488	133488	Bagman	201	“ it ’s all been enormous fun . How ’s old Barty doing ? Shame he could n’t come . ”
133513	133529	133531	133531	Percy	247	“ Oh I ’m sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no time , ”
133534	133542	133543	133543	Ron	170	“ Let ’s go for a walk , ”
133548	133554	133543	133543	Ron	170	“ get away from Percy ... ”
133680	133694	133786	133786	Snape	387	“ ... do n’t see what there is to fuss about , Igor . ”
133695	133707	133708	133708	Karkaroff	373	“ Severus , you can not pretend this is n’t happening ! ”
133724	133747	133708	133708	Karkaroff	373	“ It ’s been getting clearer and clearer for months . I am becoming seriously concerned , I ca n’t deny it — ”
133748	133752	133754	133754	Snape	387	“ Then flee , ”
133759	133777	133754	133754	Snape	387	“ Flee — I will make your excuses . I , however , am remaining at Hogwarts . ”
133819	133827	133828	133828	Snape	387	“ Ten points from Ravenclaw , Fawcett ! ”
133837	133847	133828	133828	Snape	387	“ And ten points from Hufflepuff too , Stebbins ! ”
133856	133864	133865	133865	he	1781	“ And what are you two doing ? ”

133921	133930	133916	133916	Ron	170	“ Not against the law , is it ? ”
133931	133937	133938	133938	Snape	387	“ Keep walking , then ! ”
133970	133978	133979	133979	Ron	170	“ What ’s got Karkaroff all worried ? ”
133982	133997	133999	133999	Harry	157	“ And since when have he and Snape been on first - name terms ? ”

135240	135270	135233	135233	Ron	170	“ I always thought he ’d got in the way of a bad Engorgement Charm when he was a kid or something . Did n’t like to mention it ... ”
135271	135284	135286	135286	Harry	157	“ But what ’s it matter if his mother was a giantess ? ”
135288	135308	135310	135310	Ron	170	“ Well ... no one who knows him will care , ’cos they ’ll know he ’s not dangerous , ”
135313	135362	135310	135310	Ron	170	“ But ... Harry , they ’re just vicious , giants . It ’s like Hagrid said , it ’s in their natures , they ’re like trolls ... they just like killing , everyone knows that . There are n’t any left in Britain now , though . ”
135363	135369	135233	135233	Ron	170	“ What happened to them ? ”
135370	135405	135310	135310	Ron	170	“ Well , they were dying out anyway , and then loads got themselves killed by Aurors . There ’re supposed to be giants abroad , though ... They hide out in mountains mostly ... ”
135406	135418	135419	135419	Harry	157	“ I do n’t know who Maxime thinks she ’s kidding , ”
135437	135466	135423	135424	Madame Maxime	291	“ If Hagrid ’s half - giant , she definitely is . Big bones ... the only thing that ’s got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur . ”
135643	135648	135639	135639	someone	719	“ Hey — Harry ! ”
135667	135670	135672	135672	Harry	157	“ Yeah ? ”
135716	135719	135720	135720	Cedric	208	“ Listen ... ”
135728	135754	135720	135720	Cedric	208	“ I owe you one for telling me about the dragons . You know that golden egg ? Does yours wail when you open it ? ”
135755	135758	135760	135760	Harry	157	“ Yeah , ”
135762	135771	135720	135720	Cedric	208	“ Well ... take a bath , okay ? ”
135772	135775	135720	135720	Cedric	208	“ What ? ”
135776	135813	135720	135720	Cedric	208	“ Take a bath , and — er — take the egg with you , and — er — just mull things over in the hot water . It ’ll help you think ... Trust me . ”
135819	135824	135825	135825	Cedric	208	“ Tell you what , ”
135828	135869	135825	135825	Cedric	208	“ use the prefects ’ bathroom . Fourth door to the left of that statue of Boris the Bewildered on the fifth floor . Password ’s ‘ pine fresh . ’ Got ta go ... want to say good night — ”
135962	135966	135958	135958	Harry	157	“ Fairy lights ! ”
136017	136038	136040	136040	Hermione	168	“ Well , if you do n’t like it , you know what the solution is , do n’t you ? ”
136063	136067	136068	136068	Ron	170	“ Oh yeah ? ”
136072	136077	136068	136068	Ron	170	“ What ’s that ? ”
136078	136100	136068	136068	Ron	170	“ Next time there ’s a ball , ask me before someone else does , and not as a last resort ! ”
136133	136136	136137	136137	he	157	“ Well , ”
136143	136155	136137	136137	he	157	“ well — that just proves — completely missed the point — ”
136252	136265	136266	136266	she	168	“ but it ’s way too much bother to do every day , ”
136355	136364	136365	136365	she	168	“ Well , I thought he must be , ”
136370	136425	136365	136365	she	168	“ I knew he could n’t be pure giant because they ’re about twenty feet tall . But honestly , all this hysteria about giants . They ca n’t all be horrible ... It ’s the same sort of prejudice that people have toward werewolves ... It ’s just bigotry , is n’t it ? ”
136967	136980	136981	136981	she	3308	“ Hurry up , now , the bell rang five minutes ago , ”
136994	136999	137001	137001	Ron	170	“ Who ’re you ? ”
137007	137012	137001	137001	Ron	170	“ Where ’s Hagrid ? ”
137013	137022	137023	137023	she	3308	“ My name is Professor Grubbly - Plank , ”
137027	137038	137023	137023	she	3308	“ I am your temporary Care of Magical Creatures teacher . ”
137039	137044	137045	137045	Harry	157	“ Where ’s Hagrid ? ”
137049	137054	137056	137059	Professor Grubbly - Plank	446	“ He is indisposed , ”
137106	137112	137114	137117	Professor Grubbly - Plank	446	“ This way , please , ”
137167	137174	137175	137175	Harry	157	“ What ’s wrong with Hagrid ? ”
137188	137193	137194	137194	she	446	“ Never you mind , ”
137205	137212	137214	137214	Harry	157	“ I do mind , though , ”
137217	137224	137214	137214	Harry	157	“ What ’s up with him ? ”
137281	137284	137279	137280	the girls	1101	“ ooooohed ! ”
137292	137299	137301	137302	Lavender Brown	352	“ Oh it ’s so beautiful ! ”
137304	137321	137301	137302	Lavender Brown	352	“ How did she get it ? They ’re supposed to be really hard to catch ! ”
137354	137359	137361	137364	Professor Grubbly - Plank	446	“ Boys keep back ! ”
137378	137405	137372	137372	Harry	157	“ They prefer the woman ’s touch , unicorns . Girls to the front , and approach with care , come on , easy does it ... ”
137444	137461	137442	137442	Ron	170	“ What d’you reckon ’s wrong with him ? You do n’t think a skrewt — ? ”
137462	137480	137482	137482	Malfoy	256	“ Oh he has n’t been attacked , Potter , if that ’s what you ’re thinking , ”
137485	137501	137482	137482	Malfoy	256	“ No , he ’s just too ashamed to show his big , ugly face . ”
137502	137507	137509	137509	Harry	157	“ What d’you mean ? ”
137531	137536	137537	137537	he	256	“ There you go , ”
137540	137550	137537	137537	he	256	“ Hate to break it to you , Potter ... ”
137594	137602	137603	137603	he	256	“ I was just having some fun , ”
137627	137634	137635	137635	he	157	“ How did she find out ? ”
137647	137659	137660	137660	Harry	157	“ What d’you mean , ‘ we all hate Hagrid ’ ? ”
137665	137672	137674	137674	he	157	“ What ’s this rubbish about him ”
137679	137695	137674	137674	he	157	“ getting a bad bite off a flobberworm ? They have n’t even got teeth ! ”
137706	137723	137725	137725	Malfoy	256	“ Well , I think this should put an end to the oaf ’s teaching career , ”
137731	137784	137727	137727	his	256	“ Half - giant ... and there was me thinking he ’d just swallowed a bottle of Skele - Gro when he was young ... None of the mummies and daddies are going to like this at all ... They ’ll be worried he ’ll eat their kids , ha , ha ... ”
137785	137789	137727	137727	his	256	“ You — . ”
137790	137798	137727	137727	his	256	“ Are you paying attention over there ? ”
137871	137880	137882	137883	Parvati Patil	326	“ I hope she stays , that woman ! ”
137901	137924	137882	137883	Parvati Patil	326	“ That ’s more what I thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like ... proper creatures like unicorns , not monsters ... ”
137925	137930	137931	137931	Harry	157	“ What about Hagrid ? ”
137941	137946	137948	137948	Parvati	326	“ What about him ? ”
137954	137965	137948	137948	Parvati	326	“ He can still be gamekeeper , ca n’t he ? ”
138031	138039	138041	138041	Hermione	168	“ That was a really good lesson , ”
138049	138066	138041	138041	Hermione	168	“ I did n’t know half the things Professor Grubbly - Plank told us about uni — ”
138067	138072	138077	138077	he	157	“ Look at this ! ”
138107	138125	138077	138077	he	157	“ How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out ? You do n’t think Hagrid told her ? ”
138126	138129	138131	138131	Harry	157	“ No , ”
138150	138187	138143	138143	himself	157	“ He never even told us , did he ? I reckon she was so mad he would n’t give her loads of horrible stuff about me , she went ferreting around to get him back . ”
138188	138200	138202	138202	Hermione	168	“ Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball , ”
138205	138215	138217	138217	Ron	170	“ We ’d have seen her in the garden ! ”
138219	138238	138217	138217	Ron	170	“ Anyway , she ’s not supposed to come into school anymore , Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her ... ”
138239	138248	138250	138250	Harry	157	“ Maybe she ’s got an Invisibility Cloak , ”
138266	138285	138250	138250	Harry	157	“ Sort of thing she ’d do , is n’t it , hide in bushes listening to people . ”
138286	138296	138298	138298	Hermione	168	“ Like you and Ron did , you mean , ”
138300	138309	138311	138311	Ron	170	“ We were n’t trying to hear him ! ”
138314	138338	138311	138311	Ron	170	“ We did n’t have any choice ! The stupid prat , talking about his giantess mother where anyone could have heard him ! ”
138339	138349	138351	138351	Harry	157	“ We ’ve got to go and see him , ”
138353	138373	138374	138374	he	157	“ This evening , after Divination . Tell him we want him back ... you do want him back ? ”
138379	138421	138422	138422	Hermione	168	“ I — well , I ’m not going to pretend it did n’t make a nice change , having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once — but I do want Hagrid back , of course I do ! ”
138470	138477	138478	138478	Harry	157	“ Hagrid , it ’s us ! ”
138486	138490	138478	138478	Harry	157	“ Open up ! ”
138539	138547	138548	138548	Hermione	168	“ What ’s he avoiding us for ? ”
138564	138580	138548	138548	Hermione	168	“ He surely does n’t think we ’d care about him being half - giant ? ”
138648	138656	138657	138657	he	256	“ Missing your half - breed pal ? ”
138679	138686	138657	138657	he	256	“ Missing the elephant - man ? ”
138707	138724	138725	138725	she	168	“ I just thought you ’d want to take advantage of the common room being quiet , ”
138728	138737	138725	138725	she	168	“ Really get to work on that egg . ”
138738	138757	138758	138758	Harry	157	“ Oh I — I reckon I ’ve got a pretty good idea what it ’s about now , ”
138761	138766	138768	138768	Hermione	168	“ Have you really ? ”
138773	138777	138768	138768	Hermione	168	“ Well done ! ”
138926	138931	138933	138933	Harry	157	“ He ’s mad ! ”
138952	138962	138933	138933	Harry	157	“ It must be freezing , it ’s January ! ”
138963	138974	138976	138976	Hermione	168	“ It ’s a lot colder where he comes from , ”
138978	138988	138976	138976	Hermione	168	“ I suppose it feels quite warm to him . ”
138989	139000	139002	139002	Ron	170	“ Yeah , but there ’s still the giant squid , ”
139026	139035	139036	139036	she	168	“ He ’s really nice , you know , ”
139039	139065	139036	139036	she	168	“ He ’s not at all like you ’d think , coming from Durmstrang . He likes it much better here , he told me . ”
139223	139233	139234	139234	Hermione	168	“ Does n’t he ever go into the office ? ”
139238	139241	139234	139234	Hermione	168	“ Look ! ”
139378	139387	139390	139390	him	201	“ In a moment , in a moment ! ”
139413	139416	139417	139417	he	201	“ Harry ! ”
139420	139437	139417	139417	he	201	“ How are you ? Been hoping to run into you ! Everything going all right ? ”
139438	139443	139445	139445	Harry	157	“ Fine , thanks , ”
139447	139461	139463	139463	Bagman	201	“ Wonder if I could have a quick , private word , Harry ? ”
139466	139481	139463	139463	Bagman	201	“ You could n’t give us a moment , you two , could you ? ”
139482	139487	139489	139489	Ron	170	“ Er — okay , ”
139516	139537	139539	139539	Bagman	201	“ Well , I just thought I ’d congratulate you again on your splendid performance against that Horntail , Harry , ”
139541	139545	139539	139539	Bagman	201	“ Really superb . ”
139546	139549	139551	139551	Harry	157	“ Thanks , ”
139625	139629	139631	139631	Bagman	201	“ Absolute nightmare , ”
139653	139659	139660	139660	Harry	157	“ What do they want ? ”
139674	139679	139681	139681	Bagman	201	“ Er — well ... ”
139687	139699	139681	139681	Bagman	201	“ They ... er ... they ’re looking for Barty Crouch . ”
139700	139709	139711	139711	Harry	157	“ Why are they looking for him here ? ”
139713	139726	139711	139711	Harry	157	“ He ’s at the Ministry in London , is n’t he ? ”
139727	139744	139746	139746	Bagman	201	“ Er ... as a matter of fact , I ’ve no idea where he is , ”
139748	139840	139746	139746	Bagman	201	“ He ’s sort of ... stopped coming to work . Been absent for a couple of weeks now . Young Percy , his assistant , says he ’s ill . Apparently he ’s just been sending instructions in by owl . But would you mind not mentioning that to anyone , Harry ? Because Rita Skeeter ’s still poking around everywhere she can , and I ’m willing to bet she ’d work up Barty ’s illness into something sinister . Probably say he ’s gone missing like Bertha Jorkins . ”
139841	139850	139851	139851	Harry	157	“ Have you heard anything about Bertha Jorkins ? ”
139854	139857	139859	139859	Bagman	201	“ No , ”
139865	139875	139859	139859	Bagman	201	“ I ’ve got people looking , of course ... ”
139883	139976	139978	139978	he	3365	“ and it ’s all very strange . She definitely arrived in Albania , because she met her second cousin there . And then she left the cousin ’s house to go south and see an aunt ... and she seems to have vanished without trace en route . Blowed if I can see where she ’s got to ... she does n’t seem the type to elope , for instance ... but still ... What are we doing , talking about goblins and Bertha Jorkins ? I really wanted to ask you ”
139983	139994	139980	139980	his	3365	“ how are you getting on with your golden egg ? ”
139995	140001	140002	140002	Harry	157	“ Er ... not bad , ”
140016	140021	140022	140022	he	201	“ Listen , Harry , ”
140033	140059	140061	140061	his	201	“ I feel very bad about all this ... you were thrown into this tournament , you did n’t volunteer for it ... and if ... ”
140076	140115	140061	140061	his	201	“ if I can help at all ... a prod in the right direction ... I ’ve taken a liking to you ... the way you got past that dragon ! ... well , just say the word . ”
140135	140150	140151	140151	he	157	“ We ’re supposed to work out the clues alone , are n’t we ? ”
140183	140190	140192	140192	Bagman	201	“ Well ... well , yes , ”
140195	140214	140192	140192	Bagman	201	“ but — come on , Harry — we all want a Hogwarts victory , do n’t we ? ”
140215	140222	140223	140223	Harry	157	“ Have you offered Cedric help ? ”
140236	140243	140244	140244	he	157	“ No , I have n’t , ”
140247	140270	140244	140244	he	157	“ I — well , like I say , I ’ve taken a liking to you . Just thought I ’d offer ... ”
140271	140276	140278	140278	Harry	157	“ Well , thanks , ”
140280	140299	140278	140278	Harry	157	“ but I think I ’m nearly there with the egg ... couple more days should crack it . ”
140366	140372	140374	140374	Fred	174	“ Hello , Mr. Bagman , ”
140377	140385	140374	140374	Fred	174	“ Can we buy you a drink ? ”
140386	140391	140393	140393	Bagman	201	“ Er ... no , ”
140403	140411	140393	140393	Bagman	201	“ no , thank you , boys ... ”
140435	140442	140443	140443	he	201	“ Well , I must dash , ”
140446	140457	140443	140443	he	201	“ Nice seeing you all . Good luck , Harry . ”
140485	140491	140492	140492	Ron	170	“ What did he want ? ”
140502	140513	140515	140515	Harry	157	“ He offered to help me with the golden egg , ”
140517	140525	140527	140527	Hermione	168	“ He should n’t be doing that ! ”
140533	140555	140527	140527	Hermione	168	“ He ’s one of the judges ! And anyway , you ’ve already worked it out — have n’t you ? ”
140556	140561	140563	140563	Harry	157	“ Er ... nearly , ”
140565	140588	140590	140590	Hermione	168	“ Well , I do n’t think Dumbledore would like it if he knew Bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat ! ”
140597	140609	140590	140590	Hermione	168	“ I hope he ’s trying to help Cedric as much ! ”
140610	140618	140620	140620	Harry	157	“ He ’s not , I asked , ”
140622	140631	140633	140633	Ron	170	“ Who cares if Diggory ’s getting help ? ”
140639	140648	140650	140650	Hermione	168	“ Those goblins did n’t look very friendly , ”
140656	140663	140650	140650	Hermione	168	“ What were they doing here ? ”
140664	140673	140675	140675	Harry	157	“ Looking for Crouch , according to Bagman , ”
140677	140689	140675	140675	Harry	157	“ He ’s still ill . Has n’t been into work . ”
140690	140697	140699	140699	Ron	170	“ Maybe Percy ’s poisoning him , ”
140701	140721	140699	140699	Ron	170	“ Probably thinks if Crouch snuffs it he ’ll be made Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation . ”
140742	140767	140722	140722	Hermione	168	“ Funny , goblins looking for Mr. Crouch ... They ’d normally deal with the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures . ”
140768	140779	140781	140781	Harry	157	“ Crouch can speak loads of different languages , though , ”
140783	140790	140781	140781	Harry	157	“ Maybe they need an interpreter . ”
140791	140804	140805	140805	Ron	170	“ Worrying about poor ’ ickle goblins , now , are you ? ”
140809	140826	140805	140805	Ron	170	“ Thinking of starting up S.P.U.G. or something ? Society for the Protection of Ugly Goblins ? ”
140827	140834	140836	140836	Hermione	168	“ Ha , ha , ha , ”
140839	140863	140836	140836	Hermione	168	“ Goblins do n’t need protection . Have n’t you been listening to what Professor Binns has been telling us about goblin rebellions ? ”
140864	140867	140869	140869	Harry	157	“ No , ”
140874	140886	140888	140888	Hermione	168	“ Well , they ’re quite capable of dealing with wizards , ”
140896	140917	140888	140888	Hermione	168	“ They ’re very clever . They ’re not like house - elves , who never stick up for themselves . ”
140918	140923	140925	140925	Ron	170	“ Uh - oh , ”
141008	141113	140997	140997	She	302	“ ... did n’t seem very keen to talk to us , did he , Bozo ? Now , why would that be , do you think ? And what ’s he doing with a pack of goblins in tow anyway ? Showing them the sights ... what nonsense ... he was always a bad liar . Reckon something ’s up ? Think we should do a bit of digging ? ‘ Disgraced Ex - Head of Magical Games and Sports , Ludo Bagman ... ’ Snappy start to a sentence , Bozo — we just need to find a story to fit it — ”
141114	141123	141125	141125	Harry	157	“ Trying to ruin someone else ’s life ? ”
141150	141153	141154	141154	she	302	“ Harry ! ”
141159	141172	141154	141154	she	302	“ How lovely ! Why do n’t you come and join — ? ”
141173	141187	141189	141189	Harry	157	“ I would n’t come near you with a ten - foot broomstick , ”
141192	141204	141189	141189	Harry	157	“ What did you do that to Hagrid for , eh ? ”
141213	141231	141208	141208	her	302	“ Our readers have a right to the truth , Harry . I am merely doing my — ”
141232	141242	141243	141243	Harry	157	“ Who cares if he ’s half - giant ? ”
141246	141254	141243	141243	Harry	157	“ There ’s nothing wrong with him ! ”
141326	141364	141306	141306	she	302	“ How about giving me an interview about the Hagrid you know , Harry ? The man behind the muscles ? Your unlikely friendship and the reasons behind it . Would you call him a father substitute ? ”
141384	141389	141390	141390	she	302	“ You horrible woman , ”
141397	141424	141390	141390	she	302	“ you do n’t care , do you , anything for a story , and anyone will do , wo n’t they ? Even Ludo Bagman — ”
141425	141445	141451	141451	her	302	“ Sit down , you silly little girl , and do n’t talk about things you do n’t understand , ”
141460	141480	141481	141481	she	302	“ I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl ... not that it needs it — ”
141490	141495	141497	141497	Hermione	168	“ Let ’s go , ”
141499	141507	141497	141497	Hermione	168	“ c’m on , Harry — Ron ... ”
141555	141565	141567	141567	Ron	170	“ She ’ll be after you next , Hermione , ”

141599	141628	141593	141593	she	168	“ I ’ll show her ! Silly little girl , am I ? Oh , I ’ll get her back for this . First Harry , then Hagrid ... ”
141629	141640	141642	141642	Ron	170	“ You do n’t want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter , ”
141645	141660	141642	141642	Ron	170	“ I ’m serious , Hermione , she ’ll dig up something on you — ”
141661	141679	141681	141681	Hermione	168	“ My parents do n’t read the Daily Prophet . She ca n’t scare me into hiding ! ”
141725	141750	141716	141716	she	168	“ And Hagrid is n’t hiding anymore ! He should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him ! Come on ! ”
141801	141804	141805	141805	Hermione	168	“ Hagrid ! ”
141814	141863	141805	141805	Hermione	168	“ Hagrid , that ’s enough ! We know you ’re in there ! Nobody cares if your mum was a giantess , Hagrid ! You ca n’t let that foul Skeeter woman do this to you ! Hagrid , get out here , you ’re just being — ”
141871	141876	141868	141868	Hermione	168	“ About t — ! ”
141904	141908	141909	141909	he	169	“ Good afternoon , ”
141918	141929	141931	141931	Hermione	168	“ We — er — we wanted to see Hagrid , ”
141938	141946	141948	141948	Dumbledore	169	“ Yes , I surmised as much , ”
141954	141962	141950	141950	his	169	“ Why do n’t you come in ? ”
141963	141970	141972	141972	Hermione	168	“ Oh ... um ... okay , ”
142075	142080	142082	142082	Harry	157	“ Hi , Hagrid , ”
142088	142092	142093	142093	he	180	“ ’ Lo , ”
142101	142108	142110	142110	Dumbledore	169	“ More tea , I think , ”
142170	142185	142167	142167	Dumbledore	169	“ Did you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was shouting , Hagrid ? ”
142199	142227	142192	142192	Dumbledore	169	“ Hermione , Harry , and Ron still seem to want to know you , judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door . ”
142228	142238	142239	142239	Harry	157	“ Of course we still want to know you ! ”
142246	142260	142261	142261	he	157	“ You do n’t think anything that Skeeter cow — sorry , Professor , ”
142269	142286	142288	142288	Dumbledore	169	“ I have gone temporarily deaf and have n’t any idea what you said , Harry , ”
142299	142304	142306	142306	Harry	157	“ Er — right , ”
142309	142332	142306	142306	Harry	157	“ I just meant — Hagrid , how could you think we ’d care what that — woman — wrote about you ? ”
142353	142366	142368	142368	Dumbledore	169	“ Living proof of what I ’ve been telling you , Hagrid , ”
142378	142419	142368	142368	Dumbledore	169	“ I have shown you the letters from the countless parents who remember you from their own days here , telling me in no uncertain terms that if I sacked you , they would have something to say about it — ”
142420	142426	142428	142428	Hagrid	180	“ Not all of ’em , ”
142431	142442	142428	142428	Hagrid	180	“ Not all of ’em wan ’ me ter stay . ”
142443	142472	142474	142474	Dumbledore	169	“ Really , Hagrid , if you are holding out for universal popularity , I ’m afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time , ”
142486	142534	142474	142474	Dumbledore	169	“ Not a week has passed since I became headmaster of this school when I have n’t had at least one owl complaining about the way I run it . But what should I do ? Barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybody ? ”
142535	142544	142546	142546	Hagrid	180	“ Yeh — yeh’re not half - giant ! ”
142549	142560	142561	142561	Harry	157	“ Hagrid , look what I ’ve got for relatives ! ”
142565	142571	142561	142561	Harry	157	“ Look at the Dursleys ! ”
142572	142577	142579	142580	Professor Dumbledore	169	“ An excellent point , ”
142582	142650	142579	142580	Professor Dumbledore	169	“ My own brother , Aberforth , was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat . It was all over the papers , but did Aberforth hide ? No , he did not ! He held his head high and went about his business as usual ! Of course , I ’m not entirely sure he can read , so that may not have been bravery ... ”
142651	142659	142661	142661	Hermione	168	“ Come back and teach , Hagrid , ”
142664	142674	142661	142661	Hermione	168	“ please come back , we really miss you . ”

142834	142838	142840	142840	Hagrid	180	“ Help yerself , ”

143002	143015	143016	143016	Hagrid	180	“ Tha ’ was taken jus ’ after I got inter Hogwarts , ”

Yeh don ’ have ter be ashamed of what yeh are . It ’d show ’em Dumbledore ’s the one who ’s got it righ ’ , lettin ’ anyone in as long as they can do magic . How you doin’ with that egg , Harry ? ”

144898	144901	144903	144903	Myrtle	431	“ Sometimes , ”

145329	145338	145339	145339	she	431	“ Well , that ’s what Diggory thought , ”
145342	145365	145339	145339	she	431	“ He lay there talking to himself for ages about it . Ages and ages ... nearly all the bubbles had gone ... ”

145399	145425	145396	145396	she	431	“ I sometimes go down there ... sometimes do n’t have any choice , if someone flushes my toilet when I ’m not expecting it ... ”
145450	145465	145447	145447	Harry	157	“ Well , does anything in there have a human voice ? Hang on — ”

146985	147021	146981	146981	he	375	“ I ’m coming to get you , Peeves ... You ’ve gone and stolen a Triwizard clue , Peeves ... Dumbledore’ll have you out of here for this , you filthy , pilfering poltergeist ... ”

147250	147260	147238	147238	Snape	387	“ But Peeves could n’t get into my office ... ”
147261	147271	147306	147306	Snape	387	“ This egg was in your office , Professor ? ”
147272	147277	147278	147278	Snape	387	“ Of course not , ”
147281	147288	147278	147278	Snape	387	“ I heard banging and wailing — ”
147289	147295	147306	147306	Snape	387	“ But Peeves could n’t — ”
147296	147305	147306	147306	Snape	387	“ I know he could n’t , Filch ! ”
147310	147325	147306	147306	Snape	387	“ I seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break ! ”
147344	147360	147326	147326	Snape	387	“ I want you to come and help me search for the intruder , Filch . ”
147361	147370	147306	147306	Snape	387	“ I — yes , Professor — but — ”
147444	147451	147453	147453	Filch	375	“ The thing is , Professor , ”
147456	147494	147453	147453	Filch	375	“ the headmaster will have to listen to me this time . Peeves has been stealing from a student , it might be my chance to get him thrown out of the castle once and for all — ”
147495	147516	147553	147553	Moody	294	“ Filch , I do n’t give a damn about that wretched poltergeist ; it ’s my office that ’s — ”
147571	147578	147579	147579	he	294	“ Pajama party , is it ? ”
147585	147595	147597	147597	Filch	375	“ Professor Snape and I heard noises , Professor , ”
147601	147625	147597	147597	Filch	375	“ Peeves the Poltergeist , throwing things around as usual — and then Professor Snape discovered that someone had broken into his off — ”
147626	147630	147631	147631	Snape	331	“ Shut up ! ”
147755	147764	147765	147765	he	294	“ Did I hear that correctly , Snape ? ”
147769	147776	147765	147765	he	294	“ Someone broke into your office ? ”
147777	147782	147784	147784	Snape	331	“ It is unimportant , ”
147787	147792	147794	147794	Moody	294	“ On the contrary , ”
147796	147811	147794	147794	Moody	294	“ it is very important . Who ’d want to break into your office ? ”
147812	147819	147821	147821	Snape	331	“ A student , I daresay , ”
147836	147861	147794	147794	Moody	294	“ It has happened before . Potion ingredients have gone missing from my private store cupboard ... students attempting illicit mixtures , no doubt ... ”
147862	147872	147874	147874	Moody	294	“ Reckon they were after potion ingredients , eh ? ”
147876	147888	147874	147874	Moody	294	“ Not hiding anything else in your office , are you ? ”
147913	147923	147924	147924	he	331	“ You know I ’m hiding nothing , Moody , ”
147933	147944	147924	147924	he	331	“ as you ’ve searched my office pretty thoroughly yourself . ”
147953	147968	147945	147945	Moody	294	“ Auror ’s privilege , Snape . Dumbledore told me to keep an eye — ”
147969	147976	147978	147978	Snape	331	“ Dumbledore happens to trust me , ”
147983	147998	147978	147978	Snape	331	“ I refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my office ! ”
147999	148006	148008	148008	Moody	294	“ ’ Course Dumbledore trusts you , ”
148010	148054	148008	148008	Moody	294	“ He ’s a trusting man , is n’t he ? Believes in second chances . But me — I say there are spots that do n’t come off , Snape . Spots that never come off , d’you know what I mean ? ”
148085	148093	148082	148082	Moody	294	“ Get back to bed , Snape . ”
148094	148106	148107	148107	Snape	331	“ You do n’t have the authority to send me anywhere ! ”
148121	148137	148107	148107	Snape	331	“ I have as much right to prowl this school after dark as you do ! ”
148138	148142	148144	148144	Moody	294	“ Prowl away , ”
148154	148177	148147	148147	his	294	“ I look forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some time ... You ’ve dropped something , by the way ... ”
148240	148247	148222	148222	he	157	“ It ’s mine ! Mine ! ”
148265	148269	148248	148248	Snape	331	“ Accio Parchment ! ”
148295	148299	148300	148300	Moody	294	“ My mistake , ”
148304	148315	148300	148300	Moody	294	“ It ’s mine — must ’ve dropped it earlier — ”
148355	148358	148359	148359	he	294	“ Potter , ”
148363	148368	148370	148370	Moody	294	“ What ’s that ? ”
148381	148384	148385	148385	Snape	331	“ Potter ! ”
148412	148449	148406	148406	he	294	“ That egg is Potter ’s egg . That piece of parchment belongs to Potter . I have seen it before , I recognize it ! Potter is here ! Potter , in his Invisibility Cloak ! ”
148503	148511	148513	148513	Moody	294	“ There ’s nothing there , Snape ! ”
148515	148534	148513	148513	Moody	294	“ but I ’ll be happy to tell the headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to Harry Potter ! ”
148535	148539	148540	148540	Snape	331	“ Meaning what ? ”
148559	148577	148579	148579	Moody	294	“ Meaning that Dumbledore ’s very interested to know who ’s got it in for that boy ! ”
148591	148602	148579	148579	Moody	294	“ And so am I , Snape ... very interested ... ”
148666	148671	148673	148673	Snape	331	“ I merely thought , ”
148682	148713	148673	148673	Snape	331	“ that if Potter was wandering around after hours again ... it ’s an unfortunate habit of his ... he should be stopped . For — for his own safety . ”
148714	148720	148722	148722	Moody	294	“ Ah , I see , ”
148725	148737	148722	148722	Moody	294	“ Got Potter ’s best interests at heart , have you ? ”
148779	148789	148790	148790	Snape	331	“ I think I will go back to bed , ”
148794	148803	148805	148805	Moody	294	“ Best idea you ’ve had all night , ”
148807	148821	148805	148805	Moody	294	“ Now , Filch , if you ’ll just give me that egg — ”
148822	148825	148827	148827	Filch	375	“ No ! ”
148840	148852	148827	148827	Filch	375	“ Professor Moody , this is evidence of Peeves ’ treachery ! ”
148853	148866	148868	148868	Moody	344	“ It ’s the property of the champion he stole it from , ”
148870	148877	148868	148868	Moody	344	“ Hand it over , now . ”
148944	148967	148941	148942	Mrs. Norris	455	“ Never mind , my sweet ... we ’ll see Dumbledore in the morning ... tell him what Peeves was up to ... ”
149004	149010	149011	149011	he	344	“ Close shave , Potter , ”
149014	149023	149025	149025	Harry	157	“ Yeah ... I — er ... thanks , ”
149028	149034	149036	149036	Moody	344	“ What is this thing ? ”
149051	149056	149058	149058	Harry	157	“ Map of Hogwarts , ”
149080	149085	149086	149086	Moody	344	“ Merlin ’s beard , ”
149100	149110	149086	149086	Moody	344	“ This ... this is some map , Potter ! ”
149111	149120	149121	149121	Harry	157	“ Yeah , it ’s ... quite useful , ”
149134	149148	149121	149121	Harry	157	“ Er — Professor Moody , d’you think you could help me — ? ”
149149	149161	149162	149162	Moody	344	“ What ? Oh ! Yes ... yes , of course ... ”
149199	149202	149203	149203	he	344	“ Potter ... ”
149207	149236	149203	149203	he	344	“ you did n’t happen , by any chance , to see who broke into Snape ’s office , did you ? On this map , I mean ? ”
149237	149245	149246	149246	Harry	157	“ Er ... yeah , I did ... ”
149249	149255	149246	149246	Harry	157	“ It was Mr. Crouch . ”
149274	149277	149278	149278	he	344	“ Crouch ? ”
149281	149291	149278	149278	he	344	“ You ’re — you ’re sure , Potter ? ”
149292	149295	149297	149297	Harry	157	“ Positive , ”
149299	149308	149310	149310	Moody	344	“ Well , he ’s not here anymore , ”
149320	149330	149310	149310	Moody	344	“ Crouch ... that ’s very — very interesting ... ”
149390	149409	149378	149378	Moody	344	“ Er ... Professor Moody ... why d’you reckon Mr. Crouch wanted to look around Snape ’s office ? ”
149457	149465	149466	149466	Moody	344	“ Put it this way , Potter , ”
149470	149496	149466	149466	Moody	344	“ they say old Mad - Eye ’s obsessed with catching Dark wizards ... but I ’m nothing — nothing — compared to Barty Crouch . ”
149512	149516	149517	149517	he	157	“ Professor Moody ? ”
149521	149543	149517	149517	he	157	“ D’you think ... could this have anything to do with ... maybe Mr. Crouch thinks there ’s something going on ... ”
149544	149548	149550	149550	Moody	344	“ Like what ? ”
149587	149593	149594	149594	Harry	157	“ I do n’t know , ”
149597	149632	149594	149594	Harry	157	“ odd stuff ’s been happening lately , has n’t it ? It ’s been in the Daily Prophet ... the Dark Mark at the World Cup , and the Death Eaters and everything ... ”
149641	149650	149651	149651	he	157	“ You ’re a sharp boy , Potter , ”
149665	149674	149675	149675	he	344	“ Crouch could be thinking along those lines , ”
149679	149714	149675	149675	he	344	“ Very possible ... there have been some funny rumors flying around lately — helped along by Rita Skeeter , of course . It ’s making a lot of people nervous , I reckon . ”
149723	149733	149734	149734	he	344	“ Oh if there ’s one thing I hate , ”
149760	149770	149734	149734	he	344	“ it ’s a Death Eater who walked free ... ”
149786	149799	149801	149801	Moody	344	“ And now I want to ask you a question , Potter , ”
149892	149898	149890	149890	himself	157	“ Can I borrow this ? ”
149899	149902	149904	149904	Harry	157	“ Oh ! ”
149947	149952	149941	149941	he	157	“ Yeah , okay . ”
149953	149957	149959	149959	Moody	344	“ Good boy , ”
149961	149992	149959	149959	Moody	344	“ I can make good use of this ... this might be exactly what I ’ve been looking for ... Right , bed , Potter , come on , now ... ”
150045	150058	150037	150037	he	344	“ You ever thought of a career as an Auror , Potter ? ”
150059	150062	150064	150064	Harry	157	“ No , ”
150069	150076	150078	150078	Moody	344	“ You want to consider it , ”
150087	150110	150078	150078	Moody	344	“ Yes , indeed ... and incidentally ... I ’m guessing you were n’t just taking that egg for a walk tonight ? ”
150111	150116	150118	150118	Harry	157	“ Er — no , ”
150122	150131	150118	150118	Harry	157	“ I ’ve been working out the clue . ”
150144	150163	150164	150164	He	344	“ Nothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas , Potter ... See you in the morning ... ”
150311	150323	150325	150325	Hermione	168	“ You said you ’d already worked out that egg clue ! ”
150328	150334	150336	150336	Harry	157	“ Keep your voice down ! ”
150339	150355	150336	150336	Harry	157	“ I just need to — sort of fine - tune it , all right ? ”
150480	150492	150493	150493	Harry	157	“ Just forget the egg for a minute , all right ? ”
150512	150524	150496	150497	Professor Flitwick	328	“ I ’m trying to tell you about Snape and Moody ... ”
150569	150580	150581	150581	Ron	170	“ Snape said Moody ’s searched his office as well ? ”
150614	150633	150590	150590	he	170	“ What ... d’you reckon Moody ’s here to keep an eye on Snape as well as Karkaroff ? ”
150634	150656	150658	150658	Harry	157	“ Well , I dunno if that ’s what Dumbledore asked him to do , but he ’s definitely doing it , ”
150683	150703	150661	150661	his	157	“ Moody said Dumbledore only lets Snape stay here because he ’s giving him a second chance or something ... ”
150704	150707	150709	150709	Ron	170	“ What ? ”
150737	150753	150733	150733	Flitwick	328	“ Harry ... maybe Moody thinks Snape put your name in the Goblet of Fire ! ”
150754	150758	150760	150760	Hermione	168	“ Oh Ron , ”
150767	150791	150763	150763	her	168	“ we thought Snape was trying to kill Harry before , and it turned out he was saving Harry ’s life , remember ? ”
150893	150902	150903	150903	Hermione	168	“ I do n’t care what Moody says , ”
150907	150952	150903	150903	Hermione	168	“ Dumbledore ’s not stupid . He was right to trust Hagrid and Professor Lupin , even though loads of people would n’t have given them jobs , so why should n’t he be right about Snape , even if Snape is a bit — ”
150953	150957	150959	150959	Ron	170	“ — evil , ”
150962	150981	150959	150959	Ron	170	“ Come on , Hermione , why are all these Dark wizard catchers searching his office , then ? ”
150982	150993	150995	150995	Hermione	168	“ Why has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill ? ”
151000	151040	150995	150995	Hermione	168	“ It ’s a bit funny , is n’t it , that he ca n’t manage to come to the Yule Ball , but he can get up here in the middle of the night when he wants to ? ”
151041	151055	151057	151057	Ron	170	“ You just do n’t like Crouch because of that elf , Winky , ”
151067	151079	151081	151081	Hermione	168	“ You just want to think Snape ’s up to something , ”
151092	151114	151116	151116	Harry	157	“ I just want to know what Snape did with his first chance , if he ’s on his second one , ”
151322	151342	151343	151343	Hermione	168	“ Of course , the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into a submarine or something , ”
151346	151384	151343	151343	Hermione	168	“ If only we ’d done human Transfiguration already ! But I do n’t think we start that until sixth year , and it can go badly wrong if you do n’t know what you ’re doing ... ”
151385	151403	151405	151405	Harry	157	“ Yeah , I do n’t fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head , ”
151407	151427	151405	151405	Harry	157	“ I s’pose I could always attack someone in front of Moody ; he might do it for me ... ”
151428	151448	151450	151450	Hermione	168	“ I do n’t think he ’d let you choose what you wanted to be turned into , though , ”
151453	151467	151450	151450	Hermione	168	“ No , I think your best chance is some sort of charm . ”
151825	151830	151832	151832	Hermione	168	“ Weekend after next , ”
151844	151858	151832	151832	Hermione	168	“ Here — take my quill and send this owl back straight away . ”
151924	151938	151940	151940	Ron	170	“ What ’s he want to know about the next Hogsmeade weekend for ? ”
151942	151945	151947	151947	Harry	157	“ Dunno , ”
151967	151976	151947	151947	Harry	157	“ Come on ... Care of Magical Creatures . ”
152123	152126	152128	152128	Hagrid	180	“ Harry , ”

Merchieftainess Murcus has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake , and we have therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions , as follows ... Fleur Delacour , though she demonstrated excellent use of the Bubble - Head Charm , was attacked by grindylows as she approached her goal , and failed to retrieve her hostage . We award her twenty - five points . ”
159622	159627	159633	159633	her	383	“ I deserved zero , ”
159637	159671	159675	159679	the Hufflepuffs in the crowd	3706	“ Cedric Diggory , who also used the Bubble - Head Charm , was first to return with his hostage , though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour . ”
159690	159700	159683	159683	Cho	232	“ We therefore award him forty - seven points . ”

159774	159829	159771	159771	Bagman	201	“ He returned last , and well outside the time limit of an hour . However , the Merchieftainess informs us that Mr. Potter was first to reach the hostages , and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety , not merely his own . ”
159845	159851	159855	159855	Bagman	201	“ Most of the judges , ”
159863	159887	159855	159855	Bagman	201	“ feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks . However ... Mr. Potter ’s score is forty - five points . ”

160596	160602	160593	160593	Harry	157	“ if he ’s caught ... ”
160603	160615	160617	160617	Ron	170	“ Made it so far , though , has n’t he ? ”
160619	160633	160617	160617	Ron	170	“ And it ’s not like the place is swarming with dementors anymore . ”
160747	160756	160757	160757	she	398	“ There they are , there they are ! ”
160809	160822	160823	160823	Pansy	398	“ You might find something to interest you in there , Granger ! ”
160941	160947	160949	160950	Pansy Parkinson	398	“ She ’s really ugly , ”
160961	160989	160949	160950	Pansy Parkinson	398	“ but she ’d be well up to making a Love Potion , she ’s quite brainy . I think that ’s how she ’s doing it . ”
161039	161044	161045	161045	Ron	170	“ I told you ! ”
161057	161082	161045	161045	Ron	170	“ I told you not to annoy Rita Skeeter ! She ’s made you out to be some sort of — of scarlet woman ! ”
161092	161096	161097	161097	she	168	“ Scarlet woman ? ”
161111	161120	161121	161121	Ron	170	“ It ’s what my mum calls them , ”
161129	161145	161153	161153	she	168	“ If that ’s the best Rita can do , she ’s losing her touch , ”
161164	161172	161153	161153	she	168	“ What a pile of old rubbish . ”
161233	161241	161243	161243	Hermione	168	“ There ’s something funny , though , ”
161259	161268	161243	161243	Hermione	168	“ How could Rita Skeeter have known ... ? ”
161269	161273	161275	161275	Ron	170	“ Known what ? ”
161278	161291	161275	161275	Ron	170	“ You have n’t been mixing up Love Potions , have you ? ”
161292	161298	161299	161299	Hermione	168	“ Do n’t be stupid , ”
161310	161331	161306	161306	her	168	“ No , it ’s just ... how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer ? ”
161346	161349	161351	161351	Ron	170	“ What ? ”
161361	161376	161377	161377	Hermione	168	“ He asked me right after he ’d pulled me out of the lake , ”
161380	161434	161377	161377	Hermione	168	“ After he ’d got rid of his shark ’s head . Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they would n’t hear , and he said , if I was n’t doing anything over the summer , would I like to — ”
161435	161442	161444	161444	Ron	170	“ And what did you say ? ”
161475	161491	161492	161492	Hermione	168	“ And he did say he ’d never felt the same way about anyone else , ”
161511	161550	161509	161509	her	168	“ but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him ? She was n’t there ... or was she ? Maybe she has got an Invisibility Cloak ; maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task ... ”
161551	161558	161559	161559	Ron	170	“ And what did you say ? ”
161574	161590	161559	161559	Ron	170	“ Well , I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were okay to — ”
161591	161603	161509	161509	her	168	“ Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is , Miss Granger , ”
161619	161637	161613	161616	all three of them	1494	“ I must ask you not to discuss it in my class . Ten points from Gryffindor . ”
161674	161685	161686	161686	Snape	331	“ Ah ... reading magazines under the table as well ? ”
161697	161710	161686	161686	Snape	331	“ A further ten points from Gryffindor ... oh but of course ... ”
161725	161736	161711	161711	Snape	331	“ Potter has to keep up with his press cuttings ... ”
161769	161800	161761	161761	he	331	“ ‘ Harry Potter ’s Secret Heartache ’ ... dear , dear , Potter , what ’s ailing you now ? ‘ A boy like no other , perhaps ... ’ ”
161843	161873	161875	161875	Snape	331	“ ‘ ... Harry Potter ’s well - wishers must hope that , next time , he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate . ’ How very touching , ”
161890	161951	161875	161875	Snape	331	“ Well , I think I had better separate the three of you , so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives . Weasley , you stay here . Miss Granger , over there , beside Miss Parkinson . Potter — that table in front of my desk . Move . Now . ”
162019	162035	162037	162037	Snape	331	“ All this press attention seems to have inflated your already overlarge head , Potter , ”
162094	162112	162113	162113	Snape	331	“ You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire Wizarding world is impressed with you , ”
162149	162186	162125	162125	him	331	“ but I do n’t care how many times your picture appears in the papers . To me , Potter , you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him . ”
162232	162242	162243	162243	Snape	331	“ So I give you fair warning , Potter , ”
162253	162273	162243	162243	Snape	331	“ pint - sized celebrity or not — if I catch you breaking into my office one more time — ”
162274	162284	162286	162286	Harry	157	“ I have n’t been anywhere near your office ! ”
162294	162301	162302	162302	Snape	331	“ Do n’t lie to me , ”
162314	162334	162302	162302	Snape	331	“ Boomslang skin . Gillyweed . Both come from my private stores , and I know who stole them . ”
162414	162425	162426	162426	Harry	157	“ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about , ”
162430	162445	162446	162446	Snape	331	“ You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into ! ”
162449	162492	162446	162446	Snape	331	“ I know it , Potter ! Now , Mad - Eye Moody might have joined your fan club , but I will not tolerate your behavior ! One more nighttime stroll into my office , Potter , and you will pay ! ”
162493	162496	162498	162498	Harry	157	“ Right , ”
162508	162526	162498	162498	Harry	157	“ I ’ll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go in there . ”
162586	162596	162597	162597	Snape	331	“ Do you know what this is , Potter ? ”
162606	162609	162611	162611	Harry	157	“ No , ”
162619	162646	162648	162648	Snape	331	“ It is Veritaserum — a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear , ”
162651	162682	162684	162684	he	331	“ Now , the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines . But unless you watch your step , you might just find that my hand slips ”
162691	162719	162684	162684	he	331	“ right over your evening pumpkin juice . And then , Potter ... then we ’ll find out whether you ’ve been in my office or not . ”
162889	162892	162894	162894	Snape	331	“ Enter , ”
162938	162944	162946	162946	Karkaroff	373	“ We need to talk , ”
162997	163009	163010	163010	Snape	331	“ I ’ll talk to you after my lesson , Karkaroff , ”
163018	163040	163014	163014	Karkaroff	373	“ I want to talk now , while you ca n’t slip off , Severus . You ’ve been avoiding me . ”
163041	163046	163047	163047	Snape	331	“ After the lesson , ”
163173	163179	163182	163182	Snape	331	“ What ’s so urgent ? ”
163187	163190	163192	163192	Karkaroff	373	“ This , ”
163226	163229	163231	163231	Karkaroff	373	“ Well ? ”
163243	163258	163231	163231	Karkaroff	373	“ Do you see ? It ’s never been this clear , never since — ”
163259	163264	163266	163266	Snape	331	“ Put it away ! ”
163275	163282	163283	163283	Karkaroff	373	“ But you must have noticed — ”
163290	163298	163300	163300	Snape	331	“ We can talk later , Karkaroff ! ”
163302	163310	163300	163300	Snape	331	“ Potter ! What are you doing ? ”
163311	163320	163322	163322	Harry	157	“ Clearing up my armadillo bile , Professor , ”
163664	163669	163671	163671	Harry	157	“ Hello , Sirius , ”
164020	164023	164024	164024	he	177	“ Chicken ! ”
164061	164064	164066	164066	Sirius	177	“ Thanks , ”
164092	164117	164089	164089	his	177	“ I ’ve been living off rats mostly . Ca n’t steal too much food from Hogsmeade ; I ’d draw attention to myself . ”
164132	164141	164142	164142	he	157	“ What ’re you doing here , Sirius ? ”
164145	164152	164154	164154	Sirius	177	“ Fulfilling my duty as godfather , ”
164167	164183	164154	164154	Sirius	177	“ Do n’t worry about it , I ’m pretending to be a lovable stray . ”
164202	164257	164184	164184	He	177	“ I want to be on the spot . Your last letter ... well , let ’s just say things are getting fishier . I ’ve been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out , and by the looks of things , I ’m not the only one who ’s getting worried . ”
164289	164302	164258	164258	He	177	“ What if they catch you ? What if you ’re seen ? ”
164303	164321	164323	164323	Sirius	177	“ You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who know I ’m an Animagus , ”
164422	164433	164435	164435	Harry	157	“ They ’re making it sound like he ’s dying , ”
164438	164454	164435	164435	Harry	157	“ But he ca n’t be that ill if he managed to get up here ... ”
164455	164464	164465	164465	Ron	170	“ My brother ’s Crouch ’s personal assistant , ”
164469	164478	164465	164465	Ron	170	“ He says Crouch is suffering from overwork . ”
164479	164496	164498	164498	Harry	157	“ Mind you , he did look ill , last time I saw him up close , ”
164506	164517	164498	164498	Harry	157	“ The night my name came out of the goblet ... ”
164518	164530	164532	164532	Hermione	168	“ Getting his comeuppance for sacking Winky , is n’t he ? ”
164554	164581	164540	164540	She	168	“ I bet he wishes he had n’t done it now — bet he feels the difference now she ’s not there to look after him . ”
164582	164591	164592	164592	Ron	170	“ Hermione ’s obsessed with house - elves , ”
164610	164618	164603	164603	Sirius	177	“ Crouch sacked his house - elf ? ”
164619	164628	164630	164630	Harry	157	“ Yeah , at the Quidditch World Cup , ”
164685	164692	164693	164693	he	157	“ Let me get this straight , ”
164705	164725	164693	164693	he	157	“ You first saw the elf in the Top Box . She was saving Crouch a seat , right ? ”
164726	164729	164731	164731	Harry	157	“ Right , ”
164739	164750	164693	164693	he	157	“ But Crouch did n’t turn up for the match ? ”
164751	164754	164756	164756	Harry	157	“ No , ”
164758	164769	164756	164756	Harry	157	“ I think he said he ’d been too busy . ”
164783	164802	164780	164780	he	177	“ Harry , did you check your pockets for your wand after you ’d left the Top Box ? ”
164803	164806	164807	164807	Harry	157	“ Erm ... ”
164811	164814	164815	164815	he	157	“ No , ”
164819	164854	164855	164855	He	157	“ I did n’t need to use it before we got in the forest . And then I put my hand in my pocket , and all that was in there were my Omnioculars . ”
164860	164876	164855	164855	He	157	“ Are you saying whoever conjured the Mark stole my wand in the Top Box ? ”
164877	164882	164884	164884	Sirius	177	“ It ’s possible , ”
164886	164894	164895	164895	Hermione	168	“ Winky did n’t steal that wand ! ”
164898	164910	164912	164912	Sirius	177	“ The elf was n’t the only one in that box , ”
164923	164931	164918	164918	he	177	“ Who else was sitting behind you ? ”
164932	164937	164939	164939	Harry	157	“ Loads of people , ”
164941	164952	164939	164939	Harry	157	“ Some Bulgarian ministers ... Cornelius Fudge ... the Malfoys ... ”
164953	164957	164959	164959	Ron	170	“ The Malfoys ! ”
164980	164987	164976	164976	his	178	“ I bet it was Lucius ! ”
164988	164992	164994	164994	Sirius	177	“ Anyone else ? ”
164996	165000	165002	165002	Harry	157	“ No one , ”
165004	165015	165018	165018	him	157	“ Yes , there was , there was Ludo Bagman , ”
165020	165024	165016	165016	Hermione	168	“ Oh yeah ... ”
165025	165045	165047	165047	Sirius	177	“ I do n’t know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps , ”
165052	165058	165047	165047	Sirius	177	“ What ’s he like ? ”
165059	165064	165066	165066	Harry	157	“ He ’s okay , ”
165068	165080	165066	165066	Harry	157	“ He keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard Tournament . ”
165081	165087	165089	165089	Sirius	177	“ Does he , now ? ”
165095	165104	165089	165089	Sirius	177	“ I wonder why he ’d do that ? ”
165105	165115	165117	165117	Harry	157	“ Says he ’s taken a liking to me , ”
165119	165122	165124	165124	Sirius	177	“ Hmm , ”
165129	165143	165146	165146	Sirius	177	“ We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared , ”
165148	165151	165152	165152	she	168	“ Remember ? ”
165159	165174	165176	165176	Ron	170	“ Yeah , but he did n’t stay in the forest , did he ? ”
165178	165195	165176	165176	Ron	170	“ The moment we told him about the riot , he went off to the campsite . ”
165196	165201	165202	165202	Hermione	168	“ How d’you know ? ”
165206	165215	165202	165202	Hermione	168	“ How d’you know where he Disapparated to ? ”
165216	165221	165223	165223	Ron	170	“ Come off it , ”
165226	165239	165223	165223	Ron	170	“ Are you saying you reckon Ludo Bagman conjured the Dark Mark ? ”
165240	165251	165253	165253	Hermione	168	“ It ’s more likely he did it than Winky , ”
165256	165260	165262	165262	Ron	170	“ Told you , ”
165269	165278	165262	165262	Ron	170	“ told you she ’s obsessed with house — ”
165289	165314	165280	165280	Sirius	177	“ When the Dark Mark had been conjured , and the elf had been discovered holding Harry ’s wand , what did Crouch do ? ”
165315	165323	165325	165325	Harry	157	“ Went to look in the bushes , ”
165327	165336	165325	165325	Harry	157	“ but there was n’t anyone else there . ”
165337	165341	165342	165342	Sirius	177	“ Of course , ”
165350	165373	165342	165342	Sirius	177	“ of course , he ’d want to pin it on anyone but his own elf ... and then he sacked her ? ”
165374	165377	165379	165379	Hermione	168	“ Yes , ”
165385	165405	165379	165379	Hermione	168	“ he sacked her , just because she had n’t stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled — ”
165406	165419	165421	165421	Ron	170	“ Hermione , will you give it a rest with the elf ! ”
165430	165471	165425	165425	his	177	“ She ’s got the measure of Crouch better than you have , Ron . If you want to know what a man ’s like , take a good look at how he treats his inferiors , not his equals . ”
165485	165570	165472	165472	He	177	“ All these absences of Barty Crouch ’s ... he goes to the trouble of making sure his house - elf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup , but does n’t bother to turn up and watch . He works very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament , and then stops coming to that too ... It ’s not like Crouch . If he ’s ever taken a day off work because of illness before this , I ’ll eat Buckbeak . ”
165571	165578	165580	165580	Harry	157	“ D’you know Crouch , then ? ”
165615	165623	165624	165624	he	177	“ Oh I know Crouch all right , ”
165628	165649	165624	165624	he	177	“ He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban — without a trial . ”
165650	165653	165655	165655	Ron	170	“ What ? ”
165660	165665	165667	165667	Harry	157	“ You ’re kidding ! ”
165669	165676	165678	165678	Sirius	177	“ No , I ’m not , ”
165687	165706	165678	165678	Sirius	177	“ Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement , did n’t you know ? ”
165717	165728	165730	165730	Sirius	177	“ He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic , ”
165732	165756	165757	165757	he	177	“ He ’s a great wizard , Barty Crouch , powerfully magical — and power - hungry . Oh never a Voldemort supporter , ”
165768	165807	165757	165757	he	177	“ No , Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against the Dark Side . But then a lot of people who were against the Dark Side ... well , you would n’t understand ... you ’re too young ... ”
165808	165820	165822	165822	Ron	170	“ That ’s what my dad said at the World Cup , ”
165833	165842	165830	165830	his	170	“ Try us , why do n’t you ? ”
165852	165861	165862	165862	Sirius	177	“ All right , I ’ll try you ... ”
165866	165903	165862	165862	Sirius	177	“ Crouch ’s own son was caught with a group of Death Eaters who ’d managed to talk their way out of Azkaban . Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power . ”
165904	165911	165913	165913	Hermione	168	“ Crouch ’s son was caught ? ”
165915	165918	165920	165920	Sirius	177	“ Yep , ”
165948	165996	165930	165930	himself	177	“ Nasty little shock for old Barty , I ’d imagine . Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family , should n’t he ? Ought to have left the office early once in a while ... gotten to know his own son . ”
166007	166015	166017	166017	Harry	157	“ Was his son a Death Eater ? ”
166019	166023	166025	166025	Sirius	177	“ No idea , ”
166032	166097	166025	166025	Sirius	177	“ I was in Azkaban myself when he was brought in . This is mostly stuff I ’ve found out since I got out . The boy was definitely caught in the company of people I ’d bet my life were Death Eaters — but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time , just like the house - elf . ”
166098	166108	166109	166109	Hermione	168	“ Did Crouch try and get his son off ? ”
166125	166242	166112	166112	Sirius	177	“ Crouch let his son off ? I thought you had the measure of him , Hermione ! Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go ; he had dedicated his whole life to becoming Minister of Magic . You saw him dismiss a devoted house - elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again — does n’t that tell you what he ’s like ? Crouch ’s fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial , and by all accounts , it was n’t much more than an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the boy ... then he sent him straight to Azkaban . ”
166243	166253	166255	166255	Harry	157	“ He gave his own son to the dementors ? ”
166258	166263	166265	166265	Sirius	177	“ That ’s right , ”
166276	166348	166268	166268	he	177	“ I saw the dementors bringing him in , watched them through the bars in my cell door . He ca n’t have been more than nineteen . They took him into a cell near mine . He was screaming for his mother by nightfall . He went quiet after a few days , though ... they all went quiet in the end ... except when they shrieked in their sleep ... ”
166374	166382	166383	166383	Harry	157	“ So he ’s still in Azkaban ? ”
166386	166389	166391	166391	Sirius	177	“ No , ”
166394	166415	166391	166391	Sirius	177	“ No , he ’s not in there anymore . He died about a year after they brought him in . ”
166416	166420	166563	166563	Sirius	177	“ He died ? ”
166421	166429	166431	166431	Sirius	177	“ He was n’t the only one , ”
166434	166562	166431	166431	Sirius	177	“ Most go mad in there , and plenty stop eating in the end . They lose the will to live . You could always tell when a death was coming , because the dementors could sense it , they got excited . That boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived . Crouch being an important Ministry member , he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit . That was the last time I saw Barty Crouch , half carrying his wife past my cell . She died herself , apparently , shortly afterward . Grief . Wasted away just like the boy . Crouch never came for his son ’s body . The dementors buried him outside the fortress ; I watched them do it . ”
166588	166605	166606	166606	he	177	“ So old Crouch lost it all , just when he thought he had it made , ”
166700	166711	166712	166712	Harry	157	“ Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards , ”
166716	166733	166735	166735	Sirius	177	“ Yeah , I ’ve heard it ’s become a bit of a mania with him , ”
166739	166762	166735	166735	Sirius	177	“ If you ask me , he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more Death Eater . ”
166763	166775	166777	166777	Ron	170	“ And he sneaked up here to search Snape ’s office ! ”
166784	166796	166798	166798	Sirius	177	“ Yes , and that does n’t make sense at all , ”
166800	166806	166808	166808	Ron	170	“ Yeah , it does ! ”
166817	166857	166814	166814	his	177	“ Listen , if Crouch wants to investigate Snape , why has n’t he been coming to judge the tournament ? It would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to Hogwarts and keep an eye on him . ”
166858	166871	166873	166873	Harry	157	“ So you think Snape could be up to something , then ? ”
166880	166895	166814	166814	his	177	“ Look , I do n’t care what you say , Dumbledore trusts Snape — ”
166896	166905	166907	166907	Ron	170	“ Oh give it a rest , Hermione , ”
166910	166934	166907	166907	Ron	170	“ I know Dumbledore ’s brilliant and everything , but that does n’t mean a really clever Dark wizard could n’t fool him — ”
166935	166959	166814	166814	his	177	“ Why did Snape save Harry ’s life in the first year , then ? Why did n’t he just let him die ? ”
166960	166973	166907	166907	Ron	170	“ I dunno — maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out — ”
166974	166981	166982	166982	Harry	157	“ What d’you think , Sirius ? ”
166995	167005	167007	167007	Sirius	177	“ I think they ’ve both got a point , ”
167027	167135	167016	167016	Sirius	177	“ Rosier and Wilkes — they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort fell . The Lestranges — they ’re a married couple — they ’re in Azkaban . Avery — from what I ’ve heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying he ’d been acting under the Imperius Curse — he ’s still at large . But as far as I know , Snape was never even accused of being a Death Eater — not that that means much . Plenty of them were never caught . And Snape ’s certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble . ”
167136	167151	167153	167153	Ron	170	“ Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well , but he wants to keep that quiet , ”
167155	167173	167175	167175	Harry	157	“ Yeah , you should ’ve seen Snape ’s face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday ! ”
167178	167216	167175	167175	Harry	157	“ Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape , he says Snape ’s been avoiding him . Karkaroff looked really worried . He showed Snape something on his arm , but I could n’t see what it was . ”
167217	167226	167228	167228	Sirius	177	“ He showed Snape something on his arm ? ”
167248	167276	167234	167234	He	177	“ Well , I ’ve no idea what that ’s about ... but if Karkaroff ’s genuinely worried , and he ’s going to Snape for answers ... ”
167291	167336	167277	167277	Sirius	177	“ There ’s still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape , and I know Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people would n’t , but I just ca n’t see him letting Snape teach at Hogwarts if he ’d ever worked for Voldemort . ”
167337	167353	167355	167355	Ron	170	“ Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snape ’s office then ? ”
167358	167361	167363	167363	Sirius	177	“ Well , ”
167403	167427	167397	167397	Sirius	177	“ You say your brother ’s Crouch ’s personal assistant ? Any chance you could ask him if he ’s seen Crouch lately ? ”
167428	167433	167435	167435	Ron	170	“ I can try , ”
167438	167460	167435	167435	Ron	170	“ Better not make it sound like I reckon Crouch is up to anything dodgy , though . Percy loves Crouch . ”
167461	167484	167486	167486	Sirius	177	“ And you might try and find out whether they ’ve got any leads on Bertha Jorkins while you ’re at it , ”
167498	167506	167508	167508	Harry	157	“ Bagman told me they had n’t , ”
167510	167522	167524	167524	Sirius	177	“ Yes , he ’s quoted in the article in there , ”
167531	167636	167524	167524	Sirius	177	“ Blustering on about how bad Bertha ’s memory is . Well , maybe she ’s changed since I knew her , but the Bertha I knew was n’t forgetful at all — quite the reverse . She was a bit dim , but she had an excellent memory for gossip . It used to get her into a lot of trouble ; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut . I can see her being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic ... maybe that ’s why Bagman did n’t bother to look for her for so long ... ”
167648	167654	167712	167712	He	177	“ What ’s the time ? ”
167678	167685	167687	167687	Hermione	168	“ It ’s half past three , ”
167689	167698	167699	167699	Sirius	177	“ You ’d better get back to school , ”
167707	167711	167699	167699	Sirius	177	“ Now listen ... ”
167719	167776	167712	167712	He	177	“ I do n’t want you lot sneaking out of school to see me , all right ? Just send notes to me here . I still want to hear about anything odd . But you ’re not to go leaving Hogwarts without permission ; it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you . ”
167777	167797	167798	167798	Harry	157	“ No one ’s tried to attack me so far , except a dragon and a couple of grindylows , ”
167807	167851	167852	167852	He	177	“ I do n’t care ... I ’ll breathe freely again when this tournament ’s over , and that ’s not until June . And do n’t forget , if you ’re talking about me among yourselves , call me Snuffles , okay ? ”
167869	167882	167884	167884	Sirius	177	“ I ’ll walk to the edge of the village with you , ”
167886	167895	167884	167884	Sirius	177	“ see if I can scrounge another paper . ”
167977	167988	167989	167989	Ron	170	“ Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch ? ”
168001	168041	167989	167989	Ron	170	“ But maybe he does n’t care ... it ’d probably just make him admire Crouch even more . Yeah , Percy loves rules . He ’d just say Crouch was refusing to break them for his own son . ”
168042	168055	168057	168057	Hermione	168	“ Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors , ”
168060	168066	168068	168068	Ron	170	“ I do n’t know , ”
168070	168092	168068	168068	Ron	170	“ If he thought we were standing in the way of his career ... Percy ’s really ambitious , you know ... ”
168118	168123	168125	168125	Ron	170	“ Poor old Snuffles , ”
168130	168146	168125	168125	Ron	170	“ He must really like you , Harry ... Imagine having to live off rats . ”
168256	168265	168266	168266	he	425	“ Harry Potter is too good to Dobby ! ”
168278	168293	168295	168295	Harry	157	“ You saved my life with that gillyweed , Dobby , you really did , ”
168297	168309	168311	168311	Ron	170	“ No chance of more of those eclairs , is there ? ”
168326	168333	168335	168335	Hermione	168	“ You ’ve just had breakfast ! ”
168356	168368	168369	168369	Harry	157	“ We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles , ”
168372	168376	168378	168378	Ron	170	“ Good idea , ”
168380	168401	168402	168402	he	170	“ Give Pig something to do . You could n’t give us a bit of extra food , could you ? ”
168421	168428	168430	168430	Hermione	168	“ Dobby , where ’s Winky ? ”
168437	168448	168450	168450	Dobby	425	“ Winky is over there by the fire , miss , ”
168458	168462	168466	168466	she	168	“ Oh dear , ”
168550	168561	168562	168562	Dobby	425	“ Winky is getting through six bottles a day now , ”
168567	168578	168579	168579	Harry	157	“ Well , it ’s not strong , that stuff , ”
168588	168600	168601	168601	he	425	“ ’ Tis strong for a house - elf , sir , ”
168625	168633	168634	168634	Dobby	425	“ Winky is pining , Harry Potter , ”
168638	168671	168634	168634	Dobby	425	“ Winky wants to go home . Winky still thinks Mr. Crouch is her master , sir , and nothing Dobby says will persuade her that Professor Dumbledore is her master now . ”
168672	168677	168679	168679	Harry	157	“ Hey , Winky , ”
168696	168724	168679	168679	Harry	157	“ you do n’t know what Mr. Crouch might be up to , do you ? Because he ’s stopped turning up to judge the Triwizard Tournament . ”
168745	168756	168737	168737	She	252	“ M — Master is stopped — hic — coming ? ”
168757	168760	168762	168762	Harry	157	“ Yeah , ”
168764	168784	168762	168762	Harry	157	“ we have n’t seen him since the first task . The Daily Prophet ’s saying he ’s ill . ”
168795	168802	168737	168737	She	252	“ Master — hic — ill ? ”
168810	168821	168823	168823	Hermione	168	“ But we ’re not sure if that ’s true , ”
168826	168836	168838	168839	the elf	1243	“ Master is needing his — hic — Winky ! ”
168841	168856	168838	168839	the elf	1243	“ Master can not — hic — manage — hic — all by himself ... ”
168857	168872	168873	168873	Hermione	168	“ Other people manage to do their own housework , you know , Winky , ”
168877	168894	168895	168895	Winky	252	“ Winky — hic — is not only — hic — doing housework for Mr. Crouch ! ”
168913	168935	168895	168895	Winky	252	“ Master is — hic — trusting Winky with — hic — the most important — hic — the most secret — ”
168936	168939	168941	168941	Harry	157	“ What ? ”
168957	168968	168969	168969	she	252	“ Winky keeps — hic — her master ’s secrets , ”
168987	168998	168969	168969	she	252	“ You is — hic — nosing , you is . ”
168999	169010	169012	169012	Dobby	425	“ Winky must not talk like that to Harry Potter ! ”
169015	169029	169012	169012	Dobby	425	“ Harry Potter is brave and noble and Harry Potter is not nosy ! ”
169030	169079	168969	168969	she	252	“ He is nosing — hic — into my master ’s — hic — private and secret — hic — Winky is a good house - elf — hic — Winky keeps her silence — hic — people trying to — hic — pry and poke — hic — ”
169158	169172	169179	169179	his	3819	“ We is sorry you had to see that , sirs and miss ! ”
169186	169203	169179	169179	his	3819	“ We is hoping you will not judge us all by Winky , sirs and miss ! ”
169204	169209	169211	169211	Hermione	168	“ She ’s unhappy ! ”
169215	169231	169211	169211	Hermione	168	“ Why do n’t you try and cheer her up instead of covering her up ? ”
169232	169239	169241	169244	the house - elf	1260	“ Begging your pardon , miss , ”
169250	169274	169241	169244	the house - elf	1260	“ but house - elves has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and masters to be served . ”
169275	169282	169283	169283	Hermione	168	“ Oh for heaven ’s sake ! ”
169286	169336	169283	169283	Hermione	168	“ Listen to me , all of you ! You ’ve got just as much right as wizards to be unhappy ! You ’ve got the right to wages and holidays and proper clothes , you do n’t have to do everything you ’re told — look at Dobby ! ”
169337	169347	169348	169348	Dobby	425	“ Miss will please keep Dobby out of this , ”
169385	169392	169394	169395	an elf	5158	“ We has your extra food ! ”
169420	169425	169402	169402	he	5158	“ Good - bye ! ”
169458	169468	169469	169469	Dobby	425	“ Thank you for the socks , Harry Potter ! ”
169489	169503	169505	169505	Ron	170	“ You could n’t keep your mouth shut , could you , Hermione ? ”
169516	169540	169505	169505	Ron	170	“ They wo n’t want us visiting them now ! We could ’ve tried to get more stuff out of Winky about Crouch ! ”
169541	169550	169552	169552	Hermione	168	“ Oh as if you care about that ! ”
169554	169565	169552	169552	Hermione	168	“ You only like coming down here for the food ! ”
169932	169943	169945	169945	Ron	170	“ Percy wo n’t ’ve had time to answer yet , ”
169947	169954	169945	169945	Ron	170	“ We only sent Hedwig yesterday . ”
169955	169963	169965	169965	Hermione	168	“ No , it ’s not that , ”
169967	169991	169965	169965	Hermione	168	“ I ’ve taken out a subscription to the Daily Prophet . I ’m getting sick of finding everything out from the Slytherins . ”
169992	169996	169998	169998	Harry	157	“ Good thinking ! ”
170007	170019	169998	169998	Harry	157	“ Hey , Hermione , I think you ’re in luck — ”
170029	170039	170040	170040	she	168	“ It has n’t got a newspaper , though , ”
170046	170050	170040	170040	she	168	“ It ’s — ”
170081	170090	170092	170092	Harry	157	“ How many subscriptions did you take out ? ”
170126	170132	170133	170133	Hermione	168	“ What on earth — ? ”
170152	170156	170157	170157	she	168	“ Oh really ! ”
170164	170169	170171	170171	Ron	170	“ What ’s up ? ”
170173	170181	170182	170182	She	168	“ It ’s — oh how ridiculous — ”
170232	170239	170241	170241	Hermione	168	“ They ’re all like it ! ”
170250	170278	170241	170241	Hermione	168	“ ‘ Harry Potter can do much better than the likes of you ... ’ ‘ You deserve to be boiled in frog spawn ... ’ Ouch ! ”
170309	170314	170316	170316	Ron	170	“ Undiluted bubotuber pus ! ”
170327	170330	170332	170332	Hermione	168	“ Ow ! ”
170380	170391	170393	170393	Harry	157	“ You ’d better get up to the hospital wing , ”
170402	170413	170393	170393	Harry	157	“ We ’ll tell Professor Sprout where you ’ve gone ... ”

171711	171716	171717	171717	Ron	170	“ Must be nice , ”
171736	171754	171717	171717	Ron	170	“ To have so much money you do n’t notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing . ”
171755	171768	171770	171770	Harry	157	“ Listen , I had other stuff on my mind that night ! ”
171773	171780	171770	171770	Harry	157	“ We all did , remember ? ”
171781	171790	171791	171791	Ron	170	“ I did n’t know leprechaun gold vanishes , ”

171888	171914	171879	171879	Ron	170	“ I do n’t blame Fred and George for trying to make some extra money . Wish I could . Wish I had a niffler . ”
171915	171927	171929	171929	Hermione	168	“ Well , we know what to get you next Christmas , ”
171944	171965	171941	171941	she	168	“ Come on , Ron , it could be worse . At least your fingers are n’t full of pus . ”

172118	172138	172114	172114	he	157	“ if we just ignore it ... People got bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time — ”
172139	172162	172164	172164	Hermione	168	“ I want to know how she ’s listening into private conversations when she ’s supposed to be banned from the grounds ! ”
172244	172256	172257	172257	Hermione	168	“ Well , Rita ’s definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak ! ”
172292	172317	172275	172275	Harry	157	“ Moody says he did n’t see her anywhere near the judges ’ table at the second task , or anywhere near the lake ! ”
172318	172332	172334	172334	Ron	170	“ Hermione , is there any point in telling you to drop this ? ”
172336	172339	172341	172341	Hermione	168	“ No ! ”
172344	172367	172341	172341	Hermione	168	“ I want to know how she heard me talking to Viktor ! And how she found out about Hagrid ’s mum ! ”
172368	172375	172377	172377	Harry	157	“ Maybe she had you bugged , ”
172379	172382	172384	172384	Ron	170	“ Bugged ? ”
172387	172397	172384	172384	Ron	170	“ What ... put fleas on her or something ? ”
172417	172431	172413	172413	Hermione	168	“ Are n’t you two ever going to read Hogwarts : A History ? ”
172432	172438	172440	172440	Ron	170	“ What ’s the point ? ”
172442	172455	172440	172440	Ron	170	“ You know it by heart , we can just ask you . ”
172456	172528	172413	172413	Hermione	168	“ All those substitutes for magic Muggles use — electricity , computers , and radar , and all those things — they all go haywire around Hogwarts , there ’s too much magic in the air . No , Rita ’s using magic to eavesdrop , she must be ... If I could just find out what it is ... ooh , if it ’s illegal , I ’ll have her ... ”
172529	172539	172540	172540	Ron	170	“ Have n’t we got enough to worry about ? ”
172544	172558	172540	172540	Ron	170	“ Do we have to start a vendetta against Rita Skeeter as well ? ”
172559	172568	172569	172569	Hermione	168	“ I ’m not asking you to help ! ”
172572	172581	172569	172569	Hermione	168	“ I ’ll do it on my own ! ”
172605	172623	172625	172625	Ron	170	“ What ’s the betting she comes back with a box of I Hate Rita Skeeter badges ? ”
172839	172857	172858	172858	she	168	“ Your mum does n’t read Witch Weekly , by any chance , does she , Ron ? ”
172862	172865	172867	172867	Ron	170	“ Yeah , ”
172876	172883	172867	172867	Ron	170	“ Gets it for the recipes . ”
172892	172904	172905	172905	Harry	157	“ Do n’t you want to see what Percy ’s written ? ”
173079	173096	173097	173097	she	318	“ You are to go down to the Quidditch field tonight at nine o’clock , Potter , ”
173101	173116	173097	173097	she	318	“ Mr. Bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third task . ”

173182	173200	173164	173164	he	208	“ Fleur keeps going on about underground tunnels ; she reckons we ’ve got to find treasure . ”
173201	173209	173211	173211	Harry	157	“ That would n’t be too bad , ”

173305	173310	173312	173312	Harry	157	“ They ’re hedges ! ”
173321	173325	173342	173342	Krum	204	“ Hello there ! ”

173407	173431	173432	173432	he	201	“ Growing nicely , are n’t they ? Give them a month and Hagrid’ll have them twenty feet high . Do n’t worry , ”
173453	173482	173432	173432	he	201	“ you ’ll have your Quidditch field back to normal once the task is over ! Now , I imagine you can guess what we ’re making here ? ”

173560	173566	173568	173568	Bagman	201	“ There will be obstacles , ”
173579	173625	173576	173576	his	201	“ Hagrid is providing a number of creatures ... then there will be spells that must be broken ... all that sort of thing , you know . Now , the champions who are leading on points will get a head start into the maze . ”
173633	173670	173626	173626	Bagman	201	“ Then Mr. Krum will enter ... then Miss Delacour . But you ’ll all be in with a fighting chance , depending how well you get past the obstacles . Should be fun , eh ? ”

175410	175416	175418	175418	Harry	157	“ Just keep him here , ”

175697	175705	175707	175707	Harry	157	“ I need to see Professor Dumbledore ! ”
175725	175747	175722	175722	Snape	331	“ It ’s Mr. Crouch ... he ’s just turned up ... he ’s in the forest ... he ’s asking — ”
175748	175754	175756	175756	Snape	331	“ What is this rubbish ? ”
175763	175770	175756	175756	Snape	331	“ What are you talking about ? ”
175771	175775	175776	175776	Harry	157	“ Mr. Crouch ! ”
175779	175810	175776	175776	Harry	157	“ From the Ministry ! He ’s ill or something — he ’s in the forest , he wants to see Dumbledore ! Just give me the password up to — ”
175811	175819	175821	175821	Snape	331	“ The headmaster is busy , Potter , ”
175832	175840	175841	175841	Harry	157	“ I ’ve got to tell Dumbledore ! ”
175844	175853	175857	175857	Snape	331	“ Did n’t you hear me , Potter ? ”
175875	175878	175880	175880	Harry	157	“ Look , ”
175883	175906	175880	175880	Harry	157	“ Crouch is n’t right — he ’s — he ’s out of his mind — he says he wants to warn — ”
175930	175936	175937	175937	he	169	“ Is there a problem ? ”
175946	175949	175950	175950	Harry	157	“ Professor ! ”
175960	175980	175950	175950	Harry	157	“ Mr. Crouch is here — he ’s down in the forest , he wants to speak to you ! ”
176000	176005	176006	176006	he	169	“ Lead the way , ”
176033	176042	176044	176044	Dumbledore	169	“ What did Mr. Crouch say , Harry ? ”
176054	176089	176098	176098	he	169	“ Said he wants to warn you ... said he ’s done something terrible ... he mentioned his son ... and Bertha Jorkins ... and — and Voldemort ... something about Voldemort getting stronger ... ”
176090	176093	176098	176098	he	169	“ Indeed , ”
176112	176119	176120	176120	Harry	157	“ He ’s not acting normally , ”
176128	176170	176120	176120	Harry	157	“ He does n’t seem to know where he is . He keeps talking like he thinks Percy Weasley ’s there , and then he changes , and says he needs to see you ... I left him with Viktor Krum . ”
176171	176175	176181	176181	he	169	“ You did ? ”
176198	176209	176181	176181	he	169	“ Do you know if anybody else saw Mr. Crouch ? ”
176210	176213	176215	176215	Harry	157	“ No , ”
176217	176252	176215	176215	Harry	157	“ Krum and I were talking , Mr. Bagman had just finished telling us about the third task , we stayed behind , and then we saw Mr. Crouch coming out of the forest — ”
176253	176258	176260	176260	Dumbledore	169	“ Where are they ? ”
176270	176274	176276	176276	Harry	157	“ Over here , ”
176322	176325	176326	176326	Harry	157	“ Viktor ? ”
176333	176338	176339	176339	Harry	157	“ They were here , ”
176344	176352	176339	176339	Harry	157	“ They were definitely somewhere around here ... ”
176353	176356	176357	176357	Dumbledore	169	“ Lumos , ”
176435	176438	176439	176439	he	169	“ Stunned , ”
176461	176469	176471	176471	Harry	157	“ Should I go and get someone ? ”
176473	176477	176471	176471	Harry	157	“ Madam Pomfrey ? ”
176478	176481	176483	176483	Dumbledore	169	“ No , ”
176486	176490	176483	176483	Dumbledore	169	“ Stay here . ”
176544	176547	176536	176536	his	169	“ Rennervate . ”
176582	176587	176588	176588	Krum	204	“ He attacked me ! ”
176599	176622	176588	176588	Krum	204	“ The old madman attacked me ! I vos looking around to see vare Potter had gone and he attacked from behind ! ”
176623	176630	176631	176631	Dumbledore	169	“ Lie still for a moment , ”
176660	176664	176665	176665	he	351	“ Professor Dumbledore ! ”
176672	176679	176665	176665	he	351	“ Harry — what the — ? ”
176680	176691	176693	176693	Dumbledore	169	“ Hagrid , I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff , ”
176695	176713	176693	176693	Dumbledore	169	“ His student has been attacked . When you ’ve done that , kindly alert Professor Moody — ”
176714	176720	176665	176665	he	351	“ No need , Dumbledore , ”
176726	176731	176665	176665	he	351	“ I ’m here . ”
176747	176751	176752	176752	he	344	“ Damn leg , ”
176756	176773	176752	176752	he	344	“ Would ’ve been here quicker ... what ’s happened ? Snape said something about Crouch — ”
176774	176777	176779	176779	Hagrid	180	“ Crouch ? ”
176782	176789	176791	176791	Dumbledore	169	“ Karkaroff , please , Hagrid ! ”
176794	176803	176805	176805	Hagrid	180	“ Oh yeah ... right y’are , Professor ... ”
176822	176832	176833	176833	Dumbledore	169	“ I do n’t know where Barty Crouch is , ”
176837	176847	176833	176833	Dumbledore	169	“ but it is essential that we find him . ”
176848	176854	176856	176856	Moody	344	“ I ’m onto it , ”
176910	176915	176916	176916	he	373	“ What is this ? ”
176932	176938	176928	176928	Harry	157	“ What ’s going on ? ”
176939	176944	176946	176946	Krum	204	“ I vos attacked ! ”
176956	176964	176946	176946	Krum	204	“ Mr. Crouch or votever his name — ”
176965	176978	176928	176928	Harry	157	“ Crouch attacked you ? Crouch attacked you ? The Triwizard judge ? ”
176979	176982	176983	176983	Dumbledore	169	“ Igor , ”
177002	177005	177006	177006	he	373	“ Treachery ! ”
177013	177116	177006	177006	he	373	“ It is a plot ! You and your Ministry of Magic have lured me here under false pretenses , Dumbledore ! This is not an equal competition ! First you sneak Potter into the tournament , though he is underage ! Now one of your Ministry friends attempts to put my champion out of action ! I smell double - dealing and corruption in this whole affair , and you , Dumbledore , you , with your talk of closer international Wizarding links , of rebuilding old ties , of forgetting old differences — here ’s what I think of you ! ”
177155	177158	177159	177159	Hagrid	180	“ Apologize ! ”
177181	177186	177187	177187	Dumbledore	169	“ Hagrid , no ! ”
177233	177245	177247	177247	Dumbledore	169	“ Kindly escort Harry back up to the castle , Hagrid , ”
177260	177270	177253	177253	Hagrid	180	“ Maybe I ’d better stay here , Headmaster ... ”
177271	177282	177283	177283	Dumbledore	169	“ You will take Harry back to school , Hagrid , ”
177287	177332	177283	177283	Dumbledore	169	“ Take him right up to Gryffindor Tower . And Harry — I want you to stay there . Anything you might want to do — any owls you might want to send — they can wait until morning , do you understand me ? ”
177333	177338	177340	177340	Harry	157	“ Er — yes , ”
177375	177385	177386	177386	Hagrid	180	“ I ’ll leave Fang with yeh , Headmaster , ”
177412	177422	177392	177392	Karkaroff	373	“ Stay , Fang . C’m on , Harry . ”
177437	177442	177443	177443	Hagrid	180	“ How dare he , ”
177452	177458	177460	177460	Harry	157	“ Krum ’s all right ! ”
177471	177488	177460	177460	Harry	157	“ He was n’t trying to jinx me , he just wanted to talk about Hermione — ”
177489	177504	177506	177506	Hagrid	180	“ I ’ll be havin’ a few words with her , an ’ all , ”
177514	177540	177506	177506	Hagrid	180	“ The less you lot ’ ave ter do with these foreigners , the happier yeh’ll be . Yeh can ’ trust any of ’em . ”
177541	177552	177553	177553	Harry	157	“ You were getting on all right with Madame Maxime , ”
177558	177569	177571	177571	Hagrid	180	“ Don ’ you talk ter me abou ’ her ! ”
177582	177627	177574	177574	he	180	“ I ’ve got her number now ! Tryin ’ ter get back in me good books , tryin ’ ter get me ter tell her what ’s comin ’ in the third task . Ha ! You can ’ trust any of ’em ! ”
177684	177691	177693	177693	Hermione	168	“ It comes down to this , ”
177699	177719	177693	177693	Hermione	168	“ Either Mr. Crouch attacked Viktor , or somebody else attacked both of them when Viktor was n’t looking . ”
177720	177727	177729	177729	Ron	170	“ It must ’ve been Crouch , ”
177733	177753	177729	177729	Ron	170	“ That ’s why he was gone when Harry and Dumbledore got there . He ’d done a runner . ”
177754	177761	177763	177763	Harry	157	“ I do n’t think so , ”
177769	177787	177763	177763	Harry	157	“ He seemed really weak — I do n’t reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything . ”
177788	177806	177808	177808	Hermione	168	“ You ca n’t Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds , have n’t I told you enough times ? ”
177810	177820	177822	177822	Ron	170	“ Okay ... how ’s this for a theory , ”
177825	177841	177822	177822	Ron	170	“ Krum attacked Crouch — no , wait for it — and then Stunned himself ! ”
177842	177851	177853	177853	Hermione	168	“ And Mr. Crouch evaporated , did he ? ”
177856	177860	177822	177822	Ron	170	“ Oh yeah ... ”
177927	177936	177938	177938	Hermione	168	“ Just go through it again , Harry , ”
177940	177948	177938	177938	Hermione	168	“ What did Mr. Crouch actually say ? ”
177949	177962	177964	177964	Harry	157	“ I ’ve told you , he was n’t making much sense , ”
177966	178005	177964	177964	Harry	157	“ He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about something . He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins , and he seemed to think she was dead . He kept saying stuff was his fault ... He mentioned his son . ”
178006	178014	178016	178016	Hermione	168	“ Well , that was his fault , ”
178019	178027	178029	178029	Harry	157	“ He was out of his mind , ”
178031	178060	178029	178029	Harry	157	“ Half the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive , and he kept talking to Percy about work and giving him instructions . ”
178061	178076	178078	178078	Ron	170	“ And ... remind me what he said about You - Know - Who ? ”
178081	178087	178088	178088	Harry	157	“ I ’ve told you , ”
178092	178100	178088	178088	Harry	157	“ He said he ’s getting stronger . ”
178115	178137	178107	178107	Ron	170	“ But he was out of his mind , like you said , so half of it was probably just raving ... ”
178138	178151	178153	178153	Harry	157	“ He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort , ”
178165	178206	178156	178156	Ron	170	“ He was having real trouble stringing two words together , but that was when he seemed to know where he was , and know what he wanted to do . He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore . ”
178257	178266	178267	178267	Harry	157	“ If Snape had n’t held me up , ”
178271	178308	178267	178267	Harry	157	“ we might ’ve got there in time . ‘ The headmaster is busy , Potter ... what ’s this rubbish , Potter ? ’ Why could n’t he have just got out of the way ? ”
178309	178320	178322	178322	Ron	170	“ Maybe he did n’t want you to get there ! ”
178325	178355	178322	178322	Ron	170	“ Maybe — hang on — how fast d’you reckon he could ’ve gotten down to the forest ? D’you reckon he could ’ve beaten you and Dumbledore there ? ”
178356	178369	178371	178371	Harry	157	“ Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something , ”
178373	178381	178382	178382	Ron	170	“ Would n’t put it past him , ”
178385	178393	178395	178395	Hermione	168	“ We need to see Professor Moody , ”
178397	178409	178395	178395	Hermione	168	“ We need to find out whether he found Mr. Crouch . ”
178410	178427	178429	178429	Harry	157	“ If he had the Marauder ’s Map on him , it would ’ve been easy , ”
178431	178440	178442	178442	Ron	170	“ Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds , ”
178444	178457	178442	178442	Ron	170	“ because it only shows up to the boundaries , does n’t — ”
178458	178461	178463	178463	Hermione	168	“ Shh ! ”
178488	178508	178466	178466	Somebody	1529	“ — that ’s blackmail , that is , we could get into a lot of trouble for that — ”
178509	178540	178442	178442	Ron	170	“ — we ’ve tried being polite ; it ’s time to play dirty , like him . He would n’t like the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did — ”
178541	178558	178466	178466	Somebody	1529	“ I ’m telling you , if you put that in writing , it ’s blackmail ! ”
178559	178579	178442	178442	Ron	170	“ Yeah , and you wo n’t be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff , will you ? ”
178607	178614	178615	178615	Ron	170	“ What ’re you doing here ? ”
178624	178629	178631	178631	Harry	157	“ Sending a letter , ”
178637	178644	178648	178648	Fred	174	“ What , at this time ? ”
178653	178673	178674	178674	he	3968	“ Fine — we wo n’t ask you what you ’re doing , if you do n’t ask us , ”
178713	178724	178725	178725	Fred	174	“ Well , do n’t let us hold you up , ”
178743	178749	178750	178750	he	170	“ Who ’re you blackmailing ? ”
178774	178785	178786	178786	he	170	“ Do n’t be stupid , I was only joking , ”
178790	178797	178799	178799	Ron	170	“ Did n’t sound like that , ”
178814	178845	178810	178810	Fred	174	“ I ’ve told you before , Ron , keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is . Ca n’t see why you would , but — ”
178846	178857	178859	178859	Ron	170	“ It ’s my business if you ’re blackmailing someone , ”
178861	178876	178859	178859	Ron	170	“ George ’s right , you could end up in serious trouble for that . ”
178877	178885	178887	178887	George	175	“ Told you , I was joking , ”
178916	178947	178889	178889	He	170	“ You ’re starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother , you are , Ron . Carry on like this and you ’ll be made a prefect . ”
178948	178955	178957	178957	Ron	170	“ No , I wo n’t ! ”
178982	178997	178974	178974	George	175	“ Well , stop telling people what to do then . See you later . ”
179016	179031	179032	179032	Hermione	168	“ You do n’t think they know something about all this , do you ? ”
179035	179041	179032	179032	Hermione	168	“ About Crouch and everything ? ”
179042	179045	179047	179047	Harry	157	“ No , ”
179049	179067	179047	179047	Harry	157	“ If it was something that serious , they ’d tell someone . They ’d tell Dumbledore . ”
179076	179082	179085	179085	him	170	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
179087	179090	179092	179092	Ron	170	“ Well ... ”
179095	179129	179092	179092	Ron	170	“ I dunno if they would . They ’re ... they ’re obsessed with making money lately , I noticed it when I was hanging around with them — when — you know — ”
179130	179136	179137	179137	Harry	157	“ We were n’t talking . ”
179144	179150	179137	179137	Harry	157	“ Yeah , but blackmail ... ”
179151	179162	179164	179164	Ron	170	“ It ’s this joke shop idea they ’ve got , ”
179166	179230	179164	179164	Ron	170	“ I thought they were only saying it to annoy Mum , but they really mean it , they want to start one . They ’ve only got a year left at Hogwarts , they keep going on about how it ’s time to think about their future , and Dad ca n’t help them , and they need gold to get started . ”
179237	179254	179231	179231	Hermione	168	“ Yes , but ... they would n’t do anything against the law to get gold . ”
179255	179260	179262	179262	Ron	170	“ Would n’t they ? ”
179267	179282	179262	179262	Ron	170	“ I dunno ... they do n’t exactly mind breaking rules , do they ? ”
179283	179292	179294	179294	Hermione	168	“ Yes , but this is the law , ”
179299	179328	179294	179294	Hermione	168	“ This is n’t some silly school rule ... They ’ll get a lot more than detention for blackmail ! Ron ... maybe you ’d better tell Percy ... ”
179329	179334	179336	179336	Ron	170	“ Are you mad ? ”
179338	179353	179336	179336	Ron	170	“ Tell Percy ? He ’d probably do a Crouch and turn them in . ”
179372	179382	179354	179354	He	170	“ Come on , let ’s get some breakfast . ”
179383	179397	179398	179398	Hermione	168	“ D’you think it ’s too early to go and see Professor Moody ? ”
179408	179411	179413	179413	Harry	157	“ Yes , ”
179415	179455	179413	179413	Harry	157	“ He ’d probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn ; he ’ll think we ’re trying to attack him while he ’s asleep . Let ’s give it till break . ”
179598	179602	179603	179603	Harry	157	“ Professor Moody ? ”
179616	179621	179623	179623	Moody	344	“ Hello , Potter , ”
179663	179668	179659	179659	he	344	“ Come in here . ”
179690	179696	179697	179697	Harry	157	“ Did you find him ? ”
179702	179706	179697	179697	Harry	157	“ Mr. Crouch ? ”
179707	179710	179712	179712	Moody	344	“ No , ”
179741	179748	179749	179749	Harry	157	“ Did you use the map ? ”
179752	179756	179758	179758	Moody	344	“ Of course , ”
179767	179794	179758	179758	Moody	344	“ Took a leaf out of your book , Potter . Summoned it from my office into the forest . He was n’t anywhere on there . ”
179795	179801	179803	179803	Ron	170	“ So he did Disapparate ? ”
179805	179816	179818	179818	Hermione	168	“ You ca n’t Disapparate on the grounds , Ron ! ”
179820	179836	179818	179818	Hermione	168	“ There are other ways he could have disappeared , are n’t there , Professor ? ”
179848	179863	179864	179864	he	344	“ You ’re another one who might think about a career as an Auror , ”
179868	179877	179864	179864	he	344	“ Mind works the right way , Granger . ”
179884	179892	179894	179894	Harry	157	“ Well , he was n’t invisible , ”
179896	179912	179894	179894	Harry	157	“ The map shows invisible people . He must ’ve left the grounds , then . ”
179913	179920	179922	179922	Hermione	168	“ But under his own steam ? ”
179925	179932	179922	179922	Hermione	168	“ or because someone made him ? ”
179933	179957	179959	179959	Ron	170	“ Yeah , someone could ’ve — could ’ve pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him , could n’t they ? ”
179982	179990	179992	179992	Moody	344	“ We ca n’t rule out kidnap , ”
179994	179997	179999	179999	Ron	170	“ So , ”
180001	180010	179999	179999	Ron	170	“ d’you reckon he ’s somewhere in Hogsmeade ? ”
180011	180016	180018	180018	Moody	344	“ Could be anywhere , ”
180024	180038	180018	180018	Moody	344	“ Only thing we know for sure is that he ’s not here . ”
180064	180113	180061	180061	he	344	“ Now , Dumbledore ’s told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators , but there ’s nothing you can do for Crouch . The Ministry’ll be looking for him now , Dumbledore ’s notified them . Potter , you just keep your mind on the third task . ”
180114	180117	180119	180119	Harry	157	“ What ? ”
180121	180125	180119	180119	Harry	157	“ Oh yeah ... ”
180146	180157	180159	180159	Moody	344	“ Should be right up your street , this one , ”
180173	180215	180159	180159	Moody	344	“ From what Dumbledore ’s said , you ’ve managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times . Broke your way through a series of obstacles guarding the Sorcerer ’s Stone in your first year , did n’t you ? ”
180216	180220	180221	180221	Ron	170	“ We helped , ”
180225	180231	180221	180221	Ron	170	“ Me and Hermione helped . ”
180235	180257	180259	180259	Moody	344	“ Well , help him practice for this one , and I ’ll be very surprised if he does n’t win , ”
180261	180274	180275	180275	He	344	“ In the meantime ... constant vigilance , Potter . Constant vigilance . ”
180306	180310	180312	180312	Moody	344	“ You two , ”
180322	180354	180314	180314	his	344	“ you stick close to Potter , all right ? I ’m keeping an eye on things , but all the same ... you can never have too many eyes out . ”
180408	180419	180395	180395	She	168	“ Ha ! She has n’t got wind of Crouch ! ”
180630	180646	180648	180648	Harry	157	“ Who ’s he , to lecture me about being out - of - bounds ? ”
180666	180676	180653	180653	he	157	“ After all the stuff he did at school ! ”
180677	180684	180686	180686	Hermione	168	“ He ’s worried about you ! ”
180689	180701	180686	180686	Hermione	168	“ Just like Moody and Hagrid ! So listen to them ! ”
180702	180713	180715	180715	Harry	157	“ No one ’s tried to attack me all year , ”
180717	180728	180715	180715	Harry	157	“ No one ’s done anything to me at all — ”
180729	180740	180742	180742	Hermione	168	“ Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire , ”
180744	180781	180742	180742	Hermione	168	“ And they must ’ve done that for a reason , Harry . Snuffles is right . Maybe they ’ve been biding their time . Maybe this is the task they ’re going to get you . ”
180782	180785	180787	180787	Harry	157	“ Look , ”
180790	180854	180787	180787	Harry	157	“ let ’s say Sirius is right , and someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch . Well , they would ’ve been in the trees near us , would n’t they ? But they waited till I was out of the way until they acted , did n’t they ? So it does n’t look like I ’m their target , does it ? ”
180855	180875	180877	180877	Hermione	168	“ They could n’t have made it look like an accident if they ’d murdered you in the forest ! ”
180879	180888	180877	180877	Hermione	168	“ But if you die during a task — ”
180889	180901	180903	180903	Harry	157	“ They did n’t care about attacking Krum , did they ? ”
180905	180935	180903	180903	Harry	157	“ Why did n’t they just polish me off at the same time ? They could ’ve made it look like Krum and I had a duel or something . ”
180936	180946	180948	180948	Hermione	168	“ Harry , I do n’t understand it either , ”
180951	181018	180948	180948	Hermione	168	“ I just know there are a lot of odd things going on , and I do n’t like it ... Moody ’s right — Sirius is right — you ’ve got to get in training for the third task , straight away . And you make sure you write back to Sirius and promise him you ’re not going to go sneaking off alone again . ”
181104	181112	181113	181113	Ron	170	“ Ca n’t we kidnap Mrs. Norris ? ”
181149	181182	181184	181184	he	157	“ Let ’s Stun her for a bit . Or you could use Dobby , Harry , I bet he ’d do anything to help you . I ’m not complaining or anything ”
181195	181203	181184	181184	he	157	“ but I ’m aching all over ... ”
181204	181217	181219	181219	Hermione	168	“ Well , you keep missing the cushions , do n’t you ! ”
181243	181250	181236	181236	Flitwick	328	“ Just try and fall backward ! ”
181251	181266	181268	181268	Ron	170	“ Once you ’re Stunned , you ca n’t aim too well , Hermione ! ”
181271	181280	181268	181268	Ron	170	“ Why do n’t you take a turn ? ”
181281	181294	181296	181296	Hermione	168	“ Well , I think Harry ’s got it now , anyway , ”
181299	181335	181296	181296	Hermione	168	“ And we do n’t have to worry about Disarming , because he ’s been able to do that for ages ... I think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening . ”
181348	181357	181358	181358	she	168	“ I like the look of this one , ”
181361	181386	181358	181358	she	168	“ this Impediment Curse . Should slow down anything that ’s trying to attack you , Harry . We ’ll start with that one . ”
181408	181414	181419	181419	she	168	“ See you at dinner ! ”
181468	181487	181489	181489	Ron	170	“ It ’s going to be boiling in Trelawney ’s room , she never puts out that fire , ”
181591	181595	181597	181598	Professor Trelawney	304	“ My dears , ”
181623	181675	181618	181618	her	304	“ we have almost finished our work on planetary divination . Today , however , will be an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of Mars , for he is placed most interestingly at the present time . If you will all look this way , I will dim the lights ... ”
181994	182002	182132	182134	the cold voice	660	“ You are in luck , Wormtail , ”
182024	182042	182132	182134	the cold voice	660	“ You are very fortunate indeed . Your blunder has not ruined everything . He is dead . ”
182043	182047	182049	182053	the man on the floor	4012	“ My Lord ! ”
182055	182071	182049	182053	the man on the floor	4012	“ My Lord , I am ... I am so pleased ... and so sorry ... ”
182072	182075	182077	182079	the cold voice	660	“ Nagini , ”
182081	182113	182077	182079	the cold voice	660	“ you are out of luck . I will not be feeding Wormtail to you , after all ... but never mind , never mind ... there is still Harry Potter ... ”
182125	182130	182132	182134	the cold voice	660	“ Now , Wormtail , ”
182136	182152	182132	182134	the cold voice	660	“ perhaps one more little reminder why I will not tolerate another blunder from you ... ”
182153	182163	182189	182191	the cold voice	660	“ My Lord ... no ... I beg you ... ”
182184	182187	182189	182191	the cold voice	660	“ Crucio ! ”
182240	182245	182224	182224	he	157	“ Harry ! Harry ! ”
182307	182312	182313	182313	he	170	“ You all right ? ”
182316	182323	182325	182326	Professor Trelawney	304	“ Of course he is n’t ! ”
182343	182361	182332	182332	Her	304	“ What was it , Potter ? A premonition ? An apparition ? What did you see ? ”
182362	182365	182366	182366	Harry	157	“ Nothing , ”
182402	182409	182411	182412	Professor Trelawney	304	“ You were clutching your scar ! ”
182414	182438	182411	182412	Professor Trelawney	304	“ You were rolling on the floor , clutching your scar ! Come now , Potter , I have experience in these matters ! ”
182445	182458	182459	182459	he	157	“ I need to go to the hospital wing , I think , ”
182462	182466	182439	182439	Harry	157	“ Bad headache . ”
182467	182484	182486	182487	Professor Trelawney	304	“ My dear , you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room ! ”
182489	182508	182486	182487	Professor Trelawney	304	“ If you leave now , you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever — ”
182509	182522	182524	182524	Harry	157	“ I do n’t want to see anything except a headache cure , ”
182540	182545	182546	182546	Harry	157	“ See you later , ”
182805	182809	182810	182810	he	157	“ Lemon drop ? ”
182820	182823	182825	182825	Harry	157	“ Okay , ”
182831	182877	182878	182878	he	157	“ Pear Drop . Er — Licorice Wand . Fizzing Whizbee . Drooble ’s Best Blowing Gum . Bertie Bott ’s Every Flavor Beans ... oh no , he does n’t like them , does he ? ... oh just open , ca n’t you ? ”
182882	182894	182878	182878	he	157	“ I really need to see him , it ’s urgent ! ”
182915	182919	182920	182920	he	157	“ Chocolate Frog ! ”
182929	182936	182920	182920	he	157	“ Sugar Quill ! Cockroach Cluster ! ”
182949	182953	182954	182954	he	157	“ Cockroach Cluster ? ”
182959	182965	182954	182954	he	157	“ I was only joking ... ”
183030	183050	183019	183019	He	157	“ Dumbledore , I ’m afraid I do n’t see the connection , do n’t see it at all ! ”
183064	183119	183061	183062	Cornelius Fudge	254	“ Ludo says Bertha ’s perfectly capable of getting herself lost . I agree we would have expected to have found her by now , but all the same , we ’ve no evidence of foul play , Dumbledore , none at all . As for her disappearance being linked with Barty Crouch ’s ! ”
183120	183134	183136	183136	Moody	344	“ And what do you think ’s happened to Barty Crouch , Minister ? ”
183141	183149	183151	183151	Fudge	254	“ I see two possibilities , Alastor , ”
183153	183186	183151	183151	Fudge	254	“ Either Crouch has finally cracked — more than likely , I ’m sure you ’ll agree , given his personal history — lost his mind , and gone wandering off somewhere — ”
183187	183201	183203	183203	Dumbledore	169	“ He wandered extremely quickly , if that is the case , Cornelius , ”
183206	183212	183213	183213	Fudge	254	“ Or else — well ... ”
183217	183256	183213	183213	Fudge	254	“ Well , I ’ll reserve judgment until after I ’ve seen the place where he was found , but you say it was just past the Beauxbatons carriage ? Dumbledore , you know what that woman is ? ”
183257	183273	183275	183275	Dumbledore	169	“ I consider her to be a very able headmistress — and an excellent dancer , ”
183278	183283	183285	183285	Fudge	254	“ Dumbledore , come ! ”
183288	183330	183285	183285	Fudge	254	“ Do n’t you think you might be prejudiced in her favor because of Hagrid ? They do n’t all turn out harmless — if , indeed , you can call Hagrid harmless , with that monster fixation he ’s got — ”
183331	183341	183343	183343	Dumbledore	169	“ I no more suspect Madame Maxime than Hagrid , ”
183349	183364	183343	183343	Dumbledore	169	“ I think it possible that it is you who are prejudiced , Cornelius . ”
183365	183373	183375	183375	Moody	344	“ Can we wrap up this discussion ? ”
183377	183392	183394	183394	Fudge	254	“ Yes , yes , let ’s go down to the grounds , then , ”
183397	183405	183407	183407	Moody	344	“ No , it ’s not that , ”
183409	183430	183407	183407	Moody	344	“ it ’s just that Potter wants a word with you , Dumbledore . He ’s just outside the door . ”
183438	183443	183445	183445	Moody	344	“ Hello , Potter , ”
183447	183453	183445	183445	Moody	344	“ Come in , then . ”
183525	183528	183530	183530	Fudge	254	“ Harry ! ”
183536	183541	183530	183530	Fudge	254	“ How are you ? ”
183542	183545	183546	183546	Harry	157	“ Fine , ”
183549	183566	183568	183568	Fudge	254	“ We were just talking about the night when Mr. Crouch turned up on the grounds , ”
183570	183582	183568	183568	Fudge	254	“ It was you who found him , was it not ? ”
183583	183586	183588	183588	Harry	157	“ Yes , ”
183612	183635	183609	183609	he	157	“ I did n’t see Madame Maxime anywhere , though , and she ’d have a job hiding , would n’t she ? ”
183649	183654	183656	183656	Fudge	254	“ Yes , well , ”
183661	183693	183656	183656	Fudge	254	“ we ’re about to go for a short walk on the grounds , Harry , if you ’ll excuse us ... perhaps if you just go back to your class — ”
183694	183704	183705	183705	Harry	157	“ I wanted to talk to you , Professor , ”
183722	183730	183731	183731	he	254	“ Wait here for me , Harry , ”
183734	183745	183731	183731	he	254	“ Our examination of the grounds will not take long . ”
183784	183789	183790	183790	he	157	“ Hello , Fawkes , ”
184856	184859	184860	184860	Harry	157	“ Professor ! ”
184869	184897	184860	184860	Harry	157	“ I ’m sorry — I did n’t mean to — I was just looking at that basin in your cabinet — I — where are we ? ”
185468	185472	185500	185500	Crouch	199	“ Igor Karkaroff , ”
185519	185549	185513	185513	he	199	“ You have been brought from Azkaban to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic . You have given us to understand that you have important information for us . ”
185564	185570	185571	185571	he	373	“ I have , sir , ”
185593	185643	185571	185571	he	373	“ I wish to be of use to the Ministry . I wish to help . I — I know that the Ministry is trying to — to round up the last of the Dark Lord ’s supporters . I am eager to assist in any way I can ... ”
185689	185692	185677	185677	Dumbledore	169	“ Filth . ”
185752	185761	185762	185762	Moody	294	“ Crouch is going to let him out , ”
185768	185820	185762	185762	Moody	294	“ He ’s done a deal with him . Took me six months to track him down , and Crouch is going to let him go if he ’s got enough new names . Let ’s hear his information , I say , and throw him straight back to the dementors . ”
185835	185854	185856	185856	Moody	294	“ Ah , I was forgetting ... you do n’t like the dementors , do you , Albus ? ”
185862	185865	185867	185867	Dumbledore	169	“ No , ”
185870	185893	185867	185867	Dumbledore	169	“ I ’m afraid I do n’t . I have long felt the Ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures . ”
185894	185901	185902	185902	Moody	294	“ But for filth like this ... ”
185906	185917	185919	185920	Mr. Crouch	199	“ You say you have names for us , Karkaroff , ”
185922	185930	185919	185920	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Let us hear them , please . ”
185931	185936	185938	185938	Karkaroff	373	“ You must understand , ”
185941	185990	185938	185938	Karkaroff	373	“ that He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named operated always in the greatest secrecy ... He preferred that we — I mean to say , his supporters — and I regret now , very deeply , that I ever counted myself among them — ”
185991	185997	185999	185999	Moody	294	“ Get on with it , ”
186001	186024	185999	185999	Moody	294	“ — we never knew the names of every one of our fellows — He alone knew exactly who we all were — ”
186025	186052	186054	186054	Moody	294	“ Which was a wise move , was n’t it , as it prevented someone like you , Karkaroff , from turning all of them in , ”
186056	186067	186069	186070	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Yet you say you have some names for us ? ”
186072	186078	186080	186080	Karkaroff	373	“ I — I do , ”
186083	186131	186080	186080	Karkaroff	373	“ And these were important supporters , mark you . People I saw with my own eyes doing his bidding . I give this information as a sign that I fully and totally renounce him , and am filled with a remorse so deep I can barely — ”
186132	186137	186139	186140	Mr. Crouch	199	“ These names are ? ”
186149	186155	186156	186156	he	373	“ There was Antonin Dolohov , ”
186159	186179	186156	186156	he	373	“ I — I saw him torture countless Muggles and — and non - supporters of the Dark Lord . ”
186180	186187	186189	186189	Moody	294	“ And helped him do it , ”
186191	186198	186200	186200	Crouch	199	“ We have already apprehended Dolohov , ”
186202	186210	186200	186200	Crouch	199	“ He was caught shortly after yourself . ”
186211	186214	186216	186216	Karkaroff	373	“ Indeed ? ”
186222	186232	186216	186216	Karkaroff	373	“ I — I am delighted to hear it ! ”
186262	186266	186268	186268	Crouch	199	“ Any others ? ”
186271	186280	186282	186282	Karkaroff	373	“ Why , yes ... there was Rosier , ”
186285	186289	186282	186282	Karkaroff	373	“ Evan Rosier . ”
186290	186295	186297	186297	Crouch	199	“ Rosier is dead , ”
186299	186324	186297	186297	Crouch	199	“ He was caught shortly after you were too . He preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was killed in the struggle . ”
186325	186336	186338	186338	Moody	294	“ Took a bit of me with him , though , ”
186366	186375	186377	186377	Karkaroff	373	“ No — no more than Rosier deserved ! ”
186433	186437	186439	186439	Crouch	199	“ Any more ? ”
186441	186444	186446	186446	Karkaroff	373	“ Yes ! ”
186448	186504	186446	186446	Karkaroff	373	“ There was Travers — he helped murder the McKinnons ! Mulciber — he specialized in the Imperius Curse , forced countless people to do horrific things ! Rookwood , who was a spy , and passed He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named useful information from inside the Ministry itself ! ”
186526	186529	186531	186532	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Rookwood ? ”
186553	186562	186548	186548	her	4118	“ Augustus Rookwood of the Department of Mysteries ? ”
186563	186568	186570	186570	Karkaroff	373	“ The very same , ”
186573	186597	186570	186570	Karkaroff	373	“ I believe he used a network of well - placed wizards , both inside the Ministry and out , to collect information — ”
186598	186606	186608	186609	Mr. Crouch	199	“ But Travers and Mulciber we have , ”
186611	186632	186608	186609	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Very well , Karkaroff , if that is all , you will be returned to Azkaban while we decide — ”
186633	186637	186639	186639	Karkaroff	373	“ Not yet ! ”
186645	186652	186639	186639	Karkaroff	373	“ Wait , I have more ! ”
186676	186679	186680	186680	he	157	“ Snape ! ”
186683	186687	186680	186680	he	157	“ Severus Snape ! ”
186688	186697	186699	186699	Crouch	199	“ Snape has been cleared by this council , ”
186702	186712	186699	186699	Crouch	199	“ He has been vouched for by Albus Dumbledore . ”
186713	186716	186718	186718	Karkaroff	373	“ No ! ”
186731	186743	186718	186718	Karkaroff	373	“ I assure you ! Severus Snape is a Death Eater ! ”
186751	186761	186762	186762	he	169	“ I have given evidence already on this matter , ”
186766	186809	186762	186762	he	169	“ Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater . However , he rejoined our side before Lord Voldemort ’s downfall and turned spy for us , at great personal risk . He is now no more a Death Eater than I am . ”
186833	186839	186840	186840	Crouch	199	“ Very well , Karkaroff , ”
186844	186866	186840	186840	Crouch	199	“ you have been of assistance . I shall review your case . You will return to Azkaban in the meantime ... ”
187177	187206	187208	187209	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Ludo Bagman , you have been brought here in front of the Council of Magical Law to answer charges relating to the activities of the Death Eaters , ”
187211	187242	187208	187209	Mr. Crouch	199	“ We have heard the evidence against you , and are about to reach our verdict . Do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce judgment ? ”
187257	187260	187262	187262	Bagman	201	“ Only , ”
187267	187281	187262	187262	Bagman	201	“ well — I know I ’ve been a bit of an idiot — ”
187322	187332	187333	187333	someone	719	“ You never spoke a truer word , boy , ”
187351	187377	187346	187346	Moody	294	“ If I did n’t know he ’d always been dim , I ’d have said some of those Bludgers had permanently affected his brain ... ”
187378	187393	187395	187396	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Ludovic Bagman , you were caught passing information to Lord Voldemort ’s supporters , ”
187398	187415	187395	187396	Mr. Crouch	199	“ For this , I suggest a term of imprisonment in Azkaban lasting no less than — ”
187452	187464	187465	187465	Bagman	494	“ But I ’ve told you , I had no idea ! ”
187480	187565	187474	187474	his	494	“ None at all ! Old Rookwood was a friend of my dad ’s ... never crossed my mind he was in with You - Know - Who ! I thought I was collecting information for our side ! And Rookwood kept talking about getting me a job in the Ministry later on ... once my Quidditch days are over , you know ... I mean , I ca n’t keep getting hit by Bludgers for the rest of my life , can I ? ”
187573	187582	187584	187585	Mr. Crouch	199	“ It will be put to the vote , ”
187600	187615	187588	187588	He	199	“ The jury will please raise their hands ... those in favor of imprisonment ... ”
187658	187661	187663	187663	Crouch	199	“ Yes ? ”
187665	187689	187690	187691	the witch	4143	“ We ’d just like to congratulate Mr. Bagman on his splendid performance for England in the Quidditch match against Turkey last Saturday , ”
187718	187721	187722	187723	Mr. Crouch	199	“ Despicable , ”
187738	187762	187731	187731	Bagman	201	“ Rookwood get him a job indeed ... The day Ludo Bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the Ministry ... ”
187862	187867	187868	187868	he	157	“ Bring them in , ”
188086	188099	188100	188100	he	199	“ You have been brought here before the Council of Magical Law , ”
188104	188120	188100	188100	he	199	“ so that we may pass judgment on you , for a crime so heinous — ”
188121	188124	188126	188133	the boy with the straw - colored hair	4161	“ Father , ”
188135	188140	188126	188133	the boy with the straw - colored hair	4161	“ Father ... please ... ”
188141	188156	188158	188158	Crouch	199	“ — that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court , ”
188171	188228	188158	188158	Crouch	199	“ We have heard the evidence against you . The four of you stand accused of capturing an Auror — Frank Longbottom — and subjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse , believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master , He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named — ”
188229	188236	188238	188242	the boy in chains below	4163	“ Father , I did n’t ! ”
188244	188264	188238	188242	the boy in chains below	4163	“ I did n’t , I swear it , Father , do n’t send me back to the dementors — ”
188265	188271	188273	188274	Mr. Crouch	199	“ You are further accused , ”
188276	188335	188273	188274	Mr. Crouch	199	“ of using the Cruciatus Curse on Frank Longbottom ’s wife , when he would not give you information . You planned to restore He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named to power , and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong . I now ask the jury — ”
188336	188339	188341	188342	the boy	4758	“ Mother ! ”
188361	188380	188346	188351	the wispy little witch beside Crouch	4160	“ Mother , stop him , Mother , I did n’t do it , it was n’t me ! ”
188381	188388	188390	188391	Mr. Crouch	199	“ I now ask the jury , ”
188393	188416	188390	188391	Mr. Crouch	199	“ to raise their hands if they believe , as I do , that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban ! ”
188464	188499	188458	188459	The boy	4758	“ No ! Mother , no ! I did n’t do it , I did n’t do it , I did n’t know ! Do n’t send me there , do n’t let him ! ”
188535	188587	188531	188531	Crouch	199	“ The Dark Lord will rise again , Crouch ! Throw us into Azkaban ; we will wait ! He will rise again and will come for us , he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters ! We alone were faithful ! We alone tried to find him ! ”
188642	188648	188649	188649	he	4758	“ I ’m your son ! ”
188655	188661	188649	188649	he	4758	“ I ’m your son ! ”
188662	188670	188672	188673	Mr. Crouch	199	“ You are no son of mine ! ”
188680	188686	188675	188675	his	199	“ I have no son ! ”
188713	188718	188719	188719	Crouch	199	“ Take them away ! ”
188731	188742	188719	188719	Crouch	199	“ Take them away , and may they rot there ! ”
188743	188761	188719	188719	Crouch	199	“ Father ! Father , I was n’t involved ! No ! No ! Father , please ! ”
188762	188777	188719	188719	Crouch	199	“ I think , Harry , it is time to return to my office , ”
188838	188841	188843	188844	the Dumbledore	169	“ Come , ”
188937	188940	188941	188941	Harry	157	“ Professor , ”
188944	188966	188941	188941	Harry	157	“ I know I should n’t ’ve — I did n’t mean — the cabinet door was sort of open and — ”
188967	188972	188974	188974	Dumbledore	169	“ I quite understand , ”
189044	189049	189050	189050	Harry	157	“ What is it ? ”
189054	189063	189065	189065	Dumbledore	169	“ This ? It is called a Pensieve , ”
189067	189095	189065	189065	Dumbledore	169	“ I sometimes find , and I am sure you know the feeling , that I simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind . ”
189096	189099	189101	189101	Harry	157	“ Er , ”
189118	189123	189125	189125	Dumbledore	169	“ At these times , ”
189132	189182	189125	189125	Dumbledore	169	“ I use the Pensieve . One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one ’s mind , pours them into the basin , and examines them at one ’s leisure . It becomes easier to spot patterns and links , you understand , when they are in this form . ”
189183	189193	189194	189194	Harry	157	“ You mean ... that stuff ’s your thoughts ? ”
189207	189210	189212	189212	Dumbledore	169	“ Certainly , ”
189214	189220	189212	189212	Dumbledore	169	“ Let me show you . ”
189366	189382	189353	189353	his	331	“ It ’s coming back ... Karkaroff ’s too ... stronger and clearer than ever ... ”
189383	189393	189394	189394	Dumbledore	169	“ A connection I could have made without assistance , ”
189397	189402	189403	189403	He	169	“ but never mind . ”
189434	189473	189421	189421	Snape	331	“ I was using the Pensieve when Mr. Fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather hastily . Undoubtedly I did not fasten the cabinet door properly . Naturally , it would have attracted your attention . ”
189474	189479	189480	189480	Harry	157	“ I ’m sorry , ”
189488	189495	189496	189496	he	169	“ Curiosity is not a sin , ”
189499	189513	189496	189496	he	169	“ But we should exercise caution with our curiosity ... yes , indeed ... ”
189600	189635	189578	189578	her	4191	“ He put a hex on me , Professor Dumbledore , and I was only teasing him , sir , I only said I ’d seen him kissing Florence behind the greenhouses last Thursday ... ”
189636	189642	189644	189644	Dumbledore	169	“ But why , Bertha , ”
189656	189669	189644	189644	Dumbledore	169	“ why did you have to follow him in the first place ? ”
189670	189673	189674	189674	Harry	157	“ Bertha ? ”
189682	189691	189674	189674	Harry	157	“ Is that — was that Bertha Jorkins ? ”
189692	189695	189697	189697	Dumbledore	169	“ Yes , ”
189722	189733	189707	189707	Bertha	159	“ That was Bertha as I remember her at school . ”
189784	189789	189791	189791	Dumbledore	169	“ So , Harry , ”
189794	189810	189791	189791	Dumbledore	169	“ Before you got lost in my thoughts , you wanted to tell me something . ”
189811	189814	189816	189816	Harry	157	“ Yes , ”
189818	189836	189816	189816	Harry	157	“ Professor — I was in Divination just now , and — er — I fell asleep . ”
189853	189859	189849	189849	Dumbledore	169	“ Quite understandable . Continue . ”
189860	189868	189870	189870	Harry	157	“ Well , I had a dream , ”
189872	189889	189870	189870	Harry	157	“ A dream about Lord Voldemort . He was torturing Wormtail ... you know who Wormtail — ”
189890	189895	189897	189897	Dumbledore	169	“ I do know , ”
189900	189904	189897	189897	Dumbledore	169	“ Please continue . ”
189905	189982	189983	189983	Harry	157	“ Voldemort got a letter from an owl . He said something like , Wormtail ’s blunder had been repaired . He said someone was dead . Then he said , Wormtail would n’t be fed to the snake — there was a snake beside his chair . He said — he said he ’d be feeding me to it , instead . Then he did the Cruciatus Curse on Wormtail — and my scar hurt , ”
189986	189997	189983	189983	Harry	157	“ It woke me up , it hurt so badly . ”
190004	190011	190013	190013	Harry	157	“ Er — that ’s all , ”
190015	190019	190021	190021	Dumbledore	169	“ I see , ”
190024	190052	190021	190021	Dumbledore	169	“ I see . Now , has your scar hurt at any other time this year , excepting the time it woke you up over the summer ? ”
190053	190070	190072	190072	Harry	157	“ No , I — how did you know it woke me up over the summer ? ”
190076	190085	190087	190087	Dumbledore	169	“ You are not Sirius ’s only correspondent , ”
190089	190123	190087	190087	Dumbledore	169	“ I have also been in contact with him ever since he left Hogwarts last year . It was I who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay . ”
190190	190193	190194	190194	he	169	“ Professor ? ”
190212	190216	190217	190217	he	169	“ My apologies , ”
190229	190241	190221	190221	He	169	“ D’you — d’you know why my scar ’s hurting me ? ”
190256	190295	190242	190242	Dumbledore	169	“ I have a theory , no more than that ... It is my belief that your scar hurts both when Lord Voldemort is near you , and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred . ”
190296	190301	190242	190242	Dumbledore	169	“ But ... why ? ”
190302	190315	190317	190317	Dumbledore	169	“ Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed , ”
190319	190326	190317	190317	Dumbledore	169	“ That is no ordinary scar . ”
190327	190340	190242	190242	Dumbledore	169	“ So you think ... that dream ... did it really happen ? ”
190341	190346	190348	190348	Dumbledore	169	“ It is possible , ”
190350	190364	190348	190348	Dumbledore	169	“ I would say — probable . Harry — did you see Voldemort ? ”
190365	190368	190370	190370	Harry	157	“ No , ”
190372	190419	190420	190420	Harry	157	“ Just the back of his chair . But — there would n’t have been anything to see , would there ? I mean , he has n’t got a body , has he ? But ... but then how could he have held the wand ? ”
190424	190428	190430	190430	Dumbledore	169	“ How indeed ? ”
190432	190436	190430	190430	Dumbledore	169	“ How indeed ... ”
190482	190485	190486	190486	Harry	157	“ Professor , ”
190491	190500	190486	190486	Harry	157	“ do you think he ’s getting stronger ? ”
190501	190504	190506	190506	Dumbledore	169	“ Voldemort ? ”
190555	190569	190537	190537	Dumbledore	169	“ Once again , Harry , I can only give you my suspicions . ”
190585	190595	190596	190596	he	169	“ The years of Voldemort ’s ascent to power , ”
190606	190632	190599	190599	Dumbledore	169	“ These disappearances seem to me to be linked . The Ministry disagrees — as you may have heard , while waiting outside my office . ”
190668	190671	190672	190672	he	157	“ Professor ? ”
190676	190681	190683	190683	Dumbledore	169	“ Yes , Harry ? ”
190685	190705	190683	190683	Dumbledore	169	“ Er ... could I ask you about ... that court thing I was in ... in the Pensieve ? ”
190706	190710	190712	190712	Dumbledore	169	“ You could , ”
190715	190737	190712	190712	Dumbledore	169	“ I attended it many times , but some trials come back to me more clearly than others ... particularly now ... ”
190738	190768	190683	190683	Dumbledore	169	“ You know — you know the trial you found me in ? The one with Crouch ’s son ? Well ... were they talking about Neville ’s parents ? ”
190777	190793	190794	190794	he	169	“ Has Neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother ? ”
190827	190838	190840	190840	Dumbledore	169	“ Yes , they were talking about Neville ’s parents , ”
190842	190878	190840	190840	Dumbledore	169	“ His father , Frank , was an Auror just like Professor Moody . He and his wife were tortured for information about Voldemort ’s whereabouts after he lost his powers , as you heard . ”
190879	190885	190887	190887	Harry	157	“ So they ’re dead ? ”
190890	190893	190895	190895	Dumbledore	169	“ No , ”
190910	190949	190895	190895	Dumbledore	169	“ They are insane . They are both in St. Mungo ’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries . I believe Neville visits them , with his grandmother , during the holidays . They do not recognize him . ”
190974	190981	190983	190983	Dumbledore	169	“ The Longbottoms were very popular , ”
190985	191050	190983	190983	Dumbledore	169	“ The attacks on them came after Voldemort ’s fall from power , just when everyone thought they were safe . Those attacks caused a wave of fury such as I have never known . The Ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it . Unfortunately , the Longbottoms ’ evidence was — given their condition — none too reliable . ”
191051	191063	191065	191065	Harry	157	“ Then Mr. Crouch ’s son might not have been involved ? ”
191073	191083	191070	191070	his	169	“ As to that , I have no idea . ”
191119	191122	191123	191123	he	157	“ Er , ”
191126	191130	191123	191123	he	157	“ Mr. Bagman ... ”
191131	191143	191145	191145	Dumbledore	169	“ ... has never been accused of any Dark activity since , ”
191148	191151	191153	191153	Harry	157	“ Right , ”
191178	191183	191172	191172	Dumbledore	169	“ And ... er ... ”
191218	191225	191226	191226	he	169	“ No more has Professor Snape , ”
191257	191271	191232	191232	Dumbledore	169	“ What made you think he ’d really stopped supporting Voldemort , Professor ? ”
191286	191300	191272	191272	Dumbledore	169	“ That , Harry , is a matter between Professor Snape and myself . ”
191341	191344	191345	191345	he	157	“ Harry , ”
191353	191380	191345	191345	he	157	“ Please do not speak about Neville ’s parents to anybody else . He has the right to let people know , when he is ready . ”
191381	191386	191388	191388	Harry	157	“ Yes , Professor , ”
191394	191397	191345	191345	he	157	“ And — ”
191438	191446	191426	191426	He	169	“ Good luck with the third task . ”
191447	191462	191463	191463	Ron	170	“ Dumbledore reckons You - Know - Who ’s getting stronger again as well ? ”
191596	191602	191603	191603	Ron	170	“ And he trusts Snape ? ”
191606	191622	191603	191603	Ron	170	“ He really trusts Snape , even though he knows he was a Death Eater ? ”
191623	191626	191628	191628	Harry	157	“ Yes , ”
191668	191672	191673	191673	she	168	“ Rita Skeeter , ”
191677	191687	191689	191689	Ron	170	“ How can you be worrying about her now ? ”
191695	191703	191704	191704	Hermione	168	“ I ’m not worrying about her , ”
191710	191802	191704	191704	Hermione	168	“ I ’m just thinking ... remember what she said to me in the Three Broomsticks ? ‘ I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl . ’ This is what she meant , is n’t it ? She reported his trial , she knew he ’d passed information to the Death Eaters . And Winky too , remember ... ‘ Ludo Bagman ’s a bad wizard . ’ Mr. Crouch would have been furious he got off , he would have talked about it at home . ”
191803	191818	191819	191819	Hermione	168	“ Yeah , but Bagman did n’t pass information on purpose , did he ? ”
191822	191831	191832	191832	Ron	170	“ And Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked Crouch ? ”
191840	191843	191845	191845	Harry	157	“ Yeah , ”
191847	191862	191845	191845	Harry	157	“ but he ’s only saying that because Crouch disappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage . ”
191863	191873	191875	191875	Ron	170	“ We never thought of her , did we ? ”
191878	191898	191875	191875	Ron	170	“ Mind you , she ’s definitely got giant blood , and she does n’t want to admit it — ”
191899	191906	191908	191908	Hermione	168	“ Of course she does n’t , ”
191914	191974	191908	191908	Hermione	168	“ Look what happened to Hagrid when Rita found out about his mother . Look at Fudge , jumping to conclusions about her , just because she ’s part giant . Who needs that sort of prejudice ? I ’d probably say I had big bones if I knew that ’s what I ’d get for telling the truth . ”
191981	191989	191990	191990	she	168	“ We have n’t done any practicing ! ”
191996	192029	191990	191990	she	168	“ We were going to do the Impediment Curse ! We ’ll have to really get down to it tomorrow ! Come on , Harry , you need to get some sleep . ”
192296	192303	192304	192304	Hermione	168	“ Do n’t worry about it , ”
192328	192356	192308	192308	Harry	157	“ at least we ’ll get top marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts . We ’d never have found out about all these hexes in class . ”
192357	192367	192369	192369	Ron	170	“ Good training for when we ’re all Aurors , ”
192666	192676	192677	192677	Hermione	168	“ You ’re still doing really well , though , ”
192695	192706	192683	192683	her	168	“ Some of these are bound to come in handy . ”
192707	192714	192716	192716	Ron	170	“ Come and look at this , ”
192733	192739	192725	192725	He	170	“ What ’s Malfoy doing ? ”
192791	192803	192805	192805	Harry	157	“ He looks like he ’s using a walkie - talkie , ”
192808	192814	192816	192816	Hermione	168	“ He ca n’t be , ”
192818	192839	192840	192840	she	168	“ I ’ve told you , those sorts of things do n’t work around Hogwarts . Come on , Harry , ”
192859	192868	192840	192840	she	168	“ let ’s try that Shield Charm again . ”
193187	193190	193192	193192	Harry	157	“ What ? ”
193201	193204	193206	193206	Hermione	168	“ Nothing , ”
193231	193242	193223	193223	He	170	“ No way . Not today . That old cow . ”
193243	193246	193248	193248	Harry	157	“ What ? ”
193250	193255	193248	193248	Harry	157	“ Rita Skeeter again ? ”
193256	193259	193261	193261	Ron	170	“ No , ”
193278	193288	193290	193290	Harry	157	“ It ’s about me , is n’t it ? ”
193292	193295	193297	193297	Ron	170	“ No , ”
193327	193355	193315	193316	Draco Malfoy	256	“ Hey , Potter ! Potter ! How ’s your head ? You feeling all right ? Sure you ’re not going to go berserk on us ? ”
193386	193392	193393	193393	Harry	157	“ Let me see it , ”
193398	193403	193393	193393	Harry	157	“ Give it here . ”
193431	193442	193444	193444	Harry	157	“ Gone off me a bit , has n’t she ? ”
193488	193499	193500	193500	Ron	170	“ How did she know your scar hurt in Divination ? ”
193503	193521	193500	193500	Ron	170	“ There ’s no way she was there , there ’s no way she could ’ve heard — ”
193522	193528	193530	193530	Harry	157	“ The window was open , ”
193532	193539	193530	193530	Harry	157	“ I opened it to breathe . ”
193540	193550	193551	193551	Hermione	168	“ You were at the top of North Tower ! ”
193554	193569	193551	193551	Hermione	168	“ Your voice could n’t have carried all the way down to the grounds ! ”
193570	193588	193590	193590	Harry	157	“ Well , you ’re the one who ’s supposed to be researching magical methods of bugging ! ”
193592	193601	193590	193590	Harry	157	“ You tell me how she did it ! ”
193602	193608	193610	193610	Hermione	168	“ I ’ve been trying ! ”
193612	193618	193610	193610	Hermione	168	“ But I ... but ... ”
193644	193650	193652	193652	Ron	170	“ Are you all right ? ”
193658	193661	193663	193663	Hermione	168	“ Yes , ”
193703	193710	193711	193711	Hermione	168	“ I ’ve had an idea , ”
193718	193783	193711	193711	Hermione	168	“ I think I know ... because then no one would be able to see ... even Moody ... and she ’d have been able to get onto the window ledge ... but she ’s not allowed ... she ’s definitely not allowed ... I think we ’ve got her ! Just give me two seconds in the library — just to make sure ! ”
193800	193803	193804	193804	Ron	170	“ Oi ! ”
193809	193824	193825	193825	he	170	“ We ’ve got our History of Magic exam in ten minutes ! Blimey , ”
193833	193864	193825	193825	he	170	“ she must really hate that Skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam . What ’re you going to do in Binns ’s class — read again ? ”
193902	193906	193907	193907	Harry	157	“ S’pose so , ”
193927	193943	193944	193944	she	318	“ Potter , the champions are congregating in the chamber off the Hall after breakfast , ”
193947	193956	193958	193958	Harry	157	“ But the task ’s not till tonight ! ”
193975	193984	193985	193985	she	318	“ I ’m aware of that , Potter , ”
193988	194015	193985	193985	she	318	“ The champions ’ families are invited to watch the final task , you know . This is simply a chance for you to greet them . ”
194025	194039	194040	194040	he	157	“ She does n’t expect the Dursleys to turn up , does she ? ”
194045	194048	194050	194050	Ron	170	“ Dunno , ”
194052	194073	194050	194050	Ron	170	“ Harry , I ’d better hurry , I ’m going to be late for Binns . See you later . ”
194195	194207	194191	194191	his	208	“ Harry , come on , they ’re waiting for you ! ”
194340	194343	194344	194345	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Surprise ! ”
194358	194369	194370	194370	She	173	“ Thought we ’d come and watch you , Harry ! ”
194380	194385	194387	194387	Bill	184	“ You all right ? ”
194397	194420	194387	194387	Bill	184	“ Charlie wanted to come , but he could n’t get time off . He said you were incredible against the Horntail . ”
194457	194465	194466	194466	Harry	157	“ This is really nice of you , ”
194472	194482	194466	194466	Harry	157	“ I thought for a moment — the Dursleys — ”
194483	194486	194488	194489	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Hmm , ”
194518	194526	194528	194528	Bill	184	“ It ’s great being back here , ”
194551	194574	194535	194535	Violet	390	“ Have n’t seen this place for five years . Is that picture of the mad knight still around ? Sir Cadogan ? ”
194575	194579	194581	194581	Harry	157	“ Oh yeah , ”
194592	194598	194600	194600	Bill	184	“ And the Fat Lady ? ”
194602	194610	194612	194613	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ She was here in my time , ”
194615	194638	194612	194613	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ She gave me such a telling off one night when I got back to the dormitory at four in the morning — ”
194639	194654	194656	194656	Bill	184	“ What were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning ? ”
194672	194684	194685	194685	she	173	“ Your father and I had been for a nighttime stroll , ”
194688	194712	194685	194685	she	173	“ He got caught by Apollyon Pringle — he was the caretaker in those days — your father ’s still got the marks . ”
194713	194722	194724	194724	Bill	184	“ Fancy giving us a tour , Harry ? ”
194726	194731	194733	194733	Harry	157	“ Yeah , okay , ”
194759	194767	194768	194768	he	207	“ There you are , are you ? ”
194777	194800	194768	194768	he	207	“ Bet you ’re not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedric ’s caught you up on points , are you ? ”
194801	194804	194806	194806	Harry	157	“ What ? ”
194808	194812	194814	194814	Cedric	208	“ Ignore him , ”
194827	194857	194814	194814	Cedric	208	“ He ’s been angry ever since Rita Skeeter ’s article about the Triwizard Tournament — you know , when she made out you were the only Hogwarts champion . ”
194858	194871	194873	194874	Amos Diggory	207	“ Did n’t bother to correct her , though , did he ? ”
194897	194916	194895	194895	Bill	184	“ Still ... you ’ll show him , Ced . Beaten him once before , have n’t you ? ”
194917	194931	194932	194933	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble , Amos ! ”
194937	194952	194932	194933	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ I would have thought you ’d know that , working at the Ministry ! ”
195045	195050	195051	195051	Harry	157	“ How ’s Percy ? ”
195060	195064	195066	195066	Bill	184	“ Not good , ”
195068	195074	195076	195077	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ He ’s very upset , ”
195086	195166	195080	195080	her	173	“ The Ministry wants to keep Mr. Crouch ’s disappearance quiet , but Percy ’s been hauled in for questioning about the instructions Mr. Crouch has been sending in . They seem to think there ’s a chance they were n’t genuinely written by him . Percy ’s been under a lot of strain . They ’re not letting him fill in for Mr. Crouch as the fifth judge tonight . Cornelius Fudge is going to be doing it . ”
195175	195180	195182	195182	Ron	170	“ Mum — Bill ! ”
195194	195201	195182	195182	Ron	170	“ What ’re you doing here ? ”
195202	195212	195214	195215	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Come to watch Harry in the last task ! ”
195218	195239	195214	195215	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ I must say , it makes a lovely change , not having to cook . How was your exam ? ”
195240	195245	195247	195247	Ron	170	“ Oh ... okay , ”
195249	195271	195272	195272	he	170	“ Could n’t remember all the goblin rebels ’ names , so I invented a few . It ’s all right , ”
195288	195308	195283	195284	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ they ’re all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean ; it was n’t hard . ”
195378	195387	195369	195369	she	168	“ Are you going to tell us — ? ”
195399	195404	195406	195407	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Hello , Hermione , ”
195415	195418	195420	195420	Hermione	168	“ Hello , ”
195443	195470	195435	195435	Harry	157	“ Mrs. Weasley , you did n’t believe that rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote in Witch Weekly , did you ? Because Hermione ’s not my girlfriend . ”
195471	195474	195476	195477	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Oh ! ”
195479	195488	195476	195477	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ No — of course I did n’t ! ”
195644	195693	195633	195633	his	169	“ Ladies and gentlemen , in five minutes ’ time , I will be asking you to make your way down to the Quidditch field for the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament . Will the champions please follow Mr. Bagman down to the stadium now . ”

203736	203788	203732	203732	he	158	“ A Muggle and a fool ... very like your dear mother . But they both had their uses , did they not ? Your mother died to defend you as a child ... and I killed my father , and see how useful he has proved himself , in death ... ”
203830	203839	203840	203840	he	158	“ Listen to me , reliving family history ... ”

204903	204928	204898	204898	Lucius	255	“ Yes , I know all about that , Lucius ... You have disappointed me ... I expect more faithful service in the future . ”

205090	205095	205049	205049	Voldemort	158	“ Yes , Master ... ”
205096	205102	205049	205049	Voldemort	158	“ We will , Master ... ”
205103	205112	205114	205114	Voldemort	158	“ The same goes for you , Nott , ”
205128	205144	205049	205049	Voldemort	158	“ My Lord , I prostrate myself before you , I am your most faithful — ”
205145	205150	205152	205152	Voldemort	158	“ That will do , ”
205184	205247	205164	205164	he	158	“ And here we have six missing Death Eaters ... three dead in my service . One , too cowardly to return ... he will pay . One , who I believe has left me forever ... he will be killed , of course ... and one , who remains my most faithful servant , and who has already reentered my service . ”
205267	205293	205300	205300	his	158	“ He is at Hogwarts , that faithful servant , and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight ... Yes , ”
205315	205341	205300	205300	his	158	“ Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party . One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor . ”
205369	205401	205360	205360	Lucius	255	“ Master , we crave to know ... we beg you to tell us ... how you have achieved this ... this miracle ... how you managed to return to us ... ”
205402	205413	205415	205415	Voldemort	158	“ Ah , what a story it is , Lucius , ”
205417	205431	205415	205415	Voldemort	158	“ And it begins — and ends — with my young friend here . ”
205481	205521	205467	205467	his	158	“ His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice ... This is old magic , I should have remembered it , I was foolish to overlook it ... but no matter . I can touch him now . ”
205671	205674	205666	205666	He	158	“ Crucio ! ”
205773	205797	205799	205799	Voldemort	158	“ You see , I think , how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me , ”
205801	205815	205816	205816	Wormtail	153	“ Now untie him , Wormtail , and give him back his wand . ”
205981	205993	205998	205998	his	158	“ You have been taught how to duel , Harry Potter ? ”

206135	206144	206146	206146	Voldemort	158	“ We bow to each other , Harry , ”
206161	206184	206146	206146	Voldemort	158	“ Come , the niceties must be observed ... Dumbledore would like you to show manners ... Bow to death , Harry ... ”
206228	206234	206235	206235	Voldemort	158	“ I said , bow , ”
206270	206274	206281	206281	he	158	“ Very good , ”
206294	206323	206290	206290	Harry	157	“ And now you face me , like a man ... straight - backed and proud , the way your father died ... And now — we duel . ”
206463	206468	206470	206470	Voldemort	158	“ A little break , ”
206481	206508	206470	206470	Voldemort	158	“ a little pause ... That hurt , did n’t it , Harry ? You do n’t want me to do that again , do you ? ”
206571	206584	206586	206586	Voldemort	158	“ I asked you whether you want me to do that again , ”
206589	206595	206586	206586	Voldemort	158	“ Answer me ! Imperio ! ”
206692	206696	206676	206676	I	0	“ I WON’T ! ”

206779	206808	206771	206773	the Death Eaters	5230	“ You wo n’t say no ? Harry , obedience is a virtue I need to teach you before you die ... Perhaps another little dose of pain ? ”
206860	206873	206875	206875	Voldemort	158	“ We are not playing hide - and - seek , Harry , ”
207045	207048	207042	207042	Harry	157	“ Expelliarmus ! ”

209877	209889	209890	209890	Dumbledore	169	“ That ’s right , Harry ... just let go now ... ”
209953	209958	209936	209939	The crowd around them	4499	“ What ’s happened ? ”
209959	209966	209936	209939	The crowd around them	4499	“ What ’s wrong with him ? ”
209967	209972	209936	209939	The crowd around them	4499	“ Diggory ’s dead ! ”
209973	209984	209985	209985	Fudge	254	“ He ’ll need to go to the hospital wing ! ”
209990	210015	209985	209985	Fudge	254	“ He ’s ill , he ’s injured — Dumbledore , Diggory ’s parents , they ’re here , they ’re in the stands ... ”
210016	210029	209985	209985	Fudge	254	“ I ’ll take Harry , Dumbledore , I ’ll take him — ”
210030	210037	209985	209985	Fudge	254	“ No , I would prefer — ”
210038	210065	209985	209985	Fudge	254	“ Dumbledore , Amos Diggory ’s running ... he ’s coming over ... Do n’t you think you should tell him — before he sees — ? ”
210066	210072	209985	209985	Fudge	254	“ Harry , stay here — ”
210089	210108	210073	210073	Girls	4881	“ It ’s all right , son , I ’ve got you ... come on ... hospital wing ... ”
210109	210114	210116	210116	Harry	157	“ Dumbledore said stay , ”
210144	210155	210171	210173	the frightened crowd	4502	“ You need to lie down ... Come on now ... ”
210228	210234	210235	210236	the man	1678	“ What happened , Harry ? ”
210334	210354	210314	210314	He	294	“ Voldemort ’s back , Harry ? You ’re sure he ’s back ? How did he do it ? ”
210355	210372	210374	210374	Harry	157	“ He took stuff from his father ’s grave , and from Wormtail , and me , ”
210418	210428	210430	210430	Moody	294	“ What did the Dark Lord take from you ? ”
210432	210435	210437	210437	Harry	157	“ Blood , ”
210467	210476	210458	210458	his	294	“ And the Death Eaters ? They returned ? ”
210477	210480	210482	210482	Harry	157	“ Yes , ”
210484	210489	210482	210482	Harry	157	“ Loads of them ... ”
210490	210497	210498	210498	Moody	294	“ How did he treat them ? ”
210502	210508	210498	210498	Moody	294	“ Did he forgive them ? ”
210528	210564	210521	210521	he	157	“ There ’s a Death Eater at Hogwarts ! There ’s a Death Eater here — they put my name in the Goblet of Fire , they made sure I got through to the end — ”
210578	210587	210588	210588	he	294	“ I know who the Death Eater is , ”
210592	210595	210597	210597	Harry	157	“ Karkaroff ? ”
210600	210615	210597	210597	Harry	157	“ Where is he ? Have you got him ? Is he locked up ? ”
210616	210619	210621	210621	Moody	294	“ Karkaroff ? ”
210627	210677	210621	210621	Moody	294	“ Karkaroff fled tonight , when he felt the Dark Mark burn upon his arm . He betrayed too many faithful supporters of the Dark Lord to wish to meet them ... but I doubt he will get far . The Dark Lord has ways of tracking his enemies . ”
210678	210700	210597	210597	Harry	157	“ Karkaroff ’s gone ? He ran away ? But then — he did n’t put my name in the goblet ? ”
210701	210704	210706	210706	Moody	294	“ No , ”
210709	210723	210706	210706	Moody	294	“ No , he did n’t . It was I who did that . ”
210732	210739	210740	210740	he	157	“ No , you did n’t , ”
210743	210756	210740	210740	he	157	“ You did n’t do that ... you ca n’t have done ... ”
210757	210764	210766	210766	Moody	294	“ I assure you I did , ”
210811	210818	210819	210819	he	294	“ He forgave them , then ? ”
210822	210836	210819	210819	he	294	“ The Death Eaters who went free ? The ones who escaped Azkaban ? ”
210837	210840	210842	210842	Harry	157	“ What ? ”
210867	210872	210874	210874	Moody	294	“ I asked you , ”
210877	210942	210874	210874	Moody	294	“ whether he forgave the scum who never even went to look for him . Those treacherous cowards who would n’t even brave Azkaban for him . The faithless , worthless bits of filth who were brave enough to cavort in masks at the Quidditch World Cup , but fled at the sight of the Dark Mark when I fired it into the sky . ”
210943	210954	210819	210819	he	294	“ You fired ... What are you talking about ... ? ”
210955	211022	211023	211023	Moody	294	“ I told you , Harry ... I told you . If there ’s one thing I hate more than any other , it ’s a Death Eater who walked free . They turned their backs on my master when he needed them most . I expected him to punish them . I expected him to torture them . Tell me he hurt them , Harry ... ”
211034	211066	211023	211023	Moody	294	“ Tell me he told them that I , I alone remained faithful ... prepared to risk everything to deliver to him the one thing he wanted above all ... you . ”
211067	211080	211023	211023	Moody	294	“ You did n’t ... it — it ca n’t be you ... ”
211081	211154	211023	211023	Moody	294	“ Who put your name in the Goblet of Fire , under the name of a different school ? I did . Who frightened off every person I thought might try to hurt you or prevent you from winning the tournament ? I did . Who nudged Hagrid into showing you the dragons ? I did . Who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon ? I did . ”
211209	211266	211268	211268	Moody	294	“ You were so long in that lake , Potter , I thought you had drowned . But luckily , Dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility , and marked you high for it . I breathed again . You had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight , of course , ”
211361	211380	211382	211382	Moody	294	“ The Dark Lord did n’t manage to kill you , Potter , and he so wanted to , ”
211384	211449	211382	211382	Moody	294	“ Imagine how he will reward me when he finds I have done it for him . I gave you to him — the thing he needed above all to regenerate — and then I killed you for him . I will be honored beyond all other Death Eaters . I will be his dearest , his closest supporter ... closer than a son ... ”
211482	211489	211491	211491	Moody	294	“ The Dark Lord and I , ”
211509	211574	211494	211494	he	294	“ have much in common . Both of us , for instance , had very disappointing fathers ... very disappointing indeed . Both of us suffered the indignity , Harry , of being named after those fathers . And both of us had the pleasure ... the very great pleasure ... of killing our fathers to ensure the continued rise of the Dark Order ! ”
211575	211580	211581	211581	Harry	157	“ You ’re mad , ”
211590	211595	211581	211581	Harry	157	“ you ’re mad ! ”
211596	211602	211604	211604	Moody	294	“ Mad , am I ? ”
211611	211657	211606	211606	his	294	“ We ’ll see ! We ’ll see who ’s mad , now that the Dark Lord has returned , with me at his side ! He is back , Harry Potter , you did not conquer him — and now — I conquer you ! ”
211677	211680	211670	211670	his	157	“ Stupefy ! ”
211935	211941	211942	211942	she	318	“ Come along , Potter , ”
211961	211968	211955	211955	she	318	“ Come along ... hospital wing ... ”
211969	211972	211974	211974	Dumbledore	169	“ No , ”
211977	211995	211955	211955	she	318	“ Dumbledore , he ought to — look at him — he ’s been through enough tonight — ”
211996	212009	212011	212011	Dumbledore	169	“ He will stay , Minerva , because he needs to understand , ”
212014	212051	212011	212011	Dumbledore	169	“ Understanding is the first step to acceptance , and only with acceptance can there be recovery . He needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered tonight , and why . ”
212052	212055	212056	212056	Harry	157	“ Moody , ”
212069	212077	212059	212059	He	157	“ How can it have been Moody ? ”
212078	212085	212087	212087	Dumbledore	169	“ This is not Alastor Moody , ”
212090	212127	212087	212087	Dumbledore	169	“ You have never known Alastor Moody . The real Moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight . The moment he took you , I knew — and I followed . ”
212169	212245	212161	212161	he	169	“ Severus , please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion you possess , and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the house - elf called Winky . Minerva , kindly go down to Hagrid ’s house , where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch . Take the dog up to my office , tell him I will be with him shortly , then come back here . ”
212527	212539	212540	212540	he	169	“ Stunned — controlled by the Imperius Curse — very weak , ”
212543	212585	212540	212540	he	169	“ Of course , they would have needed to keep him alive . Harry , throw down the imposter ’s cloak — he ’s freezing . Madam Pomfrey will need to see him , but he seems in no immediate danger . ”
212644	212650	212652	212652	Dumbledore	169	“ Polyjuice Potion , Harry , ”
212654	212713	212652	212652	Dumbledore	169	“ You see the simplicity of it , and the brilliance . For Moody never does drink except from his hip flask , he ’s well known for it . The imposter needed , of course , to keep the real Moody close by , so that he could continue making the potion . You see his hair ... ”
212724	212779	212714	212714	Dumbledore	169	“ The imposter has been cutting it off all year , see where it is uneven ? But I think , in the excitement of tonight , our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he should have done ... on the hour ... every hour ... We shall see . ”
213029	213033	213034	213034	Snape	331	“ Crouch Junior ! ”
213043	213047	213049	213050	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Good heavens , ”
213087	213100	213080	213080	she	252	“ Master Barty , Master Barty , what is you doing here ? ”
213112	213130	213101	213101	She	252	“ You is killed him ! You is killed him ! You is killed Master ’s son ! ”
213131	213139	213141	213141	Dumbledore	169	“ He is simply Stunned , Winky , ”
213143	213156	213141	213141	Dumbledore	169	“ Step aside , please . Severus , you have the potion ? ”
213268	213271	213256	213256	he	169	“ Rennervate . ”
213300	213306	213307	213307	Dumbledore	169	“ Can you hear me ? ”
213317	213320	213321	213321	he	6515	“ Yes , ”
213324	213333	213335	213335	Dumbledore	169	“ I would like you to tell us , ”
213338	213353	213335	213335	Dumbledore	169	“ how you came to be here . How did you escape from Azkaban ? ”
213374	213456	213354	213355	Crouch Junior	520	“ My mother saved me . She knew she was dying . She persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favor to her . He loved her as he had never loved me . He agreed . They came to visit me . They gave me a draught of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my mother ’s hairs . She took a draught of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my hairs . We took on each other ’s appearance . ”
213465	213485	213590	213592	The Crouch Junior	520	“ Say no more , Master Barty , say no more , you is getting your father into trouble ! ”
213501	213589	213487	213488	Crouch Junior	520	“ The dementors are blind . They sensed one healthy , one dying person entering Azkaban . They sensed one healthy , one dying person leaving it . My father smuggled me out , disguised as my mother , in case any prisoners were watching through their doors . My mother died a short while afterward in Azkaban . She was careful to drink Polyjuice Potion until the end . She was buried under my name and bearing my appearance . Everyone believed her to be me . ”
213597	213614	213616	213616	Dumbledore	169	“ And what did your father do with you , when he had got you home ? ”
213619	213694	213487	213488	Crouch Junior	520	“ Staged my mother ’s death . A quiet , private funeral . That grave is empty . The house - elf nursed me back to health . Then I had to be concealed . I had to be controlled . My father had to use a number of spells to subdue me . When I had recovered my strength , I thought only of finding my master ... of returning to his service . ”
213695	213703	213705	213705	Dumbledore	169	“ How did your father subdue you ? ”
213707	213712	213713	213714	Crouch Junior	520	“ The Imperius Curse , ”
213717	213774	213713	213714	Crouch Junior	520	“ I was under my father ’s control . I was forced to wear an Invisibility Cloak day and night . I was always with the house - elf . She was my keeper and caretaker . She pitied me . She persuaded my father to give me occasional treats . Rewards for my good behavior . ”
213775	213782	213784	213784	Winky	252	“ Master Barty , Master Barty , ”
213789	213804	213784	213784	Winky	252	“ You is n’t ought to tell them , we is getting in trouble ... ”
213805	213816	213818	213818	Dumbledore	169	“ Did anybody ever discover that you were still alive ? ”
213821	213834	213818	213818	Dumbledore	169	“ Did anyone know except your father and the house - elf ? ”
213835	213838	213840	213841	Crouch Junior	520	“ Yes , ”
213848	213958	213840	213841	Crouch Junior	520	“ A witch in my father ’s office . Bertha Jorkins . She came to the house with papers for my father ’s signature . He was not at home . Winky showed her inside and returned to the kitchen , to me . But Bertha Jorkins heard Winky talking to me . She came to investigate . She heard enough to guess who was hiding under the Invisibility Cloak . My father arrived home . She confronted him . He put a very powerful Memory Charm on her to make her forget what she ’d found out . Too powerful . He said it damaged her memory permanently . ”
213959	213973	213975	213975	Winky	252	“ Why is she coming to nose into my master ’s private business ? ”
213977	213986	213975	213975	Winky	252	“ Why is n’t she leaving us be ? ”
213987	213996	213998	213998	Dumbledore	169	“ Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup , ”
214000	214008	214010	214010	Winky	252	“ Master Barty , you bad boy ! ”
214018	214025	214027	214027	Dumbledore	169	“ So you took the wand , ”
214029	214038	214027	214027	Dumbledore	169	“ and what did you do with it ? ”
214085	214155	214078	214078	She	252	“ It was very quick . My father was placed under the Imperius Curse by my master . Now my father was the one imprisoned , controlled . My master forced him to go about his business as usual , to act as though nothing was wrong . And I was released . I awoke . I was myself again , alive as I had n’t been in years . ”
214156	214167	214169	214169	Dumbledore	169	“ And what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do ? ”
214171	214277	214078	214078	She	252	“ He asked me whether I was ready to risk everything for him . I was ready . It was my dream , my greatest ambition , to serve him , to prove myself to him . He told me he needed to place a faithful servant at Hogwarts . A servant who would guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament without appearing to do so . A servant who would watch over Harry Potter . Ensure he reached the Triwizard Cup . Turn the Cup into a Portkey , which would take the first person to touch it to my master . But first — ”
214278	214284	214286	214286	Dumbledore	169	“ You needed Alastor Moody , ”
214300	214311	214313	214313	Dumbledore	169	“ And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody ? ”
214315	214338	214078	214078	She	252	“ Wormtail returned to care for my master , in my father ’s house , and to keep watch over my father . ”
214339	214345	214347	214347	Dumbledore	169	“ But your father escaped , ”
214349	214352	214354	214354	Dumbledore	169	“ Map ? ”
214357	214363	214354	214354	Dumbledore	169	“ What map is this ? ”
214364	214413	214078	214078	She	252	“ Potter ’s map of Hogwarts . Potter saw me on it . Potter saw me stealing more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape ’s office one night . He thought I was my father . We have the same first name . I killed my father . ”
214414	214417	214419	214419	Winky	252	“ Noooo ! ”
214421	214433	214419	214419	Winky	252	“ Master Barty , Master Barty , what is you saying ? ”
214434	214440	214441	214441	Dumbledore	169	“ You killed your father , ”
214450	214459	214441	214441	Dumbledore	169	“ What did you do with the body ? ”
214460	214474	214078	214078	She	252	“ Carried it into the forest . Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak . ”
214492	214496	214489	214489	Dumbledore	169	“ And tonight ... ”
214497	214511	214513	214514	Crouch Junior	520	“ I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner , ”
214516	214547	214513	214514	Crouch Junior	520	“ Turned it into a Portkey . My master ’s plan worked . He is returned to power and I will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards . ”
214624	214641	214618	214618	He	169	“ Minerva , could I ask you to stand guard here while I take Harry upstairs ? ”
214642	214646	214648	214649	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Of course , ”
214687	214689	214691	214691	Dumbledore	169	“ Severus ”
214696	214766	214691	214691	Dumbledore	169	“ please tell Madam Pomfrey to come down here ; we need to get Alastor Moody into the hospital wing . Then go down into the grounds , find Cornelius Fudge , and bring him up to this office . He will undoubtedly want to question Crouch Junior himself . Tell him I will be in the hospital wing in half an hour ’s time if he needs me . ”
214777	214780	214781	214781	Dumbledore	169	“ Harry ? ”
214841	214855	214856	214856	he	169	“ I want you to come up to my office first , Harry , ”
214866	214874	214856	214856	he	169	“ Sirius is waiting for us there . ”
214996	214999	215000	215000	Harry	157	“ Professor , ”
215003	215011	215000	215000	Harry	157	“ where are Mr. and Mrs. Diggory ? ”
215012	215019	215021	215021	Dumbledore	169	“ They are with Professor Sprout , ”
215046	215060	215023	215023	His	169	“ She was Head of Cedric ’s House , and knew him best . ”
215129	215150	215123	215123	he	177	“ Harry , are you all right ? I knew it — I knew something like this — what happened ? ”
215167	215171	215172	215172	he	169	“ What happened ? ”
215262	215268	215270	215270	Harry	157	“ ’ Lo , Fawkes , ”
215343	215361	215363	215363	Dumbledore	169	“ I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze , Harry , ”
215365	215379	215381	215381	Sirius	177	“ We can leave that till morning , ca n’t we , Dumbledore ? ”
215394	215405	215384	215384	He	177	“ Let him have a sleep . Let him rest . ”
215445	215454	215455	215455	Dumbledore	169	“ If I thought I could help you , ”
215730	215748	215749	215749	Harry	157	“ He said my blood would make him stronger than if he ’d used someone else ’s , ”
215753	215790	215751	215751	Dumbledore	169	“ He said the protection my — my mother left in me — he ’d have it too . And he was right — he could touch me without hurting himself , he touched my face . ”
215848	215852	215853	215853	he	169	“ Very well , ”
215860	215874	215853	215853	he	169	“ Voldemort has overcome that particular barrier . Harry , continue , please . ”
216004	216009	216010	216010	he	177	“ The wands connected ? ”
216019	216022	216010	216010	he	177	“ Why ? ”
216039	216043	216044	216044	he	169	“ Priori Incantatem , ”
216068	216074	216076	216076	Sirius	177	“ The Reverse Spell effect ? ”
216079	216082	216084	216084	Dumbledore	169	“ Exactly , ”
216086	216117	216118	216118	he	169	“ Harry ’s wand and Voldemort ’s wand share cores . Each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix . This phoenix , in fact , ”
216140	216149	216150	216150	Harry	157	“ My wand ’s feather came from Fawkes ? ”
216155	216158	216160	216160	Dumbledore	169	“ Yes , ”
216162	216186	216160	216160	Dumbledore	169	“ Mr. Ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand , the moment you left his shop four years ago . ”
216187	216198	216200	216200	Sirius	177	“ So what happens when a wand meets its brother ? ”
216202	216212	216214	216214	Dumbledore	169	“ They will not work properly against each other , ”
216216	216271	216214	216214	Dumbledore	169	“ If , however , the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle ... a very rare effect will take place . One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed — in reverse . The most recent first ... and then those which preceded it ... ”
216282	216286	216288	216288	Dumbledore	169	“ Which means , ”
216298	216308	216291	216291	his	169	“ that some form of Cedric must have reappeared . ”
216313	216320	216322	216322	Sirius	177	“ Diggory came back to life ? ”
216325	216333	216335	216335	Dumbledore	169	“ No spell can reawaken the dead , ”
216338	216370	216335	216335	Dumbledore	169	“ All that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo . A shadow of the living Cedric would have emerged from the wand ... am I correct , Harry ? ”
216371	216377	216378	216378	Harry	157	“ He spoke to me , ”
216387	216401	216381	216381	He	157	“ The ... the ghost Cedric , or whatever he was , spoke . ”
216402	216406	216408	216408	Dumbledore	169	“ An echo , ”
216410	216435	216408	216408	Dumbledore	169	“ which retained Cedric ’s appearance and character . I am guessing other such forms appeared ... less recent victims of Voldemort ’s wand ... ”
216436	216441	216442	216442	Harry	157	“ An old man , ”
216450	216456	216442	216442	Harry	157	“ Bertha Jorkins . And ... ”
216457	216461	216463	216463	Dumbledore	169	“ Your parents ? ”
216466	216469	216471	216471	Harry	157	“ Yes , ”
216488	216496	216498	216498	Dumbledore	169	“ The last murders the wand performed , ”
216502	216537	216498	216498	Dumbledore	169	“ In reverse order . More would have appeared , of course , had you maintained the connection . Very well , Harry , these echoes , these shadows ... what did they do ? ”
216678	216685	216687	216687	Dumbledore	169	“ I will say it again , ”
216705	216716	216687	216687	Dumbledore	169	“ Sirius , would you like to stay with him ? ”
216825	216831	216815	216816	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Harry ! Oh Harry ! ”
216845	216848	216849	216849	he	169	“ Molly , ”
216857	216909	216910	216910	he	169	“ please listen to me for a moment . Harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight . He has just had to relive it for me . What he needs now is sleep , and peace , and quiet . If he would like you all to stay with him , ”
216924	216951	216910	216910	he	169	“ you may do so . But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer , and certainly not this evening . ”
216980	216989	216961	216961	She	173	“ Did you hear ? He needs quiet ! ”
216990	216993	216995	216996	Madam Pomfrey	303	“ Headmaster , ”
217008	217015	216995	216996	Madam Pomfrey	303	“ may I ask what — ? ”
217016	217028	217030	217030	Dumbledore	169	“ This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while , ”
217033	217055	217030	217030	Dumbledore	169	“ I assure you , he is extremely well trained . Harry — I will wait while you get into bed . ”
217112	217131	217133	217133	Dumbledore	169	“ I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge , Harry , ”
217135	217152	217153	217153	He	169	“ I would like you to remain here tomorrow until I have spoken to the school . ”
217199	217204	217205	217205	Harry	157	“ Is he okay ? ”
217208	217214	217216	217217	Madam Pomfrey	303	“ He ’ll be fine , ”
217289	217295	217296	217296	he	157	“ I ’m all right , ”
217300	217304	217296	217296	he	157	“ Just tired . ”
217343	217355	217356	217356	she	303	“ You ’ll need to drink all of this , Harry , ”
217359	217368	217356	217356	she	303	“ It ’s a potion for dreamless sleep . ”
217516	217528	217552	217552	Someone	719	“ They ’ll wake him if they do n’t shut up ! ”
217529	217545	217552	217552	Someone	719	“ What are they shouting about ? Nothing else can have happened , can it ? ”
217579	217586	217587	217587	she	173	“ That ’s Fudge ’s voice , ”
217590	217609	217587	217587	she	173	“ And that ’s Minerva McGonagall ’s , is n’t it ? But what are they arguing about ? ”
217626	217636	217614	217614	them	4590	“ Regrettable , but all the same , Minerva — ”
217643	217654	217656	217657	Professor McGonagall	318	“ You should never have brought it inside the castle ! ”
217659	217665	217656	217657	Professor McGonagall	318	“ When Dumbledore finds out — ”
217725	217730	217731	217731	Fudge	254	“ Where ’s Dumbledore ? ”
217737	217743	217745	217746	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ He ’s not here , ”
217749	217768	217745	217746	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ This is a hospital wing , Minister , do n’t you think you ’d do better to — ”
217782	217787	217789	217789	Dumbledore	169	“ What has happened ? ”
217799	217825	217796	217797	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Why are you disturbing these people ? Minerva , I ’m surprised at you — I asked you to stand guard over Crouch Junior — ”
217826	217840	217841	217841	she	4596	“ There is no need to stand guard over him anymore , Dumbledore ! ”
217844	217852	217841	217841	she	4596	“ The Minister has seen to that ! ”
217888	217907	217909	217909	Snape	387	“ When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for tonight ’s events , ”
217916	217952	217909	217909	Snape	387	“ he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question . He insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle . He brought it up to the office where Crouch Junior — ”
217953	217964	217965	217966	Professor McGonagall	318	“ I told him you would not agree , Dumbledore ! ”
217969	217987	217965	217966	Professor McGonagall	318	“ I told him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle , but — ”
217988	217993	217995	217995	Fudge	500	“ My dear woman ! ”
218008	218032	217995	217995	Fudge	500	“ as Minister of Magic , it is my decision whether I wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous — ”
218042	218053	218054	218054	she	318	“ The moment that — that thing entered the room , ”
218065	218076	218054	218054	she	318	“ it swooped down on Crouch Junior and — and — ”
218142	218152	218154	218154	Fudge	500	“ By all accounts , he is no loss ! ”
218156	218167	218154	218154	Fudge	500	“ It seems he has been responsible for several deaths ! ”
218168	218179	218181	218181	Dumbledore	169	“ But he can not now give testimony , Cornelius , ”
218200	218213	218183	218183	He	169	“ He can not give evidence about why he killed those people . ”
218214	218230	218232	218232	Fudge	254	“ Why he killed them ? Well , that ’s no mystery , is it ? ”
218234	218269	218232	218232	Fudge	254	“ He was a raving lunatic ! From what Minerva and Severus have told me , he seems to have thought he was doing it all on You - Know - Who ’s instructions ! ”
218270	218280	218281	218281	Dumbledore	169	“ Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions , Cornelius , ”
218284	218317	218281	218281	Dumbledore	169	“ Those people ’s deaths were mere by - products of a plan to restore Voldemort to full strength again . The plan succeeded . Voldemort has been restored to his body . ”
218365	218381	218355	218355	He	254	“ You - Know - Who ... returned ? Preposterous . Come now , Dumbledore ... ”
218382	218392	218394	218394	Dumbledore	169	“ As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you , ”
218396	218463	218394	218394	Dumbledore	169	“ we heard Crouch Junior confess . Under the influence of Veritaserum , he told us how he was smuggled out of Azkaban , and how Voldemort — learning of his continued existence from Bertha Jorkins — went to free him from his father and used him to capture Harry . The plan worked , I tell you . Crouch Junior has helped Voldemort to return . ”
218464	218470	218472	218472	Fudge	254	“ See here , Dumbledore , ”
218488	218545	218485	218485	his	254	“ you — you ca n’t seriously believe that . You - Know - Who — back ? Come now , come now ... certainly , Crouch Junior may have believed himself to be acting upon You - Know - Who ’s orders — but to take the word of a lunatic like that , Dumbledore ... ”
218546	218562	218564	218564	Dumbledore	169	“ When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight , he was transported straight to Voldemort , ”
218567	218591	218564	218564	Dumbledore	169	“ He witnessed Lord Voldemort ’s rebirth . I will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office . ”
218611	218625	218592	218592	Dumbledore	169	“ I am afraid I can not permit you to question Harry tonight . ”
218647	218667	218632	218632	He	254	“ You are — er — prepared to take Harry ’s word on this , are you , Dumbledore ? ”
218696	218703	218705	218705	Dumbledore	169	“ Certainly , I believe Harry , ”
218713	218756	218707	218707	His	169	“ I heard Crouch Junior ’s confession , and I heard Harry ’s account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup ; the two stories make sense , they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer . ”
218777	218804	218770	218770	he	254	“ You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned , on the word of a lunatic murderer , and a boy who ... well ... ”
218816	218827	218828	218828	he	254	“ You ’ve been reading Rita Skeeter , Mr. Fudge , ”
218869	218875	218876	218876	he	254	“ And if I have ? ”
218883	218915	218876	218876	he	254	“ If I have discovered that you ’ve been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet ? A Parselmouth , eh ? And having funny turns all over the place — ”
218916	218934	218936	218936	Dumbledore	169	“ I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar ? ”
218939	218952	218954	218954	Fudge	254	“ You admit that he has been having these pains , then ? ”
218957	218966	218954	218954	Fudge	254	“ Headaches ? Nightmares ? Possibly — hallucinations ? ”
218967	218974	218976	218976	Dumbledore	169	“ Listen to me , Cornelius , ”
219008	219045	219005	219006	Crouch Junior	520	“ Harry is as sane as you or I. That scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains . I believe it hurts him when Lord Voldemort is close by , or feeling particularly murderous . ”
219063	219087	219057	219057	he	254	“ You ’ll forgive me , Dumbledore , but I ’ve never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before ... ”
219088	219097	219098	219098	Harry	157	“ Look , I saw Voldemort come back ! ”
219117	219133	219111	219112	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ I saw the Death Eaters ! I can give you their names ! Lucius — ”
219155	219160	219162	219162	Fudge	254	“ Malfoy was cleared ! ”
219167	219178	219162	219162	Fudge	254	“ A very old family — donations to excellent causes — ”
219179	219182	219183	219183	Harry	157	“ Macnair ! ”
219186	219196	219162	219162	Fudge	254	“ Also cleared ! Now working for the Ministry ! ”
219197	219217	219219	219219	Fudge	254	“ You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being Death Eaters thirteen years ago ! ”
219222	219226	219227	219228	Professor McGonagall	318	“ You fool ! ”
219231	219249	219227	219228	Professor McGonagall	318	“ Cedric Diggory ! Mr. Crouch ! These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic ! ”
219250	219259	219261	219261	Fudge	254	“ I see no evidence to the contrary ! ”
219272	219299	219268	219268	his	254	“ It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years ! ”
219372	219377	219378	219378	Dumbledore	169	“ Voldemort has returned , ”
219381	219424	219378	219378	Dumbledore	169	“ If you accept that fact straightaway , Fudge , and take the necessary measures , we may still be able to save the situation . The first and most essential step is to remove Azkaban from the control of the dementors — ”
219425	219428	219430	219430	Fudge	254	“ Preposterous ! ”
219433	219471	219430	219430	Fudge	254	“ Remove the dementors ? I ’d be kicked out of office for suggesting it ! Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing guard at Azkaban ! ”
219472	219512	219514	219514	Dumbledore	169	“ The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds , Cornelius , knowing that you have put Lord Voldemort ’s most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them ! ”
219516	219578	219514	219514	Dumbledore	169	“ They will not remain loyal to you , Fudge ! Voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can ! With the dementors behind him , and his old supporters returned to him , you will be hard - pressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago ! ”
219595	219607	219608	219608	Dumbledore	169	“ The second step you must take — and at once , ”
219612	219621	219608	219608	Dumbledore	169	“ is to send envoys to the giants . ”
219622	219628	219629	219629	Fudge	254	“ Envoys to the giants ? ”
219637	219643	219629	219629	Fudge	254	“ What madness is this ? ”
219644	219660	219662	219662	Dumbledore	169	“ Extend them the hand of friendship , now , before it is too late , ”
219664	219690	219662	219662	Dumbledore	169	“ or Voldemort will persuade them , as he did before , that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom ! ”
219691	219700	219701	219701	Fudge	254	“ You — you can not be serious ! ”
219713	219738	219705	219705	his	254	“ If the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants — people hate them , Dumbledore — end of my career — ”
219739	219744	219746	219746	Dumbledore	169	“ You are blinded , ”
219767	219848	219761	219761	his	169	“ by the love of the office you hold , Cornelius ! I tell you now — take the steps I have suggested , and you will be remembered , in office or out , as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers of Magic we have ever known . Fail to act — and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild ! ”
219849	219852	219854	219854	Fudge	254	“ Insane , ”
219860	219863	219854	219854	Fudge	254	“ Mad ... ”
219919	219937	219939	219939	Dumbledore	169	“ If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this , Cornelius , ”
219941	219970	219939	219939	Dumbledore	169	“ we have reached a parting of the ways . You must act as you see fit . And I — I shall act as I see fit . ”
220002	220010	220011	220011	he	169	“ Now , see here , Dumbledore , ”
220019	220095	220011	220011	he	169	“ I ’ve given you free rein , always . I ’ve had a lot of respect for you . I might not have agreed with some of your decisions , but I ’ve kept quiet . There are n’t many who ’d have let you hire werewolves , or keep Hagrid , or decide what to teach your students without reference to the Ministry . But if you ’re going to work against me — ”
220096	220107	220109	220109	Dumbledore	169	“ The only one against whom I intend to work , ”
220111	220133	220109	220109	Dumbledore	169	“ is Lord Voldemort . If you are against him , then we remain , Cornelius , on the same side . ”
220181	220196	220168	220168	he	254	“ He ca n’t be back , Dumbledore , he just ca n’t be ... ”
220230	220233	220235	220235	Snape	387	“ There , ”
220238	220285	220235	220235	Snape	387	“ There . The Dark Mark . It is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago , when it burned black , but you can still see it . Every Death Eater had the sign burned into him by the Dark Lord . ”
220335	220390	220313	220313	He	254	“ I do n’t know what you and your staff are playing at , Dumbledore , but I have heard enough . I have no more to add . I will be in touch with you tomorrow , Dumbledore , to discuss the running of this school . I must return to the Ministry . ”
220418	220422	220423	220423	he	254	“ Your winnings , ”
220446	220464	220423	220423	he	254	“ One thousand Galleons . There should have been a presentation ceremony , but under the circumstances ... ”
220504	220512	220513	220513	he	169	“ There is work to be done , ”
220516	220533	220513	220513	he	169	“ Molly ... am I right in thinking that I can count on you and Arthur ? ”
220534	220540	220553	220553	she	173	“ Of course you can , ”
220557	220591	220553	220553	she	173	“ We know what Fudge is . It ’s Arthur ’s fondness for Muggles that has held him back at the Ministry all these years . Fudge thinks he lacks proper Wizarding pride . ”
220592	220603	220605	220605	Dumbledore	169	“ Then I need to send a message to Arthur , ”
220607	220641	220605	220605	Dumbledore	169	“ All those that we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately , and he is well placed to contact those at the Ministry who are not as shortsighted as Cornelius . ”
220642	220649	220651	220651	Bill	184	“ I ’ll go to Dad , ”
220656	220662	220651	220651	Bill	184	“ I ’ll go now . ”
220663	220666	220668	220668	Dumbledore	169	“ Excellent , ”
220670	220708	220668	220668	Dumbledore	169	“ Tell him what has happened . Tell him I will be in direct contact with him shortly . He will need to be discreet , however . If Fudge thinks I am interfering at the Ministry — ”
220709	220715	220717	220717	Bill	184	“ Leave it to me , ”
220747	220750	220752	220752	Dumbledore	169	“ Minerva , ”
220759	220785	220752	220752	Dumbledore	169	“ I want to see Hagrid in my office as soon as possible . Also — if she will consent to come — Madame Maxime . ”
220795	220798	220799	220799	Dumbledore	169	“ Poppy , ”
220805	220861	220799	220799	Dumbledore	169	“ would you be very kind and go down to Professor Moody ’s office , where I think you will find a house - elf called Winky in considerable distress ? Do what you can for her , and take her back to the kitchens . I think Dobby will look after her for us . ”
220862	220868	220870	220871	Madam Pomfrey	303	“ Very — very well , ”
220905	220909	220910	220910	he	169	“ And now , ”
220913	220941	220910	220910	he	169	“ it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are . Sirius ... if you could resume your usual form . ”
220973	220977	220978	220978	she	173	“ Sirius Black ! ”
220985	220991	220992	220992	Ron	170	“ Mum , shut up ! ”
220995	221000	220992	220992	Ron	170	“ It ’s okay ! ”
221023	221026	221027	221027	he	387	“ Him ! ”
221040	221047	221032	221032	Sirius	529	“ What is he doing here ? ”
221048	221056	221058	221058	Dumbledore	169	“ He is here at my invitation , ”
221064	221092	221058	221058	Dumbledore	169	“ as are you , Severus . I trust you both . It is time for you to lay aside your old differences and trust each other . ”
221115	221125	221127	221127	Dumbledore	169	“ I will settle , in the short term , ”
221138	221185	221135	221135	his	169	“ for a lack of open hostility . You will shake hands . You are on the same side now . Time is short , and unless the few of us who know the truth stand united , there is no hope for any of us . ”
221222	221232	221234	221234	Dumbledore	169	“ That will do to be going on with , ”
221242	221306	221234	221234	Dumbledore	169	“ Now I have work for each of you . Fudge ’s attitude , though not unexpected , changes everything . Sirius , I need you to set off at once . You are to alert Remus Lupin , Arabella Figg , Mundungus Fletcher — the old crowd . Lie low at Lupin ’s for a while ; I will contact you there . ”
221307	221310	221312	221312	Harry	157	“ But — ”
221335	221345	221347	221347	Sirius	529	“ You ’ll see me very soon , Harry , ”
221353	221373	221347	221347	Sirius	529	“ I promise you . But I must do what I can , you understand , do n’t you ? ”
221374	221377	221379	221379	Harry	157	“ Yeah , ”
221381	221389	221379	221379	Harry	157	“ Yeah ... of course I do . ”
221431	221434	221436	221436	Dumbledore	169	“ Severus , ”
221442	221463	221436	221436	Dumbledore	169	“ you know what I must ask you to do . If you are ready ... if you are prepared ... ”
221464	221468	221470	221470	Snape	387	“ I am , ”
221488	221493	221495	221495	Dumbledore	169	“ Then good luck , ”
221526	221532	221533	221533	he	169	“ I must go downstairs , ”
221537	221561	221533	221533	he	169	“ I must see the Diggorys . Harry — take the rest of your potion . I will see all of you later . ”
221595	221609	221610	221611	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ You ’ve got to take the rest of your potion , Harry , ”
221637	221667	221628	221628	she	173	“ You have a good long sleep . Try and think about something else for a while ... think about what you ’re going to buy with your winnings ! ”
221668	221676	221678	221678	Harry	157	“ I do n’t want that gold , ”
221684	221708	221678	221678	Harry	157	“ You have it . Anyone can have it . I should n’t have won it . It should ’ve been Cedric ’s . ”
221760	221769	221770	221771	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ It was n’t your fault , Harry , ”
221774	221785	221787	221787	Harry	157	“ I told him to take the Cup with me , ”
221950	221953	221954	221954	she	168	“ Sorry , ”
221957	221963	221965	221966	Mrs. Weasley	173	“ Your potion , Harry , ”
222123	222130	222131	222131	she	524	“ He suffered very little then , ”
222144	222167	222131	222131	she	524	“ And after all , Amos ... he died just when he ’d won the tournament . He must have been happy . ”
222183	222191	222175	222175	she	524	“ You look after yourself , now . ”
222203	222208	222209	222209	he	157	“ You take this , ”
222214	222231	222209	222209	he	157	“ It should ’ve been Cedric ’s , he got there first , you take it — ”
222239	222257	222233	222233	she	524	“ Oh no , it ’s yours , dear , I could n’t ... you keep it . ”
222501	222517	222518	222518	he	170	“ She went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer , ”
222521	222538	222518	222518	he	170	“ But he wants you to go back to the Dursleys , at least at first . ”
222539	222542	222544	222544	Harry	157	“ Why ? ”
222546	222555	222557	222557	Ron	170	“ She said Dumbledore ’s got his reasons , ”
222564	222578	222560	222560	his	170	“ I suppose we ’ve got to trust him , have n’t we ? ”
222659	222664	222666	222666	Hagrid	180	“ Who ’s that ? ”
222673	222676	222666	222666	Hagrid	180	“ Harry ! ”
222700	222713	222677	222677	He	180	“ Good ter see yeh , mate . Good ter see yeh . ”
222739	222747	222748	222748	Hagrid	180	“ Bin havin’ a cuppa with Olympe , ”
222751	222758	222748	222748	Hagrid	180	“ She ’s jus ’ left . ”
222759	222762	222764	222764	Ron	170	“ Who ? ”
222767	222775	222777	222777	Hagrid	180	“ Madame Maxime , o ’ course ! ”
222779	222788	222790	222790	Ron	170	“ You two made up , have you ? ”
222792	222800	222802	222802	Hagrid	180	“ Dunno what yeh’re talkin ’ about , ”
222843	222849	222850	222850	he	180	“ You all righ ’ ? ”
222854	222857	222859	222859	Harry	157	“ Yeah , ”
222861	222867	222869	222869	Hagrid	180	“ No , yeh’re not , ”
222871	222882	222869	222869	Hagrid	180	“ ’ Course yeh’re not . But yeh will be . ”
222887	222896	222898	222898	Hagrid	180	“ Knew he was goin’ ter come back , ”
222914	223002	222906	222906	Hermione	168	“ Known it fer years , Harry . Knew he was out there , bidin ’ his time . It had ter happen . Well , now it has , an ’ we ’ll jus ’ have ter get on with it . We ’ll fight . Migh ’ be able ter stop him before he gets a good hold . That ’s Dumbledore ’s plan , anyway . Great man , Dumbledore . ’S long as we ’ve got him , I ’m not too worried . ”
223016	223027	223028	223028	he	180	“ No good sittin ’ worryin ’ abou ’ it , ”
223031	223059	223028	223028	he	180	“ What ’s comin ’ will come , an ’ we ’ll meet it when it does . Dumbledore told me wha ’ you did , Harry . ”
223070	223095	223068	223068	Harry	157	“ Yeh did as much as yer father would ’ve done , an ’ I can ’ give yeh no higher praise than that . ”
223113	223124	223125	223125	he	180	“ What ’s Dumbledore asked you to do , Hagrid ? ”
223128	223146	223125	223125	he	180	“ He sent Professor McGonagall to ask you and Madame Maxime to meet him — that night . ”
223147	223158	223160	223160	Hagrid	180	“ Got a little job fer me over the summer , ”
223162	223210	223160	223160	Hagrid	180	“ Secret , though . I ’m not s’pposed ter talk abou ’ it , no , not even ter you lot . Olympe — Madame Maxime ter you — might be comin ’ with me . I think she will . Think I got her persuaded . ”
223211	223219	223125	223125	he	180	“ Is it to do with Voldemort ? ”
223229	223234	223235	223235	he	180	“ Migh ’ be , ”

223670	223676	223663	223663	Snape	387	“ at great personal risk . ”
223764	223768	223770	223770	Dumbledore	169	“ The end , ”
223778	223783	223770	223770	Dumbledore	169	“ of another year . ”
223824	223839	223841	223841	Dumbledore	169	“ There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight , ”
223843	223863	223864	223864	he	169	“ but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person , who should be sitting here , ”
223870	223897	223864	223864	he	169	“ enjoying our feast with us . I would like you all , please , to stand , and raise your glasses , to Cedric Diggory . ”
223933	223937	223918	223918	their	2234	“ Cedric Diggory . ”
223970	223986	223987	223987	Dumbledore	169	“ Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish Hufflepuff House , ”
223990	224041	223987	223987	Dumbledore	169	“ He was a good and loyal friend , a hard worker , he valued fair play . His death has affected you all , whether you knew him well or not . I think that you have the right , therefore , to know exactly how it came about . ”
224051	224060	224042	224042	Harry	157	“ Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort . ”
224093	224099	224100	224100	Dumbledore	169	“ The Ministry of Magic , ”
224103	224206	224100	224100	Dumbledore	169	“ does not wish me to tell you this . It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so — either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned , or because they think I should not tell you so , young as you are . It is my belief , however , that the truth is generally preferable to lies , and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident , or some sort of blunder of his own , is an insult to his memory . ”
224266	224282	224283	224283	Dumbledore	169	“ There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with Cedric ’s death , ”
224287	224299	224283	224283	Dumbledore	169	“ I am talking , of course , about Harry Potter . ”
224324	224333	224335	224335	Dumbledore	169	“ Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort , ”
224337	224381	224335	224335	Dumbledore	169	“ He risked his own life to return Cedric ’s body to Hogwarts . He showed , in every respect , the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort , and for this , I honor him . ”
224482	224519	224479	224479	Dumbledore	169	“ The Triwizard Tournament ’s aim was to further and promote magical understanding . In the light of what has happened — of Lord Voldemort ’s return — such ties are more important than ever before . ”
224569	224576	224578	224578	Dumbledore	169	“ Every guest in this Hall , ”
224589	224661	224581	224581	his	169	“ will be welcomed back here at any time , should they wish to come . Remember Cedric . Remember , if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy , remember what happened to a boy who was good , and kind , and brave , because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort . Remember Cedric Diggory . ”
224754	224758	224763	224764	Fleur Delacour	383	“ ’ Arry ! ”
224810	224822	224824	224824	Fleur	383	“ We will see each uzzer again , I ’ ope , ”
224835	224852	224824	224824	Fleur	383	“ I am ’ oping to get a job ’ ere , to improve my Eenglish . ”
224853	224860	224862	224862	Ron	170	“ It ’s very good already , ”
224878	224886	224888	224888	Fleur	383	“ Good - bye , ’ Arry , ”
224894	224904	224888	224888	Fleur	383	“ It ’ az been a pleasure meeting you ! ”
224935	224945	224947	224947	Ron	170	“ Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting back , ”
224949	224960	224947	224947	Ron	170	“ D’you reckon they can steer that ship without Karkaroff ? ”
224961	224967	224987	224987	Krum	204	“ Karkaroff did not steer , ”
224973	224986	224987	224987	Krum	204	“ He stayed in his cabin and let us do the vork . ”
224998	225005	225006	225006	he	204	“ Could I have a vord ? ”
225010	225018	225020	225020	Hermione	168	“ Oh ... yes ... all right , ”
225037	225044	225045	225045	Ron	170	“ You ’d better hurry up ! ”
225051	225060	225045	225045	Ron	170	“ The carriages’ll be here in a minute ! ”
225115	225120	225122	225122	Krum	204	“ I liked Diggory , ”
225127	225147	225148	225148	he	157	“ He vos alvays polite to me . Alvays . Even though I vos from Durmstrang — with Karkaroff , ”
225153	225162	225164	225164	Harry	157	“ Have you got a new headmaster yet ? ”
225214	225221	225210	225210	Ron	170	“ Can I have your autograph ? ”
225492	225561	225481	225481	Hermione	168	“ There ’s nothing in there . You can look for yourself , but there ’s nothing at all . I ’ve been checking every day . Just a small piece the day after the third task saying you won the tournament . They did n’t even mention Cedric . Nothing about any of it . If you ask me , Fudge is forcing them to keep quiet . ”
225562	225570	225572	225572	Harry	157	“ He ’ll never keep Rita quiet , ”
225574	225582	225572	225572	Harry	157	“ Not on a story like this . ”
225583	225598	225600	225600	Hermione	168	“ Oh , Rita has n’t written anything at all since the third task , ”
225607	225614	225615	225615	she	168	“ As a matter of fact , ”
225624	225652	225615	225615	she	168	“ Rita Skeeter is n’t going to be writing anything at all for a while . Not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her . ”
225653	225660	225662	225662	Ron	170	“ What are you talking about ? ”
225664	225688	225690	225690	Hermione	168	“ I found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she was n’t supposed to be coming onto the grounds , ”
225726	225733	225735	225735	Harry	157	“ How was she doing it ? ”
225739	225746	225748	225748	Ron	170	“ How did you find out ? ”
225754	225771	225772	225772	she	168	“ Well , it was you , really , who gave me the idea , Harry , ”
225775	225779	225781	225781	Harry	157	“ Did I ? ”
225785	225788	225781	225781	Harry	157	“ How ? ”
225789	225792	225794	225794	Hermione	168	“ Bugging , ”
225797	225806	225781	225781	Harry	157	“ But you said they did n’t work — ”
225807	225813	225815	225815	Hermione	168	“ Oh not electronic bugs , ”
225817	225825	225815	225815	Hermione	168	“ No , you see ... Rita Skeeter ”
225835	225845	225815	225815	Hermione	168	“ is an unregistered Animagus . She can turn — ”
225858	225864	225846	225846	Hermione	168	“ — into a beetle . ”
225865	225870	225872	225872	Ron	170	“ You ’re kidding , ”
225874	225883	225872	225872	Ron	170	“ You have n’t ... she ’s not ... ”
225884	225890	225892	225892	Hermione	168	“ Oh yes she is , ”
225915	225924	225925	225925	Ron	170	“ That ’s never — you ’re kidding — ”
225935	225942	225944	225944	Hermione	168	“ No , I ’m not , ”
225948	225982	225944	225944	Hermione	168	“ I caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing . Look very closely , and you ’ll notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears . ”
225998	226018	225944	225944	Hermione	168	“ There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard Hagrid telling Madame Maxime about his mum ! ”
226019	226022	226024	226024	Hermione	168	“ Exactly , ”
226026	226080	226024	226024	Hermione	168	“ And Viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after we ’d had our conversation by the lake . And unless I ’m very much mistaken , Rita was perched on the windowsill of the Divination class the day your scar hurt . She ’s been buzzing around for stories all year . ”
226081	226090	226092	226092	Ron	170	“ When we saw Malfoy under that tree ... ”
226095	226106	226108	226108	Hermione	168	“ He was talking to her , in his hand , ”
226110	226158	226108	226108	Hermione	168	“ He knew , of course . That ’s how she ’s been getting all those nice little interviews with the Slytherins . They would n’t care that she was doing something illegal , as long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us and Hagrid . ”
226180	226197	226199	226199	Hermione	168	“ I ’ve told her I ’ll let her out when we get back to London , ”
226201	226254	226199	226199	Hermione	168	“ I ’ve put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar , you see , so she ca n’t transform . And I ’ve told her she ’s to keep her quill to herself for a whole year . See if she ca n’t break the habit of writing horrible lies about people . ”
226275	226281	226283	226284	Draco Malfoy	256	“ Very clever , Granger , ”
226317	226320	226322	226322	Malfoy	256	“ So , ”
226344	226363	226341	226341	his	256	“ You caught some pathetic reporter , and Potter ’s Dumbledore ’s favorite boy again . Big deal . ”
226373	226384	226386	226386	Malfoy	256	“ Trying not to think about it , are we ? ”
226397	226406	226386	226386	Malfoy	256	“ Trying to pretend it has n’t happened ? ”
226407	226411	226413	226413	Harry	157	“ Get out , ”
226460	226512	226513	226513	He	157	“ You ’ve picked the losing side , Potter ! I warned you ! I told you you ought to choose your company more carefully , remember ? When we met on the train , first day at Hogwarts ? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like this ! ”
226522	226560	226515	226515	his	157	“ Too late now , Potter ! They ’ll be the first to go , now the Dark Lord ’s back ! Mudbloods and Muggle - lovers first ! Well — second — Diggory was the f — ”
226652	226664	226666	226666	Fred	174	“ Thought we ’d see what those three were up to , ”
226705	226709	226711	226711	George	175	“ Interesting effect , ”
226718	226725	226711	226711	George	175	“ Who used the Furnunculus Curse ? ”
226726	226729	226731	226731	Harry	157	“ Me , ”
226733	226736	226738	226738	George	175	“ Odd , ”
226741	226788	226738	226738	George	175	“ I used Jelly - Legs . Looks as though those two should n’t be mixed . He seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face . Well , let ’s not leave them here , they do n’t add much to the decor . ”
226846	226852	226854	226854	Fred	174	“ Exploding Snap , anyone ? ”
226877	226886	226887	226887	he	157	“ You going to tell us , then ? ”
226892	226898	226887	226887	he	157	“ Who you were blackmailing ? ”
226899	226902	226904	226904	George	175	“ Oh , ”
226907	226910	226904	226904	George	175	“ That . ”
226911	226917	226919	226919	Fred	174	“ It does n’t matter , ”
226926	226938	226919	226919	Fred	174	“ It was n’t anything important . Not now , anyway . ”
226939	226945	226947	226947	George	175	“ We ’ve given up , ”
226968	226987	226965	226965	Fred	174	“ All right , all right , if you really want to know ... it was Ludo Bagman . ”
226988	226991	226993	226993	Harry	157	“ Bagman ? ”
226996	227005	226993	226993	Harry	157	“ Are you saying he was involved in — ”
227006	227009	227011	227011	George	175	“ Nah , ”
227014	227029	227011	227011	George	175	“ Nothing like that . Stupid git . He would n’t have the brains . ”
227030	227037	227039	227039	Ron	170	“ Well , what , then ? ”
227047	227075	227041	227041	Fred	174	“ You remember that bet we had with him at the Quidditch World Cup ? About how Ireland would win , but Krum would get the Snitch ? ”
227076	227079	227081	227081	Harry	157	“ Yeah , ”
227086	227104	227041	227041	Fred	174	“ Well , the git paid us in leprechaun gold he ’d caught from the Irish mascots . ”
227105	227108	227041	227041	Fred	174	“ So ? ”
227109	227112	227114	227114	Fred	174	“ So , ”
227117	227133	227114	227114	Fred	174	“ it vanished , did n’t it ? By next morning , it had gone ! ”
227134	227148	227150	227150	Hermione	168	“ But — it must ’ve been an accident , must n’t it ? ”
227157	227225	227152	227152	George	175	“ Yeah , that ’s what we thought , at first . We thought if we just wrote to him , and told him he ’d made a mistake , he ’d cough up . But nothing doing . Ignored our letter . We kept trying to talk to him about it at Hogwarts , but he was always making some excuse to get away from us . ”
227226	227236	227238	227238	Fred	174	“ In the end , he turned pretty nasty , ”
227240	227258	227238	227238	Fred	174	“ Told us we were too young to gamble , and he was n’t giving us anything . ”
227259	227268	227270	227270	George	175	“ So we asked for our money back , ”
227274	227280	227282	227282	Hermione	168	“ He did n’t refuse ! ”
227284	227289	227291	227291	Fred	174	“ Right in one , ”
227293	227301	227303	227303	Ron	170	“ But that was all your savings ! ”
227305	227311	227313	227313	George	175	“ Tell me about it , ”
227315	227441	227313	227313	George	175	“ ’ Course , we found out what was going on in the end . Lee Jordan ’s dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off Bagman as well . Turns out he ’s in big trouble with the goblins . Borrowed loads of gold off them . A gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the gold he had , and it still was n’t enough to cover all his debts . They followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him . He ’s lost everything gambling . Has n’t got two Galleons to rub together . And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back ? ”
227442	227445	227447	227447	Harry	157	“ How ? ”
227449	227459	227461	227461	Fred	174	“ He put a bet on you , mate , ”
227463	227480	227461	227461	Fred	174	“ Put a big bet on you to win the tournament . Bet against the goblins . ”
227481	227494	227496	227496	Harry	157	“ So that ’s why he kept trying to help me win ! ”
227498	227517	227496	227496	Harry	157	“ Well — I did win , did n’t I ? So he can pay you your gold ! ”
227518	227521	227523	227523	George	175	“ Nope , ”
227529	227573	227523	227523	George	175	“ The goblins play as dirty as him . They say you drew with Diggory , and Bagman was betting you ’d win outright . So Bagman had to run for it . He did run for it right after the third task . ”
227698	227707	227708	227709	The twins	922	“ Fred — George — wait a moment . ”
227724	227728	227729	227729	he	157	“ Take it , ”
227742	227745	227747	227747	Fred	174	“ What ? ”
227752	227756	227757	227757	Harry	157	“ Take it , ”
227761	227768	227757	227757	Harry	157	“ I do n’t want it . ”
227769	227774	227776	227776	George	175	“ You ’re mental , ”
227786	227793	227795	227795	Harry	157	“ No , I ’m not , ”
227797	227813	227795	227795	Harry	157	“ You take it , and get inventing . It ’s for the joke shop . ”
227814	227819	227820	227820	Fred	174	“ He is mental , ”
227828	227831	227833	227833	Harry	157	“ Listen , ”
227836	227899	227833	227833	Harry	157	“ If you do n’t take it , I ’m throwing it down the drain . I do n’t want it and I do n’t need it . But I could do with a few laughs . We could all do with a few laughs . I ’ve got a feeling we ’re going to need them more than usual before long . ”
227900	227903	227905	227905	George	175	“ Harry , ”
227916	227928	227905	227905	George	175	“ there ’s got to be a thousand Galleons in here . ”
227929	227932	227934	227934	Harry	157	“ Yeah , ”
227938	227947	227934	227934	Harry	157	“ Think how many Canary Creams that is . ”
227954	227987	227905	227905	George	175	“ Just do n’t tell your mum where you got it ... although she might not be so keen for you to join the Ministry anymore , come to think of it ... ”
227988	227991	227992	227992	Fred	174	“ Harry , ”
228002	228005	228006	228006	he	157	“ Look , ”
228010	228048	228006	228006	he	157	“ take it , or I ’ll hex you . I know some good ones now . Just do me one favor , okay ? Buy Ron some different dress robes and say they ’re from you . ”
228112	228133	228103	228103	she	173	“ I think Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer . Keep in touch , Harry . ”
228134	228140	228142	228142	Ron	170	“ See you , Harry , ”
228150	228156	228161	228161	she	168	“ ’ Bye , Harry ! ”
228177	228182	228183	228183	George	175	“ Harry — thanks , ”
