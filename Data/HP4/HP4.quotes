8	13	0	4	The villagers of Little Hangleton	538	“ the Riddle House , ”
98	101	88	90	The Little Hangletons	146	“ creepy . ”
476	483	484	484	she	579	“ Always thought he was odd , ”
496	530	484	484	she	579	“ Unfriendly , like . I ’m sure if I ’ve offered him a cuppa once , I ’ve offered it a hundred times . Never wanted to mix , he did n’t . ”
531	536	538	542	a woman at the bar	581	“ Ah , now , ”
544	565	538	542	a woman at the bar	581	“ he had a hard war , Frank . He likes the quiet life . That ’s no reason to — ”
566	579	581	582	the cook	579	“ Who else had a key to the back door , then ? ”
584	633	581	582	the cook	579	“ There ’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener ’s cottage far back as I can remember ! Nobody forced the door last night ! No broken windows ! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping ... ”
640	655	657	661	a man at the bar	584	“ I always thought he had a nasty look about him , right enough , ”
663	674	676	677	the landlord	585	“ War turned him funny , if you ask me , ”
679	701	703	708	an excited woman in the corner	586	“ Told you I would n’t like to get on the wrong side of Frank , did n’t I , Dot ? ”
710	714	716	716	Dot	152	“ Horrible temper , ”
721	731	716	716	Dot	152	“ I remember , when he was a kid ... ”
1069	1091	1093	1093	Dot	152	“ ’S far as I ’m concerned , he killed them , and I do n’t care what the police say , ”
1099	1121	1093	1093	Dot	152	“ And if he had any decency , he ’d leave here , knowing as how we knows he did it . ”
1221	1225	1211	1211	they	615	“ tax reasons , ”
1964	1983	1949	1950	a man	654	“ There is a little more in the bottle , my Lord , if you are still hungry . ”
1984	1987	1997	1998	a man	654	“ Later , ”
2036	2046	2030	2030	Frank	150	“ Move me closer to the fire , Wormtail . ”
2142	2147	2149	2151	the cold voice	658	“ Where is Nagini ? ”
2153	2164	2166	2168	the first voice	659	“ I — I do n’t know , my Lord , ”
2171	2183	2166	2168	the first voice	659	“ She set out to explore the house , I think ... ”
2184	2195	2197	2199	the second voice	660	“ You will milk her before we retire , Wormtail , ”
2201	2217	2197	2199	the second voice	660	“ I will need feeding in the night . The journey has tired me greatly . ”
2250	2266	2243	2245	the man called	661	“ My Lord , may I ask how long we are going to stay here ? ”
2267	2271	2273	2275	the cold voice	658	“ A week , ”
2277	2309	2273	2275	the cold voice	658	“ Perhaps longer . The place is moderately comfortable , and the plan can not proceed yet . It would be foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over . ”
2338	2341	2273	2275	the cold voice	658	“ Quidditch , ”
2350	2361	2363	2363	Wormtail	154	“ The — the Quidditch World Cup , my Lord ? ”
2378	2400	2366	2366	Frank	150	“ Forgive me , but — I do not understand — why should we wait until the World Cup is over ? ”
2401	2468	2368	2368	his	150	“ Because , fool , at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world , and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty , on the watch for signs of unusual activity , checking and double - checking identities . They will be obsessed with security , lest the Muggles notice anything . So we wait . ”
2484	2489	2478	2478	He	150	“ Ministry of Magic , ”
2490	2493	2368	2368	his	150	“ wizards , ”
2495	2498	2478	2478	He	150	“ Muggles . ”
2546	2555	2556	2556	Wormtail	154	“ Your Lordship is still determined , then ? ”
2560	2568	2556	2556	Wormtail	154	“ Certainly I am determined , Wormtail . ”
2615	2627	2602	2602	he	154	“ It could be done without Harry Potter , my Lord . ”
2637	2642	2644	2646	the second voice	660	“ Without Harry Potter ? ”
2649	2653	2644	2646	the second voice	660	“ I see ... ”
2654	2670	2672	2672	Wormtail	154	“ My Lord , I do not say this out of concern for the boy ! ”
2679	2756	2674	2674	his	154	“ The boy is nothing to me , nothing at all ! It is merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard — any wizard — the thing could be done so much more quickly ! If you allowed me to leave you for a short while — you know that I can disguise myself most effectively — I could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person — ”
2757	2764	2766	2768	the cold voice	658	“ I could use another wizard , ”
2771	2776	2766	2768	the cold voice	658	“ that is true ... ”
2777	2785	2787	2787	Wormtail	154	“ My Lord , it makes sense , ”
2794	2811	2787	2787	Wormtail	154	“ Laying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult , he is so well protected — ”
2812	2859	2766	2768	the cold voice	658	“ And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute ? I wonder ... perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you , Wormtail ? Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me ? ”
2860	2878	2787	2787	Wormtail	154	“ My Lord ! I — I have no wish to leave you , none at all — ”
2879	2886	2888	2890	the second voice	660	“ Do not lie to me ! ”
2892	2932	2888	2890	the second voice	660	“ I can always tell , Wormtail ! You are regretting that you ever returned to me . I revolt you . I see you flinch when you look at me , feel you shudder when you touch me ... ”
2933	2942	2787	2787	Wormtail	154	“ No ! My devotion to Your Lordship — ”
2943	2987	2888	2890	the second voice	660	“ Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice . You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go . How am I to survive without you , when I need feeding every few hours ? Who is to milk Nagini ? ”
2988	2999	2787	2787	Wormtail	154	“ But you seem so much stronger , my Lord — ”
3000	3003	3005	3007	the second voice	660	“ Liar , ”
3009	3040	3005	3007	the second voice	660	“ I am no stronger , and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained under your clumsy care . Silence ! ”
3085	3173	3069	3071	the second man	670	“ I have my reasons for using the boy , as I have already explained to you , and I will use no other . I have waited thirteen years . A few more months will make no difference . As for the protection surrounding the boy , I believe my plan will be effective . All that is needed is a little courage from you , Wormtail — courage you will find , unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord Voldemort ’s wrath — ”
3174	3182	3184	3184	Wormtail	154	“ My Lord , I must speak ! ”
3192	3230	3184	3184	Wormtail	154	“ All through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head — my Lord , Bertha Jorkins ’s disappearance will not go unnoticed for long , and if we proceed , if I murder — ”
3231	3234	3236	3238	the second voice	660	“ If ? ”
3240	3325	3236	3238	the second voice	660	“ If ? If you follow the plan , Wormtail , the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died . You will do it quietly and without fuss ; I only wish that I could do it myself , but in my present condition ... Come , Wormtail , one more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear . I am not asking you to do it alone . By that time , my faithful servant will have rejoined us — ”
3326	3333	3335	3335	Wormtail	154	“ I am a faithful servant , ”
3346	3371	3343	3343	his	154	“ Wormtail , I need somebody with brains , somebody whose loyalty has never wavered , and you , unfortunately , fulfill neither requirement . ”
3372	3377	3379	3379	Wormtail	154	“ I found you , ”
3393	3408	3389	3389	his	154	“ I was the one who found you . I brought you Bertha Jorkins . ”
3409	3414	3416	3418	the second man	670	“ That is true , ”
3423	3463	3416	3418	the second man	670	“ A stroke of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you , Wormtail — though , if truth be told , you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her , were you ? ”
3464	3477	3483	3485	the second voice	660	“ I — I thought she might be useful , my Lord — ”
3478	3481	3483	3485	the second voice	660	“ Liar , ”
3496	3558	3483	3485	the second voice	660	“ However , I do not deny that her information was invaluable . Without it , I could never have formed our plan , and for that , you will have your reward , Wormtail . I will allow you to perform an essential task for me , one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform ... ”
3559	3570	3571	3571	Wormtail	154	“ R - really , my Lord ? What — ? ”
3576	3619	3483	3485	the second voice	660	“ Ah , Wormtail , you do n’t want me to spoil the surprise ? Your part will come at the very end ... but I promise you , you will have the honor of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins . ”
3620	3625	3626	3626	Wormtail	154	“ You ... you ... ”
3642	3653	3626	3626	Wormtail	154	“ You ... are going ... to kill me too ? ”
3654	3659	3661	3663	the cold voice	658	“ Wormtail , Wormtail , ”
3666	3745	3661	3663	the cold voice	658	“ why would I kill you ? I killed Bertha because I had to . She was fit for nothing after my questioning , quite useless . In any case , awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays . Wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of Magic witches at wayside inns ... ”
3776	3823	3761	3763	the second man	670	“ We could have modified her memory ? But Memory Charms can be broken by a powerful wizard , as I proved when I questioned her . It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her , Wormtail . ”
3963	4004	4013	4013	He	670	“ One more murder ... my faithful servant at Hogwarts ... Harry Potter is as good as mine , Wormtail . It is decided . There will be no more argument . But quiet ... I think I hear Nagini ... ”
4351	4359	4409	4409	Frank	150	“ Nagini has interesting news , Wormtail , ”
4363	4371	4373	4373	Wormtail	154	“ In - indeed , my Lord ? ”
4375	4380	4435	4452	A short , balding man with graying hair , a pointed nose , and small , watery eyes	694	“ Indeed , yes , ”
4385	4408	4435	4452	A short , balding man with graying hair , a pointed nose , and small , watery eyes	694	“ According to Nagini , there is an old Muggle standing right outside this room , listening to every word we say . ”
4467	4479	4464	4464	his	694	“ Invite him inside , Wormtail . Where are your manners ? ”
4610	4617	4619	4621	the cold voice	658	“ You heard everything , Muggle ? ”
4623	4632	4634	4634	Frank	150	“ What ’s that you ’re calling me ? ”
4671	4679	4619	4621	the cold voice	658	“ I am calling you a Muggle , ”
4685	4695	4619	4621	the cold voice	658	“ It means that you are not a wizard . ”
4696	4707	4709	4709	Frank	150	“ I do n’t know what you mean by wizard , ”
4716	4752	4753	4753	he	150	“ All I know is I ’ve heard enough to interest the police tonight , I have . You ’ve done murder and you ’re planning more ! And I ’ll tell you this too , ”
4761	4778	4753	4753	he	150	“ my wife knows I ’m up here , and if I do n’t come back — ”
4779	4785	4787	4789	the cold voice	658	“ You have no wife , ”
4794	4826	4787	4789	the cold voice	658	“ Nobody knows you are here . You told nobody that you were coming . Do not lie to Lord Voldemort , Muggle , for he knows ... he always knows ... ”
4827	4832	4834	4834	Frank	150	“ Is that right ? ”
4837	4872	4834	4834	Frank	150	“ Lord , is it ? Well , I do n’t think much of your manners , my Lord . Turn ’ round and face me like a man , why do n’t you ? ”
4873	4883	4787	4789	the cold voice	658	“ But I am not a man , Muggle , ”
4899	4928	4787	4789	the cold voice	658	“ I am much , much more than a man . However ... why not ? I will face you ... Wormtail , come turn my chair around . ”
4935	4942	4946	4946	his	703	“ You heard me , Wormtail . ”
6784	6823	6770	6771	Hermione Granger	169	“ Your scar hurt ? Harry , that ’s really serious ... Write to Professor Dumbledore ! And I ’ll go and check Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions ... Maybe there ’s something in there about curse scars ... ”
7075	7141	7053	7053	Ron	171	“ Your scar hurt ? But ... but You - Know - Who ca n’t be near you now , can he ? I mean ... you ’d know , would n’t you ? He ’d be trying to do you in again , would n’t he ? I dunno , Harry , maybe curse scars always twinge a bit ... I ’ll ask Dad ... ”
8229	8237	8241	8241	her	167	“ There you are , Diddy darling , ”
8308	8323	8304	8305	Uncle Vernon	166	“ he did n’t want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway . ”
8336	8352	8353	8354	Aunt Petunia	167	“ He ’s a boisterous little boy , but he would n’t hurt a fly ! ”
8589	8593	8586	8587	Uncle Vernon	166	“ rabbit food . ”
8934	8939	8940	8940	he	166	“ Is this it ? ”
9130	9133	9134	9134	he	166	“ You , ”
9139	9147	9134	9134	he	166	“ In the living room . Now . ”
9191	9194	9195	9195	he	166	“ So , ”
9219	9222	9195	9195	he	166	“ So . ”
9232	9236	9223	9223	Harry	158	“ So what ? ”
9277	9282	9284	9285	Uncle Vernon	166	“ This just arrived , ”
9298	9305	9287	9287	He	166	“ A letter . About you . ”
9370	9375	9376	9376	he	166	“ Look at this , ”
9433	9443	9445	9445	Harry	158	“ She did put enough stamps on , then , ”
9468	9473	9474	9474	he	166	“ The postman noticed , ”
9480	9509	9474	9474	he	166	“ Very interested to know where this letter came from , he was . That ’s why he rang the doorbell . Seemed to think it was funny . ”
9642	9650	9651	9651	he	158	“ So — can I go then ? ”
9778	9784	9785	9785	he	166	“ Who is this woman ? ”
9795	9801	9803	9803	Harry	158	“ You ’ve seen her , ”
9805	9833	9803	9803	Harry	158	“ She ’s my friend Ron ’s mother , she was meeting him off the Hog — off the school train at the end of last term . ”
9838	9842	9834	9834	He	158	“ Hogwarts Express , ”
9888	9894	9895	9895	he	166	“ Dumpy sort of woman ? ”
9899	9907	9895	9895	he	166	“ Load of children with red hair ? ”
9924	9927	9911	9911	He	158	“ dumpy , ”
9967	9970	9971	9971	he	166	“ Quidditch , ”
9977	9985	9971	9971	he	166	“ Quidditch — what is this rubbish ? ”
9994	10000	10001	10001	he	158	“ It ’s a sport , ”
10005	10010	10001	10001	he	158	“ Played on broom — ”
10011	10018	10020	10021	Uncle Vernon	166	“ All right , all right ! ”
10049	10051	10068	10068	his	158	“ broomsticks ”
10073	10084	10085	10085	He	158	“ send us your answer ... in the normal way . ”
10088	10100	10101	10101	he	158	“ What does she mean , ‘ the normal way ’ ? ”
10104	10109	10111	10111	Harry	158	“ Normal for us , ”
10124	10139	10121	10121	he	158	“ you know , owl post . That ’s what ’s normal for wizards . ”
10185	10204	10205	10205	he	166	“ How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof ? ”
10216	10234	10205	10205	he	166	“ You stand there , in the clothes Petunia and I have put on your ungrateful back — ”
10235	10243	10245	10245	Harry	158	“ Only after Dudley finished with them , ”
10294	10304	10306	10307	Uncle Vernon	166	“ I will not be spoken to like that ! ”
10389	10426	10378	10378	Harry	158	“ Okay , I ca n’t see the World Cup . Can I go now , then ? Only I ’ve got a letter to Sirius I want to finish . You know — my godfather . ”
10463	10476	10478	10479	Uncle Vernon	166	“ You ’re — you ’re writing to him , are you ? ”
10504	10509	10511	10511	Harry	158	“ Well — yeah , ”
10515	10545	10511	10511	Harry	158	“ It ’s been a while since he heard from me , and , you know , if he does n’t , he might start thinking something ’s wrong . ”
10673	10756	10766	10766	He	158	“ Well , all right then . You can go to this ruddy ... this stupid ... this World Cup thing . You write and tell these — these Weasleys they ’re to pick you up , mind . I have n’t got time to go dropping you off all over the country . And you can spend the rest of the summer there . And you can tell your — your godfather ... tell him ... tell him you ’re going . ”
10757	10761	10763	10763	Harry	158	“ Okay then , ”
10849	10860	10862	10862	Harry	158	“ That was an excellent breakfast , was n’t it ? ”
10864	10874	10862	10862	Harry	158	“ I feel really full , do n’t you ? ”
10955	10958	10960	10960	Harry	158	“ OUCH ! ”
11065	11068	11060	11060	Harry	158	“ Pig , ”
11114	11118	11119	11119	Harry	158	“ Calm down ! ”
11151	11164	11135	11135	Harry	158	“ Come here , I need you to take my answer back ! ”
11273	11281	11282	11282	he	158	“ Feeling up to a long journey ? ”
11296	11306	11307	11307	he	158	“ Can you take this to Sirius for me ? ”
11315	11326	11307	11307	he	158	“ Hang on ... I just want to finish it . ”
11403	11418	11419	11419	Harry	158	“ I ’ll be at Ron ’s when you get back , all right ? ”
11735	11748	11749	11749	he	166	“ I hope you told them to dress properly , these people , ”
11754	11782	11749	11749	he	166	“ I ’ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear . They ’d better have the decency to put on normal clothes , that ’s all . ”
11806	11809	11802	11803	the Dursleys	168	“ normal . ”
12090	12099	12100	12101	Uncle Vernon	166	“ They ’ll be driving , of course ? ”
12107	12110	12112	12112	Harry	158	“ Er , ”
12179	12184	12186	12186	Harry	158	“ I think so , ”
12434	12439	12440	12440	he	166	“ They ’re late ! ”
12445	12449	12451	12451	Harry	158	“ I know , ”
12453	12466	12451	12451	Harry	158	“ Maybe — er — the traffic ’s bad , or something . ”
12506	12512	12556	12556	him	166	“ No consideration at all . ”
12513	12521	12556	12556	him	166	“ We might ’ve had an engagement . ”
12522	12537	12556	12556	him	166	“ Maybe they think they ’ll get invited to dinner if they ’re late . ”
12538	12548	12550	12551	Uncle Vernon	166	“ Well , they most certainly wo n’t be , ”
12566	12625	12556	12556	him	166	“ They ’ll take the boy and go , there ’ll be no hanging around . That ’s if they ’re coming at all . Probably mistaken the day . I daresay their kind do n’t set much store by punctuality . Either that or they drive some tin - pot car that ’s broken d — AAAAAAAARRRRRGH ! ”
12668	12672	12674	12674	Harry	158	“ What happened ? ”
12676	12682	12674	12674	Harry	158	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
12745	12750	12752	12753	Aunt Petunia	167	“ What is it ? ”
12771	12778	12752	12753	Aunt Petunia	167	“ What is it , Vernon ? ”
12800	12844	12962	12962	He	158	“ Ouch ! Fred , no — go back , go back , there ’s been some kind of mistake — tell George not to — OUCH ! George , no , there ’s no room , go back quickly and tell Ron — ”
12845	12864	12962	12962	He	158	“ Maybe Harry can hear us , Dad — maybe he ’ll be able to let us out — ”
12880	12890	12962	12962	He	158	“ Harry ? Harry , can you hear us ? ”
12903	12908	12910	12911	Uncle Vernon	166	“ What is this ? ”
12913	12919	12910	12911	Uncle Vernon	166	“ What ’s going on ? ”
12920	12933	12935	12935	Harry	158	“ They — they ’ve tried to get here by Floo powder , ”
12944	12961	12935	12935	Harry	158	“ They can travel by fire — only you ’ve blocked the fireplace — hang on — ”
12972	12981	12962	12962	He	158	“ Mr. Weasley ? Can you hear me ? ”
12993	12996	12986	12990	Somebody inside the chimney piece	894	“ Shh ! ”
12997	13022	12962	12962	He	158	“ Mr. Weasley , it ’s Harry ... the fireplace has been blocked up . You wo n’t be able to get through there . ”
13023	13026	13028	13029	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Damn ! ”
13033	13047	13028	13029	Mr. Weasley	173	“ What on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for ? ”
13048	13056	13057	13057	Harry	158	“ They ’ve got an electric fire , ”
13060	13063	13065	13066	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Really ? ”
13071	13096	13065	13066	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Eclectic , you say ? With a plug ? Gracious , I must see that ... Let ’s think ... ouch , Ron ! ”
13106	13118	13097	13097	Ron	171	“ What are we doing here ? Has something gone wrong ? ”
13119	13125	13127	13127	Fred	175	“ Oh no , Ron , ”
13134	13147	13127	13127	Fred	175	“ No , this is exactly where we wanted to end up . ”
13148	13161	13163	13163	George	176	“ Yeah , we ’re having the time of our lives here , ”
13179	13184	13186	13187	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Boys , boys ... ”
13190	13210	13186	13187	Mr. Weasley	173	“ I ’m trying to think what to do ... Yes ... only way ... Stand back , Harry . ”
13225	13230	13231	13231	he	166	“ Wait a moment ! ”
13237	13245	13231	13231	he	166	“ What exactly are you going to — ”
13334	13339	13341	13342	Mr. Weasley	173	“ That ’s better , ”
13356	13368	13341	13342	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Ah — you must be Harry ’s aunt and uncle ! ”
13434	13443	13445	13446	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Er — yes — sorry about that , ”
13461	13584	13449	13449	his	173	“ It ’s all my fault . It just did n’t occur to me that we would n’t be able to get out at the other end . I had your fireplace connected to the Floo Network , you see — just for an afternoon , you know , so we could get Harry . Muggle fireplaces are n’t supposed to be connected , strictly speaking — but I ’ve got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel and he fixed it for me . I can put it right in a jiffy , though , do n’t worry . I ’ll light a fire to send the boys back , and then I can repair your fireplace before I Disapparate . ”
13623	13628	13630	13631	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Hello , Harry ! ”
13634	13640	13630	13631	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Got your trunk ready ? ”
13641	13646	13648	13648	Harry	158	“ It ’s upstairs , ”
13653	13659	13661	13661	Fred	175	“ We ’ll get it , ”
13720	13723	13729	13729	his	173	“ Well , ”
13746	13759	13734	13734	he	173	“ Very — erm — very nice place you ’ve got here . ”
13846	13855	13856	13856	he	173	“ They run off eckeltricity , do they ? ”
13860	13874	13875	13875	he	173	“ Ah yes , I can see the plugs . I collect plugs , ”
13881	13905	13875	13875	he	173	“ And batteries . Got a very large collection of batteries . My wife thinks I ’m mad , but there you are . ”
14025	14038	14040	14041	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Ah , this is your cousin , is it , Harry ? ”
14051	14054	14056	14056	Harry	158	“ Yep , ”
14058	14063	14056	14056	Harry	158	“ that ’s Dudley . ”
14159	14167	14168	14168	he	173	“ Having a good holiday , Dudley ? ”
14219	14224	14226	14227	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Ah , right , ”
14229	14235	14226	14227	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Better get cracking then . ”
14262	14265	14267	14268	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Incendio ! ”
14340	14348	14350	14351	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Off you go then , Fred , ”
14353	14356	14358	14358	Fred	175	“ Coming , ”
14360	14367	14358	14358	Fred	175	“ Oh no — hang on — ”
14428	14432	14433	14434	Aunt Petunia	167	“ the Burrow ! ”
14451	14457	14459	14460	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Right then , George , ”
14462	14468	14459	14460	Mr. Weasley	173	“ you and the trunk . ”
14503	14507	14500	14500	George	176	“ the Burrow ! ”

14548	14552	14535	14535	He	171	“ the Burrow ! ”
14564	14570	14571	14571	Harry	158	“ Well ... ’bye then , ”
14622	14631	14632	14632	he	173	“ Harry said good - bye to you , ”
14635	14642	14632	14632	he	173	“ Did n’t you hear him ? ”
14643	14649	14650	14650	Harry	158	“ It does n’t matter , ”
14656	14664	14650	14650	Harry	158	“ Honestly , I do n’t care . ”
14677	14690	14691	14691	he	173	“ You are n’t going to see your nephew till next summer , ”
14700	14711	14691	14691	he	173	“ Surely you ’re going to say good - bye ? ”
14775	14782	14769	14769	he	166	“ Good - bye , then . ”
14783	14787	14789	14789	Harry	158	“ See you , ”
14969	14980	14981	14981	he	173	“ Not to worry , I can sort him out ! ”
15013	15018	15020	15021	Mr. Weasley	173	“ No , really ! ”
15024	15067	15020	15021	Mr. Weasley	173	“ It ’s a simple process — it was the toffee — my son Fred — real practical joker — but it ’s only an Engorgement Charm — at least , I think it is — please , I can correct it — ”
15158	15162	15164	15165	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Now really ! ”
15172	15179	15164	15165	Mr. Weasley	173	“ I ’m trying to help ! ”
15193	15201	15202	15203	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Harry , go ! Just go ! ”
15212	15219	15202	15203	Mr. Weasley	173	“ I ’ll sort this out ! ”
15269	15273	15267	15267	he	166	“ the Burrow ! ”
15421	15427	15429	15429	Fred	175	“ Did he eat it ? ”
15443	15446	15448	15448	Harry	158	“ Yeah , ”
15453	15458	15448	15448	Harry	158	“ What was it ? ”
15459	15465	15467	15467	Fred	175	“ Ton - Tongue Toffee , ”
15470	15491	15467	15467	Fred	175	“ George and I invented them , and we ’ve been looking for someone to test them on all summer ... ”
15546	15554	15559	15560	the two	919	“ How ’re you doing , Harry ? ”
15851	15859	15860	15860	he	173	“ That was n’t funny , Fred ! ”
15863	15874	15860	15860	he	173	“ What on earth did you give that Muggle boy ? ”
15875	15883	15885	15885	Fred	175	“ I did n’t give him anything , ”
15892	15914	15885	15885	Fred	175	“ I just dropped it ... It was his fault he went and ate it , I never told him to . ”
15915	15922	15924	15925	Mr. Weasley	173	“ You dropped it on purpose ! ”
15927	15943	15924	15925	Mr. Weasley	173	“ You knew he ’d eat it , you knew he was on a diet — ”
15944	15952	15953	15953	George	176	“ How big did his tongue get ? ”
15957	15972	15924	15925	Mr. Weasley	173	“ It was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it ! ”
15982	15988	15989	15990	Mr. Weasley	173	“ It is n’t funny ! ”
15993	16022	15989	15990	Mr. Weasley	173	“ That sort of behavior seriously undermines wizard – Muggle relations ! I spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of Muggles , and my own sons — ”
16023	16037	16039	16039	Fred	175	“ We did n’t give it to him because he ’s a Muggle ! ”
16042	16058	16060	16060	George	176	“ No , we gave it to him because he ’s a great bullying git , ”
16062	16069	16060	16060	George	176	“ Is n’t he , Harry ? ”
16070	16079	16081	16081	Harry	158	“ Yeah , he is , Mr. Weasley , ”
16084	16091	16093	16094	Mr. Weasley	173	“ That ’s not the point ! ”
16096	16105	16093	16094	Mr. Weasley	173	“ You wait until I tell your mother — ”
16106	16111	16126	16126	She	174	“ Tell me what ? ”
16148	16156	16157	16157	she	174	“ Oh hello , Harry , dear , ”
16174	16181	16166	16166	her	174	“ Tell me what , Arthur ? ”
16314	16321	16322	16323	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Tell me what , Arthur ? ”
16333	16340	16342	16343	Mr. Weasley	173	“ It ’s nothing , Molly , ”
16345	16359	16342	16343	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Fred and George just — but I ’ve had words with them — ”
16360	16368	16370	16371	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ What have they done this time ? ”
16373	16387	16370	16371	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ If it ’s got anything to do with Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes — ”
16388	16402	16404	16404	Hermione	169	“ Why do n’t you show Harry where he ’s sleeping , Ron ? ”
16409	16417	16419	16419	Ron	171	“ He knows where he ’s sleeping , ”
16421	16431	16419	16419	Ron	171	“ in my room , he slept there last — ”
16432	16438	16440	16440	Hermione	169	“ We can all go , ”
16443	16446	16448	16448	Ron	171	“ Oh , ”
16453	16456	16448	16448	Ron	171	“ Right . ”
16457	16465	16467	16467	George	176	“ Yeah , we ’ll come too , ”
16469	16476	16478	16479	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ You stay where you are ! ”
16518	16526	16527	16527	Harry	158	“ What are Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes ? ”
16544	16562	16564	16564	Ron	171	“ Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George ’s room , ”
16567	16590	16592	16592	Ginny	191	“ We ’ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages , but we never thought they were actually making things , ”
16594	16615	16617	16617	Ron	171	“ Only , most of the stuff — well , all of it , really — was a bit dangerous , ”
16636	16645	16646	16646	Ginny	191	“ And then there was this big row , ”
16649	16679	16646	16646	Ginny	191	“ because Mum wants them to go into the Ministry of Magic like Dad , and they told her all they want to do is open a joke shop . ”
16706	16711	16713	16713	Harry	158	“ Hi , Percy , ”
16715	16721	16723	16723	Percy	187	“ Oh hello , Harry , ”
16725	16731	16733	16733	Ron	171	“ We ’re not thundering , ”
16736	16743	16745	16745	Harry	158	“ What are you working on ? ”
16747	16758	16760	16760	Percy	187	“ A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation , ”
16763	16798	16760	16760	Percy	187	“ We ’re trying to standardize cauldron thickness . Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin — leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year — ”
16799	16810	16812	16812	Ron	171	“ That ’ll change the world , that report will , ”
16814	16828	16812	16812	Ron	171	“ Front page of the Daily Prophet , I expect , cauldron leaks . ”
16834	16841	16842	16842	he	187	“ You might sneer , Ron , ”
16846	16875	16842	16842	he	187	“ but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy , shallow - bottomed products that seriously endanger — . ”
16876	16884	16886	16886	Ron	171	“ Yeah , yeah , all right , ”
17061	17067	17069	17069	Ron	171	“ Shut up , Pig , ”
17088	17107	17108	17108	he	171	“ Fred and George are in here with us , because Bill and Charlie are in their room , ”
17112	17129	17108	17108	he	171	“ Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he ’s got to work . ”
17130	17141	17142	17142	Harry	158	“ Er — why are you calling that owl Pig ? ”
17146	17153	17155	17155	Ginny	191	“ Because he ’s being stupid , ”
17157	17164	17155	17155	Ginny	191	“ Its proper name is Pigwidgeon . ”
17165	17178	17180	17180	Ron	171	“ Yeah , and that ’s not a stupid name at all , ”
17183	17188	17189	17189	he	171	“ Ginny named him , ”
17194	17252	17189	17189	he	171	“ She reckons it ’s sweet . And I tried to change it , but it was too late , he wo n’t answer to anything else . So now he ’s Pig . I ’ve got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes . He annoys me too , come to that . ”
17302	17307	17308	17308	Harry	158	“ Where ’s Crookshanks ? ”
17313	17322	17323	17323	she	169	“ Out in the garden , I expect , ”
17326	17339	17323	17323	she	169	“ He likes chasing gnomes . He ’s never seen any before . ”
17340	17348	17350	17350	Harry	158	“ Percy ’s enjoying work , then ? ”
17375	17379	17381	17381	Ron	171	“ Enjoying it ? ”
17384	17452	17381	17381	Ron	171	“ I do n’t reckon he ’d come home if Dad did n’t make him . He ’s obsessed . Just do n’t get him onto the subject of his boss . According to Mr. Crouch ... as I was saying to Mr. Crouch ... Mr. Crouch is of the opinion ... Mr. Crouch was telling me ... They ’ll be announcing their engagement any day now . ”
17453	17463	17465	17465	Hermione	169	“ Have you had a good summer , Harry ? ”
17467	17477	17465	17465	Hermione	169	“ Did you get our food parcels and everything ? ”
17478	17485	17487	17487	Harry	158	“ Yeah , thanks a lot , ”
17489	17498	17487	17487	Harry	158	“ They saved my life , those cakes . ”
17499	17507	17508	17508	Ron	171	“ And have you heard from — ? ”
17595	17603	17605	17605	Hermione	169	“ I think they ’ve stopped arguing , ”
17623	17635	17614	17614	Ginny	191	“ Shall we go down and help your mum with dinner ? ”
17636	17642	17644	17644	Ron	171	“ Yeah , all right , ”
17673	17682	17683	17683	she	174	“ We ’re eating out in the garden , ”
17690	17729	17730	17730	she	174	“ There ’s just not room for eleven people in here . Could you take the plates outside , girls ? Bill and Charlie are setting up the tables . Knives and forks , please , you two , ”
17774	17781	17782	17782	she	174	“ Oh for heaven ’s sake , ”
17810	17814	17815	17815	she	174	“ Those two ! ”
17839	17872	17815	17815	she	174	“ I do n’t know what ’s going to happen to them , I really do n’t . No ambition , unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly can ... ”
17908	17920	17921	17921	she	174	“ It ’s not as though they have n’t got brains , ”
17943	18004	17921	17921	she	174	“ but they ’re wasting them , and unless they pull themselves together soon , they ’ll be in real trouble . I ’ve had more owls from Hogwarts about them than the rest put together . If they carry on the way they ’re going , they ’ll end up in front of the Improper Use of Magic Office . ”
18060	18072	18079	18079	her	174	“ I do n’t know where we went wrong with them , ”
18090	18115	18079	18079	her	174	“ It ’s been the same for years , one thing after another , and they wo n’t listen to — OH NOT AGAIN ! ”
18141	18149	18150	18150	she	174	“ One of their fake wands again ! ”
18153	18168	18150	18150	she	174	“ How many times have I told them not to leave them lying around ? ”
18188	18192	18193	18193	Ron	171	“ C’m on , ”
18209	18219	18193	18193	Ron	171	“ let ’s go and help Bill and Charlie . ”
18482	18490	18491	18491	he	187	“ Will you keep it down ? ! ”
18494	18499	18501	18501	Bill	185	“ Sorry , Perce , ”
18505	18514	18501	18501	Bill	185	“ How ’re the cauldron bottoms coming on ? ”
18515	18519	18521	18521	Percy	187	“ Very badly , ”
18678	18693	18694	18694	Percy	187	“ I ’ve told Mr. Crouch that I ’ll have it ready by Tuesday , ”
18699	18778	18694	18694	Percy	187	“ That ’s a bit sooner than he expected it , but I like to keep on top of things . I think he ’ll be grateful I ’ve done it in good time , I mean , it ’s extremely busy in our department just now , what with all the arrangements for the World Cup . We ’re just not getting the support we need from the Department of Magical Games and Sports . Ludo Bagman — ”
18779	18784	18786	18787	Mr. Weasley	173	“ I like Ludo , ”
18790	18839	18786	18787	Mr. Weasley	173	“ He was the one who got us such good tickets for the Cup . I did him a bit of a favor : His brother , Otto , got into a spot of trouble — a lawnmower with unnatural powers — I smoothed the whole thing over . ”
18840	18850	18852	18852	Percy	187	“ Oh Bagman ’s likable enough , of course , ”
18855	18922	18852	18852	Percy	187	“ but how he ever got to be Head of Department ... when I compare him to Mr. Crouch ! I ca n’t see Mr. Crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out what ’s happened to them . You realize Bertha Jorkins has been missing for over a month now ? Went on holiday to Albania and never came back ? ”
18923	18933	18935	18936	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Yes , I was asking Ludo about that , ”
18940	18971	18935	18936	Mr. Weasley	173	“ He says Bertha ’s gotten lost plenty of times before now — though I must say , if it was someone in my department , I ’d be worried ... ”
18972	18981	18983	18983	Percy	187	“ Oh Bertha ’s hopeless , all right , ”
18985	19075	18983	18983	Percy	187	“ I hear she ’s been shunted from department to department for years , much more trouble than she ’s worth ... but all the same , Bagman ought to be trying to find her . Mr. Crouch has been taking a personal interest , she worked in our department at one time , you know , and I think Mr. Crouch was quite fond of her — but Bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in Australia instead of Albania . However ”
19091	19135	19077	19077	Percy	187	“ we ’ve got quite enough on our plates at the Department of International Magical Cooperation without trying to find members of other departments too . As you know , we ’ve got another big event to organize right after the World Cup . ”
19160	19172	19173	19173	He	187	“ You know the one I ’m talking about , Father . ”
19179	19186	19175	19175	his	187	“ The top - secret one . ”
19198	19227	19187	19187	Ron	171	“ He ’s been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work . Probably an exhibition of thick - bottomed cauldrons . ”
19253	19275	19235	19236	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ ... with a horrible great fang on it . Really , Bill , what do they say at the bank ? ”
19276	19300	19302	19302	Bill	185	“ Mum , no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I bring home plenty of treasure , ”
19305	19315	19317	19318	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ And your hair ’s getting silly , dear , ”
19325	19337	19321	19321	her	174	“ I wish you ’d let me give it a trim ... ”
19338	19343	19345	19345	Ginny	191	“ I like it , ”
19353	19376	19345	19345	Ginny	191	“ You ’re so old - fashioned , Mum . Anyway , it ’s nowhere near as long as Professor Dumbledore ’s ... ”
19397	19405	19407	19407	Charlie	186	“ It ’s got to be Ireland , ”
19416	19424	19407	19407	Charlie	186	“ They flattened Peru in the semifinals . ”
19425	19434	19436	19436	Fred	175	“ Bulgaria has got Viktor Krum , though , ”
19438	19450	19452	19452	Charlie	186	“ Krum ’s one decent player , Ireland has got seven , ”
19455	19470	19452	19452	Charlie	186	“ I wish England had got through . That was embarrassing , that was . ”
19471	19475	19477	19477	Harry	158	“ What happened ? ”
19498	19511	19513	19513	Charlie	186	“ Went down to Transylvania , three hundred and ninety to ten , ”
19516	19533	19513	19513	Charlie	186	“ Shocking performance . And Wales lost to Uganda , and Scotland was slaughtered by Luxembourg . ”
19699	19709	19692	19692	he	171	“ So — have you heard from Sirius lately ? ”
19717	19720	19722	19722	Harry	158	“ Yeah , ”
19725	19747	19722	19722	Harry	158	“ twice . He sounds okay . I wrote to him yesterday . He might write back while I ’m here . ”
19810	19816	19823	19823	her	174	“ Look at the time , ”
19826	19904	19823	19823	her	174	“ You really should be in bed , the whole lot of you — you ’ll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup . Harry , if you leave your school list out , I ’ll get your things for you tomorrow in Diagon Alley . I ’m getting everyone else ’s . There might not be time after the World Cup , the match went on for five days last time . ”
19905	19914	19916	19916	Harry	158	“ Wow — hope it does this time ! ”
19919	19927	19929	19929	Percy	187	“ Well , I certainly do n’t , ”
19932	19957	19929	19929	Percy	187	“ I shudder to think what the state of my in - tray would be if I was away from work for five days . ”
19958	19974	19976	19976	Fred	175	“ Yeah , someone might slip dragon dung in it again , eh , Perce ? ”
19978	19988	19990	19990	Percy	187	“ That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway ! ”
19999	20005	19990	19990	Percy	187	“ It was nothing personal ! ”
20006	20010	20011	20011	Fred	175	“ It was , ”
20023	20028	20011	20011	Fred	175	“ We sent it . ”
20054	20063	20064	20064	she	174	“ Time to go , Harry , dear , ”
20123	20129	20131	20131	Fred	175	“ ’S ’ time already ? ”
20244	20249	20250	20250	he	173	“ What d’you think ? ”
20254	20271	20250	20250	he	173	“ We ’re supposed to go incognito — do I look like a Muggle , Harry ? ”
20272	20275	20277	20277	Harry	158	“ Yeah , ”
20281	20285	20277	20277	Harry	158	“ very good . ”
20286	20299	20301	20301	George	176	“ Where ’re Bill and Charlie and Per - Per - Percy ? ”
20310	20321	20323	20324	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Well , they ’re Apparating , are n’t they ? ”
20342	20355	20323	20324	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ So they can have a bit of a lie - in . ”
20391	20399	20401	20401	Fred	175	“ So they ’re still in bed ? ”
20412	20420	20401	20401	Fred	175	“ Why ca n’t we Apparate too ? ”
20421	20436	20438	20439	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Because you ’re not of age and you have n’t passed your test , ”
20441	20450	20438	20439	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ And where have those girls got to ? ”
20465	20475	20476	20476	Harry	158	“ You have to pass a test to Apparate ? ”
20479	20483	20485	20486	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Oh yes , ”
20500	20554	20485	20486	Mr. Weasley	173	“ The Department of Magical Transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for Apparating without a license . It ’s not easy , Apparition , and when it ’s not done properly it can lead to nasty complications . This pair I ’m talking about went and Splinched themselves . ”
20563	20568	20570	20570	Harry	158	“ Er — Splinched ? ”
20572	20580	20582	20583	Mr. Weasley	173	“ They left half of themselves behind , ”
20595	20652	20582	20583	Mr. Weasley	173	“ So , of course , they were stuck . Could n’t move either way . Had to wait for the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad to sort them out . Meant a fair old bit of paperwork , I can tell you , what with the Muggles who spotted the body parts they ’d left behind ... ”
20675	20680	20681	20681	he	158	“ Were they okay ? ”
20686	20690	20692	20693	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Oh yes , ”
20700	20752	20692	20693	Mr. Weasley	173	“ But they got a heavy fine , and I do n’t think they ’ll be trying it again in a hurry . You do n’t mess around with Apparition . There are plenty of adult wizards who do n’t bother with it . Prefer brooms — slower , but safer . ”
20753	20765	20826	20827	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ But Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it ? ”
20766	20775	20777	20777	Fred	175	“ Charlie had to take the test twice , ”
20781	20812	20777	20777	Fred	175	“ He failed the first time , Apparated five miles south of where he meant to , right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping , remember ? ”
20813	20824	20826	20827	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Yes , well , he passed the second time , ”
20838	20846	20848	20848	George	176	“ Percy only passed two weeks ago , ”
20850	20866	20848	20848	George	176	“ He ’s been Apparating downstairs every morning since , just to prove he can . ”
20888	20899	20900	20900	Ginny	191	“ Why do we have to be up so early ? ”
20913	20923	20925	20926	Mr. Weasley	173	“ We ’ve got a bit of a walk , ”
20928	20931	20933	20933	Harry	158	“ Walk ? ”
20935	20946	20933	20933	Harry	158	“ What , are we walking to the World Cup ? ”
20947	20957	20959	20960	Mr. Weasley	173	“ No , no , that ’s miles away , ”
20964	21022	20959	20960	Mr. Weasley	173	“ We only need to walk a short way . It ’s just that it ’s very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting Muggle attention . We have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of times , and on a huge occasion like the Quidditch World Cup — ”
21023	21026	21028	21029	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ George ! ”
21037	21040	21042	21042	George	176	“ What ? ”
21052	21060	20959	20960	Mr. Weasley	173	“ What is that in your pocket ? ”
21061	21064	21077	21077	her	174	“ Nothing ! ”
21065	21073	20959	20960	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Do n’t you lie to me ! ”
21086	21089	21077	21077	her	174	“ Accio ! ”
21123	21131	21133	21134	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ We told you to destroy them ! ”
21148	21170	21133	21134	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ We told you to get rid of the lot ! Empty your pockets , go on , both of you ! ”
21213	21220	21221	21221	she	174	“ Accio ! Accio ! Accio ! ”
21251	21259	21260	21260	Fred	175	“ We spent six months developing those ! ”
21272	21282	21283	21283	she	174	“ Oh a fine way to spend six months ! ”
21286	21296	21283	21283	she	174	“ No wonder you did n’t get more O.W.L.s ! ”
21354	21362	21364	21365	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Well , have a lovely time , ”
21367	21372	21373	21373	she	174	“ and behave yourselves , ”
21391	21405	21373	21373	she	174	“ I ’ll send Bill , Charlie , and Percy along around midday , ”
21488	21501	21502	21502	he	158	“ So how does everyone get there without all the Muggles noticing ? ”
21526	21534	21536	21536	Harry	158	“ What sort of objects are Portkeys ? ”
21539	21547	21549	21550	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Well , they can be anything , ”
21552	21579	21549	21550	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Unobtrusive things , obviously , so Muggles do n’t go picking them up and playing with them ... stuff they ’ll just think is litter ... ”
21697	21700	21702	21703	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Whew , ”
21716	21731	21702	21703	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Well , we ’ve made good time — we ’ve got ten minutes ... ”
21749	21757	21759	21760	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Now we just need the Portkey , ”
21772	21782	21759	21760	Mr. Weasley	173	“ It wo n’t be big ... Come on ... ”
21811	21827	21855	21855	he	173	“ Over here , Arthur ! Over here , son , we ’ve got it ! ”
21845	21848	21855	21855	he	173	“ Amos ! ”
21902	21910	21912	21913	Mr. Weasley	173	“ This is Amos Diggory , everyone , ”
21915	21940	21912	21913	Mr. Weasley	173	“ He works for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures . And I think you know his son , Cedric ? ”
21966	21969	21971	21971	Cedric	209	“ Hi , ”
22015	22021	22022	22022	Cedric	209	“ Long walk , Arthur ? ”
22027	22032	22034	22035	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Not too bad , ”
22037	22052	22034	22035	Mr. Weasley	173	“ We live just on the other side of the village there . You ? ”
22053	22119	22120	22121	Amos Diggory	208	“ Had to get up at two , did n’t we , Ced ? I tell you , I ’ll be glad when he ’s got his Apparition test . Still ... not complaining ... Quidditch World Cup , would n’t miss it for a sackful of Galleons — and the tickets cost about that . Mind you , looks like I got off easy ... ”
22140	22147	22138	22138	Ginny	191	“ All these yours , Arthur ? ”
22148	22156	22158	22159	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Oh no , only the redheads , ”
22166	22182	22158	22159	Mr. Weasley	173	“ This is Hermione , friend of Ron ’s — and Harry , another friend — ”
22183	22188	22190	22191	Amos Diggory	208	“ Merlin ’s beard , ”
22197	22203	22193	22193	his	208	“ Harry ? Harry Potter ? ”
22204	22209	22211	22211	Harry	158	“ Er — yeah , ”
22252	22262	22264	22265	Amos Diggory	208	“ Ced ’s talked about you , of course , ”
22267	22305	22264	22265	Amos Diggory	208	“ Told us all about playing against you last year ... I said to him , I said — Ced , that ’ll be something to tell your grandchildren , that will ... You beat Harry Potter ! ”
22334	22343	22344	22344	he	209	“ Harry fell off his broom , Dad , ”
22347	22357	22344	22344	he	209	“ I told you ... it was an accident ... ”
22358	22371	22373	22373	Amos	208	“ Yes , but you did n’t fall off , did you ? ”
22383	22441	22373	22373	Amos	208	“ Always modest , our Ced , always the gentleman ... but the best man won , I ’m sure Harry’d say the same , would n’t you , eh ? One falls off his broom , one stays on , you do n’t need to be a genius to tell which one ’s the better flier ! ”
22442	22448	22450	22451	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Must be nearly time , ”
22460	22474	22456	22456	his	173	“ Do you know whether we ’re waiting for any more , Amos ? ”
22475	22495	22497	22498	Mr. Diggory	216	“ No , the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the Fawcetts could n’t get tickets , ”
22500	22515	22497	22498	Mr. Diggory	216	“ There are n’t any more of us in this area , are there ? ”
22516	22523	22525	22526	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Not that I know of , ”
22528	22543	22525	22526	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Yes , it ’s a minute off ... We ’d better get ready ... ”
22552	22570	22544	22544	He	173	“ You just need to touch the Portkey , that ’s all , a finger will do — ”
22657	22660	22662	22663	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Three ... ”
22672	22677	22662	22663	Mr. Weasley	173	“ two ... one ... ”
22812	22820	22829	22829	Ron	171	“ Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill , ”
22921	22926	22928	22929	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Morning , Basil , ”
22973	22979	22981	22981	Basil	218	“ Hello there , Arthur , ”
22984	22989	22995	22995	he	173	“ Thanks , Basil , ”
23130	23133	23135	23136	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Morning ! ”
23139	23142	23144	23145	the Muggle	161	“ Morning , ”
23147	23154	23118	23118	their	1045	“ Would you be Mr. Roberts ? ”
23155	23161	23163	23164	Mr. Roberts	220	“ Aye , I would , ”
23166	23172	23163	23164	Mr. Roberts	220	“ And who ’re you ? ”
23173	23186	23118	23118	their	1045	“ Weasley — two tents , booked a couple of days ago ? ”
23187	23190	23192	23193	Mr. Roberts	220	“ Aye , ”
23203	23220	23192	23193	Mr. Roberts	220	“ You ’ve got a space up by the wood there . Just the one night ? ”
23221	23226	23228	23229	Mr. Weasley	173	“ That ’s it , ”
23231	23240	23242	23243	Mr. Roberts	220	“ You ’ll be paying now , then ? ”
23245	23252	23254	23255	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Ah — right — certainly — ”
23271	23277	23278	23278	he	173	“ Help me , Harry , ”
23298	23327	23278	23278	he	173	“ This one ’s a — a — a ten ? Ah yes , I see the little number on it now ... So this is a five ? ”
23328	23332	23333	23333	Harry	158	“ A twenty , ”
23351	23370	23278	23278	he	173	“ Ah yes , so it is ... I do n’t know , these little bits of paper ... ”
23371	23375	23377	23378	Mr. Roberts	220	“ You foreign ? ”
23388	23391	23393	23394	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Foreign ? ”
23398	23412	23414	23415	Mr. Roberts	220	“ You ’re not the first one who ’s had trouble with money , ”
23422	23442	23418	23419	Mr. Weasley	173	“ I had two try and pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago . ”
23443	23448	23450	23451	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Did you really ? ”
23465	23471	23472	23472	he	220	“ Never been this crowded , ”
23484	23497	23472	23472	he	220	“ Hundreds of pre - bookings . People usually just turn up ... ”
23498	23503	23505	23506	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Is that right ? ”
23526	23529	23530	23530	he	220	“ Aye , ”
23534	23568	23530	23530	he	220	“ People from all over . Loads of foreigners . And not just foreigners . Weirdos , you know ? There ’s a bloke walking ’ round in a kilt and a poncho . ”
23569	23574	23576	23577	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Should n’t he ? ”
23580	23597	23599	23600	Mr. Roberts	220	“ It ’s like some sort of ... I dunno ... like some sort of rally , ”
23602	23616	23599	23600	Mr. Roberts	220	“ They all seem to know each other . Like a big party . ”
23640	23643	23644	23644	he	1066	“ Obliviate ! ”
23695	23704	23705	23706	Mr. Roberts	220	“ A map of the campsite for you , ”
23713	23718	23705	23706	Mr. Roberts	220	“ And your change . ”
23719	23724	23726	23727	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Thanks very much , ”
23778	23848	23772	23772	he	220	“ Been having a lot of trouble with him . Needs a Memory Charm ten times a day to keep him happy . And Ludo Bagman ’s not helping . Trotting around talking about Bludgers and Quaffles at the top of his voice , not a worry about anti - Muggle security . Blimey , I ’ll be glad when this is over . See you later , Arthur . ”
23852	23865	23867	23867	Ginny	191	“ I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games and Sports , ”
23872	23889	23867	23867	Ginny	191	“ He should know better than to talk about Bludgers near Muggles , should n’t he ? ”
23890	23894	23896	23897	Mr. Weasley	173	“ He should , ”
23911	23963	23896	23897	Mr. Weasley	173	“ but Ludo ’s always been a bit ... well ... lax about security . You could n’t wish for a more enthusiastic Head of the sports department though . He played Quidditch for England himself , you know . And he was the best Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had . ”
24101	24106	24108	24109	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Always the same , ”
24113	24137	24108	24109	Mr. Weasley	173	“ We ca n’t resist showing off when we get together . Ah , here we are , look , this is us . ”
24173	24181	24183	24184	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Could n’t have a better spot ! ”
24187	24210	24211	24211	He	173	“ The field is just on the other side of the wood there , we ’re as close as we could be . ”
24219	24222	24223	24223	he	173	“ Right , ”
24227	24282	24223	24223	he	173	“ no magic allowed , strictly speaking , not when we ’re out in these numbers on Muggle land . We ’ll be putting these tents up by hand ! Should n’t be too difficult ... Muggles do it all the time ... Here , Harry , where do you reckon we should start ? ”
24450	24458	24459	24459	he	173	“ We ’ll be a bit cramped , ”
24462	24478	24459	24459	he	173	“ but I think we ’ll all squeeze in . Come and have a look . ”
24552	24561	24567	24567	his	173	“ Well , it ’s not for long , ”
24587	24611	24567	24567	his	173	“ I borrowed this from Perkins at the office . Does n’t camp much anymore , poor fellow , he ’s got lumbago . ”
24623	24629	24612	24612	He	173	“ We ’ll need water ... ”
24630	24644	24646	24646	Ron	171	“ There ’s a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave us , ”
24665	24676	24646	24646	Ron	171	“ It ’s on the other side of the field . ”
24677	24696	24698	24699	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Well , why do n’t you , Harry , and Hermione go and get us some water then ”
24710	24724	24698	24699	Mr. Weasley	173	“ and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire ? ”
24725	24733	24735	24735	Ron	171	“ But we ’ve got an oven , ”
24737	24744	24735	24735	Ron	171	“ Why ca n’t we just — ”
24745	24753	24755	24756	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Ron , anti - Muggle security ! ”
24764	24783	24758	24758	his	173	“ When real Muggles camp , they cook on fires outdoors . I ’ve seen them at it ! ”
24983	25003	25004	25004	She	819	“ How many times , Kevin ? You do n’t — touch — Daddy ’s — wand — yecchh ! ”
25033	25042	25015	25015	Her	819	“ You bust slug ! You bust slug ! ”
25103	25118	25099	25099	he	1120	“ In broad daylight ! Parents having a lie - in , I suppose — ”
25261	25275	25277	25277	Ron	171	“ Er — is it my eyes , or has everything gone green ? ”
25348	25355	25345	25345	their	1126	“ Harry ! Ron ! Hermione ! ”
25405	25410	25412	25412	Seamus	228	“ Like the decorations ? ”
25416	25424	25412	25412	Seamus	228	“ The Ministry ’s not too happy . ”
25425	25436	25438	25439	Mrs. Finnigan	229	“ Ah , why should n’t we show our colors ? ”
25441	25465	25466	25466	she	229	“ You should see what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents . You ’ll be supporting Ireland , of course ? ”
25501	25513	25498	25498	Ron	171	“ Like we ’d say anything else surrounded by that lot . ”
25514	25528	25530	25530	Hermione	169	“ I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents ? ”
25532	25541	25543	25543	Harry	158	“ Let ’s go and have a look , ”
25628	25631	25633	25633	Ron	171	“ Krum , ”
25636	25639	25641	25641	Hermione	169	“ What ? ”
25643	25646	25648	25648	Ron	171	“ Krum ! ”
25650	25658	25648	25648	Ron	171	“ Viktor Krum , the Bulgarian Seeker ! ”
25659	25665	25667	25667	Hermione	169	“ He looks really grumpy , ”
25681	25687	25688	25688	Ron	171	“ ‘ Really grumpy ’ ? ”
25696	25734	25688	25688	Ron	171	“ Who cares what he looks like ? He ’s unbelievable . He ’s really young too . Only just eighteen or something . He ’s a genius , you wait until tonight , you ’ll see . ”
25812	25844	25797	25797	he	935	“ Just put them on , Archie , there ’s a good chap . You ca n’t walk around like that , the Muggle at the gate ’s already getting suspicious — ”
25845	25854	25856	25858	the old wizard	1148	“ I bought this in a Muggle shop , ”
25861	25866	25856	25858	the old wizard	1148	“ Muggles wear them . ”
25867	25883	25890	25890	he	1149	“ Muggle women wear them , Archie , not the men , they wear these , ”
25896	25904	25906	25907	old Archie	230	“ I ’m not putting them on , ”
25911	25924	25906	25907	old Archie	230	“ I like a healthy breeze ’ round my privates , thanks . ”
26130	26137	26138	26138	he	158	“ Who d’you reckon they are ? ”
26141	26152	26138	26138	he	158	“ They do n’t go to Hogwarts , do they ? ”
26153	26163	26165	26165	Ron	171	“ ’ Spect they go to some foreign school , ”
26167	26245	26165	26165	Ron	171	“ I know there are others . Never met anyone who went to one , though . Bill had a penfriend at a school in Brazil ... this was years and years ago ... and he wanted to go on an exchange trip but Mum and Dad could n’t afford it . His penfriend got all offended when he said he was n’t going and sent him a cursed hat . It made his ears shrivel up . ”
26327	26333	26335	26335	George	176	“ You ’ve been ages , ”
26347	26353	26355	26355	Ron	171	“ Met a few people , ”
26362	26371	26355	26355	Ron	171	“ You not got that fire started yet ? ”
26372	26381	26383	26383	Fred	175	“ Dad ’s having fun with the matches , ”
26429	26432	26433	26433	he	173	“ Oops ! ”
26449	26456	26458	26458	Hermione	169	“ Come here , Mr. Weasley , ”
26576	26647	26545	26546	Mr. Weasley	173	“ That was Cuthbert Mockridge , Head of the Goblin Liaison Office ... Here comes Gilbert Wimple ; he ’s with the Committee on Experimental Charms ; he ’s had those horns for a while now ... Hello , Arnie ... Arnold Peasegood , he ’s an Obliviator — member of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad , you know ... and that ’s Bode and Croaker ... they ’re Unspeakables ... ”
26648	26653	26725	26725	They	1172	“ They ’re what ? ”
26654	26672	26545	26546	Mr. Weasley	173	“ From the Department of Mysteries , top secret , no idea what they get up to ... ”
26706	26712	26714	26714	Percy	187	“ Just Apparated , Dad , ”
26717	26724	26714	26714	Percy	187	“ Ah , excellent , lunch ! ”
26755	26758	26759	26759	he	173	“ Aha ! ”
26762	26771	26759	26759	he	173	“ The man of the moment ! Ludo ! ”
26900	26904	26905	26905	Bagman	202	“ Ahoy there ! ”
26934	26940	26941	26941	he	202	“ Arthur , old man , ”
26949	26989	26941	26941	he	202	“ what a day , eh ? What a day ! Could we have asked for more perfect weather ? A cloudless night coming ... and hardly a hiccough in the arrangements ... Not much for me to do ! ”
27058	27063	27065	27066	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Ah — yes , ”
27070	27122	27065	27066	Mr. Weasley	173	“ this is my son Percy . He ’s just started at the Ministry — and this is Fred — no , George , sorry — that ’s Fred — Bill , Charlie , Ron — my daughter , Ginny — and Ron ’s friends , Hermione Granger and Harry Potter . ”
27153	27156	27157	27158	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Everyone , ”
27161	27185	27157	27158	Mr. Weasley	173	“ this is Ludo Bagman , you know who he is , it ’s thanks to him we ’ve got such good tickets — ”
27201	27211	27212	27212	he	202	“ Fancy a flutter on the match , Arthur ? ”
27238	27292	27212	27212	he	202	“ I ’ve already got Roddy Pontner betting me Bulgaria will score first — I offered him nice odds , considering Ireland ’s front three are the strongest I ’ve seen in years — and little Agatha Timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a week - long match . ”
27293	27300	27302	27303	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Oh ... go on then , ”
27305	27317	27302	27303	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Let ’s see ... a Galleon on Ireland to win ? ”
27318	27322	27323	27324	Ludo Bagman	202	“ A Galleon ? ”
27333	27344	27331	27331	himself	202	“ Very well , very well ... any other takers ? ”
27345	27355	27357	27358	Mr. Weasley	173	“ They ’re a bit young to be gambling , ”
27360	27366	27357	27358	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Molly would n’t like — ”
27367	27382	27384	27384	Fred	175	“ We ’ll bet thirty - seven Galleons , fifteen Sickles , three Knuts , ”
27395	27417	27384	27384	Fred	175	“ that Ireland wins — but Viktor Krum gets the Snitch . Oh and we ’ll throw in a fake wand . ”
27418	27432	27433	27433	Percy	187	“ You do n’t want to go showing Mr. Bagman rubbish like that — ”
27487	27508	27482	27482	Bagman	202	“ Excellent ! I have n’t seen one that convincing in years ! I ’d pay five Galleons for that ! ”
27518	27521	27526	27526	his	173	“ Boys , ”
27529	27546	27526	27526	his	173	“ I do n’t want you betting ... That ’s all your savings ... Your mother — ”
27547	27556	27558	27559	Ludo Bagman	202	“ Do n’t be a spoilsport , Arthur ! ”
27566	27623	27558	27559	Ludo Bagman	202	“ They ’re old enough to know what they want ! You reckon Ireland will win but Krum’ll get the Snitch ? Not a chance , boys , not a chance ... I ’ll give you excellent odds on that one ... We ’ll add five Galleons for the funny wand , then , shall we ... ”
27647	27650	27652	27652	George	176	“ Cheers , ”
27677	27734	27668	27668	Bagman	202	“ Could n’t do me a brew , I suppose ? I ’m keeping an eye out for Barty Crouch . My Bulgarian opposite number ’s making difficulties , and I ca n’t understand a word he ’s saying . Barty’ll be able to sort it out . He speaks about a hundred and fifty languages . ”
27735	27739	27741	27741	Percy	187	“ Mr. Crouch ? ”
27758	27771	27741	27741	Percy	187	“ He speaks over two hundred ! Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll ... ”
27772	27778	27780	27780	Fred	175	“ Anyone can speak Troll , ”
27783	27794	27780	27780	Fred	175	“ All you have to do is point and grunt . ”
27816	27826	27827	27828	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet , Ludo ? ”
27842	27848	27850	27850	Bagman	202	“ Not a dicky bird , ”
27853	27901	27850	27850	Bagman	202	“ But she ’ll turn up . Poor old Bertha ... memory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction . Lost , you take my word for it . She ’ll wander back into the office sometime in October , thinking it ’s still July . ”
27902	27919	27920	27921	Mr. Weasley	173	“ You do n’t think it might be time to send someone to look for her ? ”
27931	27938	27940	27940	Bagman	202	“ Barty Crouch keeps saying that , ”
27948	27969	27940	27940	Bagman	202	“ but we really ca n’t spare anyone at the moment . Oh — talk of the devil ! Barty ! ”
28116	28126	28128	28128	Ludo	202	“ Pull up a bit of grass , Barty , ”
28137	28144	28146	28146	Crouch	243	“ No thank you , Ludo , ”
28159	28182	28146	28146	Crouch	243	“ I ’ve been looking for you everywhere . The Bulgarians are insisting we add another twelve seats to the Top Box . ”
28183	28192	28194	28194	Bagman	202	“ Oh is that what they ’re after ? ”
28196	28216	28194	28194	Bagman	202	“ I thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers . Bit of a strong accent . ”
28217	28221	28223	28223	Percy	187	“ Mr. Crouch ! ”
28242	28251	28223	28223	Percy	187	“ Would you like a cup of tea ? ”
28252	28255	28257	28258	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Oh , ”
28268	28276	28257	28258	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Yes — thank you , Weatherby . ”
28300	28315	28317	28318	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Oh and I ’ve been wanting a word with you too , Arthur , ”
28328	28349	28320	28320	his	200	“ Ali Bashir ’s on the warpath . He wants a word with you about your embargo on flying carpets . ”
28357	28403	28320	28320	his	200	“ I sent him an owl about that just last week . If I ’ve told him once I ’ve told him a hundred times : Carpets are defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects , but will he listen ? ”
28404	28409	28411	28412	Mr. Crouch	200	“ I doubt it , ”
28420	28428	28411	28412	Mr. Crouch	200	“ He ’s desperate to export here . ”
28429	28443	28445	28445	Bagman	202	“ Well , they ’ll never replace brooms in Britain , will they ? ”
28447	28462	28464	28465	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Ali thinks there ’s a niche in the market for a family vehicle , ”
28467	28491	28464	28465	Mr. Crouch	200	“ I remember my grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve — but that was before carpets were banned , of course . ”
28515	28524	28526	28526	Bagman	202	“ So , been keeping busy , Barty ? ”
28529	28532	28534	28535	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Fairly , ”
28538	28551	28534	28535	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Organizing Portkeys across five continents is no mean feat , Ludo . ”
28552	28565	28567	28568	Mr. Weasley	173	“ I expect you ’ll both be glad when this is over ? ”
28575	28618	28619	28620	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Glad ! Do n’t know when I ’ve had more fun ... Still , it ’s not as though we have n’t got anything to look forward to , eh , Barty ? Eh ? Plenty left to organize , eh ? ”
28627	28640	28622	28622	his	200	“ We agreed not to make the announcement until all the details — ”
28641	28645	28647	28647	Bagman	202	“ Oh details ! ”
28659	28696	28647	28647	Bagman	202	“ They ’ve signed , have n’t they ? They ’ve agreed , have n’t they ? I bet you anything these kids’ll know soon enough anyway . I mean , it ’s happening at Hogwarts — ”
28697	28710	28712	28713	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Ludo , we need to meet the Bulgarians , you know , ”
28722	28731	28712	28713	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Thank you for the tea , Weatherby . ”
28769	28775	28776	28776	he	200	“ See you all later ! ”
28779	28795	28796	28796	He	200	“ You ’ll be up in the Top Box with me — I ’m commentating ! ”
28810	28819	28821	28821	Fred	175	“ What ’s happening at Hogwarts , Dad ? ”
28825	28832	28821	28821	Fred	175	“ What were they talking about ? ”
28833	28841	28843	28844	Mr. Weasley	173	“ You ’ll find out soon enough , ”
28848	28865	28867	28867	Percy	248	“ It ’s classified information , until such time as the Ministry decides to release it , ”
28870	28881	28867	28867	Percy	248	“ Mr. Crouch was quite right not to disclose it . ”
28882	28889	28891	28891	Fred	175	“ Oh shut up , Weatherby , ”
29068	29079	29080	29080	Ron	171	“ Been saving my pocket money all summer for this , ”
29143	29150	29152	29152	Harry	158	“ Wow , look at these ! ”
29182	29185	29187	29188	the saleswizard	1205	“ Omnioculars , ”
29191	29223	29187	29188	the saleswizard	1205	“ You can replay action ... slow everything down ... and they flash up a play - by - play breakdown if you need it . Bargain — ten Galleons each . ”
29224	29233	29235	29235	Ron	171	“ Wish I had n’t bought this now , ”
29250	29254	29256	29256	Harry	158	“ Three pairs , ”
29262	29269	29271	29271	Ron	171	“ No — do n’t bother , ”
29304	29314	29315	29315	Harry	158	“ You wo n’t be getting anything for Christmas , ”
29328	29336	29315	29315	Harry	158	“ For about ten years , mind . ”
29337	29341	29343	29343	Ron	171	“ Fair enough , ”
29347	29354	29356	29356	Hermione	169	“ Oooh , thanks , Harry , ”
29358	29369	29356	29356	Hermione	169	“ And I ’ll get us some programs , look — ”
29455	29460	29462	29463	Mr. Weasley	173	“ It ’s time ! ”
29473	29481	29462	29463	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Come on , let ’s go ! ”
29604	29610	29612	29613	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Seats a hundred thousand , ”
29624	29628	29637	29637	she	1217	“ Prime seats ! ”
29642	29659	29637	29637	she	1217	“ Top Box ! Straight upstairs , Arthur , and as high as you can go . ”
30052	30055	30057	30057	Harry	158	“ Dobby ? ”

38736	38745	38746	38746	Hermione	169	“ It ’s people like you , Ron , ”
38750	38767	38746	38746	Hermione	169	“ who prop up rotten and unjust systems , just because they ’re too lazy to — ”
38779	38789	38791	38791	Ron	171	“ Let ’s just keep moving , shall we ? ”
38953	38966	38967	38969	one of them	1144	“ I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a year ! ”
38972	38988	38967	38969	one of them	1144	“ I ’m a dragon killer for the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures . ”
38989	38996	38998	38999	his friend	1511	“ No , you ’re not ! ”
39001	39026	38998	38999	his friend	1511	“ You ’re a dishwasher at the Leaky Cauldron ... but I ’m a vampire hunter , I ’ve killed about ninety so far — ”
39051	39068	39027	39045	A third young wizard , whose pimples were visible even by the dim , silvery light of the veela	1512	“ I ’m about to become the youngest - ever Minister of Magic , I am . ”
39124	39139	39120	39120	Ron	171	“ Did I tell you I ’ve invented a broomstick that ’ll reach Jupiter ? ”
39140	39143	39148	39148	she	169	“ Honestly ! ”
39208	39229	39204	39204	Harry	158	“ I reckon we can just wait here , you know . We ’ll hear anyone coming a mile off . ”
39300	39305	39306	39306	he	158	“ Who ’s that ? ”
39321	39332	39306	39306	he	158	“ What are you doing in here , all alone ? ”
39341	39353	39355	39355	Ron	171	“ Well — there ’s a sort of riot going on , ”
39362	39365	39357	39357	Bagman	202	“ What ? ”
39366	39382	39383	39383	Bagman	202	“ At the campsite ... some people have got hold of a family of Muggles ... ”
39387	39391	39392	39392	he	202	“ Damn them ! ”
39411	39425	39427	39427	Hermione	169	“ Not exactly on top of things , Mr. Bagman , is he ? ”
39431	39440	39442	39442	Ron	171	“ He was a great Beater , though , ”
39471	39489	39442	39442	Ron	171	“ The Wimbourne Wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them . ”
39564	39572	39574	39574	Hermione	169	“ I hope the others are okay , ”
39579	39585	39587	39587	Ron	171	“ They ’ll be fine , ”
39589	39598	39600	39600	Harry	158	“ Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy , ”
39620	39634	39613	39613	Krum	205	“ He ’s always said he ’d like to get something on him . ”
39635	39650	39652	39652	Ron	171	“ That ’d wipe the smirk off old Draco ’s face , all right , ”
39654	39661	39663	39663	Hermione	169	“ Those poor Muggles , though , ”
39666	39676	39663	39663	Hermione	169	“ What if they ca n’t get them down ? ”
39677	39681	39683	39683	Ron	171	“ They will , ”
39686	39693	39683	39683	Ron	171	“ They ’ll find a way . ”
39694	39715	39717	39717	Hermione	169	“ Mad , though , to do something like that when the whole Ministry of Magic ’s out here tonight ! ”
39719	39746	39717	39717	Hermione	169	“ I mean , how do they expect to get away with it ? Do you think they ’ve been drinking , or are they just — ”
39802	39805	39807	39807	Harry	158	“ Hello ? ”
39847	39852	39853	39853	he	158	“ Who ’s there ? ”
39894	39897	39853	39853	he	158	“ MORSMORDRE ! ”
39932	39937	39939	39939	Ron	171	“ What the — ? ”
40094	40099	40100	40100	he	158	“ Who ’s there ? ”
40104	40112	40113	40113	Hermione	169	“ Harry , come on , move ! ”
40127	40133	40140	40140	her	169	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
40147	40156	40157	40157	Hermione	169	“ It ’s the Dark Mark , Harry ! ”
40168	40177	40165	40165	she	169	“ You - Know - Who ’s sign ! ”
40178	40183	40165	40165	she	169	“ Voldemort ’s — ? ”
40184	40190	40165	40165	she	169	“ Harry , come on ! ”
40287	40290	40284	40284	he	158	“ DUCK ! ”
40304	40307	40309	40310	twenty voices	1537	“ Stupefy ! ”
40376	40379	40410	40415	The wizard in front of him	1540	“ Stop ! ”
40386	40394	40410	40415	The wizard in front of him	1540	“ Stop ! That ’s my son ! ”
40435	40439	40441	40441	his	1540	“ Ron — Harry ”
40446	40454	40441	40441	his	1540	“ Hermione — are you all right ? ”
40455	40463	40473	40474	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Out of the way , Arthur , ”
40506	40513	40514	40514	he	200	“ Which of you did it ? ”
40524	40533	40514	40514	he	200	“ Which of you conjured the Dark Mark ? ”
40534	40541	40543	40543	Harry	158	“ We did n’t do that ! ”
40551	40558	40560	40560	Ron	171	“ We did n’t do anything ! ”
40574	40584	40560	40560	Ron	171	“ What did you want to attack us for ? ”
40585	40592	40594	40595	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Do not lie , sir ! ”
40617	40629	40612	40612	he	200	“ You have been discovered at the scene of the crime ! ”
40630	40633	40635	40642	a witch in a long woolen dressing gown	1543	“ Barty , ”
40644	40659	40635	40642	a witch in a long woolen dressing gown	1543	“ they ’re kids , Barty , they ’d never have been able to — ”
40660	40671	40673	40674	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Where did the Mark come from , you three ? ”
40677	40681	40683	40683	Hermione	169	“ Over there , ”
40697	40712	40683	40683	Hermione	169	“ There was someone behind the trees ... they shouted words — an incantation — ”
40713	40723	40725	40726	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Oh , stood over there , did they ? ”
40743	40765	40740	40740	his	200	“ Said an incantation , did they ? You seem very well informed about how that Mark is summoned , missy — ”
40826	40832	40843	40843	her	1548	“ We ’re too late , ”
40846	40852	40843	40843	her	1548	“ They ’ll have Disapparated . ”
40853	40860	40862	40868	a wizard with a scrubby brown beard	1549	“ I do n’t think so , ”
40879	40897	40872	40873	Amos Diggory	208	“ Our Stunners went right through those trees ... There ’s a good chance we got them ... ”
40898	40904	40906	40910	a few of the wizards	1551	“ Amos , be careful ! ”
40956	40977	40952	40953	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Yes ! We got them ! There ’s someone here ! Unconscious ! It ’s — but — blimey ... ”
40978	40984	40986	40987	Mr. Crouch	200	“ You ’ve got someone ? ”
40993	41000	40986	40987	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Who ? Who is it ? ”
41110	41118	41119	41119	he	200	“ This — can not — be , ”
41123	41126	41119	41119	he	200	“ No — ”
41145	41152	41157	41157	him	200	“ No point , Mr. Crouch , ”
41159	41167	41153	41154	Mr. Diggory	216	“ There ’s no one else there . ”
41202	41206	41207	41208	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Bit embarrassing , ”
41220	41233	41207	41208	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Barty Crouch ’s house - elf ... I mean to say ... ”
41234	41241	41243	41244	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Come off it , Amos , ”
41247	41272	41243	41244	Mr. Weasley	173	“ you do n’t seriously think it was the elf ? The Dark Mark ’s a wizard ’s sign . It requires a wand . ”
41273	41276	41278	41279	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Yeah , ”
41281	41288	41278	41279	Mr. Diggory	216	“ and she had a wand . ”
41289	41292	41294	41295	Mr. Weasley	173	“ What ? ”
41297	41302	41303	41304	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Here , look . ”
41316	41354	41313	41314	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Had it in her hand . So that ’s clause three of the Code of Wand Use broken , for a start . No non - human creature is permitted to carry or use a wand . ”
41392	41397	41398	41398	he	202	“ The Dark Mark ! ”
41412	41429	41405	41405	he	202	“ Who did it ? Did you get them ? Barty ! What ’s going on ? ”
41456	41464	41466	41466	Bagman	202	“ Where have you been , Barty ? ”
41468	41489	41466	41466	Bagman	202	“ Why were n’t you at the match ? Your elf was saving you a seat too — gulping gargoyles ! ”
41500	41506	41494	41494	Winky	253	“ What happened to her ? ”
41507	41515	41517	41518	Mr. Crouch	200	“ I have been busy , Ludo , ”
41533	41541	41517	41518	Mr. Crouch	200	“ And my elf has been Stunned . ”
41542	41556	41494	41494	Winky	253	“ Stunned ? By you lot , you mean ? But why — ? ”
41585	41588	41589	41589	he	202	“ No ! ”
41592	41616	41589	41589	he	202	“ Winky ? Conjure the Dark Mark ? She would n’t know how ! She ’d need a wand , for a start ! ”
41617	41623	41625	41626	Mr. Diggory	216	“ And she had one , ”
41628	41662	41625	41626	Mr. Diggory	216	“ I found her holding one , Ludo . If it ’s all right with you , Mr. Crouch , I think we should hear what she ’s got to say for herself . ”
41699	41702	41685	41685	He	202	“ Rennervate ! ”
41809	41812	41814	41815	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Elf ! ”
41818	41842	41814	41815	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Do you know who I am ? I ’m a member of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures ! ”
41874	41892	41894	41895	Mr. Diggory	216	“ As you see , elf , the Dark Mark was conjured here a short while ago , ”
41897	41916	41894	41895	Mr. Diggory	216	“ And you were discovered moments later , right beneath it ! An explanation , if you please ! ”
41917	41930	41931	41931	Winky	253	“ I — I — I is not doing it , sir ! ”
41934	41943	41931	41931	Winky	253	“ I is not knowing how , sir ! ”
41944	41955	41957	41958	Mr. Diggory	216	“ You were found with a wand in your hand ! ”
41989	41996	41997	41997	he	158	“ Hey — that ’s mine ! ”
42008	42012	42014	42015	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Excuse me ? ”
42019	42025	42027	42027	Harry	158	“ That ’s my wand ! ”
42029	42034	42027	42027	Harry	158	“ I dropped it ! ”
42035	42040	42042	42043	Mr. Diggory	216	“ You dropped it ? ”
42047	42063	42042	42043	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Is this a confession ? You threw it aside after you conjured the Mark ? ”
42064	42074	42076	42077	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Amos , think who you ’re talking to ! ”
42082	42093	42076	42077	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Is Harry Potter likely to conjure the Dark Mark ? ”
42094	42101	42103	42104	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Er — of course not , ”
42106	42112	42103	42104	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Sorry ... carried away ... ”
42113	42123	42125	42125	Harry	158	“ I did n’t drop it there , anyway , ”
42137	42149	42128	42128	his	158	“ I missed it right after we got into the wood . ”
42150	42153	42155	42156	Mr. Diggory	216	“ So , ”
42175	42203	42162	42162	he	216	“ You found this wand , eh , elf ? And you picked it up and thought you ’d have some fun with it , did you ? ”
42204	42215	42217	42217	Winky	253	“ I is not doing magic with it , sir ! ”
42231	42263	42217	42217	Winky	253	“ I is ... I is ... I is just picking it up , sir ! I is not making the Dark Mark , sir , I is not knowing how ! ”
42264	42270	42274	42274	She	169	“ It was n’t her ! ”
42295	42316	42317	42317	She	169	“ Winky ’s got a squeaky little voice , and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper ! ”
42330	42342	42317	42317	She	169	“ It did n’t sound anything like Winky , did it ? ”
42343	42346	42348	42348	Harry	158	“ No , ”
42354	42364	42348	42348	Harry	158	“ It definitely did n’t sound like an elf . ”
42365	42374	42376	42376	Ron	171	“ Yeah , it was a human voice , ”
42378	42386	42388	42389	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Well , we ’ll soon see , ”
42394	42416	42388	42389	Mr. Diggory	216	“ There ’s a simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed , elf , did you know that ? ”
42447	42451	42453	42454	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Prior Incantato ! ”
42512	42515	42516	42517	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Deletrius ! ”
42531	42534	42536	42537	Mr. Diggory	216	“ So , ”
42556	42563	42564	42564	she	253	“ I is not doing it ! ”
42573	42606	42564	42564	she	253	“ I is not , I is not , I is not knowing how ! I is a good elf , I is n’t using wands , I is n’t knowing how ! ”
42607	42618	42619	42620	Mr. Diggory	216	“ You ’ve been caught red - handed , elf ! ”
42623	42633	42619	42620	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Caught with the guilty wand in your hand ! ”
42634	42637	42639	42640	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Amos , ”
42643	42665	42639	42640	Mr. Weasley	173	“ think about it ... precious few wizards know how to do that spell ... Where would she have learned it ? ”
42666	42672	42674	42675	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Perhaps Amos is suggesting , ”
42683	42696	42674	42675	Mr. Crouch	200	“ that I routinely teach my servants to conjure the Dark Mark ? ”
42709	42719	42704	42705	Amos Diggory	208	“ Mr. Crouch ... not ... not at all ... ”
42720	42744	42746	42747	Mr. Crouch	200	“ You have now come very close to accusing the two people in this clearing who are least likely to conjure that Mark ! ”
42749	42769	42746	42747	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Harry Potter — and myself ! I suppose you are familiar with the boy ’s story , Amos ? ”
42770	42777	42779	42780	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Of course — everyone knows — ”
42786	42818	42819	42820	Mr. Crouch	200	“ And I trust you remember the many proofs I have given , over a long career , that I despise and detest the Dark Arts and those who practice them ? ”
42828	42845	42846	42847	Amos Diggory	208	“ Mr. Crouch , I — I never suggested you had anything to do with it ! ”
42859	42872	42874	42875	Mr. Crouch	200	“ If you accuse my elf , you accuse me , Diggory ! ”
42877	42888	42874	42875	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Where else would she have learned to conjure it ? ”
42889	42900	42854	42854	his	208	“ She — she might ’ve picked it up anywhere — ”
42901	42906	42908	42909	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Precisely , Amos , ”
42911	42922	42923	42923	he	173	“ She might have picked it up anywhere ... Winky ? ”
42944	42954	42937	42937	he	173	“ Where exactly did you find Harry ’s wand ? ”
42974	42988	42989	42989	she	253	“ I — I is finding it ... finding it there , sir ... ”
42992	43001	42989	42989	she	253	“ there ... in the trees , sir ... ”
43002	43008	43010	43011	Mr. Weasley	173	“ You see , Amos ? ”
43013	43070	43010	43011	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Whoever conjured the Mark could have Disapparated right after they ’d done it , leaving Harry ’s wand behind . A clever thing to do , not using their own wand , which could have betrayed them . And Winky here had the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick it up . ”
43071	43089	43091	43092	Mr. Diggory	216	“ But then , she ’d have been only a few feet away from the real culprit ! ”
43095	43103	43091	43092	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Elf ? Did you see anyone ? ”
43135	43147	43130	43130	she	253	“ I is seeing no one , sir ... no one ... ”
43148	43151	43153	43154	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Amos , ”
43157	43197	43153	43154	Mr. Crouch	200	“ I am fully aware that , in the ordinary course of events , you would want to take Winky into your department for questioning . I ask you , however , to allow me to deal with her . ”
43239	43250	43251	43252	Mr. Crouch	200	“ You may rest assured that she will be punished , ”
43256	43263	43264	43264	Winky	253	“ M - m - master ... ”
43279	43292	43273	43273	her	253	“ M - m - master , p - p - please ... ”
43319	43334	43335	43335	he	200	“ Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible , ”
43339	43376	43335	43335	he	200	“ I told her to remain in the tent . I told her to stay there while I went to sort out the trouble . And I find that she disobeyed me . This means clothes . ”
43377	43380	43382	43382	Winky	253	“ No ! ”
43392	43403	43382	43382	Winky	253	“ No , master ! Not clothes , not clothes ! ”
43447	43453	43454	43454	Hermione	169	“ But she was frightened ! ”
43464	43495	43461	43462	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Your elf ’s scared of heights , and those wizards in masks were levitating people ! You ca n’t blame her for wanting to get out of their way ! ”
43532	43546	43547	43547	he	200	“ I have no use for a house - elf who disobeys me , ”
43556	43580	43547	43547	he	200	“ I have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master , and to her master ’s reputation . ”
43612	43654	43605	43606	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Well , I think I ’ll take my lot back to the tent , if nobody ’s got any objections . Amos , that wand ’s told us all it can — if Harry could have it back , please — ”
43666	43673	43674	43675	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Come on , you three , ”
43698	43701	43689	43689	her	169	“ Hermione ! ”
43726	43735	43737	43737	Hermione	169	“ What ’s going to happen to Winky ? ”
43747	43753	43755	43756	Mr. Weasley	173	“ I do n’t know , ”
43758	43766	43768	43768	Hermione	169	“ The way they were treating her ! ”
43771	43829	43768	43768	Hermione	169	“ Mr. Diggory , calling her ‘ elf ’ all the time ... and Mr. Crouch ! He knows she did n’t do it and he ’s still going to sack her ! He did n’t care how frightened she ’d been , or how upset she was — it was like she was n’t even human ! ”
43830	43837	43839	43839	Ron	171	“ Well , she ’s not , ”
43846	43865	43768	43768	Hermione	169	“ That does n’t mean she has n’t got feelings , Ron . It ’s disgusting the way — ”
43866	43874	43876	43877	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Hermione , I agree with you , ”
43884	43916	43881	43881	her	169	“ but now is not the time to discuss elf rights . I want to get back to the tent as fast as we can . What happened to the others ? ”
43917	43925	43927	43927	Ron	171	“ We lost them in the dark , ”
43929	43942	43927	43927	Ron	171	“ Dad , why was everyone so uptight about that skull thing ? ”
43943	43953	43955	43956	Mr. Weasley	173	“ I ’ll explain everything back at the tent , ”
44004	44012	43998	44000	many of them	1580	“ What ’s going on in there ? ”
44013	44018	43992	43993	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Who conjured it ? ”
44019	44028	43998	44000	many of them	1580	“ Arthur — it ’s not — Him ? ”
44029	44037	44039	44040	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Of course it ’s not Him , ”
44043	44071	44039	44040	Mr. Weasley	173	“ We do n’t know who it was ; it looks like they Disapparated . Now excuse me , please , I want to get to bed . ”
44123	44131	44132	44132	he	173	“ Dad , what ’s going on ? ”
44138	44153	44132	44132	he	173	“ Fred , George , and Ginny got back okay , but the others — ”
44154	44161	44163	44164	Mr. Weasley	173	“ I ’ve got them here , ”
44233	44241	44243	44243	Bill	185	“ Did you get them , Dad ? ”
44246	44254	44243	44243	Bill	185	“ The person who conjured the Mark ? ”
44255	44258	44260	44261	Mr. Weasley	173	“ No , ”
44263	44288	44260	44261	Mr. Weasley	173	“ We found Barty Crouch ’s elf holding Harry ’s wand , but we ’re none the wiser about who actually conjured the Mark . ”
44289	44292	44294	44294	Bill	185	“ What ? ”
44302	44307	44309	44309	Fred	175	“ Harry ’s wand ? ”
44311	44317	44319	44319	Percy	248	“ Mr. Crouch ’s elf ? ”
44356	44373	44374	44374	he	248	“ Well , Mr. Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that ! ”
44377	44421	44374	44374	he	248	“ Running away when he ’d expressly told her not to ... embarrassing him in front of the whole Ministry ... how would that have looked , if she ’d been brought up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control — ”
44422	44441	44442	44442	Hermione	169	“ She did n’t do anything — she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time ! ”
44473	44500	44502	44502	Percy	248	“ Hermione , a wizard in Mr. Crouch ’s position ca n’t afford a house - elf who ’s going to run amok with a wand ! ”
44508	44515	44517	44517	Hermione	169	“ She did n’t run amok ! ”
44519	44529	44517	44517	Hermione	169	“ She just picked it up off the ground ! ”
44530	44543	44545	44545	Ron	171	“ Look , can someone just explain what that skull thing was ? ”
44548	44563	44545	44545	Ron	171	“ It was n’t hurting anyone ... Why ’s it such a big deal ? ”
44564	44581	44583	44583	Hermione	169	“ I told you , it ’s You - Know - Who ’s symbol , Ron , ”
44591	44606	44583	44583	Hermione	169	“ I read about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts . ”
44607	44618	44620	44621	Mr. Weasley	173	“ And it has n’t been seen for thirteen years , ”
44624	44643	44620	44621	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Of course people panicked ... it was almost like seeing You - Know - Who back again . ”
44644	44651	44653	44653	Ron	171	“ I do n’t get it , ”
44657	44671	44653	44653	Ron	171	“ I mean ... it ’s still only a shape in the sky ... ”
44672	44694	44696	44697	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Ron , You - Know - Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air whenever they killed , ”
44699	44739	44696	44697	Mr. Weasley	173	“ The terror it inspired ... you have no idea , you ’re too young . Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house , and knowing what you ’re about to find inside ... ”
44744	44754	44740	44741	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Everyone ’s worst fear ... the very worst ... ”
44779	44841	44763	44763	Bill	185	“ Well , it did n’t help us tonight , whoever conjured it . It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it . They all Disapparated before we ’d got near enough to unmask any of them . We caught the Robertses before they hit the ground , though . They ’re having their memories modified right now . ”
44842	44846	44848	44848	Harry	158	“ Death Eaters ? ”
44850	44856	44848	44848	Harry	158	“ What are Death Eaters ? ”
44857	44871	44873	44873	Bill	185	“ It ’s what You - Know - Who ’s supporters called themselves , ”
44875	44900	44873	44873	Bill	185	“ I think we saw what ’s left of them tonight — the ones who managed to keep themselves out of Azkaban , anyway . ”
44901	44912	44914	44915	Mr. Weasley	173	“ We ca n’t prove it was them , Bill , ”
44917	44923	44924	44924	he	173	“ Though it probably was , ”
44928	44936	44938	44938	Ron	171	“ Yeah , I bet it was ! ”
44941	44985	44938	44938	Ron	171	“ Dad , we met Draco Malfoy in the woods , and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks ! And we all know the Malfoys were right in with You - Know - Who ! ”
44986	44994	44995	44995	Harry	158	“ But what were Voldemort ’s supporters — ”
45017	45020	45022	45022	Harry	158	“ Sorry , ”
45025	45049	45022	45022	Harry	158	“ What were You - Know - Who ’s supporters up to , levitating Muggles ? I mean , what was the point ? ”
45050	45054	45056	45057	Mr. Weasley	173	“ The point ? ”
45063	45123	45124	45124	he	158	“ Harry , that ’s their idea of fun . Half the Muggle killings back when You - Know - Who was in power were done for fun . I suppose they had a few drinks tonight and could n’t resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large . A nice little reunion for them , ”
45128	45148	45150	45150	Ron	171	“ But if they were the Death Eaters , why did they Disapparate when they saw the Dark Mark ? ”
45152	45166	45150	45150	Ron	171	“ They ’d have been pleased to see it , would n’t they ? ”
45167	45174	45176	45176	Bill	185	“ Use your brains , Ron , ”
45178	45278	45176	45176	Bill	185	“ If they really were Death Eaters , they worked very hard to keep out of Azkaban when You - Know - Who lost power , and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people . I bet they ’d be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back . They denied they ’d ever been involved with him when he lost his powers , and went back to their daily lives ... I do n’t reckon he ’d be over - pleased with them , do you ? ”
45279	45288	45290	45290	Hermione	169	“ So ... whoever conjured the Dark Mark ... ”
45293	45312	45290	45290	Hermione	169	“ were they doing it to show support for the Death Eaters , or to scare them away ? ”
45313	45324	45326	45327	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Your guess is as good as ours , Hermione , ”
45329	45418	45326	45327	Mr. Weasley	173	“ But I ’ll tell you this ... it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it . I ’d be very surprised if the person who did it had n’t been a Death Eater once , even if they ’re not now ... Listen , it ’s very late , and if your mother hears what ’s happened she ’ll be worried sick . We ’ll get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early Portkey out of here . ”
45640	45644	45633	45633	he	220	“ Merry Christmas . ”
45645	45652	45654	45655	Mr. Weasley	173	“ He ’ll be all right , ”
45665	45699	45654	45655	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Sometimes , when a person ’s memory ’s modified , it makes him a bit disorientated for a while ... and that was a big thing they had to make him forget . ”
45841	45849	45909	45909	She	174	“ Oh thank goodness , thank goodness ! ”
45896	45908	45876	45876	her	174	“ Arthur — I ’ve been so worried — so worried — ”
45968	45974	45975	45976	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ You ’re all right , ”
45993	46001	45975	45976	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ you ’re alive ... Oh boys ... ”
46028	46038	46008	46008	she	174	“ Ouch ! Mum — you ’re strangling us — ”
46039	46048	46049	46050	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ I shouted at you before you left ! ”
46057	46101	46049	46050	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ It ’s all I ’ve been thinking about ! What if You - Know - Who had got you , and the last thing I ever said to you was that you did n’t get enough O.W.L.s ? Oh Fred ... George ... ”
46102	46116	46118	46119	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Come on , now , Molly , we ’re all perfectly okay , ”
46135	46138	46139	46139	he	173	“ Bill , ”
46145	46159	46139	46139	he	173	“ pick up that paper , I want to see what it says ... ”
46217	46222	46224	46225	Mr. Weasley	173	“ I knew it , ”
46228	46259	46224	46225	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Ministry blunders ... culprits not apprehended ... lax security ... Dark wizards running unchecked ... national disgrace ... Who wrote this ? Ah ... of course ... Rita Skeeter . ”
46260	46273	46275	46275	Percy	248	“ That woman ’s got it in for the Ministry of Magic ! ”
46278	46326	46275	46275	Percy	248	“ Last week she was saying we ’re wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness , when we should be stamping out vampires ! As if it was n’t specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non - Wizard Part - Humans — ”
46327	46335	46337	46337	Bill	185	“ Do us a favor , Perce , ”
46341	46346	46337	46337	Bill	185	“ and shut up . ”
46347	46352	46354	46355	Mr. Weasley	173	“ I ’m mentioned , ”
46374	46377	46379	46380	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Where ? ”
46389	46404	46379	46380	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ If I ’d seen that , I ’d have known you were alive ! ”
46405	46410	46412	46413	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Not by name , ”
46421	46444	46415	46415	He	173	“ Molly , I ’m going to have to go into the office ; this is going to take some smoothing over . ”
46445	46454	46456	46456	Percy	248	“ I ’ll come with you , Father , ”
46459	46480	46456	46456	Percy	248	“ Mr. Crouch will need all hands on deck . And I can give him my cauldron report in person . ”
46494	46524	46488	46489	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Arthur , you ’re supposed to be on holiday ! This has n’t got anything to do with your office ; surely they can handle this without you ? ”
46525	46534	46536	46537	Mr. Weasley	173	“ I ’ve got to go , Molly , ”
46539	46559	46536	46537	Mr. Weasley	173	“ I ’ve made things worse . I ’ll just change into my robes and I ’ll be off ... ”
46560	46564	46566	46566	Harry	158	“ Mrs. Weasley , ”
46574	46588	46566	46566	Harry	158	“ Hedwig has n’t arrived with a letter for me , has she ? ”
46589	46594	46596	46597	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Hedwig , dear ? ”
46600	46614	46596	46597	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ No ... no , there has n’t been any post at all . ”
46634	46650	46631	46631	he	158	“ All right if I go and dump my stuff in your room , Ron ? ”
46651	46659	46661	46661	Ron	171	“ Yeah ... think I will too , ”
46665	46668	46661	46661	Ron	171	“ Hermione ? ”
46669	46672	46673	46673	she	169	“ Yes , ”
46692	46699	46701	46701	Ron	171	“ What ’s up , Harry ? ”
46717	46727	46728	46728	Harry	158	“ There ’s something I have n’t told you , ”
46731	46745	46728	46728	Harry	158	“ On Saturday morning , I woke up with my scar hurting again . ”
46802	46838	46797	46797	Ron	171	“ But — he was n’t there , was he ? You - Know - Who ? I mean — last time your scar kept hurting , he was at Hogwarts , was n’t he ? ”
46839	46850	46852	46852	Harry	158	“ I ’m sure he was n’t on Privet Drive , ”
46854	46889	46852	46852	Harry	158	“ But I was dreaming about him ... him and Peter — you know , Wormtail . I ca n’t remember all of it now , but they were plotting to kill ... someone . ”
46901	46904	46890	46890	He	158	“ me , ”
46922	46929	46931	46931	Ron	171	“ It was only a dream , ”
46934	46939	46931	46931	Ron	171	“ Just a nightmare . ”
46940	46949	46951	46951	Harry	158	“ Yeah , but was it , though ? ”
46965	47002	46951	46951	Harry	158	“ It ’s weird , is n’t it ? ... My scar hurts , and three days later the Death Eaters are on the march , and Voldemort ’s sign ’s up in the sky again . ”
47003	47013	47014	47014	Ron	171	“ Do n’t — say — his — name ! ”
47020	47028	47029	47029	Harry	158	“ And remember what Professor Trelawney said ? ”
47036	47044	47029	47029	Harry	158	“ At the end of last year ? ”
47067	47085	47060	47060	she	169	“ Oh Harry , you are n’t going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says ? ”
47086	47092	47094	47094	Harry	158	“ You were n’t there , ”
47096	47162	47094	47094	Harry	158	“ You did n’t hear her . This time was different . I told you , she went into a trance — a real one . And she said the Dark Lord would rise again ... greater and more terrible than ever before ... and he ’d manage it because his servant was going to go back to him ... and that night Wormtail escaped . ”
47181	47193	47194	47194	Hermione	169	“ Why were you asking if Hedwig had come , Harry ? ”
47197	47204	47194	47194	Hermione	169	“ Are you expecting a letter ? ”
47205	47213	47215	47215	Harry	158	“ I told Sirius about my scar , ”
47219	47227	47215	47215	Harry	158	“ I ’m waiting for his answer . ”
47228	47232	47234	47234	Ron	171	“ Good thinking ! ”
47240	47249	47234	47234	Ron	171	“ I bet Sirius’ll know what to do ! ”
47250	47261	47263	47263	Harry	158	“ I hoped he ’d get back to me quickly , ”
47265	47287	47289	47289	Hermione	169	“ But we do n’t know where Sirius is ... he could be in Africa or somewhere , could n’t he ? ”
47292	47306	47289	47289	Hermione	169	“ Hedwig ’s not going to manage that journey in a few days . ”
47307	47313	47315	47315	Harry	158	“ Yeah , I know , ”
47340	47354	47356	47356	Ron	171	“ Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard , Harry , ”
47358	47384	47356	47356	Ron	171	“ Come on — three on three , Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will play ... You can try out the Wronski Feint ... ”
47385	47388	47390	47390	Hermione	169	“ Ron , ”
47411	47439	47390	47390	Hermione	169	“ Harry does n’t want to play Quidditch right now ... He ’s worried , and he ’s tired ... We all need to go to bed ... ”
47440	47449	47451	47451	Harry	158	“ Yeah , I want to play Quidditch , ”
47454	47464	47451	47451	Harry	158	“ Hang on , I ’ll get my Firebolt . ”
47477	47480	47465	47465	Hermione	169	“ Boys . ”
47518	47526	47527	47527	Percy	248	“ It ’s been an absolute uproar , ”
47543	47589	47527	47527	Percy	248	“ I ’ve been putting out fires all week . People keep sending Howlers , and of course , if you do n’t open a Howler straight away , it explodes . Scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to cinders . ”
47590	47598	47600	47600	Ginny	191	“ Why are they all sending Howlers ? ”
47627	47636	47638	47638	Percy	248	“ Complaining about security at the World Cup , ”
47640	47690	47638	47638	Percy	248	“ They want compensation for their ruined property . Mundungus Fletcher ’s put in a claim for a twelve - bedroomed tent with en - suite Jacuzzi , but I ’ve got his number . I know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks . ”
47763	47766	47834	47835	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Home , ”
47767	47770	47834	47835	Mr. Weasley	173	“ school , ”

47855	47878	47879	47879	she	174	“ Your father has n’t had to go into the office on weekends since the days of You - Know - Who , ”
47882	47906	47879	47879	she	174	“ They ’re working him far too hard . His dinner ’s going to be ruined if he does n’t come home soon . ”
47907	47929	47931	47931	Percy	248	“ Well , Father feels he ’s got to make up for his mistake at the match , does n’t he ? ”
47933	47959	47931	47931	Percy	248	“ If truth be told , he was a tad unwise to make a public statement without clearing it with his Head of Department first — ”
47960	47976	47978	47979	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Do n’t you dare blame your father for what that wretched Skeeter woman wrote ! ”
47986	48011	48013	48013	Bill	185	“ If Dad had n’t said anything , old Rita would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from the Ministry had commented , ”
48022	48053	48013	48013	Bill	185	“ Rita Skeeter never makes anyone look good . Remember , she interviewed all the Gringotts Charm Breakers once , and called me ‘ a long - haired pillock ’ ? ”
48054	48065	48067	48068	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Well , it is a bit long , dear , ”
48071	48079	48067	48068	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ If you ’d just let me — ”

48226	48237	48239	48239	George	176	“ Yeah , we ’ve left it a bit late , ”
48241	48258	48260	48261	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ You ’re not by any chance writing out a new order form , are you ? ”
48264	48283	48260	48261	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ You would n’t be thinking of re - starting Weasleys ’ Wizard Wheezes , by any chance ? ”
48284	48289	48291	48291	Fred	175	“ Now , Mum , ”
48305	48339	48302	48302	his	1638	“ If the Hogwarts Express crashed tomorrow , and George and I died , how would you feel to know that the last thing we ever heard from you was an unfounded accusation ? ”

48485	48497	48499	48499	Percy	248	“ Mr. Crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks , ”
48502	48515	48517	48518	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Crouch is very lucky Rita has n’t found out about Winky , ”
48521	48547	48517	48518	Mr. Weasley	173	“ There ’d be a week ’s worth of headlines in his house - elf being caught holding the wand that conjured the Dark Mark . ”
48548	48568	48570	48570	Percy	248	“ I thought we were all agreed that that elf , while irresponsible , did not conjure the Mark ? ”
48573	48598	48600	48600	Hermione	169	“ If you ask me , Mr. Crouch is very lucky no one at the Daily Prophet knows how mean he is to elves ! ”
48603	48610	48612	48612	Percy	248	“ Now look here , Hermione ! ”
48614	48631	48612	48612	Percy	248	“ A high - ranking Ministry official like Mr. Crouch deserves unswerving obedience from his servants — ”
48632	48639	48641	48641	Hermione	169	“ His slave , you mean ! ”
48648	48659	48643	48643	her	169	“ because he did n’t pay Winky , did he ? ”
48660	48677	48679	48680	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ I think you ’d all better go upstairs and check that you ’ve packed properly ! ”
48687	48696	48679	48680	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Come on now , all of you ... ”
48785	48792	48794	48794	Ron	171	“ Bung him some Owl Treats , ”
48803	48810	48794	48794	Ron	171	“ It might shut him up . ”
48842	48850	48851	48851	Harry	158	“ It ’s been over a week , ”
48861	48876	48851	48851	Harry	158	“ Ron , you do n’t reckon Sirius has been caught , do you ? ”
48877	48889	48891	48891	Ron	171	“ Nah , it would ’ve been in the Daily Prophet , ”
48893	48909	48891	48891	Ron	171	“ The Ministry would want to show they ’d caught someone , would n’t they ? ”
48910	48916	48851	48851	Harry	158	“ Yeah , I suppose ... ”
48917	48953	48954	48954	He	171	“ Look , here ’s the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon Alley . And she ’s got some gold out of your vault for you ... and she ’s washed all your socks . ”
49056	49064	49046	49046	Ron	171	“ What is that supposed to be ? ”
49120	49125	49126	49126	she	174	“ Here you are , ”
49135	49149	49126	49126	she	174	“ Now , mind you pack them properly so they do n’t crease . ”
49150	49162	49164	49164	Ron	171	“ Mum , you ’ve given me Ginny ’s new dress , ”
49172	49179	49181	49182	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Of course I have n’t , ”
49184	49193	49181	49182	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ That ’s for you . Dress robes . ”
49194	49197	49199	49199	Ron	171	“ What ? ”
49206	49210	49212	49213	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Dress robes ! ”
49215	49238	49212	49213	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ It says on your school list that you ’re supposed to have dress robes this year ... robes for formal occasions . ”
49239	49247	49249	49249	Ron	171	“ You ’ve got to be kidding , ”
49253	49263	49249	49249	Ron	171	“ I ’m not wearing that , no way . ”
49264	49271	49273	49274	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Everyone wears them , Ron ! ”
49277	49293	49273	49274	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ They ’re all like that ! Your father ’s got some for smart parties ! ”
49294	49305	49307	49307	Ron	171	“ I ’ll go starkers before I put that on , ”
49310	49317	49319	49320	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Do n’t be so silly , ”
49322	49349	49319	49320	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ You ’ve got to have dress robes , they ’re on your list ! I got some for Harry too ... show him , Harry ... ”
49414	49429	49431	49432	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ I thought they ’d bring out the color of your eyes , dear , ”
49435	49442	49444	49444	Ron	171	“ Well , they ’re okay ! ”
49453	49463	49444	49444	Ron	171	“ Why could n’t I have some like that ? ”
49464	49485	49487	49488	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Because ... well , I had to get yours secondhand , and there was n’t a lot of choice ! ”
49521	49528	49529	49529	Ron	171	“ I ’m never wearing them , ”
49534	49537	49529	49529	Ron	171	“ Never . ”
49538	49541	49543	49544	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Fine , ”
49546	49572	49543	49544	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Go naked . And , Harry , make sure you get a picture of him . Goodness knows I could do with a laugh . ”
49603	49611	49613	49613	Ron	171	“ Why is everything I own rubbish ? ”
49714	49717	49718	49718	she	174	“ Arthur ! ”
49724	49733	49718	49718	she	174	“ Arthur ! Urgent message from the Ministry ! ”
49780	49789	49772	49773	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ I ’ve got a quill here somewhere ! ”
49860	49895	49839	49839	It	208	“ ... Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting , so they went and called those what - d’you - call-’ems — please - men . Arthur , you ’ve got to get over there — ”
49896	49899	49901	49902	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Here ! ”
49926	49940	49942	49943	Mr. Diggory	216	“ — it ’s a real stroke of luck I heard about it , ”
49947	49987	49942	49943	Mr. Diggory	216	“ I had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls , and I found the Improper Use of Magic lot all setting off — if Rita Skeeter gets hold of this one , Arthur — ”
49988	49997	49999	50000	Mr. Weasley	173	“ What does Mad - Eye say happened ? ”
50026	50051	50018	50019	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Says he heard an intruder in his yard . Says he was creeping toward the house , but was ambushed by his dustbins . ”
50052	50059	50061	50062	Mr. Weasley	173	“ What did the dustbins do ? ”
50067	50086	50088	50089	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere , as far as I can tell , ”
50091	50108	50088	50089	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Apparently one of them was still rocketing around when the please - men turned up — ”
50113	50120	50018	50019	Mr. Diggory	216	“ And what about the intruder ? ”
50121	50130	50132	50133	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Arthur , you know Mad - Eye , ”
50142	50222	50132	50133	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Someone creeping into his yard in the dead of night ? More likely there ’s a very shell - shocked cat wandering around somewhere , covered in potato peelings . But if the Improper Use of Magic lot get their hands on Mad - Eye , he ’s had it — think of his record — we ’ve got to get him off on a minor charge , something in your department — what are exploding dustbins worth ? ”
50223	50229	50231	50232	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Might be a caution , ”
50243	50260	50239	50239	his	173	“ Mad - Eye did n’t use his wand ? He did n’t actually attack anyone ? ”
50261	50281	50283	50284	Mr. Diggory	216	“ I ’ll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach through the window , ”
50286	50302	50283	50284	Mr. Diggory	216	“ but they ’ll have a job proving it , there are n’t any casualties . ”
50303	50311	50312	50313	Mr. Weasley	173	“ All right , I ’m off , ”
50347	50354	50312	50313	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Sorry about this , Molly , ”
50361	50405	50312	50313	Mr. Weasley	173	“ bothering you so early and everything ... but Arthur ’s the only one who can get Mad - Eye off , and Mad - Eye ’s supposed to be starting his new job today . Why he had to choose last night ... ”
50406	50412	50414	50415	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Never mind , Amos , ”
50417	50433	50414	50415	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Sure you wo n’t have a bit of toast or anything before you go ? ”
50434	50441	50443	50444	Mr. Diggory	216	“ Oh go on , then , ”
50478	50481	50482	50482	he	216	“ Fanks , ”
50546	50560	50562	50563	Mr. Weasley	173	“ I ’d better hurry — you have a good term , boys , ”
50584	50602	50562	50563	Mr. Weasley	173	“ Molly , are you going to be all right taking the kids to King ’s Cross ? ”
50603	50609	50610	50610	she	1664	“ Of course I will , ”
50613	50627	50610	50610	she	1664	“ You just look after Mad - Eye , we ’ll be fine . ”
50640	50648	50649	50649	Bill	185	“ Did someone say Mad - Eye ? ”
50652	50661	50649	50649	Bill	185	“ What ’s he been up to now ? ”
50662	50675	50677	50678	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ He says someone tried to break into his house last night , ”
50680	50686	50688	50688	George	176	“ Mad - Eye Moody ? ”
50697	50704	50688	50688	George	176	“ Is n’t he that nutter — ”
50705	50717	50719	50720	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Your father thinks very highly of Mad - Eye Moody , ”
50723	50736	50738	50738	Fred	175	“ Yeah , well , Dad collects plugs , does n’t he ? ”
50747	50753	50741	50742	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Birds of a feather ... ”
50754	50764	50766	50766	Bill	185	“ Moody was a great wizard in his time , ”
50768	50782	50784	50784	Charlie	186	“ He ’s an old friend of Dumbledore ’s , is n’t he ? ”
50786	50801	50803	50803	Fred	175	“ Dumbledore ’s not what you ’d call normal , though , is he ? ”
50805	50818	50803	50803	Fred	175	“ I mean , I know he ’s a genius and everything ... ”
50819	50826	50828	50828	Harry	158	“ Who is Mad - Eye ? ”
50830	50842	50844	50844	Charlie	186	“ He ’s retired , used to work at the Ministry , ”
50846	50876	50877	50877	he	186	“ I met him once when Dad took me in to work with him . He was an Auror — one of the best ... a Dark wizard catcher , ”
50886	50941	50877	50877	he	186	“ Half the cells in Azkaban are full because of him . He made himself loads of enemies , though ... the families of people he caught , mainly ... and I heard he ’s been getting really paranoid in his old age . Does n’t trust anyone anymore . Sees Dark wizards everywhere . ”
50975	50989	50990	50990	he	248	“ I just ca n’t justify taking more time off at the moment , ”
50994	51005	50990	50990	he	248	“ Mr. Crouch is really starting to rely on me . ”
51006	51015	51017	51017	George	176	“ Yeah , you know what , Percy ? ”
51020	51030	51017	51017	George	176	“ I reckon he ’ll know your name soon . ”
51054	51064	51065	51066	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Arthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us , ”
51093	51114	51065	51066	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ But there were n’t any to spare ... Oh dear , they do n’t look happy , do they ? ”
51494	51506	51508	51508	Charlie	186	“ I might be seeing you all sooner than you think , ”
51520	51523	51525	51525	Fred	175	“ Why ? ”
51528	51533	51535	51535	Charlie	186	“ You ’ll see , ”
51537	51569	51535	51535	Charlie	186	“ Just do n’t tell Percy I mentioned it ... it ’s ‘ classified information , until such time as the Ministry sees fit to release it , ’ after all . ”
51570	51585	51587	51587	Bill	185	“ Yeah , I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this year , ”
51601	51604	51606	51606	George	176	“ Why ? ”
51609	51619	51621	51621	Bill	185	“ You ’re going to have an interesting year , ”
51627	51643	51623	51623	his	185	“ I might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it ... ”
51644	51650	51652	51652	Ron	171	“ A bit of what ? ”
51673	51684	51686	51686	Hermione	169	“ Thanks for having us to stay , Mrs. Weasley , ”
51708	51718	51720	51720	Harry	158	“ Yeah , thanks for everything , Mrs. Weasley , ”
51722	51731	51733	51734	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Oh it was my pleasure , dears , ”
51736	51769	51733	51734	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ I ’d invite you for Christmas , but ... well , I expect you ’re all going to want to stay at Hogwarts , what with ... one thing and another . ”
51770	51773	51775	51775	Ron	171	“ Mum ! ”
51778	51788	51775	51775	Ron	171	“ What d’you three know that we do n’t ? ”
51789	51800	51802	51803	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ You ’ll find out this evening , I expect , ”
51807	51829	51802	51803	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ It ’s going to be very exciting — mind you , I ’m very glad they ’ve changed the rules — ”
51830	51834	51836	51836	Harry	158	“ What rules ? ”
51846	51875	51802	51803	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ I ’m sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you ... Now , behave , wo n’t you ? Wo n’t you , Fred ? And you , George ? ”
51887	51896	51897	51897	Fred	175	“ Tell us what ’s happening at Hogwarts ! ”
51916	51923	51910	51910	Charlie	186	“ What rules are they changing ? ”
52001	52013	52014	52014	he	171	“ Bagman wanted to tell us what ’s happening at Hogwarts , ”
52024	52043	52014	52014	he	171	“ At the World Cup , remember ? But my own mother wo n’t say . Wonder what — ”
52044	52047	52048	52048	Hermione	169	“ Shh ! ”
52106	52119	52120	52120	she	169	“ So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him , does he ? ”
52124	52142	52120	52120	she	169	“ I wish he had gone , then we would n’t have to put up with him . ”
52143	52150	52152	52152	Harry	158	“ Durmstrang ’s another Wizarding school ? ”
52154	52157	52159	52159	Hermione	169	“ Yes , ”
52162	52192	52159	52159	Hermione	169	“ and it ’s got a horrible reputation . According to An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe , it puts a lot of emphasis on the Dark Arts . ”
52193	52202	52204	52204	Ron	171	“ I think I ’ve heard of it , ”
52207	52215	52204	52204	Ron	171	“ Where is it ? What country ? ”
52216	52225	52230	52230	her	169	“ Well , nobody knows , do they ? ”
52233	52239	52241	52241	Harry	158	“ Er — why not ? ”
52243	52273	52275	52275	Hermione	169	“ There ’s traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools . Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal their secrets , ”
52282	52287	52289	52289	Ron	171	“ Come off it , ”
52295	52319	52289	52289	Ron	171	“ Durmstrang ’s got to be about the same size as Hogwarts — how are you going to hide a great big castle ? ”
52320	52326	52328	52328	Hermione	169	“ But Hogwarts is hidden , ”
52333	52351	52328	52328	Hermione	169	“ Everyone knows that ... well , everyone who ’s read Hogwarts : A History , anyway . ”
52352	52358	52360	52360	Ron	171	“ Just you , then , ”
52362	52375	52360	52360	Ron	171	“ So go on — how d’you hide a place like Hogwarts ? ”
52376	52381	52383	52383	Hermione	169	“ It ’s bewitched , ”
52385	52416	52383	52383	Hermione	169	“ If a Muggle looks at it , all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying DANGER , DO NOT ENTER , UNSAFE . ”
52417	52430	52360	52360	Ron	171	“ So Durmstrang’ll just look like a ruin to an outsider too ? ”
52431	52434	52436	52436	Hermione	169	“ Maybe , ”
52440	52474	52436	52436	Hermione	169	“ or it might have Muggle - repelling charms on it , like the World Cup stadium . And to keep foreign wizards from finding it , they ’ll have made it Unplottable — ”
52475	52479	52360	52360	Ron	171	“ Come again ? ”
52480	52502	52436	52436	Hermione	169	“ Well , you can enchant a building so it ’s impossible to plot on a map , ca n’t you ? ”
52503	52511	52513	52513	Harry	158	“ Er ... if you say so , ”
52515	52528	52530	52530	Hermione	169	“ But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north , ”
52533	52550	52530	52530	Hermione	169	“ Somewhere very cold , because they ’ve got fur capes as part of their uniforms . ”
52551	52559	52561	52561	Ron	171	“ Ah , think of the possibilities , ”
52564	52591	52561	52561	Ron	171	“ It would ’ve been so easy to push Malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an accident ... Shame his mother likes him ... ”
52714	52721	52740	52740	Hermione	169	“ Troy — Mullet — Moran ! ”
52788	52796	52797	52797	he	315	“ Gran did n’t want to go , ”
52801	52812	52797	52797	he	315	“ Would n’t buy tickets . It sounded amazing though . ”
52813	52817	52819	52819	Ron	171	“ It was , ”
52821	52828	52819	52819	Ron	171	“ Look at this , Neville ... ”
52849	52853	52855	52855	Neville	315	“ Oh wow , ”
52866	52877	52879	52879	Ron	171	“ We saw him right up close , as well , ”
52881	52889	52879	52879	Ron	171	“ We were in the Top Box — ”
52890	52903	52904	52905	Draco Malfoy	257	“ For the first and last time in your life , Weasley . ”
52959	52971	52973	52973	Harry	158	“ Do n’t remember asking you to join us , Malfoy , ”
52976	52983	52985	52985	Malfoy	257	“ Weasley ... what is that ? ”
53045	53050	53052	53052	Malfoy	257	“ Look at this ! ”
53067	53092	53063	53063	Crabbe	317	“ Weasley , you were n’t thinking of wearing these , were you ? I mean — they were very fashionable in about 1890 ... ”
53093	53099	53101	53101	Ron	171	“ Eat dung , Malfoy ! ”
53133	53179	53063	53063	Crabbe	317	“ So ... going to enter , Weasley ? Going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name ? There ’s money involved as well , you know ... you ’d be able to afford some decent robes if you won ... ”
53180	53187	53189	53189	Ron	171	“ What are you talking about ? ”
53191	53198	53199	53199	Malfoy	257	“ Are you going to enter ? ”
53202	53222	53199	53199	Malfoy	257	“ I suppose you will , Potter ? You never miss a chance to show off , do you ? ”
53223	53237	53239	53239	Hermione	169	“ Either explain what you ’re on about or go away , Malfoy , ”
53265	53275	53276	53276	he	257	“ Do n’t tell me you do n’t know ? ”
53280	53359	53276	53276	he	257	“ You ’ve got a father and brother at the Ministry and you do n’t even know ? My God , my father told me about it ages ago ... heard it from Cornelius Fudge . But then , Father ’s always associated with the top people at the Ministry ... Maybe your father ’s too junior to know about it , Weasley ... yes ... they probably do n’t talk about important stuff in front of him ... ”
53398	53401	53403	53403	Hermione	169	“ Ron ! ”
53414	53417	53407	53407	she	169	“ Reparo ! ”
53434	53449	53450	53450	Ron	171	“ Well ... making it look like he knows everything and we do n’t ... ”
53453	53486	53450	53450	Ron	171	“ ‘ Father ’s always associated with the top people at the Ministry . ’ ... Dad could ’ve got a promotion any time ... he just likes it where he is ... ”
53487	53493	53495	53495	Hermione	169	“ Of course he does , ”
53498	53509	53495	53495	Hermione	169	“ Do n’t let Malfoy get to you , Ron — ”
53510	53521	53523	53523	Ron	171	“ Him ! Get to me ! ? As if ! ”
53662	53667	53668	53668	Harry	158	“ Hi , Hagrid ! ”
53683	53690	53691	53691	Hagrid	181	“ All righ ’ , Harry ? ”
53697	53709	53691	53691	Hagrid	181	“ See yeh at the feast if we don ’ drown ! ”
53724	53738	53740	53740	Hermione	169	“ Oooh , I would n’t fancy crossing the lake in this weather , ”
53971	53974	53976	53976	Ron	171	“ Blimey , ”
53986	54004	53976	53976	Ron	171	“ if that keeps up the lake ’s going to overflow . I ’m soak — ARRGH ! ”
54136	54139	54175	54175	she	320	“ Peeves ! ”
54145	54154	54175	54175	she	320	“ Peeves , come down here at ONCE ! ”
54193	54201	54175	54175	she	320	“ Ouch — sorry , Miss Granger — ”
54202	54210	54211	54211	Hermione	169	“ That ’s all right , Professor ! ”
54218	54226	54228	54229	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Peeves , get down here NOW ! ”
54245	54250	54252	54252	Peeves	319	“ Not doing nothing ! ”
54274	54287	54289	54289	he	319	“ Already wet , are n’t they ? Little squirts ! Wheeeeeeeeee ! ”
54304	54311	54313	54314	Professor McGonagall	320	“ I shall call the headmaster ! ”
54316	54324	54313	54314	Professor McGonagall	320	“ I ’m warning you , Peeves — ”
54353	54361	54363	54364	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Well , move along , then ! ”
54371	54380	54363	54364	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Into the Great Hall , come on ! ”
54593	54597	54598	54598	he	325	“ Good evening , ”
54605	54609	54611	54611	Harry	158	“ Says who ? ”
54623	54636	54611	54611	Harry	158	“ Hope they hurry up with the Sorting . I ’m starving . ”
54696	54701	54704	54705	Colin Creevey	326	“ Hiya , Harry ! ”
54719	54724	54726	54726	Harry	158	“ Hi , Colin , ”
54729	54749	54704	54705	Colin Creevey	326	“ Harry , guess what ? Guess what , Harry ? My brother ’s starting ! My brother Dennis ! ”
54750	54755	54757	54757	Harry	158	“ Er — good , ”
54759	54765	54767	54767	Colin	326	“ He ’s really excited ! ”
54778	54796	54767	54767	Colin	326	“ I just hope he ’s in Gryffindor ! Keep your fingers crossed , eh , Harry ? ”
54797	54805	54807	54807	Harry	158	“ Er — yeah , all right , ”
54822	54837	54838	54838	he	158	“ Brothers and sisters usually go in the same Houses , do n’t they ? ”
54858	54865	54867	54867	Hermione	169	“ Oh no , not necessarily , ”
54869	54895	54867	54867	Hermione	169	“ Parvati Patil ’s twin ’s in Ravenclaw , and they ’re identical . You ’d think they ’d be together , would n’t you ? ”
54965	54977	54979	54979	Hermione	169	“ Where ’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ? ”
55043	55051	55053	55053	Hermione	169	“ Maybe they could n’t get anyone ! ”
55345	55350	55351	55351	Ron	171	“ Oh hurry up , ”
55357	55364	55351	55351	Ron	171	“ I could eat a hippogriff . ”
55663	55676	55678	55678	Harry	158	“ That ’s not the song it sang when it Sorted us , ”
55686	55694	55696	55696	Ron	171	“ Sings a different one every year , ”
55698	55729	55696	55696	Ron	171	“ It ’s got to be a pretty boring life , has n’t it , being a hat ? I suppose it spends all year making up the next one . ”
55741	55761	55762	55762	she	320	“ When I call out your name , you will put on the hat and sit on the stool , ”
55768	55790	55762	55762	she	320	“ When the hat announces your House , you will go and sit at the appropriate table . Ackerley , Stewart ! ”
56083	56090	56091	56091	he	327	“ Colin , I fell in ! ”
56102	56122	56091	56091	he	327	“ It was brilliant ! And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat ! ”
56123	56126	56128	56128	Colin	326	“ Cool ! ”
56134	56144	56128	56128	Colin	326	“ It was probably the giant squid , Dennis ! ”
56145	56148	56150	56150	Dennis	327	“ Wow ! ”
56189	56219	56128	56128	Colin	326	“ Dennis ! Dennis ! See that boy down there ? The one with the black hair and glasses ? See him ? Know who he is , Dennis ? ”
56275	56280	56281	56281	Ron	171	“ Oh hurry up , ”
56288	56302	56304	56306	Nearly Headless Nick	325	“ Now , Ron , the Sorting ’s much more important than food , ”
56308	56313	56304	56306	Nearly Headless Nick	325	“ Madley , Laura ! ”
56318	56329	56331	56331	Ron	171	“ ’ Course it is , if you ’re dead , ”
56333	56348	56350	56352	Nearly Headless Nick	325	“ I do hope this year ’s batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch , ”
56356	56361	56350	56352	Nearly Headless Nick	325	“ McDonald , Natalie ! ”
56367	56381	56350	56352	Nearly Headless Nick	325	“ We do n’t want to break our winning streak , do we ? ”
56403	56406	56350	56352	Nearly Headless Nick	325	“ Whitby , Kevin!”(“HUFFLEPUFF
56408	56429	56350	56352	Nearly Headless Nick	325	” ) , the Sorting ended . Professor McGonagall picked up the Sorint hat and the stool and carried them away .
56430	56434	56436	56436	Ron	171	“ About time , ”
56474	56485	56486	56486	he	170	“ I have only two words to say to you , ”
56498	56502	56486	56486	he	170	“ Tuck in . ”
56503	56508	56510	56510	Harry	158	“ Hear , hear ! ”
56541	56549	56551	56551	Ron	171	“ Aaah , ’ at ’s be’er , ”
56561	56576	56578	56580	Nearly Headless Nick	325	“ You ’re lucky there ’s a feast at all tonight , you know , ”
56582	56591	56578	56580	Nearly Headless Nick	325	“ There was trouble in the kitchens earlier . ”
56592	56600	56602	56602	Harry	158	“ Why ? Wha ’ ’ appened ? ”
56611	56617	56619	56621	Nearly Headless Nick	325	“ Peeves , of course , ”
56643	56723	56631	56631	He	325	“ The usual argument , you know . He wanted to attend the feast — well , it ’s quite out of the question , you know what he ’s like , utterly uncivilized , ca n’t see a plate of food without throwing it . We held a ghost ’s council — the Fat Friar was all for giving him the chance — but most wisely , in my opinion , the Bloody Baron put his foot down . ”
56755	56767	56769	56769	Ron	171	“ Yeah , we thought Peeves seemed hacked off about something , ”
56772	56782	56769	56769	Ron	171	“ So what did he do in the kitchens ? ”
56783	56788	56790	56792	Nearly Headless Nick	325	“ Oh the usual , ”
56796	56822	56790	56792	Nearly Headless Nick	325	“ Wreaked havoc and mayhem . Pots and pans everywhere . Place swimming in soup . Terrified the house - elves out of their wits — ”
56855	56863	56864	56864	she	169	“ There are house - elves here ? ”
56878	56883	56864	56864	she	169	“ Here at Hogwarts ? ”
56884	56887	56889	56891	Nearly Headless Nick	325	“ Certainly , ”
56899	56916	56889	56891	Nearly Headless Nick	325	“ The largest number in any dwelling in Britain , I believe . Over a hundred . ”
56917	56924	56926	56926	Hermione	169	“ I ’ve never seen one ! ”
56928	56943	56945	56947	Nearly Headless Nick	325	“ Well , they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day , do they ? ”
56949	57008	56945	56947	Nearly Headless Nick	325	“ They come out at night to do a bit of cleaning ... see to the fires and so on ... I mean , you ’re not supposed to see them , are you ? That ’s the mark of a good house - elf , is n’t it , that you do n’t know it ’s there ? ”
57014	57020	57021	57021	she	169	“ But they get paid ? ”
57024	57045	57021	57021	she	169	“ They get holidays , do n’t they ? And — and sick leave , and pensions , and everything ? ”
57081	57087	57088	57088	he	325	“ Sick leave and pensions ? ”
57107	57119	57088	57088	he	325	“ House - elves do n’t want sick leave and pensions ! ”
57147	57159	57161	57161	Ron	171	“ Oh c’m on , ’ Er - my - knee , ”
57172	57180	57181	57181	He	171	“ Oops — sorry , ’ Arry — ”
57184	57196	57181	57181	He	171	“ You wo n’t get them sick leave by starving yourself ! ”
57197	57201	57203	57203	Hermione	169	“ Slave labor , ”
57211	57222	57203	57203	Hermione	169	“ That ’s what made this dinner . Slave labor . ”
57279	57285	57287	57287	Ron	171	“ Treacle tart , Hermione ! ”
57296	57305	57287	57287	Ron	171	“ Spotted dick , look ! Chocolate gateau ! ”
57378	57381	57383	57383	Dumbledore	170	“ So ! ”
57391	57394	57395	57395	Harry	158	“ What ? ”
57431	57486	57427	57427	Dumbledore	170	“ This is due to an event that will be starting in October , and continuing throughout the school year , taking up much of the teachers ’ time and energy — but I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely . I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts — ”
57974	57987	57989	57989	Dumbledore	170	“ May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ? ”
57995	57999	57989	57989	Dumbledore	170	“ Professor Moody . ”
58068	58071	58072	58072	Harry	158	“ Moody ? ”
58077	58093	58072	58072	Harry	158	“ Mad - Eye Moody ? The one your dad went to help this morning ? ”
58094	58098	58100	58100	Ron	171	“ Must be , ”
58108	58114	58115	58115	Hermione	169	“ What happened to him ? ”
58118	58125	58115	58115	Hermione	169	“ What happened to his face ? ”
58126	58129	58130	58130	Ron	171	“ Dunno , ”
58230	58236	58237	58237	he	170	“ As I was saying , ”
58262	58314	58257	58260	Mad - Eye Moody	296	“ we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months , an event that has not been held for over a century . It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year . ”
58315	58320	58322	58323	Fred Weasley	175	“ You ’re JOKING ! ”
58350	58359	58360	58360	he	170	“ I am not joking , Mr. Weasley , ”
58363	58397	58360	58360	he	170	“ though now that you mention it , I did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll , a hag , and a leprechaun who all go into a bar ... ”
58405	58409	58410	58410	Hermione	169	“ Death toll ? ”
58469	58476	58484	58484	his	170	“ I ’m going for it ! ”
58591	58598	58600	58601	George Weasley	176	“ They ca n’t do that ! ”
58623	58638	58600	58601	George Weasley	176	“ We ’re seventeen in April , why ca n’t we have a shot ? ”
58639	58647	58649	58649	Fred	175	“ They ’re not stopping me entering , ”
58659	58685	58649	58649	Fred	175	“ The champions’ll get to do all sorts of stuff you ’d never be allowed to do normally . And a thousand Galleons prize money ! ”
58686	58689	58691	58691	Ron	171	“ Yeah , ”
58700	58707	58691	58691	Ron	171	“ Yeah , a thousand Galleons ... ”
58708	58712	58714	58714	Hermione	169	“ Come on , ”
58716	58731	58714	58714	Hermione	169	“ we ’ll be the only ones left here if you do n’t move . ”
58770	58786	58788	58788	Harry	158	“ Who ’s this impartial judge who ’s going to decide who the champions are ? ”
58790	58793	58795	58795	Fred	175	“ Dunno , ”
58797	58823	58795	58795	Fred	175	“ but it ’s them we ’ll have to fool . I reckon a couple of drops of Aging Potion might do it , George ... ”
58824	58835	58837	58837	Ron	171	“ Dumbledore knows you ’re not of age , though , ”
58839	58858	58860	58860	Fred	175	“ Yeah , but he ’s not the one who decides who the champion is , is he ? ”
58863	58903	58860	58860	Fred	175	“ Sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter , he ’ll choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are . Dumbledore ’s trying to stop us giving our names . ”
58904	58911	58913	58913	Hermione	169	“ People have died , though ! ”
58936	58939	58941	58941	Fred	175	“ Yeah , ”
58944	58986	58941	58941	Fred	175	“ but that was years ago , was n’t it ? Anyway , where ’s the fun without a bit of risk ? Hey , Ron , what if we find out how to get ’ round Dumbledore ? Fancy entering ? ”
58987	58992	58993	58993	Ron	171	“ What d’you reckon ? ”
58997	59023	58995	58995	Harry	158	“ Be cool to enter , would n’t it ? But I s’pose they might want someone older ... Dunno if we ’ve learned enough ... ”
59024	59030	59032	59032	Neville	315	“ I definitely have n’t , ”
59042	59077	59032	59032	Neville	315	“ I expect my gran’d want me to try , though . She ’s always going on about how I should be upholding the family honor . I ’ll just have to — oops ... ”
59157	59163	59165	59165	Ron	171	“ Shut it , you , ”

59471	59482	59483	59483	Ron	171	“ I might go in for it , you know , ”
59490	59510	59483	59483	Ron	171	“ if Fred and George find out how to ... the tournament ... you never know , do you ? ”
59511	59515	59483	59483	Ron	171	“ S’pose not ... ”
59695	59705	59707	59707	Ron	171	“ Today ’s not bad ... outside all morning , ”
59718	59739	59707	59707	Ron	171	“ Herbology with the Hufflepuffs and Care of Magical Creatures ... damn it , we ’re still with the Slytherins ... ”
59740	59746	59747	59747	Harry	158	“ Double Divination this afternoon , ”
59778	59792	59794	59794	Hermione	169	“ You should have given it up like me , should n’t you ? ”
59802	59813	59794	59794	Hermione	169	“ Then you ’d be doing something sensible like Arithmancy . ”
59814	59823	59825	59825	Ron	171	“ You ’re eating again , I notice , ”
59839	59855	59857	59857	Hermione	169	“ I ’ve decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights , ”
59860	59868	59870	59870	Ron	171	“ Yeah ... and you were hungry , ”
60116	60119	60120	60121	Professor Sprout	331	“ Bubotubers , ”
60126	60137	60120	60121	Professor Sprout	331	“ They need squeezing . You will collect the pus — ”
60138	60142	60144	60145	Seamus Finnigan	228	“ The what ? ”
60150	60157	60159	60160	Professor Sprout	331	“ Pus , Finnigan , pus , ”
60162	60209	60159	60160	Professor Sprout	331	“ and it ’s extremely valuable , so do n’t waste it . You will collect the pus , I say , in these bottles . Wear your dragon - hide gloves ; it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted , bubotuber pus . ”
60268	60276	60278	60279	Professor Sprout	331	“ This ’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy , ”
60289	60317	60278	60279	Professor Sprout	331	“ An excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne , bubotuber pus . Should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples . ”
60318	60324	60326	60327	Hannah Abbott	352	“ Like poor Eloise Midgen , ”
60337	60345	60326	60327	Hannah Abbott	352	“ She tried to curse hers off . ”
60346	60350	60352	60353	Professor Sprout	331	“ Silly girl , ”
60359	60372	60356	60356	her	331	“ But Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end . ”
60509	60513	60514	60514	Hagrid	181	“ Mornin ’ ! ”
60526	60546	60514	60514	Hagrid	181	“ Be’er wait fer the Slytherins , they won ’ want ter miss this — Blast - Ended Skrewts ! ”
60547	60551	60553	60553	Ron	171	“ Come again ? ”
60562	60565	60567	60568	Lavender Brown	354	“ Eurgh ! ”

60704	60726	60701	60701	Hagrid	181	“ so yeh’ll be able ter raise ’em yerselves ! Thought we ’d make a bit of a project of it ! ”
60727	60737	60764	60764	Hagrid	181	“ And why would we want to raise them ? ”
60771	60780	60782	60782	Malfoy	257	“ I mean , what do they do ? ”
60784	60792	60782	60782	Malfoy	257	“ What is the point of them ? ”
60815	60887	60811	60811	he	181	“ Tha ’s next lesson , Malfoy . Yer jus ’ feedin ’ ’em today . Now , yeh’ll wan ’ ter try ’em on a few diff’rent things — I ’ve never had ’em before , not sure what they ’ll go fer — I got ant eggs an ’ frog livers an ’ a bit o ’ grass snake — just try ’em out with a bit of each . ”
60888	60895	60897	60897	Seamus	228	“ First pus and now this , ”
60959	60962	60964	60965	Dean Thomas	148	“ Ouch ! ”
60971	60976	60964	60965	Dean Thomas	148	“ It got me ! ”
60986	60991	60993	60993	Dean	148	“ Its end exploded ! ”
61004	61017	61019	61019	Hagrid	181	“ Ah , yeah , that can happen when they blast off , ”
61023	61026	61028	61029	Lavender Brown	354	“ Eurgh ! ”
61032	61045	61028	61029	Lavender Brown	354	“ Eurgh , Hagrid , what ’s that pointy thing on it ? ”
61046	61056	61058	61058	Hagrid	181	“ Ah , some of ’em have got stings , ”
61071	61098	61058	61058	Hagrid	181	“ I reckon they ’re the males ... The females’ve got sorta sucker things on their bellies ... I think they might be ter suck blood . ”
61099	61115	61117	61117	Malfoy	257	“ Well , I can certainly see why we ’re trying to keep them alive , ”
61120	61138	61117	61117	Malfoy	257	“ Who would n’t want pets that can burn , sting , and bite all at once ? ”
61139	61157	61158	61158	Hermione	169	“ Just because they ’re not very pretty , it does n’t mean they ’re not useful , ”
61161	61182	61158	61158	Hermione	169	“ Dragon blood ’s amazingly magical , but you would n’t want a dragon for a pet , would you ? ”
61261	61271	61273	61273	Ron	171	“ Well , at least the skrewts are small , ”
61290	61295	61297	61297	Hermione	169	“ They are now , ”
61303	61323	61297	61297	Hermione	169	“ but once Hagrid ’s found out what they eat , I expect they ’ll be six feet long . ”
61324	61344	61346	61346	Ron	171	“ Well , that wo n’t matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something , will it ? ”
61353	61367	61369	61369	Hermione	169	“ You know perfectly well I only said that to shut Malfoy up , ”
61371	61404	61369	61369	Hermione	169	“ As a matter of fact I think he ’s right . The best thing to do would be to stamp on the lot of them before they start attacking us all . ”
61435	61447	61449	61449	Ron	171	“ Er — is this the new stand on elf rights ? ”
61451	61461	61449	61449	Ron	171	“ You ’re going to make yourself puke instead ? ”
61462	61465	61474	61474	she	169	“ No , ”
61484	61494	61474	61474	she	169	“ I just want to get to the library . ”
61495	61498	61500	61500	Ron	171	“ What ? ”
61504	61522	61500	61500	Ron	171	“ Hermione — it ’s the first day back ! We have n’t even got homework yet ! ”
61550	61556	61542	61542	she	169	“ See you at dinner ! ”
61697	61701	61707	61708	Professor Trelawney	306	“ Good day , ”
61774	61782	61783	61783	she	1903	“ You are preoccupied , my dear , ”
61789	61848	61783	61783	she	1903	“ My inner eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within . And I regret to say that your worries are not baseless . I see difficult times ahead for you , alas ... most difficult ... I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass ... and perhaps sooner than you think ... ”
61911	61925	61926	61926	she	1903	“ My dears , it is time for us to consider the stars , ”
61980	61995	61973	61973	she	1903	“ ‘ I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass ... ’ ”
62119	62122	62123	62123	Ron	171	“ Harry ! ”
62126	62129	62123	62123	Ron	171	“ What ? ”
62162	62182	62184	62185	Professor Trelawney	306	“ I was saying , my dear , that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn , ”
62209	62217	62219	62219	Harry	158	“ Born under — what , sorry ? ”
62221	62230	62232	62233	Professor Trelawney	306	“ Saturn , dear , the planet Saturn ! ”
62247	62303	62239	62239	he	158	“ I was saying that Saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your birth ... Your dark hair ... your mean stature ... tragic losses so young in life ... I think I am right in saying , my dear , that you were born in midwinter ? ”
62304	62307	62309	62309	Harry	158	“ No , ”
62311	62318	62309	62309	Harry	158	“ I was born in July . ”
62377	62385	62387	62387	Harry	158	“ I ’ve got two Neptunes here , ”
62400	62410	62387	62387	Harry	158	“ that ca n’t be right , can it ? ”
62411	62414	62416	62416	Ron	171	“ Aaaaah , ”
62425	62450	62416	62416	Ron	171	“ when two Neptunes appear in the sky , it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born , Harry ... ”
62476	62500	62473	62474	Lavender Brown	354	“ Oh Professor , look ! I think I ’ve got an unaspected planet ! Oooh , which one ’s that , Professor ? ”
62501	62509	62511	62512	Professor Trelawney	306	“ It is Uranus , my dear , ”
62520	62532	62534	62534	Ron	171	“ Can I have a look at Uranus too , Lavender ? ”
62566	62591	62592	62592	she	306	“ A detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you , with reference to your personal chart , ”
62609	62624	62592	62592	she	306	“ I want it ready to hand in next Monday , and no excuses ! ”
62625	62630	62632	62632	Ron	171	“ Miserable old bat , ”
62650	62660	62632	62632	Ron	171	“ That ’ll take all weekend , that will ... ”
62661	62666	62668	62668	Hermione	169	“ Lots of homework ? ”
62676	62687	62668	62668	Hermione	169	“ Professor Vector did n’t give us any at all ! ”
62688	62696	62698	62698	Ron	171	“ Well , bully for Professor Vector , ”
62735	62742	62748	62748	Hermione	169	“ Weasley ! Hey , Weasley ! ”
62768	62771	62773	62773	Ron	171	“ What ? ”
62776	62786	62788	62788	Malfoy	257	“ Your dad ’s in the paper , Weasley ! ”
62813	62819	62788	62788	Malfoy	257	“ Listen to this ! . ”
62824	62851	62852	62852	he	257	“ Imagine them not even getting his name right , Weasley . It ’s almost as though he ’s a complete nonentity , is n’t it ? ”
62855	62864	62866	62866	Malfoy	257	“ And there ’s a picture , Weasley ! ”
62877	62910	62866	62866	Malfoy	257	“ A picture of your parents outside their house — if you can call it a house ! Your mother could do with losing a bit of weight , could n’t she ? ”
62923	62929	62931	62931	Harry	158	“ Get stuffed , Malfoy , ”
62933	62939	62931	62931	Harry	158	“ C’m on , Ron ... ”
62940	62958	62960	62960	Malfoy	257	“ Oh yeah , you were staying with them this summer , were n’t you , Potter ? ”
62962	62981	62960	62960	Malfoy	257	“ So tell me , is his mother really that porky , or is it just the picture ? ”
62982	62990	62992	62992	Harry	158	“ You know your mother , Malfoy ? ”
63015	63048	63011	63011	himself	158	“ that expression she ’s got , like she ’s got dung under her nose ? Has she always looked like that , or was it just because you were with her ? ”
63057	63068	63011	63011	himself	158	“ Do n’t you dare insult my mother , Potter . ”
63069	63078	63080	63080	Harry	158	“ Keep your fat mouth shut , then , ”
63140	63148	63149	63149	Harry	158	“ OH NO YOU DON’T , LADDIE ! ”
63242	63248	63249	63249	Moody	346	“ Did he get you ? ”
63259	63262	63264	63264	Harry	158	“ No , ”
63266	63269	63264	63264	Harry	158	“ missed . ”
63270	63274	63275	63275	Moody	346	“ LEAVE IT ! ”
63278	63283	63284	63284	Harry	158	“ Leave — what ? ”
63289	63295	63296	63296	Moody	346	“ Not you — him ! ”
63368	63375	63377	63377	Moody	346	“ I do n’t think so ! ”
63410	63426	63428	63428	Moody	346	“ I do n’t like people who attack when their opponent ’s back ’s turned , ”
63441	63451	63428	63428	Moody	346	“ Stinking , cowardly , scummy thing to do ... ”
63466	63475	63477	63477	Moody	346	“ Never — do — that — again — ”
63494	63498	63549	63549	her	320	“ Professor Moody ! ”
63519	63525	63527	63527	Moody	346	“ Hello , Professor McGonagall , ”
63536	63544	63546	63547	Professor McGonagall	320	“ What — what are you doing ? ”
63561	63564	63566	63566	Moody	346	“ Teaching , ”
63568	63578	63580	63581	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Teach — Moody , is that a student ? ”
63591	63594	63596	63596	Moody	346	“ Yep , ”
63598	63601	63603	63604	Professor McGonagall	320	“ No ! ”
63659	63670	63672	63673	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Moody , we never use Transfiguration as a punishment ! ”
63676	63684	63672	63673	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Surely Professor Dumbledore told you that ? ”
63685	63694	63696	63696	Moody	346	“ He might ’ve mentioned it , yeah , ”
63703	63712	63696	63696	Moody	346	“ but I thought a good sharp shock — ”
63713	63730	63672	63673	Professor McGonagall	320	“ We give detentions , Moody ! Or speak to the offender ’s Head of House ! ”
63731	63739	63741	63741	Moody	346	“ I ’ll do that , then , ”
63775	63778	63672	63673	Professor McGonagall	320	“ my father ”
63782	63786	63788	63788	Moody	346	“ Oh yeah ? ”
63809	63853	63801	63801	his	346	“ Well , I know your father of old , boy ... You tell him Moody ’s keeping a close eye on his son ... you tell him that from me ... Now , your Head of House’ll be Snape , will it ? ”
63854	63857	63859	63859	Malfoy	257	“ Yes , ”
63862	63867	63869	63869	Moody	346	“ Another old friend , ”
63871	63889	63869	63869	Moody	346	“ I ’ve been looking forward to a chat with old Snape ... Come on , you ... ”
63939	63946	63947	63947	Ron	171	“ Do n’t talk to me , ”
63980	63984	63986	63986	Hermione	169	“ Why not ? ”
63990	64002	64004	64004	Ron	171	“ Because I want to fix that in my memory forever , ”
64017	64026	64004	64004	Ron	171	“ Draco Malfoy , the amazing bouncing ferret ... ”
64045	64055	64056	64056	she	169	“ He could have really hurt Malfoy , though , ”
64059	64072	64056	64056	she	169	“ It was good , really , that Professor McGonagall stopped it — ”
64073	64076	64078	64078	Ron	171	“ Hermione ! ”
64087	64098	64078	64078	Ron	171	“ you ’re ruining the best moment of my life ! ”
64113	64128	64130	64130	Harry	158	“ Do n’t tell me you ’re going back to the library this evening ? ”
64135	64139	64141	64141	Hermione	169	“ Got to , ”
64144	64149	64141	64141	Hermione	169	“ Loads to do . ”
64150	64158	64141	64141	Hermione	169	“ But you told us Professor Vector — ”
64159	64165	64166	64166	she	169	“ It ’s not schoolwork , ”
64195	64198	64199	64199	he	1932	“ Moody ! ”
64202	64208	64199	64199	he	1932	“ How cool is he ? ”
64209	64213	64215	64215	George	176	“ Beyond cool , ”
64222	64225	64233	64234	Lee Jordan	349	“ Supercool , ”
64243	64250	64251	64251	he	349	“ We had him this afternoon , ”
64257	64263	64265	64265	Harry	158	“ What was it like ? ”
64344	64360	64362	64362	Ron	171	“ You know why Snape ’s in such a foul mood , do n’t you ? ”
64384	64387	64389	64389	Harry	158	“ Yeah , ”
64391	64394	64389	64389	Harry	158	“ Moody . ”
64492	64506	64507	64507	Harry	158	“ I reckon Snape ’s a bit scared of him , you know , ”
64511	64522	64524	64524	Ron	171	“ Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad , ”
64531	64540	64524	64524	Ron	171	“ and bounced him all around his dungeon ... ”
64592	64597	64633	64634	the teacher	1946	“ Been in the — ”
64598	64601	64602	64602	Harry	158	“ Library . ”
64609	64623	64602	64602	Harry	158	“ C’m on , quick , or we wo n’t get decent seats . ”
64702	64709	64710	64710	he	346	“ You can put those away , ”
64722	64732	64710	64710	he	346	“ those books . You wo n’t need them . ”
64799	64803	64804	64804	he	346	“ Right then , ”
64816	64863	64804	64804	he	346	“ I ’ve had a letter from Professor Lupin about this class . Seems you ’ve had a pretty thorough grounding in tackling Dark creatures — you ’ve covered boggarts , Red Caps , hinkypunks , grindylows , Kappas , and werewolves , is that right ? ”
64872	64886	64888	64888	Moody	346	“ But you ’re behind — very behind — on dealing with curses , ”
64890	64924	64888	64888	Moody	346	“ So I ’m here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other . I ’ve got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark — ”
64925	64933	64934	64934	Ron	171	“ What , are n’t you staying ? ”
65010	65021	65022	65022	Moody	346	“ You ’ll be Arthur Weasley ’s son , eh ? ”
65025	65067	65022	65022	Moody	346	“ Your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago ... Yeah , I ’m staying just the one year . Special favor to Dumbledore ... One year , and then back to my quiet retirement . ”
65082	65121	65077	65077	his	346	“ So — straight into it . Curses . They come in many strengths and forms . Now , according to the Ministry of Magic , I ’m supposed to teach you countercurses and leave it at that . ”
65161	65179	65195	65195	Moody	346	“ So ... do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by Wizarding law ? ”
65210	65213	65215	65215	Ron	171	“ Er , ”
65218	65236	65215	65215	Ron	171	“ my dad told me about one ... Is it called the Imperius Curse , or something ? ”
65237	65242	65244	65244	Moody	346	“ Ah , yes , ”
65247	65270	65244	65244	Moody	346	“ Your father would know that one . Gave the Ministry a lot of trouble at one time , the Imperius Curse . ”
65353	65356	65343	65343	He	346	“ Imperio ! ”
65446	65455	65456	65456	he	346	“ Think it ’s funny , do you ? ”
65459	65475	65456	65456	he	346	“ You ’d like it , would you , if I did it to you ? ”
65483	65487	65489	65489	Moody	346	“ Total control , ”
65505	65527	65489	65489	Moody	346	“ I could make it jump out of the window , drown itself , throw itself down one of your throats ... ”
65534	65553	65555	65555	Moody	346	“ Years back , there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the Imperius Curse , ”
65575	65646	65647	65647	he	346	“ Some job for the Ministry , trying to sort out who was being forced to act , and who was acting of their own free will . The Imperius Curse can be fought , and I ’ll be teaching you how , but it takes real strength of character , and not everyone ’s got it . Better avoid being hit with it if you can . CONSTANT VIGILANCE ! ”
65668	65678	65654	65654	Moody	346	“ Anyone else know one ? Another illegal curse ? ”
65727	65730	65732	65732	Moody	346	“ Yes ? ”
65745	65754	65756	65756	Neville	315	“ There ’s one — the Cruciatus Curse , ”
65778	65784	65785	65785	he	346	“ Your name ’s Longbottom ? ”
65845	65850	65852	65852	Moody	346	“ The Cruciatus Curse , ”
65854	65868	65869	65869	he	346	“ Needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea , ”
65879	65882	65869	65869	he	346	“ Engorgio ! ”
65930	65933	65915	65915	Moody	346	“ Crucio ! ”
66004	66008	66009	66009	Hermione	169	“ Stop it ! ”
66081	66084	66085	66085	Moody	346	“ Reducio , ”
66106	66109	66111	66111	Moody	346	“ Pain , ”
66114	66148	66111	66111	Moody	346	“ You do n’t need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse ... That one was very popular once too . Right ... anyone know any others ? ”
66196	66199	66201	66201	Moody	346	“ Yes ? ”
66207	66211	66212	66212	Hermione	169	“ Avada Kedavra , ”
66226	66229	66231	66231	Moody	346	“ Ah , ”
66241	66256	66237	66237	his	346	“ Yes , the last and worst . Avada Kedavra ... the Killing Curse . ”
66331	66335	66336	66336	Moody	346	“ Avada Kedavra ! ”
66417	66421	66422	66422	he	346	“ Not nice , ”
66426	66461	66422	66422	he	346	“ Not pleasant . And there ’s no countercurse . There ’s no blocking it . Only one known person has ever survived it , and he ’s sitting right in front of me . ”
66844	66851	66834	66835	Most people	1980	“ Did you see it twitch ? ”
66852	66864	66865	66865	They	911	“ — and when he killed it — just like that ! ”
66904	66908	66909	66909	she	169	“ Hurry up , ”
66917	66924	66926	66926	Ron	171	“ Not the ruddy library again ? ”
66928	66931	66933	66933	Hermione	169	“ No , ”
66942	66945	66933	66933	Hermione	169	“ Neville . ”
66983	66986	66987	66987	Hermione	169	“ Neville ? ”
66995	66999	67000	67000	he	315	“ Oh hello , ”
67010	67036	67000	67000	he	315	“ Interesting lesson , was n’t it ? I wonder what ’s for dinner , I ’m — I ’m starving , are n’t you ? ”
67037	67045	67047	67047	Hermione	169	“ Neville , are you all right ? ”
67049	67057	67058	67058	Neville	315	“ Oh yes , I ’m fine , ”
67067	67081	67058	67058	Neville	315	“ Very interesting dinner — I mean lesson — what ’s for eating ? ”
67089	67095	67082	67082	Ron	171	“ Neville , what — ? ”
67147	67155	67156	67156	he	346	“ It ’s all right , sonny , ”
67161	67183	67156	67156	he	346	“ Why do n’t you come up to my office ? Come on ... we can have a cup of tea ... ”
67211	67221	67203	67203	Moody	346	“ You all right , are you , Potter ? ”
67222	67225	67227	67227	Harry	158	“ Yes , ”
67250	67291	67247	67247	he	346	“ You ’ve got to know . It seems harsh , maybe , but you ’ve got to know . No point pretending ... well ... come on , Longbottom , I ’ve got some books that might interest you . ”
67334	67340	67342	67342	Ron	171	“ What was that about ? ”
67352	67358	67360	67360	Hermione	169	“ I do n’t know , ”
67365	67373	67375	67375	Ron	171	“ Some lesson , though , eh ? ”
67387	67428	67375	67375	Ron	171	“ Fred and George were right , were n’t they ? He really knows his stuff , Moody , does n’t he ? When he did Avada Kedavra , the way that spider just died , just snuffed it right — ”
67537	67558	67559	67559	Harry	158	“ Would n’t Moody and Dumbledore be in trouble with the Ministry if they knew we ’d seen the curses ? ”
67568	67573	67575	67575	Ron	171	“ Yeah , probably , ”
67577	67618	67575	67575	Ron	171	“ But Dumbledore ’s always done things his way , has n’t he , and Moody ’s been getting in trouble for years , I reckon . Attacks first and asks questions later — look at his dustbins . Balderdash . ”
67645	67655	67657	67657	Harry	158	“ Shall we get our Divination stuff , then ? ”
67659	67663	67664	67664	Ron	171	“ I s’pose , ”
67720	67727	67728	67728	Harry	158	“ You all right , Neville ? ”
67732	67736	67738	67738	Neville	315	“ Oh yes , ”
67740	67756	67738	67738	Neville	315	“ I ’m fine , thanks . Just reading this book Professor Moody lent me ... ”
67770	67785	67786	67786	Neville	315	“ Apparently , Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I ’m really good at Herbology , ”
67807	67815	67797	67797	his	315	“ He thought I ’d like this . ”
67942	67957	67958	67958	he	158	“ I have n’t got a clue what this lot ’s supposed to mean , ”
67970	67974	67976	67976	Ron	171	“ You know , ”
67998	68010	67976	67976	Ron	171	“ I think it ’s back to the old Divination standby . ”
68011	68018	68053	68053	he	171	“ What — make it up ? ”
68019	68022	68024	68024	Ron	171	“ Yeah , ”
68048	68052	68053	68053	he	171	“ Next Monday , ”
68059	68078	68079	68079	He	171	“ I am likely to develop a cough , owing to the unlucky conjunction of Mars and Jupiter . ”
68085	68103	68079	68079	He	171	“ You know her — just put in loads of misery , she ’ll lap it up . ”
68104	68107	68109	68109	Harry	158	“ Right , ”
68133	68150	68109	68109	Harry	158	“ Okay ... on Monday , I will be in danger of — er — burns . ”
68151	68158	68160	68160	Ron	171	“ Yeah , you will be , ”
68163	68182	68160	68160	Ron	171	“ we ’re seeing the skrewts again on Monday . Okay , Tuesday , I ’ll ... erm ... ”
68183	68189	68191	68191	Harry	158	“ Lose a treasured possession , ”
68203	68207	68209	68209	Ron	171	“ Good one , ”
68215	68240	68209	68209	Ron	171	“ Because of ... erm ... Mercury . Why do n’t you get stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend ? ”
68241	68246	68248	68248	Harry	158	“ Yeah ... cool ... ”
68254	68264	68248	68248	Harry	158	“ because ... Venus is in the twelfth house . ”
68265	68281	68209	68209	Ron	171	“ And on Wednesday , I think I ’ll come off worst in a fight . ”
68282	68301	68248	68248	Harry	158	“ Aaah , I was going to have a fight . Okay , I ’ll lose a bet . ”
68302	68315	68209	68209	Ron	171	“ Yeah , you ’ll be betting I ’ll win my fight ... ”
68588	68604	68568	68568	his	2001	“ No — that sounds like we ’re accusing him . Got to be careful ... ”
68706	68709	68710	68710	she	169	“ Hello , ”
68713	68719	68710	68710	she	169	“ I ’ve just finished ! ”
68720	68725	68727	68727	Ron	171	“ So have I ! ”
68758	68771	68772	68772	she	169	“ Not going to have a very good month , are you ? ”
68783	68793	68794	68794	Ron	171	“ Ah well , at least I ’m forewarned , ”
68797	68805	68807	68807	Hermione	169	“ You seem to be drowning twice , ”
68809	68814	68816	68816	Ron	171	“ Oh am I ? ”
68824	68840	68842	68842	Hermione	169	“ Do n’t you think it ’s a bit obvious you ’ve made these up ? ”
68844	68849	68851	68851	Ron	171	“ How dare you ! ”
68862	68869	68871	68871	Ron	171	“ It ’s just an expression , ”
68891	68898	68899	68899	he	158	“ What ’s in the box ? ”
68906	68912	68914	68914	Hermione	169	“ Funny you should ask , ”
68953	68958	68960	68960	Harry	158	“ ‘ Spew ’ ? ”
68971	68975	68977	68977	Hermione	169	“ Not spew , ”
68980	68986	68988	68988	Ron	171	“ Never heard of it , ”
68990	68999	69001	69001	Hermione	169	“ Well , of course you have n’t , ”
69004	69012	69001	69001	Hermione	169	“ I ’ve only just started it . ”
69013	69016	69018	69018	Ron	171	“ Yeah ? ”
69023	69031	69018	69018	Ron	171	“ How many members have you got ? ”
69032	69042	69044	69044	Hermione	169	“ Well — if you two join — three , ”
69046	69065	69067	69067	Ron	171	“ And you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying ‘ spew , ’ do you ? ”
69069	69078	69080	69080	Hermione	169	“ S - P - E - W ! ”
69083	69123	69080	69080	Hermione	169	“ I was going to put Stop the Outrageous Abuse of Our Fellow Magical Creatures and Campaign for a Change in Their Legal Status — but it would n’t fit . So that ’s the heading of our manifesto . ”
69133	69164	69124	69124	She	169	“ I ’ve been researching it thoroughly in the library . Elf enslavement goes back centuries . I ca n’t believe no one ’s done anything about it before now . ”
69165	69172	69174	69174	Ron	171	“ Hermione — open your ears , ”
69177	69189	69174	69174	Ron	171	“ They . Like . It . They like being enslaved ! ”
69190	69197	69199	69199	Hermione	169	“ Our short - term aims , ”
69219	69271	69212	69212	she	169	“ are to secure house - elves fair wages and working conditions . Our long - term aims include changing the law about non - wand use , and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures , because they ’re shockingly underrepresented . ”
69272	69281	69282	69282	Harry	158	“ And how do we do all this ? ”
69285	69292	69294	69294	Hermione	169	“ We start by recruiting members , ”
69297	69362	69294	69294	Hermione	169	“ I thought two Sickles to join — that buys a badge — and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign . You ’re treasurer , Ron — I ’ve got you a collecting tin upstairs — and Harry , you ’re secretary , so you might want to write down everything I ’m saying now , as a record of our first meeting . ”
69452	69455	69456	69456	he	158	“ Hedwig ! ”
69498	69502	69504	69504	Harry	158	“ About time ! ”
69510	69517	69519	69519	Ron	171	“ She ’s got an answer ! ”
69555	69561	69562	69562	Hermione	169	“ What does it say ? ”
69604	69610	69611	69611	Hermione	169	“ He ’s flying north ? ”
69614	69620	69611	69611	Hermione	169	“ He ’s coming back ? ”
69621	69628	69630	69630	Ron	171	“ Dumbledore ’s reading what signs ? ”
69635	69642	69630	69630	Ron	171	“ Harry — what ’s up ? ”
69663	69671	69672	69672	Harry	158	“ I should n’t ’ve told him ! ”
69676	69683	69685	69685	Ron	171	“ What are you on about ? ”
69689	69702	69704	69704	Harry	158	“ It ’s made him think he ’s got to come back ! ”
69728	69757	69758	69758	Harry	158	“ Coming back , because he thinks I ’m in trouble ! And there ’s nothing wrong with me ! And I have n’t got anything for you , ”
69770	69785	69766	69766	her	163	“ you ’ll have to go up to the Owlery if you want food . ”
69814	69817	69818	69818	Hermione	169	“ Harry , ”
69828	69835	69837	69837	Harry	158	“ I ’m going to bed , ”
69840	69847	69837	69837	Harry	158	“ See you in the morning . ”
70336	70344	70345	70345	Harry	158	“ Just find him , all right ? ”
70367	70373	70345	70345	Harry	158	“ Before the dementors do . ”
70450	70458	70460	70460	Hermione	169	“ That was a lie , Harry , ”
70476	70489	70460	70460	Hermione	169	“ You did n’t imagine your scar hurting and you know it . ”
70490	70494	70496	70496	Harry	158	“ So what ? ”
70498	70510	70496	70496	Harry	158	“ He ’s not going back to Azkaban because of me . ”
70511	70515	70517	70517	Ron	171	“ Drop it , ”
70708	70720	70722	70722	Hermione	169	“ But — but you said it ’s illegal , Professor , ”
70749	70761	70734	70734	his	346	“ You said — to use it against another human was — ”
70762	70772	70774	70774	Moody	346	“ Dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like , ”
70792	70828	70776	70776	his	346	“ If you ’d rather learn the hard way — when someone ’s putting it on you so they can control you completely — fine by me . You ’re excused . Off you go . ”
70979	70982	70983	70983	Moody	346	“ Potter , ”
70986	70990	70983	70983	Moody	346	“ you next . ”
71024	71027	71011	71011	Moody	346	“ Imperio ! ”
71239	71248	71250	71250	Moody	346	“ Now , that ’s more like it ! ”
71286	71352	71269	71269	He	158	“ Look at that , you lot ... Potter fought ! He fought it , and he damn near beat it ! We ’ll try that again , Potter , and the rest of you , pay attention — watch his eyes , that ’s where you see it — very good , Potter , very good indeed ! They ’ll have trouble controlling you ! ”
71353	71359	71360	71360	Harry	158	“ The way he talks , ”
71403	71417	71378	71378	Moody	346	“ you ’d think we were all going to be attacked any second . ”
71418	71424	71426	71426	Ron	171	“ Yeah , I know , ”
71460	71465	71466	71466	Ron	171	“ Talk about paranoid ... ”
71485	71547	71475	71475	Moody	346	“ No wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the Ministry . Did you hear him telling Seamus what he did to that witch who shouted ‘ Boo ’ behind him on April Fools ’ Day ? And when are we supposed to read up on resisting the Imperius Curse with everything else we ’ve got to do ? ”
71593	71607	71608	71608	she	320	“ You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education ! ”
71621	71630	71608	71608	she	320	“ Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer — ”
71631	71641	71643	71644	Dean Thomas	148	“ We do n’t take O.W.L.s till fifth year ! ”
71647	71710	71608	71608	she	320	“ Maybe not , Thomas , but believe me , you need all the preparation you can get ! Miss Granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion . I might remind you that your pincushion , Thomas , still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin ! ”
71931	71934	71922	71922	Hagrid	181	“ project , ”
71958	71963	71965	71966	Draco Malfoy	257	“ I will not , ”
71990	72003	71977	71978	Father Christmas	204	“ I see enough of these foul things during lessons , thanks . ”
72012	72020	72021	72021	he	181	“ Yeh’ll do wha ’ yer told , ”
72024	72049	72021	72021	he	181	“ or I ’ll be takin ’ a leaf outta Professor Moody ’s book ... I hear yeh made a good ferret , Malfoy . ”
72196	72199	72201	72201	Harry	158	“ Brilliant ! ”
72203	72222	72201	72201	Harry	158	“ It ’s Potions last thing on Friday ! Snape wo n’t have time to poison us all ! ”
72223	72229	72231	72231	Ernie	232	“ Only a week away ! ”
72245	72260	72234	72234	Hufflepuff	232	“ I wonder if Cedric knows ? Think I ’ll go and tell him ... ”
72261	72264	72266	72266	Ron	171	“ Cedric ? ”
72273	72276	72278	72278	Harry	158	“ Diggory , ”
72280	72288	72278	72278	Harry	158	“ He must be entering the tournament . ”
72289	72296	72298	72298	Ron	171	“ That idiot , Hogwarts champion ? ”
72312	72332	72334	72334	Hermione	169	“ He ’s not an idiot . You just do n’t like him because he beat Gryffindor at Quidditch , ”
72336	72353	72334	72334	Hermione	169	“ I ’ve heard he ’s a really good student — and he ’s a prefect . ”
72363	72373	72375	72375	Ron	171	“ You only like him because he ’s handsome , ”
72378	72393	72395	72395	Hermione	169	“ Excuse me , I do n’t like people just because they ’re handsome ! ”
72409	72412	72398	72398	Ron	171	“ Lockhart ! ”
72600	72624	72625	72626	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Longbottom , kindly do not reveal that you ca n’t even perform a simple Switching Spell in front of anyone from Durmstrang ! ”
72802	72811	72812	72812	George	176	“ It ’s a bummer , all right , ”
72819	72858	72812	72812	George	176	“ But if he wo n’t talk to us in person , we ’ll have to send him the letter after all . Or we ’ll stuff it into his hand . He ca n’t avoid us forever . ”
72859	72865	72867	72867	Ron	171	“ Who ’s avoiding you ? ”
72875	72880	72882	72882	Fred	175	“ Wish you would , ”
72890	72896	72897	72897	Ron	171	“ What ’s a bummer ? ”
72901	72912	72914	72914	George	176	“ Having a nosy git like you for a brother , ”
72916	72928	72929	72929	Harry	158	“ You two got any ideas on the Triwizard Tournament yet ? ”
72932	72941	72929	72929	Harry	158	“ Thought any more about trying to enter ? ”
72942	72957	72959	72959	George	176	“ I asked McGonagall how the champions are chosen but she was n’t telling , ”
72962	72978	72959	72959	George	176	“ She just told me to shut up and get on with Transfiguring my raccoon . ”
72979	72989	72991	72991	Ron	171	“ Wonder what the tasks are going to be ? ”
72994	73014	72991	72991	Ron	171	“ You know , I bet we could do them , Harry . We ’ve done dangerous stuff before ... ”
73015	73029	73031	73031	Fred	175	“ Not in front of a panel of judges , you have n’t , ”
73033	73051	73031	73031	Fred	175	“ McGonagall says the champions get awarded points according to how well they ’ve done the tasks . ”
73052	73058	73059	73059	Harry	158	“ Who are the judges ? ”
73062	73077	73079	73079	Hermione	169	“ Well , the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel , ”
73091	73120	73086	73086	her	169	“ because all three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792 , when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage . ”
73148	73202	73132	73132	her	169	“ It ’s all in Hogwarts : A History . Though , of course , that book ’s not entirely reliable . A Revised History of Hogwarts would be a more accurate title . Or A Highly Biased and Selective History of Hogwarts , Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School . ”
73203	73210	73212	73212	Ron	171	“ What are you on about ? ”
73223	73228	73232	73232	her	169	“ House - elves ! ”
73236	73265	73232	73232	her	169	“ Not once , in over a thousand pages , does Hogwarts : A History mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slaves ! ”
73398	73432	73433	73433	she	169	“ You do realize that your sheets are changed , your fires lit , your classrooms cleaned , and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid and enslaved ? ”
73536	73550	73527	73527	George	176	“ Listen , have you ever been down in the kitchens , Hermione ? ”
73551	73558	73560	73560	Hermione	169	“ No , of course not , ”
73563	73572	73560	73560	Hermione	169	“ I hardly think students are supposed to — ”
73573	73579	73581	73581	George	176	“ Well , we have , ”
73586	73618	73581	73581	George	176	“ loads of times , to nick food . And we ’ve met them , and they ’re happy . They think they ’ve got the best job in the world — ”
73619	73629	73630	73630	Hermione	169	“ That ’s because they ’re uneducated and brainwashed ! ”
73753	73762	73763	73763	Ron	171	“ Why d’you have to keep changing owls ? ”
73770	73777	73779	73779	Hermione	169	“ Hedwig’ll attract too much attention , ”
73783	73812	73779	73779	Hermione	169	“ She stands out . A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he ’s hiding ... I mean , they ’re not native birds , are they ? ”
73884	73889	73890	73890	he	158	“ Thanks , Hedwig , ”
74034	74041	74042	74043	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Weasley , straighten your hat , ”
74048	74061	74042	74043	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Miss Patil , take that ridiculous thing out of your hair . ”
74077	74083	74085	74086	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Follow me , please , ”
74088	74097	74085	74086	Professor McGonagall	320	“ First years in front ... no pushing ... ”
74167	74171	74173	74173	Ron	171	“ Nearly six , ”
74191	74202	74173	74173	Ron	171	“ How d’you reckon they ’re coming ? The train ? ”
74203	74208	74210	74210	Hermione	169	“ I doubt it , ”
74212	74219	74220	74220	Harry	158	“ How , then ? Broomsticks ? ”
74230	74243	74173	74173	Ron	171	“ I do n’t think so ... not from that far away ... ”
74244	74248	74249	74249	Ron	171	“ A Portkey ? ”
74252	74272	74249	74249	Ron	171	“ Or they could Apparate — maybe you ’re allowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come from ? ”
74273	74292	74294	74294	Hermione	169	“ You ca n’t Apparate inside the Hogwarts grounds , how often do I have to tell you ? ”
74361	74377	74347	74348	Mr. Weasley	173	“ always the same — we ca n’t resist showing off when we get together ... ”
74395	74411	74388	74388	he	170	“ Aha ! Unless I am very much mistaken , the delegation from Beauxbatons approaches ! ”
74412	74415	74417	74418	many students	2111	“ Where ? ”
74427	74430	74432	74439	a sixth year , pointing over the forest	2112	“ There ! ”
74475	74481	74490	74490	her	2115	“ It ’s a dragon ! ”
74494	74506	74508	74509	Dennis Creevey	327	“ Do n’t be stupid ... it ’s a flying house ! ”
75033	75039	75040	75040	he	170	“ My dear Madame Maxime , ”
75043	75048	75040	75040	he	170	“ Welcome to Hogwarts . ”
75049	75054	75056	75057	Madame Maxime	293	“ Dumbly - dorr , ”
75063	75072	75056	75057	Madame Maxime	293	“ I ’ ope I find you well ? ”
75073	75082	75084	75084	Dumbledore	170	“ In excellent form , I thank you , ”
75086	75090	75092	75093	Madame Maxime	293	“ My pupils , ”
75224	75231	75232	75233	Madame Maxime	293	“ ’ As Karkaroff arrived yet ? ”
75236	75244	75246	75246	Dumbledore	170	“ He should be here any moment , ”
75248	75271	75246	75246	Dumbledore	170	“ Would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle ? ”
75272	75279	75281	75282	Madame Maxime	293	“ Warm up , I think , ”
75284	75290	75281	75282	Madame Maxime	293	“ But ze ’ orses — ”
75291	75307	75309	75309	Dumbledore	170	“ Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them , ”
75311	75336	75309	75309	Dumbledore	170	“ the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other — er — charges . ”
75337	75340	75341	75341	Ron	171	“ Skrewts , ”
75348	75359	75361	75362	Madame Maxime	293	“ My steeds require — er — forceful ’ andling , ”
75385	75391	75367	75367	she	293	“ Zey are very strong ... ”
75392	75406	75408	75408	Dumbledore	170	“ I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job , ”
75412	75416	75418	75419	Madame Maxime	293	“ Very well , ”
75424	75443	75418	75419	Madame Maxime	293	“ Will you please inform zis ’ Agrid zat ze ’ orses drink only single - malt whiskey ? ”
75444	75451	75453	75453	Dumbledore	170	“ It will be attended to , ”
75458	75461	75463	75464	Madame Maxime	293	“ Come , ”
75488	75501	75502	75503	Seamus Finnigan	228	“ How big d’you reckon Durmstrang ’s horses are going to be ? ”
75517	75539	75541	75541	Harry	158	“ Well , if they ’re any bigger than this lot , even Hagrid wo n’t be able to handle them , ”
75543	75563	75541	75541	Harry	158	“ That ’s if he has n’t been attacked by his skrewts . Wonder what ’s up with them ? ”
75564	75570	75572	75572	Ron	171	“ Maybe they ’ve escaped , ”
75575	75582	75584	75584	Hermione	169	“ Oh do n’t say that , ”
75589	75598	75584	75584	Hermione	169	“ Imagine that lot loose on the grounds ... ”
75647	75653	75655	75655	Ron	171	“ Can you hear something ? ”
75696	75700	75702	75703	Lee Jordan	349	“ The lake ! ”
75710	75716	75702	75703	Lee Jordan	349	“ Look at the lake ! ”
75842	75848	75849	75849	he	158	“ It ’s a mast ! ”
76073	76076	76077	76077	he	2168	“ Dumbledore ! ”
76087	76100	76077	76077	he	2168	“ How are you , my dear fellow , how are you ? ”
76101	76110	76111	76111	Dumbledore	170	“ Blooming , thank you , Professor Karkaroff , ”
76187	76192	76193	76193	he	376	“ Dear old Hogwarts , ”
76229	76264	76214	76214	his	376	“ How good it is to be here , how good ... Viktor , come along , into the warmth ... you do n’t mind , Dumbledore ? Viktor has a slight head cold ... ”
76317	76330	76331	76331	Ron	171	“ Harry — it ’s Krum ! I do n’t believe it ! ”
76354	76362	76331	76331	Ron	171	“ Krum , Harry ! Viktor Krum ! ”
76363	76378	76380	76380	Hermione	169	“ For heaven ’s sake , Ron , he ’s only a Quidditch player , ”
76382	76388	76389	76389	Ron	171	“ Only a Quidditch player ? ”
76404	76428	76389	76389	Ron	171	“ Hermione — he ’s one of the best Seekers in the world ! I had no idea he was still at school ! ”
76489	76507	76475	76479	Several sixth - year girls	2182	“ Oh I do n’t believe it , I have n’t got a single quill on me — ”
76508	76519	76475	76479	Several sixth - year girls	2182	“ D’you think he ’d sign my hat in lipstick ? ”
76520	76523	76524	76524	Hermione	169	“ Really , ”
76539	76549	76551	76551	Ron	171	“ I ’m getting his autograph if I can , ”
76553	76566	76551	76551	Ron	171	“ You have n’t got a quill , have you , Harry ? ”
76567	76577	76579	76579	Harry	158	“ Nope , they ’re upstairs in my bag , ”
76664	76671	76673	76673	Hermione	169	“ It ’s not that cold , ”
76676	76684	76673	76673	Hermione	169	“ Why did n’t they bring cloaks ? ”
76685	76695	76696	76696	Ron	171	“ Over here ! Come and sit over here ! ”
76699	76712	76696	76696	Ron	171	“ Over here ! Hermione , budge up , make a space — ”
76713	76716	76696	76696	Ron	171	“ What ? ”
76717	76721	76723	76723	Ron	171	“ Too late , ”
76768	76782	76784	76784	Ron	171	“ Yeah , that ’s right , smarm up to him , Malfoy , ”
76787	76848	76784	76784	Ron	171	“ I bet Krum can see right through him , though ... bet he gets people fawning over him all the time ... Where d’you reckon they ’re going to sleep ? We could offer him a space in our dormitory , Harry ... I would n’t mind giving him my bed , I could kip on a camp bed . ”
76852	76863	76865	76865	Harry	158	“ They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot , ”
76955	76964	76965	76965	Harry	158	“ But there are only two extra people , ”
76968	76982	76965	76965	Harry	158	“ Why ’s Filch putting out four chairs , who else is coming ? ”
76983	76986	76988	76988	Ron	171	“ Eh ? ”
77108	77124	77126	77126	Dumbledore	170	“ Good evening , ladies and gentlemen , ghosts and — most particularly — guests , ”
77135	77162	77126	77126	Dumbledore	170	“ I have great pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts . I hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable . ”
77183	77191	77192	77192	Hermione	169	“ No one ’s making you stay ! ”
77199	77213	77215	77215	Dumbledore	170	“ The tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast , ”
77217	77234	77215	77215	Dumbledore	170	“ I now invite you all to eat , drink , and make yourselves at home ! ”
77305	77310	77312	77312	Ron	171	“ What ’s that ? ”
77337	77340	77342	77342	Hermione	169	“ Bouillabaisse , ”
77344	77348	77350	77350	Ron	171	“ Bless you , ”
77352	77357	77359	77359	Hermione	169	“ It ’s French , ”
77361	77376	77359	77359	Hermione	169	“ I had it on holiday summer before last . It ’s very nice . ”
77377	77386	77388	77388	Ron	171	“ I ’ll take your word for it , ”
77504	77512	77513	77513	Harry	158	“ Skrewts doing all right , Hagrid ? ”
77516	77520	77521	77521	Hagrid	181	“ Thrivin ’ , ”
77526	77536	77538	77538	Ron	171	“ Yeah , I ’ll just bet they are , ”
77541	77561	77538	77538	Ron	171	“ Looks like they ’ve finally found a food they like , does n’t it ? Hagrid ’s fingers . ”
77570	77580	77595	77595	She	2212	“ Excuse me , are you wanting ze bouillabaisse ? ”
77657	77663	77665	77665	Harry	158	“ Yeah , have it , ”
77674	77682	77665	77665	Harry	158	“ You ’ ave finished wiz it ? ”
77683	77686	77687	77687	Ron	171	“ Yeah , ”
77691	77698	77687	77687	Ron	171	“ Yeah , it was excellent . ”
77747	77753	77754	77754	he	171	“ She ’s a veela ! ”
77760	77767	77769	77769	Hermione	169	“ Of course she is n’t ! ”
77772	77786	77769	77769	Hermione	169	“ I do n’t see anyone else gaping at her like an idiot ! ”
77824	77837	77839	77839	Ron	171	“ I ’m telling you , that ’s not a normal girl ! ”
77853	77864	77844	77844	he	171	“ They do n’t make them like that at Hogwarts ! ”
77865	77873	77875	77875	Harry	158	“ They make them okay at Hogwarts , ”
77897	77908	77910	77910	Hermione	169	“ When you ’ve both put your eyes back in , ”
77913	77925	77910	77910	Hermione	169	“ you ’ll be able to see who ’s just arrived . ”
77971	77978	77980	77980	Harry	158	“ What are they doing here ? ”
77984	77995	77997	77997	Hermione	169	“ They organized the Triwizard Tournament , did n’t they ? ”
77999	78012	77997	77997	Hermione	169	“ I suppose they wanted to be here to see it start . ”
78143	78149	78151	78151	Dumbledore	170	“ The moment has come , ”
78162	78188	78151	78151	Dumbledore	170	“ The Triwizard Tournament is about to start . I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket — ”
78189	78193	78194	78194	Harry	158	“ The what ? ”
78200	78242	78151	78151	Dumbledore	170	“ — just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year . But first , let me introduce , for those who do not know them , Mr. Bartemius Crouch , Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation ”
78252	78268	78151	78151	Dumbledore	170	“ and Mr. Ludo Bagman , Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports . ”
78367	78389	78390	78390	Dumbledore	170	“ Mr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the Triwizard Tournament , ”
78393	78418	78390	78390	Dumbledore	170	“ and they will be joining myself , Professor Karkaroff , and Madame Maxime on the panel that will judge the champions ’ efforts . ”
78425	78428	78451	78451	he	170	“ champions , ”
78454	78467	78448	78448	he	170	“ The casket , then , if you please , Mr. Filch . ”
78538	78561	78563	78563	Dumbledore	170	“ The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman , ”
78576	78635	78565	78565	Filch	378	“ and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge . There will be three tasks , spaced throughout the school year , and they will test the champions in many different ways ... their magical prowess — their daring — their powers of deduction — and , of course , their ability to cope with danger . ”
78657	78669	78670	78670	Dumbledore	170	“ As you know , three champions compete in the tournament , ”
78675	78729	78670	78670	Dumbledore	170	“ one from each of the participating schools . They will be marked on how well they perform each of the tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup . The champions will be chosen by an impartial selector : the Goblet of Fire . ”
78815	78842	78844	78844	Dumbledore	170	“ Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet , ”
78846	78851	78852	78853	Fred Weasley	175	“ An Age Line ! ”
78877	78917	78856	78856	his	2235	“ Well , that should be fooled by an Aging Potion , should n’t it ? And once your name ’s in that goblet , you ’re laughing — it ca n’t tell whether you ’re seventeen or not ! ”
78918	78932	78934	78934	Hermione	169	“ But I do n’t think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance , ”

79464	79490	79461	79461	Moody	296	“ And unless you ’ve got anything to say to Potter , Karkaroff , you might want to move . You ’re blocking the doorway . ”
79673	79681	79682	79682	Ron	171	“ Anyone put their name in yet ? ”

79713	79731	79733	79733	Harry	158	“ Bet some of them put it in last night after we ’d all gone to bed , ”
79735	79764	79733	79733	Harry	158	“ I would ’ve if it had been me ... would n’t have wanted everyone watching . What if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again ? ”
79794	79798	79799	79799	Fred	175	“ Done it , ”

She is already tending to Miss Fawcett , of Ravenclaw , and Mr. Summers , of Hufflepuff , both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too . Though I must say , neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours . ”
80366	80384	80385	80385	Dean	148	“ There ’s a rumor going around that Warrington got up early and put his name in , ”
80389	80401	80385	80385	Dean	148	“ That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth . ”
80417	80426	80412	80412	his	158	“ We ca n’t have a Slytherin champion ! ”
80427	80437	80439	80439	Seamus	228	“ And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory , ”
80442	80459	80439	80439	Seamus	228	“ But I would n’t have thought he ’d have wanted to risk his good looks . ”

80526	80540	80514	80514	Angelina	383	“ Well , I ’ve done it ! Just put my name in ! ”

80766	80783	80762	80762	she	169	“ Wait for me , will you , while I nip upstairs and get the badges ? ”
80784	80791	80793	80793	Ron	171	“ What is it with her ? ”

81663	81701	81661	81661	Hagrid	181	“ But it ’s gon na be spectacular , I ’ll tell yeh that . Them champions’re going ter have their work cut out . Never thought I ’d live ter see the Triwizard Tournament played again ! ”
81853	81864	81865	81865	he	181	“ It ’d be doin’ ’em an unkindness , Hermione , ”
81879	81922	81865	81865	he	181	“ It ’s in their nature ter look after humans , that ’s what they like , see ? Yeh’d be makin ’ ’em unhappy ter take away their work , an ’ insultin ’ ’em if yeh tried ter pay ’em . ”
81923	81939	81941	81941	Hermione	169	“ But Harry set Dobby free , and he was over the moon about it ! ”

81955	82001	81865	81865	he	181	“ Yeah , well , yeh get weirdos in every breed . I ’m not sayin ’ there is n’t the odd elf who ’d take freedom , but yeh’ll never persuade most of ’em ter do it — no , nothin’ doin’ , Hermione . ”
82063	82070	82072	82072	Hagrid	181	“ I ’ll come with yeh , ”

82487	82516	82484	82484	Ron	171	“ Well , if they end up having children , they ’ll be setting a world record — bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton . ”
82553	82561	82562	82562	Hermione	169	“ Ooh it ’s them , look ! ”
82686	82692	82694	82694	Fred	175	“ Hope it ’s Angelina , ”

82900	82913	82915	82915	Dumbledore	170	“ Well , the goblet is almost ready to make its decision , ”
82917	82965	82967	82967	he	170	“ I estimate that it requires one more minute . Now , when the champions ’ names are called , I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall , walk along the staff table , and go through into the next chamber ”
82976	82986	82967	82967	he	170	“ where they will be receiving their first instructions . ”
83068	83072	83073	83074	Lee Jordan	349	“ Any second , ”

83526	83529	83531	83531	Ron	171	“ No ! ”
83612	83615	83616	83616	Dumbledore	170	“ Excellent ! ”
83627	83683	83616	83616	Dumbledore	170	“ Well , we now have our three champions . I am sure I can count upon all of you , including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang , to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster . By cheering your champion on , you will contribute in a very real — ”

84580	84583	84584	84584	Bagman	387	“ Joke ? ”
84589	84610	84584	84584	Bagman	387	“ No , no , not at all ! Harry ’s name just came out of the Goblet of Fire ! ”
84628	84638	84639	84639	she	386	“ But evidently zair ’ as been a mistake , ”

84680	84750	84668	84668	Bagman	387	“ But , as you know , the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure . And as his name ’s come out of the goblet ... I mean , I do n’t think there can be any ducking out at this stage ... It ’s down in the rules , you ’re obliged ... Harry will just have to do the best he — ”

84947	84977	84938	84938	his	376	“ Two Hogwarts champions ? I do n’t remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions — or have I not read the rules carefully enough ? ”
84986	84990	84992	84993	Madame Maxime	293	“ C’est impossible , ”

85063	85085	85046	85046	Karkaroff	376	“ Otherwise , we would , of course , have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools . ”

85247	85265	85267	85268	Professor Dumbledore	170	“ Did you ask an older student to put it into the Goblet of Fire for you ? ”

85281	85292	85294	85295	Madame Maxime	293	“ Ah , but of course ’ e is lying ! ”

85390	85436	85386	85387	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Really , what nonsense ! Harry could not have crossed the line himself , and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him , I ’m sure that should be good enough for everybody else ! ”
85447	85454	85458	85458	his	376	“ Mr. Crouch ... Mr. Bagman , ”
85464	85484	85458	85458	his	376	“ you are our — er — objective judges . Surely you will agree that this is most irregular ? ”
85555	85587	85550	85550	his	200	“ We must follow the rules , and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament . ”
85588	85600	85602	85602	Bagman	202	“ Well , Barty knows the rule book back to front , ”
85622	85636	85638	85638	Karkaroff	376	“ I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students , ”
85660	85692	85651	85651	His	376	“ You will set up the Goblet of Fire once more , and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions . It ’s only fair , Dumbledore . ”
85693	85704	85706	85706	Bagman	202	“ But Karkaroff , it does n’t work like that , ”
85708	85730	85706	85706	Bagman	202	“ The Goblet of Fire ’s just gone out — it wo n’t reignite until the start of the next tournament — ”
85731	85743	85745	85745	Karkaroff	376	“ — in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing ! ”
85747	85776	85745	85745	Karkaroff	376	“ After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises , I little expected something of this nature to occur ! I have half a mind to leave now ! ”
85777	85783	85706	85706	Bagman	202	“ Empty threat , Karkaroff , ”
85792	85826	85706	85706	Bagman	202	“ You ca n’t leave your champion now . He ’s got to compete . They ’ve all got to compete . Binding magical contract , like Dumbledore said . Convenient , eh ? ”
85854	85857	85859	85859	Karkaroff	376	“ Convenient ? ”
85861	85873	85859	85859	Karkaroff	376	“ I ’m afraid I do n’t understand you , Moody . ”
85910	85915	85917	85917	Moody	296	“ Do n’t you ? ”
85920	85947	85917	85917	Moody	296	“ It ’s very simple , Karkaroff . Someone put Potter ’s name in that goblet knowing he ’d have to compete if it came out . ”
85948	85965	85967	85968	Madame Maxime	293	“ Evidently , someone ’ oo wished to give ’ Ogwarts two bites at ze apple ! ”
85970	85978	85980	85980	Karkaroff	376	“ I quite agree , Madame Maxime , ”
85986	86004	85980	85980	Karkaroff	376	“ I shall be lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic and the International Confederation of Wizards — ”
86005	86018	86020	86020	Moody	296	“ If anyone ’s got reason to complain , it ’s Potter , ”
86022	86037	86020	86020	Moody	296	“ but ... funny thing ... I do n’t hear him saying a word ... ”
86038	86045	86052	86052	her	386	“ Why should ’ e complain ? ”
86055	86107	86052	86052	her	386	“ ’ E ’ as ze chance to compete , ’ asn’t ’ e ? We ’ ave all been ’ oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks ! Ze honor for our schools ! A thousand Galleons in prize money — zis is a chance many would die for ! ”
86108	86121	86123	86123	Moody	296	“ Maybe someone ’s hoping Potter is going to die for it , ”
86162	86174	86157	86157	his	202	“ Moody , old man ... what a thing to say ! ”
86175	86198	86200	86200	Karkaroff	376	“ We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if he has n’t discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime , ”
86203	86238	86200	86200	Karkaroff	376	“ Apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too . An odd quality in a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher , Dumbledore , but no doubt you had your reasons . ”
86239	86246	86248	86248	Moody	346	“ Imagining things , am I ? ”
86250	86273	86248	86248	Moody	346	“ Seeing things , eh ? It was a skilled witch or wizard who put the boy ’s name in that goblet ... ”
86274	86284	86286	86287	Madame Maxime	293	“ Ah , what evidence is zere of zat ? ”
86295	86305	86307	86307	Moody	346	“ Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object ! ”
86309	86359	86307	86307	Moody	346	“ It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament ... I ’m guessing they submitted Potter ’s name under a fourth school , to make sure he was the only one in his category ... ”
86360	86375	86377	86377	Karkaroff	376	“ You seem to have given this a great deal of thought , Moody , ”
86380	86441	86377	86377	Karkaroff	376	“ and a very ingenious theory it is — though of course , I heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg , and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock . So you ’ll understand if we do n’t take you entirely seriously ... ”
86442	86455	86456	86456	Moody	346	“ There are those who ’ll turn innocent occasions to their advantage , ”
86463	86484	86456	86456	Moody	346	“ It ’s my job to think the way Dark wizards do , Karkaroff — as you ought to remember ... ”
86485	86488	86490	86490	Dumbledore	170	“ Alastor ! ”
86507	86511	86499	86499	he	158	“ Mad - Eye ”
86538	86549	86551	86551	Dumbledore	170	“ How this situation arose , we do not know , ”
86561	86600	86551	86551	Dumbledore	170	“ It seems to me , however , that we have no choice but to accept it . Both Cedric and Harry have been chosen to compete in the tournament . This , therefore , they will do ... ”
86601	86609	86641	86641	she	293	“ Ah , but Dumbly - dorr — ”
86610	86630	86551	86551	Dumbledore	170	“ My dear Madame Maxime , if you have an alternative , I would be delighted to hear it . ”
86668	86678	86679	86679	he	202	“ Well , shall we crack on , then ? ”
86692	86713	86679	86679	he	202	“ Got to give our champions their instructions , have n’t we ? Barty , want to do the honors ? ”
86725	86728	86729	86729	he	200	“ Yes , ”
86732	86741	86729	86729	he	200	“ instructions . Yes ... the first task ... ”
86786	86797	86798	86799	Mr. Crouch	200	“ The first task is designed to test your daring , ”
86818	86830	86810	86811	Mr. Crouch	200	“ I think that ’s all , is it , Albus ? ”
86831	86836	86838	86838	Dumbledore	170	“ I think so , ”
86850	86866	86838	86838	Dumbledore	170	“ Are you sure you would n’t like to stay at Hogwarts tonight , Barty ? ”
86867	86880	86882	86883	Mr. Crouch	200	“ No , Dumbledore , I must get back to the Ministry , ”
86885	86919	86882	86883	Mr. Crouch	200	“ It is a very busy , very difficult time at the moment ... I ’ve left young Weatherby in charge ... Very enthusiastic ... a little overenthusiastic , if truth be told ... ”
86920	86935	86937	86937	Dumbledore	170	“ You ’ll come and have a drink before you go , at least ? ”
86939	86949	86951	86951	Bagman	202	“ Come on , Barty , I ’m staying ! ”
86954	86975	86951	86951	Bagman	202	“ It ’s all happening at Hogwarts now , you know , much more exciting here than at the office ! ”
86976	86983	86985	86985	Crouch	243	“ I think not , Ludo , ”
86994	87004	87006	87006	Dumbledore	170	“ Professor Karkaroff — Madame Maxime — a nightcap ? ”
87065	87078	87080	87080	Dumbledore	170	“ Harry , Cedric , I suggest you go up to bed , ”
87088	87125	87080	87080	Dumbledore	170	“ I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you , and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise . ”
87165	87168	87170	87170	Cedric	209	“ So , ”
87177	87186	87170	87170	Cedric	209	“ We ’re playing against each other again ! ”
87187	87191	87193	87193	Harry	158	“ I s’pose , ”
87225	87231	87233	87233	Cedric	209	“ So ... tell me ... ”
87257	87266	87233	87233	Cedric	209	“ How did you get your name in ? ”
87267	87272	87274	87274	Harry	158	“ I did n’t , ”
87281	87295	87274	87274	Harry	158	“ I did n’t put it in . I was telling the truth . ”
87296	87301	87303	87303	Cedric	209	“ Ah ... okay , ”
87314	87322	87308	87308	Cedric	209	“ Well ... see you , then . ”
87786	87793	87795	87797	the Fat Lady	1991	“ Well , well , well , ”
87799	87818	87795	87797	the Fat Lady	1991	“ Violet ’s just told me everything . Who ’s just been chosen as school champion , then ? ”
87819	87822	87824	87824	Harry	158	“ Balderdash , ”
87827	87834	87836	87838	the pale witch	2421	“ It most certainly is n’t ! ”
87841	87853	87855	87857	the Fat Lady	394	“ No , no , Vi , it ’s the password , ”
87934	87944	87946	87946	Fred	175	“ You should ’ve told us you ’d entered ! ”
87957	87970	87972	87972	George	176	“ How did you do it without getting a beard ? Brilliant ! ”
87974	87979	87980	87980	Harry	158	“ I did n’t , ”
87983	87990	87980	87980	Harry	158	“ I do n’t know how — ”
88000	88016	87992	87992	Angelina	383	“ Oh if it could n’t be me , at least it ’s a Gryffindor — ”
88017	88034	88036	88037	Katie Bell	396	“ You ’ll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch match , Harry ! ”
88045	88058	87992	87992	Angelina	383	“ We ’ve got food , Harry , come and have some — ”
88059	88072	88036	88037	Katie Bell	396	“ I ’m not hungry , I had enough at the feast — ”
88210	88215	88216	88216	he	158	“ I did n’t , ”
88224	88233	88216	88216	he	158	“ I do n’t know how it happened . ”
88253	88258	88259	88259	he	158	“ I ’m tired ! ”
88269	88282	88259	88259	he	158	“ No , seriously , George — I ’m going to bed — ”
88392	88398	88399	88399	Harry	158	“ Where ’ve you been ? ”
88402	88406	88408	88408	Ron	171	“ Oh hello , ”
88475	88478	88479	88479	he	171	“ So , ”
88496	88499	88479	88479	he	171	“ Congratulations . ”
88500	88507	88509	88509	Harry	158	“ What d’you mean , congratulations ? ”
88534	88546	88548	88548	Ron	171	“ Well ... no one else got across the Age Line , ”
88550	88566	88548	88548	Ron	171	“ Not even Fred and George . What did you use — the Invisibility Cloak ? ”
88567	88580	88582	88582	Harry	158	“ The Invisibility Cloak would n’t have got me over that line , ”
88585	88589	88591	88591	Ron	171	“ Oh right , ”
88593	88629	88591	88591	Ron	171	“ I thought you might ’ve told me if it was the Cloak ... because it would ’ve covered both of us , would n’t it ? But you found another way , did you ? ”
88630	88633	88635	88635	Harry	158	“ Listen , ”
88637	88655	88635	88635	Harry	158	“ I did n’t put my name in that goblet . Someone else must ’ve done it . ”
88661	88669	88658	88658	his	171	“ What would they do that for ? ”
88670	88674	88676	88676	Harry	158	“ I dunno , ”
88688	88693	88676	88676	Harry	158	“ To kill me . ”
88711	88726	88727	88727	he	171	“ It ’s okay , you know , you can tell me the truth , ”
88730	88813	88727	88727	he	171	“ If you do n’t want everyone else to know , fine , but I do n’t know why you ’re bothering to lie , you did n’t get into trouble for it , did you ? That friend of the Fat Lady ’s , that Violet , she ’s already told us all Dumbledore ’s letting you enter . A thousand Galleons prize money , eh ? And you do n’t have to do end - of - year tests either ... ”
88814	88825	88827	88827	Harry	158	“ I did n’t put my name in that goblet ! ”
88834	88839	88841	88841	Ron	171	“ Yeah , okay , ”
88852	88882	88841	88841	Ron	171	“ Only you said this morning you ’d have done it last night , and no one would ’ve seen you ... I ’m not stupid , you know . ”
88883	88894	88895	88895	Harry	158	“ You ’re doing a really good impression of it , ”
88898	88901	88903	88903	Ron	171	“ Yeah ? ”
88923	88951	88903	88903	Ron	171	“ You want to get to bed , Harry . I expect you ’ll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo - call or something . ”
89194	89197	89198	89198	she	169	“ Hello , ”
89216	89229	89198	89198	she	169	“ I brought you this ... Want to go for a walk ? ”
89230	89234	89236	89236	Harry	158	“ Good idea , ”
89326	89339	89340	89340	she	169	“ Well , of course I knew you had n’t entered yourself , ”
89358	89416	89340	89340	she	169	“ The look on your face when Dumbledore read out your name ! But the question is , who did put it in ? Because Moody ’s right , Harry ... I do n’t think any student could have done it ... they ’d never be able to fool the goblet , or get over Dumbledore ’s — ”
89417	89423	89424	89424	Harry	158	“ Have you seen Ron ? ”
89430	89440	89441	89441	she	169	“ Erm ... yes ... he was at breakfast , ”
89444	89453	89340	89340	she	169	“ Does he still think I entered myself ? ”
89454	89468	89470	89470	Hermione	169	“ Well ... no , I do n’t think so ... not really , ”
89473	89486	89340	89340	she	169	“ What ’s that supposed to mean , ‘ not really ’ ? ”
89487	89496	89497	89497	Hermione	169	“ Oh Harry , is n’t it obvious ? ”
89501	89506	89497	89497	Hermione	169	“ He ’s jealous ! ”
89507	89510	89511	89511	Harry	158	“ Jealous ? ”
89515	89538	89511	89511	Harry	158	“ Jealous of what ? He wants to make a prat of himself in front of the whole school , does he ? ”
89539	89542	89544	89544	Hermione	169	“ Look , ”
89547	89571	89572	89572	she	169	“ it ’s always you who gets all the attention , you know it is . I know it ’s not your fault , ”
89583	89586	89588	89588	Harry	158	“ Great , ”
89591	89626	89588	89588	Harry	158	“ Really great . Tell him from me I ’ll swap any time he wants . Tell him from me he ’s welcome to it ... People gawping at my forehead everywhere I go ... ”
89627	89635	89636	89636	Hermione	169	“ I ’m not telling him anything , ”
89640	89655	89636	89636	Hermione	169	“ Tell him yourself . It ’s the only way to sort this out . ”
89656	89671	89672	89672	Harry	158	“ I ’m not running around after him trying to make him grow up ! ”
89689	89708	89672	89672	Harry	158	“ Maybe he ’ll believe I ’m not enjoying myself once I ’ve got my neck broken or — ”
89709	89715	89717	89717	Hermione	169	“ That ’s not funny , ”
89720	89728	89729	89729	She	169	“ That ’s not funny at all . ”
89734	89767	89729	89729	She	169	“ Harry , I ’ve been thinking — you know what we ’ve got to do , do n’t you ? Straight away , the moment we get back to the castle ? ”
89768	89779	89672	89672	Harry	158	“ Yeah , give Ron a good kick up the — ”
89780	89835	89729	89729	She	169	“ Write to Sirius . You ’ve got to tell him what ’s happened . He asked you to keep him posted on everything that ’s going on at Hogwarts ... It ’s almost as if he expected something like this to happen . I brought some parchment and a quill out with me — ”
89836	89841	89843	89843	Harry	158	“ Come off it , ”
89863	89898	89843	89843	Harry	158	“ He came back to the country just because my scar twinged . He ’ll probably come bursting right into the castle if I tell him someone ’s entered me in the Triwizard Tournament — ”
89899	89908	89910	89910	Hermione	169	“ He ’d want you to tell him , ”
89913	89922	89910	89910	Hermione	169	“ He ’s going to find out anyway — ”
89923	89926	89729	89729	She	169	“ How ? ”
89927	89939	89941	89941	Hermione	169	“ Harry , this is n’t going to be kept quiet , ”
89946	90006	89941	89941	Hermione	169	“ This tournament ’s famous , and you ’re famous . I ’ll be really surprised if there is n’t anything in the Daily Prophet about you competing ... You ’re already in half the books about You - Know - Who , you know ... and Sirius would rather hear it from you , I know he would . ”
90007	90018	90020	90020	Harry	158	“ Okay , okay , I ’ll write to him , ”
90067	90076	90077	90077	Harry	158	“ Whose owl am I going to use ? ”
90085	90095	90077	90077	Harry	158	“ He told me not to use Hedwig again . ”
90096	90104	90147	90147	Hermione	169	“ Ask Ron if you can borrow — ”
90105	90114	90115	90115	Harry	158	“ I ’m not asking Ron for anything , ”
90119	90136	90138	90138	Hermione	169	“ Well , borrow one of the school owls , then , anyone can use them , ”
90251	90254	90255	90255	he	158	“ Finished , ”
90286	90293	90294	90294	Harry	158	“ I ca n’t use you , ”
90305	90315	90294	90294	Harry	158	“ I ’ve got to use one of these ... ”
90389	90396	90398	90398	Harry	158	“ First Ron , then you , ”
90401	90408	90398	90398	Harry	158	“ This is n’t my fault . ”
90753	90765	90766	90766	he	257	“ Ah , look , boys , it ’s the champion , ”
90781	90834	90766	90766	he	257	“ Got your autograph books ? Better get a signature now , because I doubt he ’s going to be around much longer ... Half the Triwizard champions have died ... how long d’you reckon you ’re going to last , Potter ? Ten minutes into the first task ’s my bet . ”
90941	90949	90950	90950	he	257	“ Take this thing for a walk ? ”
90962	90986	90950	90950	he	257	“ And where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash ? Around the sting , the blasting end , or the sucker ? ”
90987	90993	90995	90995	Hagrid	181	“ Roun ’ the middle , ”
90999	91037	90995	90995	Hagrid	181	“ Er — yeh might want ter put on yer dragon - hide gloves , jus ’ as an extra precaution , like . Harry — you come here an ’ help me with this big one ... ”
91080	91096	91058	91058	He	181	“ So — yer competin ’ , Harry . In the tournament . School champion . ”
91097	91103	91104	91104	Harry	158	“ One of the champions , ”
91122	91134	91118	91118	his	181	“ No idea who put yeh in fer it , Harry ? ”

91927	91933	91935	91935	Harry	158	“ Wonder why that was , ”

92332	92365	92323	92323	Malfoy	257	“ I ’ve got loads . But do n’t touch my hand , now . I ’ve just washed it , you see ; do n’t want a Mudblood sliming it up . ”
92418	92421	92422	92422	Hermione	169	“ Harry ! ”
92426	92434	92441	92441	his	257	“ Go on , then , Potter , ”

92491	92494	92495	92495	Harry	158	“ Furnunculus ! ”
92498	92501	92503	92503	Malfoy	257	“ Densaugeo ! ”

92700	92703	92689	92689	Snape	333	“ Explain . ”
92704	92711	92689	92689	Snape	333	“ Potter attacked me , sir — ”
92712	92722	92723	92723	Harry	158	“ We attacked each other at the same time ! ”
92726	92735	92723	92723	Harry	158	“ — and he hit Goyle — look — ”
92758	92764	92765	92765	Snape	333	“ Hospital wing , Goyle , ”
92769	92774	92775	92775	Ron	171	“ Malfoy got Hermione ! ”

92946	92951	92952	92952	he	333	“ Let ’s see , ”
92960	92989	92952	92952	he	333	“ Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley . Now get inside , or it ’ll be a week ’s worth of detentions . ”
93153	93156	93158	93158	Snape	333	“ Antidotes ! ”
93173	93205	93158	93158	Snape	333	“ You should all have prepared your recipes now . I want you to brew them carefully , and then , we will be selecting someone on whom to test one ... ”
93297	93300	93302	93302	Snape	333	“ Yes ? ”
93305	93319	93273	93273	he	326	“ Please , sir , I ’m supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs . ”
93337	93347	93349	93349	Snape	333	“ Potter has another hour of Potions to complete , ”
93352	93363	93349	93349	Snape	333	“ He will come upstairs when this class is finished . ”
93368	93378	93379	93379	he	326	“ Sir — sir , Mr. Bagman wants him , ”
93383	93400	93379	93379	he	326	“ All the champions have got to go , I think they want to take photographs ... ”
93435	93442	93443	93443	Snape	333	“ Very well , very well , ”
93446	93466	93443	93443	Snape	333	“ Potter , leave your things here , I want you back down here later to test your antidote . ”
93467	93482	93484	93484	Colin	326	“ Please , sir — he ’s got to take his things with him , ”
93486	93491	93484	93484	Colin	326	“ All the champions — ”
93492	93496	93498	93498	Snape	333	“ Very well ! ”
93500	93513	93498	93498	Snape	333	“ Potter — take your bag and get out of my sight ! ”
93548	93559	93561	93561	Colin	326	“ It ’s amazing , is n’t it , Harry ? ”
93577	93588	93568	93568	Harry	158	“ Is n’t it , though ? You being champion ? ”
93589	93595	93597	93597	Harry	158	“ Yeah , really amazing , ”
93611	93621	93597	93597	Harry	158	“ What do they want photos for , Colin ? ”
93622	93630	93568	93568	Harry	158	“ The Daily Prophet , I think ! ”
93631	93634	93636	93636	Harry	158	“ Great , ”
93639	93648	93636	93636	Harry	158	“ Exactly what I need . More publicity . ”
93649	93653	93655	93655	Colin	326	“ Good luck ! ”
93860	93906	93847	93847	Bagman	202	“ Ah , here he is ! Champion number four ! In you come , Harry , in you come ... nothing to worry about , it ’s just the wand weighing ceremony , the rest of the judges will be here in a moment — ”
93907	93911	93912	93912	Harry	158	“ Wand weighing ? ”
93916	93946	93948	93948	Bagman	202	“ We have to check that your wands are fully functional , no problems , you know , as they ’re your most important tools in the tasks ahead , ”
93950	93976	93977	93977	he	202	“ The expert ’s upstairs now with Dumbledore . And then there ’s going to be a little photo shoot . This is Rita Skeeter , ”
93988	94003	93977	93977	he	202	“ She ’s doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily Prophet ... ”
94004	94012	94017	94017	her	304	“ Maybe not that small , Ludo , ”
94066	94082	94083	94083	she	304	“ I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start ? ”
94095	94110	94083	94083	she	304	“ The youngest champion , you know ... to add a bit of color ? ”
94111	94114	94116	94116	Bagman	202	“ Certainly ! ”
94118	94128	94116	94116	Bagman	202	“ That is — if Harry has no objection ? ”
94129	94132	94134	94134	Harry	158	“ Er — ”
94136	94139	94141	94142	Rita Skeeter	304	“ Lovely , ”
94181	94195	94196	94196	she	304	“ We do n’t want to be in there with all that noise , ”
94199	94214	94196	94196	she	304	“ Let ’s see ... ah , yes , this is nice and cozy . ”
94226	94238	94245	94245	herself	304	“ Come along , dear — that ’s right — lovely , ”
94270	94276	94245	94245	herself	304	“ Let ’s see now ... ”
94316	94343	94293	94293	she	304	“ You wo n’t mind , Harry , if I use a Quick - Quotes Quill ? It leaves me free to talk to you normally ... ”
94344	94348	94350	94350	Harry	158	“ A what ? ”
94446	94459	94406	94406	She	304	“ Testing ... my name is Rita Skeeter , Daily Prophet reporter . ”
94507	94510	94512	94513	Rita Skeeter	304	“ Lovely , ”
94547	94562	94540	94540	she	304	“ So , Harry ... what made you decide to enter the Triwizard Tournament ? ”
94563	94566	94568	94568	Harry	158	“ Er — ”
94628	94635	94637	94638	Rita Skeeter	304	“ Ignore the quill , Harry , ”
94650	94664	94643	94643	Harry	158	“ Now — why did you decide to enter the tournament , Harry ? ”
94665	94670	94672	94672	Harry	158	“ I did n’t , ”
94674	94697	94672	94672	Harry	158	“ I do n’t know how my name got into the Goblet of Fire . I did n’t put it in there . ”
94706	94749	94698	94699	Rita Skeeter	304	“ Come now , Harry , there ’s no need to be scared of getting into trouble . We all know you should n’t really have entered at all . But do n’t worry about that . Our readers love a rebel . ”
94750	94757	94758	94758	Harry	158	“ But I did n’t enter , ”
94761	94768	94758	94758	Harry	158	“ I do n’t know who — ”
94769	94779	94781	94782	Rita Skeeter	304	“ How do you feel about the tasks ahead ? ”
94784	94789	94781	94782	Rita Skeeter	304	“ Excited ? Nervous ? ”
94790	94804	94806	94806	Harry	158	“ I have n’t really thought ... yeah , nervous , I suppose , ”
94816	94828	94830	94831	Rita Skeeter	304	“ Champions have died in the past , have n’t they ? ”
94834	94843	94830	94831	Rita Skeeter	304	“ Have you thought about that at all ? ”
94844	94860	94862	94862	Harry	158	“ Well ... they say it ’s going to be a lot safer this year , ”
94882	94899	94901	94902	Rita Skeeter	304	“ Of course , you ’ve looked death in the face before , have n’t you ? ”
94908	94918	94901	94902	Rita Skeeter	304	“ How would you say that ’s affected you ? ”
94919	94922	94924	94924	Harry	158	“ Er , ”
94929	94970	94901	94902	Rita Skeeter	304	“ Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove yourself ? To live up to your name ? Do you think that perhaps you were tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because — ”
94971	94977	94979	94979	Harry	158	“ I did n’t enter , ”
94986	94995	94997	94998	Rita Skeeter	304	“ Can you remember your parents at all ? ”
95004	95007	95009	95009	Harry	158	“ No , ”
95011	95036	94997	94998	Rita Skeeter	304	“ How do you think they ’d feel if they knew you were competing in the Triwizard Tournament ? Proud ? Worried ? Angry ? ”
95106	95116	95118	95118	Harry	158	“ I have NOT got tears in my eyes ! ”
95166	95169	95171	95172	Rita Skeeter	304	“ Dumbledore ! ”
95218	95223	95224	95224	she	304	“ How are you ? ”
95242	95261	95224	95224	she	304	“ I hope you saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards ’ Conference ? ”
95262	95266	95268	95268	Dumbledore	170	“ Enchantingly nasty , ”
95274	95287	95270	95270	his	170	“ I particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat . ”
95296	95325	95288	95289	Rita Skeeter	304	“ I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old - fashioned , Dumbledore , and that many wizards in the street — ”
95326	95341	95343	95343	Dumbledore	170	“ I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness , Rita , ”
95353	95395	95343	95343	Dumbledore	170	“ but I ’m afraid we will have to discuss the matter later . The Weighing of the Wands is about to start , and it can not take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard . ”
95511	95518	95523	95523	his	170	“ May I introduce Mr. Ollivander ? ”
95536	95555	95523	95523	his	170	“ He will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament . ”
95608	95620	95622	95623	Mr. Ollivander	405	“ Mademoiselle Delacour , could we have you first , please ? ”
95650	95653	95654	95654	he	405	“ Hmmm ... ”
95692	95695	95696	95696	he	405	“ Yes , ”
95700	95717	95696	95696	he	405	“ nine and a half inches ... inflexible ... rosewood ... and containing ... dear me ... ”
95718	95730	95732	95732	Fleur	386	“ An ’ air from ze ’ ead of a veela , ”
95734	95741	95732	95732	Fleur	386	“ One of my grandmuzzer ’s . ”
95770	95773	95775	95776	Mr. Ollivander	405	“ Yes , ”
95778	95814	95775	95776	Mr. Ollivander	405	“ yes , I ’ve never used veela hair myself , of course . I find it makes for rather temperamental wands ... however , to each his own , and if this suits you ... ”
95835	95838	95832	95832	he	405	“ Orchideous ! ”
95851	95865	95867	95868	Mr. Ollivander	405	“ Very well , very well , it ’s in fine working order , ”
95883	95890	95878	95878	Fleur	386	“ Mr. Diggory , you next . ”
95906	95921	95923	95924	Mr. Ollivander	405	“ Ah , now , this is one of mine , is n’t it ? ”
95938	96000	95932	95932	Cedric	209	“ Yes , I remember it well . Containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn ... must have been seventeen hands ; nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked his tail . Twelve and a quarter inches ... ash ... pleasantly springy . It ’s in fine condition ... You treat it regularly ? ”
96001	96007	96009	96009	Cedric	209	“ Polished it last night , ”
96099	96107	96092	96092	himself	405	“ Mr. Krum , if you please . ”
96146	96149	96151	96152	Mr. Ollivander	405	“ Hmm , ”
96154	96182	96151	96152	Mr. Ollivander	405	“ this is a Gregorovitch creation , unless I ’m much mistaken ? A fine wandmaker , though the styling is never quite what I ... however ... ”
96201	96209	96210	96210	he	405	“ Yes ... hornbeam and dragon heartstring ? ”
96218	96237	96210	96210	he	405	“ Rather thicker than one usually sees ... quite rigid ... ten and a quarter inches ... Avis ! ”
96272	96275	96277	96278	Mr. Ollivander	405	“ Good , ”
96286	96293	96277	96278	Mr. Ollivander	405	“ Which leaves ... Mr. Potter . ”
96313	96318	96320	96321	Mr. Ollivander	405	“ Aaaah , yes , ”
96329	96341	96323	96323	his	405	“ Yes , yes , yes . How well I remember . ”
96461	96464	96465	96465	he	405	“ Curious , ”
96469	96472	96465	96465	he	405	“ curious , ”
96644	96649	96651	96651	Dumbledore	170	“ Thank you all , ”
96661	96691	96651	96651	Dumbledore	170	“ You may go back to your lessons now — or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner , as they are about to end — ”
96722	96729	96731	96731	Bagman	202	“ Photos , Dumbledore , photos ! ”
96734	96748	96731	96731	Bagman	202	“ All the judges and champions , what do you think , Rita ? ”
96749	96760	96762	96763	Rita Skeeter	304	“ Er — yes , let ’s do those first , ”
96772	96780	96762	96763	Rita Skeeter	304	“ And then perhaps some individual shots . ”
96982	96989	96991	96991	Ron	171	“ You ’ve had an owl , ”
97017	97022	97024	97024	Harry	158	“ Oh — right , ”
97026	97042	97044	97044	Ron	171	“ And we ’ve got to do our detentions tomorrow night , Snape ’s dungeon , ”
97664	97667	97674	97674	She	304	“ er ’s ”
97767	97782	97749	97749	people	1034	“ Want a hanky , Potter , in case you start crying in Transfiguration ? ”
97783	97813	97749	97749	people	1034	“ Since when have you been one of the top students in the school , Potter ? Or is this a school you and Longbottom have set up together ? ”
97814	97819	97749	97749	people	1034	“ Hey — Harry ! ”
97820	97827	97828	97828	Harry	158	“ Yeah , that ’s right ! ”
97846	97871	97830	97830	himself	158	“ I ’ve just been crying my eyes out over my dead mum , and I ’m just off to do a bit more ... ”
97872	97884	97828	97828	Harry	158	“ No — it was just — you dropped your quill . ”
97898	97905	97906	97906	he	158	“ Oh — right — sorry , ”
97914	97922	97923	97923	she	2597	“ Er ... good luck on Tuesday , ”
97926	97934	97923	97923	she	2597	“ I really hope you do well . ”

98013	98023	97996	97996	she	401	“ What was she judging against — a chipmunk ? ”
98024	98028	98029	98029	Hermione	169	“ Ignore it , ”
98057	98064	98051	98051	she	169	“ Just ignore it , Harry . ”
98207	98214	98215	98215	Harry	158	“ I did n’t start this , ”
98219	98225	98215	98215	Harry	158	“ It ’s his problem . ”
98226	98231	98232	98232	Hermione	169	“ You miss him ! ”
98236	98244	98232	98232	Hermione	169	“ And I know he misses you — ”
98245	98249	98251	98251	Harry	158	“ Miss him ? ”
98253	98260	98251	98251	Harry	158	“ I do n’t miss him ... ”
98426	98435	98436	98436	she	169	“ He ’s not even good - looking ! ”
98447	98475	98436	98436	she	169	“ They only like him because he ’s famous ! They would n’t look twice at him if he could n’t do that Wonky - Faint thing — ”
98476	98480	98482	98482	Harry	158	“ Wronski Feint , ”
98654	98661	98662	98662	he	158	“ What about Ron , though ? ”
98665	98675	98662	98662	he	158	“ Do n’t you want to go with him ? ”
98676	98681	98682	98682	Hermione	169	“ Oh ... well ... ”
98687	98701	98682	98682	Hermione	169	“ I thought we might meet up with him in the Three Broomsticks ... ”
98702	98705	98707	98707	Harry	158	“ No , ”
98710	98719	98682	98682	Hermione	169	“ Oh Harry , this is so stupid — ”
98720	98740	98682	98682	Hermione	169	“ I ’ll come , but I ’m not meeting Ron , and I ’m wearing my Invisibility Cloak . ”
98741	98747	98748	98748	Hermione	169	“ Oh all right then ... ”
98751	98774	98748	98748	Hermione	169	“ but I hate talking to you in that Cloak , I never know if I ’m looking at you or not . ”
98850	98858	98860	98860	Hermione	169	“ People keep looking at me now , ”
98878	98887	98860	98860	Hermione	169	“ They think I ’m talking to myself . ”
98888	98898	98860	98860	Hermione	169	“ Do n’t move your lips so much then . ”
98899	98922	98860	98860	Hermione	169	“ Come on , please just take off your Cloak for a bit , no one ’s going to bother you here . ”
98923	98927	98929	98929	Harry	158	“ Oh yeah ? ”
98931	98936	98929	98929	Harry	158	“ Look behind you . ”
98996	99015	98993	98993	Harry	158	“ She ’s staying in the village . I bet she ’s coming to watch the first task . ”
99065	99070	99072	99072	Hermione	169	“ She ’s gone , ”
99085	99119	99120	99120	she	169	“ Why do n’t we go and have a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks , it ’s a bit cold , is n’t it ? You do n’t have to talk to Ron ! ”
99308	99322	99323	99323	she	169	“ I look like such an idiot , sitting here on my own , ”
99326	99334	99323	99323	she	169	“ Lucky I brought something to do . ”
99397	99415	99416	99416	Hermione	169	“ You know , maybe I should try and get some of the villagers involved in S.P.E.W. , ”
99425	99430	99432	99432	Harry	158	“ Yeah , right , ”
99444	99459	99434	99434	He	158	“ Hermione , when are you going to give up on this spew stuff ? ”
99460	99472	99473	99473	she	169	“ When house - elves have decent wages and working conditions ! ”
99477	99504	99473	99473	she	169	“ You know , I ’m starting to think it ’s time for more direct action . I wonder how you get into the school kitchens ? ”
99505	99514	99516	99516	Harry	158	“ No idea , ask Fred and George , ”
99855	99862	99864	99864	Hermione	169	“ Look , it ’s Hagrid ! ”
100119	100125	100127	100127	Hagrid	181	“ All right , Hermione ? ”
100130	100133	100135	100135	Hermione	169	“ Hello , ”
100162	100168	100159	100159	he	346	“ Nice Cloak , Potter . ”
100197	100209	100194	100194	Moody	346	“ Can your eye — I mean , can you — ? ”
100210	100220	100221	100221	Moody	346	“ Yeah , it can see through Invisibility Cloaks , ”
100225	100240	100221	100221	Moody	346	“ And it ’s come in useful at times , I can tell you . ”
100296	100312	100267	100267	Hagrid	181	“ Harry , meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin . Wear that Cloak . ”
100320	100328	100316	100316	Hagrid	181	“ Nice ter see yeh , Hermione , ”
100338	100350	100351	100351	Harry	158	“ Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight ? ”
100357	100361	100363	100363	Hermione	169	“ Does he ? ”
100368	100388	100389	100389	She	169	“ I wonder what he ’s up to ? I do n’t know whether you should go , Harry ... ”
100396	100405	100389	100389	She	169	“ It might make you late for Sirius . ”
100641	100644	100634	100634	He	158	“ Thanks ! ”
100701	100707	100708	100708	Hagrid	181	“ You there , Harry ? ”
100718	100721	100723	100723	Harry	158	“ Yeah , ”
100738	100743	100723	100723	Harry	158	“ What ’s up ? ”
100744	100751	100753	100753	Hagrid	181	“ Got summat ter show yeh , ”
100814	100821	100822	100822	Harry	158	“ What ’re you showing me ? ”
100853	100870	100872	100872	Hagrid	181	“ Come with me , keep quiet , an ’ keep yerself covered with that Cloak , ”
100874	100887	100872	100872	Hagrid	181	“ We won ’ take Fang , he won ’ like it ... ”
100888	100913	100920	100920	he	181	“ Listen , Hagrid , I ca n’t stay long ... I ’ve got to be back up at the castle by one o’clock — ”
100955	100961	100946	100946	Hagrid	181	“ Hagrid , what — ? ”
100962	100965	100967	100967	Hagrid	181	“ Shhh ! ”
101007	101017	101003	101003	she	293	“ Ah , ’ Agrid ... it is time ? ”
101018	101023	101025	101025	Hagrid	181	“ Bong - sewer , ”
101139	101151	101135	101135	she	293	“ Wair is it you are taking me , ’ Agrid ? ”
101152	101157	101159	101159	Hagrid	181	“ Yeh’ll enjoy this , ”
101162	101190	101159	101159	Hagrid	181	“ worth seein ’ , trust me . On’y — don ’ go tellin ’ anyone I showed yeh , right ? Yeh’re not s’posed ter know . ”
101191	101196	101198	101199	Madame Maxime	293	“ Of course not , ”
101604	101611	101613	101617	a wizard near the fence	2695	“ Keep back there , Hagrid ! ”
101627	101650	101613	101617	a wizard near the fence	2695	“ They can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet , you know ! I ’ve seen this Horntail do forty ! ”
101651	101657	101659	101659	Hagrid	181	“ Is’n ’ it beautiful ? ”
101662	101668	101670	101671	another wizard	4766	“ It ’s no good ! ”
101673	101683	101670	101671	another wizard	4766	“ Stunning Spells , on the count of three ! ”
101696	101699	101700	101700	they	2697	“ Stupefy ! ”
101849	101856	101857	101857	Hagrid	181	“ Wan ’ a closer look ? ”
101901	101907	101908	101908	he	158	“ All right , Hagrid ? ”
101916	101969	101908	101908	he	158	“ They should be okay now — we put them out with a Sleeping Draught on the way here , thought it might be better for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet — but , like you saw , they were n’t happy , not happy at all — ”
101970	101979	101981	101981	Hagrid	181	“ What breeds you got here , Charlie ? ”
102020	102027	102029	102029	Charlie	186	“ This is a Hungarian Horntail , ”
102031	102066	102029	102029	Charlie	186	“ There ’s a Common Welsh Green over there , the smaller one — a Swedish Short - Snout , that blue - gray — and a Chinese Fireball , that ’s the red . ”
102089	102101	102102	102102	Charlie	186	“ I did n’t know you were bringing her , Hagrid , ”
102107	102131	102102	102102	Charlie	186	“ The champions are n’t supposed to know what ’s coming — she ’s bound to tell her student , is n’t she ? ”
102132	102143	102145	102145	Hagrid	181	“ Jus ’ thought she ’d like ter see ’em , ”
102156	102163	102165	102165	Charlie	186	“ Really romantic date , Hagrid , ”
102171	102174	102176	102176	Hagrid	181	“ Four ... ”
102178	102203	102176	102176	Hagrid	181	“ so it ’s one fer each o ’ the champions , is it ? What ’ve they got ta do — fight ’em ? ”
102204	102213	102215	102215	Charlie	186	“ Just get past them , I think , ”
102217	102277	102215	102215	Charlie	186	“ We ’ll be on hand if it gets nasty , Extinguishing Spells at the ready . They wanted nesting mothers , I do n’t know why ... but I tell you this , I do n’t envy the one who gets the Horntail . Vicious thing . Its back end ’s as dangerous as its front , look . ”
102350	102359	102361	102361	Charlie	186	“ I ’ve got them counted , Hagrid , ”
102368	102373	102365	102365	he	186	“ How ’s Harry ? ”
102374	102377	102379	102379	Hagrid	181	“ Fine , ”
102389	102403	102405	102405	Charlie	186	“ Just hope he ’s still fine after he ’s faced this lot , ”
102660	102667	102702	102702	Karkaroff	376	“ Ouch ! Who ’s there ? ”
102704	102709	102711	102711	Karkaroff	376	“ Who ’s there ? ”
102977	102980	102981	102981	he	158	“ Balderdash ! ”
103001	103007	103008	103008	she	2719	“ If you say so , ”
103208	103216	103192	103192	he	158	“ Sirius — how ’re you doing ? ”
103297	103306	103308	103308	Sirius	178	“ Never mind me , how are you ? ”
103311	103315	103341	103341	he	158	“ I ’m — ”
103324	103326	103320	103320	Harry	158	“ fine ”
103407	103437	103438	103438	he	158	“ ... and now Hagrid ’s just shown me what ’s coming in the first task , and it ’s dragons , Sirius , and I ’m a goner , ”
103488	103545	103485	103485	he	178	“ Dragons we can deal with , Harry , but we ’ll get to that in a minute — I have n’t got long here ... I ’ve broken into a Wizarding house to use the fire , but they could be back at any time . There are things I need to warn you about . ”
103546	103549	103551	103551	Harry	158	“ What ? ”
103572	103575	103577	103577	Sirius	178	“ Karkaroff , ”
103579	103599	103577	103577	Sirius	178	“ Harry , he was a Death Eater . You know what Death Eaters are , do n’t you ? ”
103600	103607	103485	103485	he	178	“ Yes — he — what ? ”
103608	103661	103577	103577	Sirius	178	“ He was caught , he was in Azkaban with me , but he got released . I ’d bet everything that ’s why Dumbledore wanted an Auror at Hogwarts this year — to keep an eye on him . Moody caught Karkaroff . Put him into Azkaban in the first place . ”
103662	103667	103668	103668	Harry	158	“ Karkaroff got released ? ”
103687	103694	103668	103668	Harry	158	“ Why did they release him ? ”
103695	103706	103708	103708	Sirius	178	“ He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic , ”
103711	103795	103708	103708	Sirius	178	“ He said he ’d seen the error of his ways , and then he named names ... he put a load of other people into Azkaban in his place ... He ’s not very popular in there , I can tell you . And since he got out , from what I can tell , he ’s been teaching the Dark Arts to every student who passes through that school of his . So watch out for the Durmstrang champion as well . ”
103796	103799	103801	103801	Harry	158	“ Okay , ”
103804	103844	103801	103801	Harry	158	“ But ... are you saying Karkaroff put my name in the goblet ? Because if he did , he ’s a really good actor . He seemed furious about it . He wanted to stop me from competing . ”
103845	103854	103856	103856	Sirius	178	“ We know he ’s a good actor , ”
103858	103890	103856	103856	Sirius	178	“ because he convinced the Ministry of Magic to set him free , did n’t he ? Now , I ’ve been keeping an eye on the Daily Prophet , Harry — ”
103891	103901	103903	103903	Harry	158	“ — you and the rest of the world , ”
103906	103945	103946	103946	Sirius	178	“ — and reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman ’s article last month , Moody was attacked the night before he started at Hogwarts . Yes , I know she says it was another false alarm , ”
103956	104041	103946	103946	Sirius	178	“ but I do n’t think so , somehow . I think someone tried to stop him from getting to Hogwarts . I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around . And no one ’s going to look into it too closely ; Mad - Eye ’s heard intruders a bit too often . But that does n’t mean he ca n’t still spot the real thing . Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had . ”
104042	104050	104052	104052	Harry	158	“ So ... what are you saying ? ”
104055	104067	104052	104052	Harry	158	“ Karkaroff ’s trying to kill me ? But — why ? ”
104071	104081	104082	104082	he	178	“ I ’ve been hearing some very strange things , ”
104086	104138	104082	104082	he	178	“ The Death Eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately . They showed themselves at the Quidditch World Cup , did n’t they ? Someone set off the Dark Mark ... and then — did you hear about that Ministry of Magic witch who ’s gone missing ? ”
104139	104143	104145	104145	Harry	158	“ Bertha Jorkins ? ”
104147	104183	104082	104082	he	178	“ Exactly ... she disappeared in Albania , and that ’s definitely where Voldemort was rumored to be last ... and she would have known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up , would n’t she ? ”
104184	104205	104207	104207	Harry	158	“ Yeah , but ... it ’s not very likely she ’d have walked straight into Voldemort , is it ? ”
104209	104217	104219	104219	Sirius	178	“ Listen , I knew Bertha Jorkins , ”
104222	104280	104219	104219	Sirius	178	“ She was at Hogwarts when I was , a few years above your dad and me . And she was an idiot . Very nosy , but no brains , none at all . It ’s not a good combination , Harry . I ’d say she ’d be very easy to lure into a trap . ”
104281	104294	104296	104296	Harry	158	“ So ... so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament ? ”
104298	104315	104296	104296	Harry	158	“ Is that what you mean ? You think Karkaroff might be here on his orders ? ”
104316	104322	104324	104324	Sirius	178	“ I do n’t know , ”
104327	104398	104324	104324	Sirius	178	“ I just do n’t know ... Karkaroff does n’t strike me as the type who ’d go back to Voldemort unless he knew Voldemort was powerful enough to protect him . But whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a reason , and I ca n’t help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to attack you and make it look like an accident . ”
104399	104412	104414	104414	Harry	158	“ Looks like a really good plan from where I ’m standing , ”
104419	104435	104414	104414	Harry	158	“ They ’ll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff . ”
104436	104442	104444	104444	Sirius	178	“ Right — these dragons , ”
104451	104500	104444	104444	Sirius	178	“ There ’s a way , Harry . Do n’t be tempted to try a Stunning Spell — dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single Stunner , you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon — ”
104501	104511	104513	104513	Harry	158	“ Yeah , I know , I just saw , ”
104515	104523	104525	104525	Sirius	178	“ But you can do it alone , ”
104527	104544	104525	104525	Sirius	178	“ There is a way , and a simple spell ’s all you need . Just — ”
104577	104580	104581	104581	he	158	“ Go ! ”
104586	104594	104581	104581	he	158	“ Go ! There ’s someone coming ! ”
104721	104728	104729	104729	he	171	“ Who were you talking to ? ”
104732	104742	104743	104743	Harry	158	“ What ’s that got to do with you ? ”
104746	104759	104743	104743	Harry	158	“ What are you doing down here at this time of night ? ”
104760	104767	104768	104768	Ron	171	“ I just wondered where you — ”
104774	104784	104768	104768	Ron	171	“ Nothing . I ’m going back to bed . ”
104785	104797	104798	104798	Harry	158	“ Just thought you ’d come nosing around , did you ? ”
104854	104859	104861	104861	Ron	171	“ Sorry about that , ”
104905	104910	104911	104911	Harry	158	“ There you go , ”
104914	104946	104911	104911	Harry	158	“ Something for you to wear on Tuesday . You might even have a scar now , if you ’re lucky ... That ’s what you want , is n’t it ? ”
105167	105180	105181	105181	she	169	“ Let ’s just try and keep you alive until Tuesday evening , ”
105185	105194	105181	105181	she	169	“ and then we can worry about Karkaroff . ”
105259	105291	105357	105357	He	158	“ ‘ Talon - clipping by charms ... treating scale - rot ... ’ This is no good , this is for nutters like Hagrid who want to keep them healthy ... ”
105292	105333	105357	105357	He	158	“ ‘ Dragons are extremely difficult to slay , owing to the ancient magic that imbues their thick hides , which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate ... ’ But Sirius said a simple one would do it ... ”
105334	105344	105346	105346	Harry	158	“ Let ’s try some simple spellbooks , then , ”
105388	105391	105392	105392	Harry	158	“ Hermione , ”
105399	105416	105392	105392	Harry	158	“ will you shut up for a bit , please ? I ’m trying to concentrate . ”
105501	105520	105522	105522	Hermione	169	“ Oh no , he ’s back again , why ca n’t he read on his stupid ship ? ”
105554	105581	105543	105543	himself	205	“ Come on , Harry , we ’ll go back to the common room ... his fan club’ll be here in a moment , twittering away ... ”
105800	105811	105812	105812	Harry	158	“ Hermione , I ’ll see you in the greenhouses , ”
105827	105837	105812	105812	Harry	158	“ Go on , I ’ll catch you up . ”
105838	105853	105817	105817	his	158	“ Harry , you ’ll be late , the bell ’s about to ring — ”
105854	105863	105812	105812	Harry	158	“ I ’ll catch you up , okay ? ”
105993	105998	106000	106000	Cedric	209	“ Do n’t bother , ”
106014	106024	106000	106000	Cedric	209	“ Tell Flitwick I ’m coming , go on ... ”
106072	106075	106077	106077	Cedric	209	“ Hi , ”

106116	106123	106114	106114	Harry	158	“ the first task is dragons . ”
106124	106127	106129	106129	Cedric	209	“ What ? ”
106134	106137	106139	106139	Harry	158	“ Dragons , ”
106158	106179	106146	106147	Professor Flitwick	330	“ They ’ve got four , one for each of us , and we ’ve got to get past them . ”
106205	106210	106211	106211	Cedric	209	“ Are you sure ? ”
106218	106222	106224	106224	Harry	158	“ Dead sure , ”
106226	106232	106224	106224	Harry	158	“ I ’ve seen them . ”
106233	106248	106258	106258	he	158	“ But how did you find out ? We ’re not supposed to know ... ”
106249	106253	106255	106255	Harry	158	“ Never mind , ”
106271	106299	106255	106255	Harry	158	“ But I ’m not the only one who knows . Fleur and Krum will know by now — Maxime and Karkaroff both saw the dragons too . ”
106342	106349	106350	106350	he	209	“ Why are you telling me ? ”
106397	106408	106409	106409	he	158	“ It ’s just ... fair , is n’t it ? ”
106414	106431	106409	106409	he	158	“ We all know now ... we ’re on an even footing , are n’t we ? ”
106468	106475	106476	106476	he	158	“ Come with me , Potter , ”
106479	106486	106476	106476	he	158	“ Diggory , off you go . ”
106498	106511	106494	106494	he	158	“ Er — Professor , I ’m supposed to be in Herbology — ”
106512	106525	106528	106528	him	296	“ Never mind that , Potter . In my office , please ... ”
106644	106657	106658	106658	Moody	296	“ That was a very decent thing you just did , Potter , ”
106681	106685	106687	106687	Moody	296	“ Sit down , ”
106895	106904	106906	106906	Moody	296	“ Like my Dark Detectors , do you ? ”
106914	106919	106920	106920	Harry	158	“ What ’s that ? ”
106930	107015	107016	107016	he	2779	“ Secrecy Sensor . Vibrates when it detects concealment and lies ... no use here , of course , too much interference — students in every direction lying about why they have n’t done their homework . Been humming ever since I got here . I had to disable my Sneakoscope because it would n’t stop whistling . It ’s extra - sensitive , picks up stuff about a mile around . Of course , it could be picking up more than kid stuff , ”
107068	107080	107057	107057	Moody	296	“ So ... found out about the dragons , have you ? ”
107115	107121	107123	107123	Moody	296	“ It ’s all right , ”
107137	107152	107123	107123	Moody	296	“ Cheating ’s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been . ”
107153	107159	107161	107161	Harry	158	“ I did n’t cheat , ”
107164	107177	107161	107161	Harry	158	“ It was — a sort of accident that I found out . ”
107181	107253	107178	107178	Moody	296	“ I was n’t accusing you , laddie . I ’ve been telling Dumbledore from the start , he can be as high - minded as he likes , but you can bet old Karkaroff and Maxime wo n’t be . They ’ll have told their champions everything they can . They want to win . They want to beat Dumbledore . They ’d like to prove he ’s only human . ”
107277	107294	107296	107296	Moody	296	“ So ... got any ideas how you ’re going to get past your dragon yet ? ”
107298	107301	107303	107303	Harry	158	“ No , ”
107305	107316	107318	107318	Moody	296	“ Well , I ’m not going to tell you , ”
107321	107354	107318	107318	Moody	296	“ I do n’t show favoritism , me . I ’m just going to give you some good , general advice . And the first bit is — play to your strengths . ”
107355	107362	107364	107364	Harry	158	“ I have n’t got any , ”
107372	107376	107378	107378	Moody	296	“ Excuse me , ”
107380	107402	107378	107378	Moody	296	“ you ’ve got strengths if I say you ’ve got them . Think now . What are you best at ? ”
107422	107425	107426	107426	he	158	“ Quidditch , ”
107430	107438	107426	107426	he	158	“ and a fat lot of help — ”
107439	107444	107446	107446	Moody	296	“ That ’s right , ”
107462	107475	107446	107446	Moody	296	“ You ’re a damn good flier from what I ’ve heard . ”
107476	107481	107482	107482	Harry	158	“ Yeah , but ... ”
107487	107502	107482	107482	Harry	158	“ I ’m not allowed a broom , I ’ve only got my wand — ”
107503	107511	107513	107513	Moody	296	“ My second piece of general advice , ”
107519	107538	107513	107513	Moody	296	“ is to use a nice , simple spell that will enable you to get what you need . ”
107550	107556	107558	107558	Moody	296	“ Come on , boy ... ”
107560	107571	107558	107558	Moody	296	“ Put them together ... it ’s not that difficult ... ”
107608	107611	107612	107612	Harry	158	“ Hermione , ”
107638	107648	107612	107612	Harry	158	“ Hermione — I need you to help me . ”
107649	107662	107663	107663	she	331	“ What d’you think I ’ve been trying to do , Harry ? ”
107684	107702	107663	107663	she	331	“ Hermione , I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by tomorrow afternoon . ”
107764	107771	107826	107826	Arithmancy	419	“ Concentrate , Harry , concentrate ... ”
107772	107782	107784	107784	Harry	158	“ What d’you think I ’m trying to do ? ”
107787	107807	107784	107784	Harry	158	“ A great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason ... Okay , try again ... ”
107885	107892	107894	107894	Harry	158	“ Well , that ’s good , ”
107905	107924	107894	107894	Harry	158	“ just as long as it ’s not drawn - out . I do n’t want to suffer . ”
108164	108176	108177	108177	Hermione	169	“ That ’s better , Harry , that ’s loads better , ”
108186	108204	108205	108205	Harry	158	“ Well , now we know what to do next time I ca n’t manage a spell , ”
108222	108231	108232	108232	He	158	“ threaten me with a dragon . Right ... ”
108239	108243	108232	108232	He	158	“ Accio Dictionary ! ”
108264	108275	108277	108277	Hermione	169	“ Harry , I really think you ’ve got it ! ”
108280	108289	108290	108290	Harry	158	“ Just as long as it works tomorrow , ”
108293	108330	108290	108290	Harry	158	“ The Firebolt ’s going to be much farther away than the stuff in here , it ’s going to be in the castle , and I ’m going to be out there on the grounds ... ”
108331	108337	108339	108339	Hermione	169	“ That does n’t matter , ”
108342	108377	108339	108339	Hermione	169	“ Just as long as you ’re concentrating really , really hard on it , it ’ll come . Harry , we ’d better get some sleep ... you ’re going to need it . ”
108481	108492	108473	108473	they	2799	“ We ’ll have a box of tissues ready , Potter ”
108618	108642	108612	108614	Lots of people	2802	“ Potter , the champions have to come down onto the grounds now ... You have to get ready for your first task . ”

113288	113385	113285	113285	he	104	“ Remember what Malfoy said on the train , about his dad being friends with Karkaroff ? Now we know where they knew each other . They were probably running around in masks together at the World Cup ... I ’ll tell you one thing , though , Harry , if it was Karkaroff who put your name in the goblet , he ’s going to be feeling really stupid now , is n’t he ? Did n’t work , did it ? You only got a scratch ! Come here — I ’ll do it — ”
113429	113451	113452	113452	Ron	171	“ There ’s no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous , how could they be ? ”
113463	113482	113456	113456	he	171	“ You know what ? I reckon you could win this tournament , Harry , I ’m serious . ”
113530	113545	113546	113546	she	169	“ Harry ’s got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament , ”
113550	113567	113546	113546	she	169	“ If that was the first task , I hate to think what ’s coming next . ”
113568	113579	113581	113581	Ron	171	“ Right little ray of sunshine , are n’t you ? ”
113583	113593	113581	113581	Ron	171	“ You and Professor Trelawney should get together sometime . ”
113672	113701	113669	113669	Ron	171	“ Well , we ’d better get downstairs for your surprise party , Harry — Fred and George should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by now . ”
113868	113875	113877	113878	Lee Jordan	349	“ Blimey , this is heavy , ”
113901	113919	113877	113878	Lee Jordan	349	“ Open it , Harry , go on ! Let ’s just see what ’s inside it ! ”
113920	113933	113934	113934	Hermione	169	“ He ’s supposed to work out the clue on his own , ”
113938	113946	113934	113934	Hermione	169	“ It ’s in the tournament rules ... ”
113947	113965	113966	113966	Harry	158	“ I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too , ”
113982	113993	113994	113995	several people	1918	“ Yeah , go on , Harry , open it ! ”
114083	114087	114088	114088	Fred	175	“ Shut it ! ”
114097	114102	114104	114105	Seamus Finnigan	228	“ What was that ? ”
114118	114138	114104	114105	Seamus Finnigan	228	“ Sounded like a banshee ... Maybe you ’ve got to get past one of those next , Harry ! ”
114139	114146	114148	114148	Neville	315	“ It was someone being tortured ! ”
114164	114176	114148	114148	Neville	315	“ You ’re going to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse ! ”
114177	114190	114192	114192	George	176	“ Do n’t be a prat , Neville , that ’s illegal , ”
114194	114232	114192	114192	George	176	“ They would n’t use the Cruciatus Curse on the champions . I thought it sounded a bit like Percy singing ... maybe you ’ve got to attack him while he ’s in the shower , Harry . ”
114233	114241	114243	114243	Fred	175	“ Want a jam tart , Hermione ? ”
114259	114265	114266	114266	he	158	“ It ’s all right , ”
114269	114289	114266	114266	he	158	“ I have n’t done anything to them . It ’s the custard creams you ’ve got to watch — ”
114310	114318	114307	114307	Fred	175	“ Just my little joke , Neville ... ”
114329	114341	114326	114326	she	169	“ Did you get all this from the kitchens , Fred ? ”
114342	114345	114347	114347	Fred	175	“ Yep , ”
114368	114400	114353	114353	He	158	“ ‘ Anything we can get you , sir , anything at all ! ’ They ’re dead helpful ... get me a roast ox if I said I was peckish . ”
114401	114409	114410	114410	Hermione	169	“ How do you get in there ? ”
114420	114423	114425	114425	Fred	175	“ Easy , ”
114427	114449	114450	114450	He	158	“ concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit . Just tickle the pear , and it giggles and — ”
114458	114461	114450	114450	He	158	“ Why ? ”
114462	114465	114467	114467	Hermione	169	“ Nothing , ”
114470	114488	114490	114490	George	176	“ Going to try and lead the house - elves out on strike now , are you ? ”
114492	114510	114490	114490	George	176	“ Going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellion ? ”
114520	114539	114541	114541	Fred	175	“ Do n’t you go upsetting them and telling them they ’ve got to take clothes and salaries ! ”
114544	114553	114541	114541	Fred	175	“ You ’ll put them off their cooking ! ”
114569	114576	114577	114577	Fred	175	“ Oh — sorry , Neville ! ”
114584	114596	114577	114577	Fred	175	“ I forgot — it was the custard creams we hexed — ”
114627	114631	114632	114632	Fred	175	“ Canary Creams ! ”
114639	114653	114632	114632	Fred	175	“ George and I invented them — seven Sickles each , a bargain ! ”
114890	114901	114902	114902	Hagrid	181	“ I ’m not sure whether they hibernate or not , ”
114915	114942	114902	114902	Hagrid	181	“ Thought we ’d jus ’ try an ’ see if they fancied a kip ... we ’ll jus ’ settle ’em down in these boxes ... ”
115035	115045	115046	115046	Hagrid	181	“ We ’ll jus ’ lead ’em in here , ”
115049	115064	115046	115046	Hagrid	181	“ an ’ put the lids on , and we ’ll see what happens . ”
115096	115107	115091	115091	Hagrid	181	“ Don ’ panic , now , don ’ panic ! ”
115208	115216	115217	115217	Hagrid	181	“ Don ’ frighten him , now ! ”
115253	115278	115217	115217	Hagrid	181	“ Jus ’ try an ’ slip the rope ’ round his sting , so he won ’ hurt any o ’ the others ! ”
115279	115288	115289	115289	Ron	171	“ Yeah , we would n’t want that ! ”
115314	115327	115289	115289	Ron	171	“ Well , well , well ... this does look like fun . ”
115404	115409	115410	115410	Hagrid	181	“ Who ’re you ? ”
115430	115438	115439	115439	Rita	304	“ Rita Skeeter , Daily Prophet reporter , ”
115451	115464	115466	115466	Hagrid	181	“ Thought Dumbledore said you weren ’ allowed inside the school anymore , ”
115500	115508	115509	115509	she	304	“ What are these fascinating creatures called ? ”
115517	115523	115525	115525	Hagrid	181	“ Blast - Ended Skrewts , ”
115527	115530	115532	115532	Rita	304	“ Really ? ”
115540	115555	115532	115532	Rita	304	“ I ’ve never heard of them before ... where do they come from ? ”
115599	115615	115585	115594	Hermione , who seemed to be thinking along these lines	2931	“ They ’re very interesting , are n’t they ? Are n’t they , Harry ? ”
115616	115626	115628	115628	Harry	158	“ What ? Oh yeah ... ouch ... interesting , ”
115636	115645	115650	115650	she	304	“ Ah , you ’re here , Harry ! ”
115654	115672	115650	115650	she	304	“ So you like Care of Magical Creatures , do you ? One of your favorite lessons ? ”
115673	115676	115678	115678	Harry	158	“ Yes , ”
115686	115689	115691	115691	Rita	304	“ Lovely , ”
115693	115701	115702	115702	she	304	“ Really lovely . Been teaching long ? ”
115773	115781	115783	115783	Hagrid	181	“ This is on’y me second year , ”
115785	115840	115783	115783	Hagrid	181	“ Lovely ... I do n’t suppose you ’d like to give an interview , would you ? Share some of your experience of magical creatures ? The Prophet does a zoological column every Wednesday , as I ’m sure you know . We could feature these — er — Bang - Ended Scoots . ”
115841	115847	115848	115848	Hagrid	181	“ Blast - Ended Skrewts , ”
115852	115860	115848	115848	Hagrid	181	“ Er — yeah , why not ? ”
115932	115941	115942	115943	Rita Skeeter	304	“ Well , good - bye , Harry ! ”
115957	115966	115942	115943	Rita Skeeter	304	“ Until Friday night , then , Hagrid ! ”
115967	115975	115976	115976	Harry	158	“ She ’ll twist everything he says , ”
115982	115997	115999	115999	Hermione	169	“ Just as long as he did n’t import those skrewts illegally or anything , ”
116019	116036	116038	116038	Ron	171	“ Hagrid ’s been in loads of trouble before , and Dumbledore ’s never sacked him , ”
116041	116067	116038	116038	Ron	171	“ Worst that can happen is Hagrid’ll have to get rid of the skrewts . Sorry ... did I say worst ? I meant best . ”
116165	116170	116171	116171	she	306	“ I would think , ”
116186	116191	116193	116193	she	306	“ that some of us ”
116200	116269	116193	116193	she	306	“ might be a little less frivolous had they seen what I have seen during my crystal gazing last night . As I sat here , absorbed in my needlework , the urge to consult the orb overpowered me . I arose , I settled myself before it , and I gazed into its crystalline depths ... and what do you think I saw gazing back at me ? ”
116270	116279	116280	116280	Ron	171	“ An ugly old bat in outsize specs ? ”
116295	116301	116286	116286	Harry	158	“ Death , my dears . ”
116316	116319	116321	116322	Professor Trelawney	306	“ Yes , ”
116327	116350	116321	116322	Professor Trelawney	306	“ it comes , ever closer , it circles overhead like a vulture , ever lower ... ever lower over the castle ... ”
116364	116383	116384	116384	Harry	158	“ It ’d be a bit more impressive if she had n’t done it about eighty times before , ”
116402	116427	116384	116384	Harry	158	“ But if I ’d dropped dead every time she ’s told me I ’m going to , I ’d be a medical miracle . ”
116428	116440	116442	116442	Ron	171	“ You ’d be a sort of extra - concentrated ghost , ”
116464	116490	116458	116458	his	5405	“ At least we did n’t get homework . I hope Hermione got loads off Professor Vector , I love not working when she is ... ”
116580	116588	116589	116589	Ron	171	“ Wonder where she ’s got to ? ”
116601	116606	116589	116589	Ron	171	“ Dunno ... balderdash . ”
116630	116633	116634	116634	she	1991	“ Harry ! ”
116656	116680	116634	116634	she	1991	“ Harry , you ’ve got to come — you ’ve got to come , the most amazing thing ’s happened — please — ”
116698	116704	116705	116705	Harry	158	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
116708	116724	116681	116681	She	1991	“ I ’ll show you when we get there — oh come on , quick — ”
116739	116742	116743	116743	Harry	158	“ Okay , ”
116761	116768	116769	116771	the Fat Lady	1991	“ Oh do n’t mind me ! ”
116777	116802	116769	116771	the Fat Lady	1991	“ Do n’t apologize for bothering me ! I ’ll just hang here , wide open , until you get back , shall I ? ”
116803	116808	116809	116809	Ron	171	“ Yeah , thanks ! ”
116815	116823	116824	116824	Harry	158	“ Hermione , where are we going ? ”
116848	116860	116862	116862	Hermione	169	“ You ’ll see , you ’ll see in a minute ! ”
116965	116970	116972	116972	Harry	158	“ Oh hang on ... ”
116980	116987	116972	116972	Harry	158	“ Wait a minute , Hermione ... ”
116988	116991	116992	116992	She	169	“ What ? ”
117006	117014	117016	117016	Harry	158	“ I know what this is about , ”
117038	117041	117043	117043	Ron	171	“ Hermione ! ”
117048	117061	117043	117043	Ron	171	“ You ’re trying to rope us into that spew stuff again ! ”
117062	117071	117072	117072	she	169	“ No , no , I ’m not ! ”
117076	117085	117072	117072	she	169	“ And it ’s not spew , Ron — ”
117086	117094	117096	117096	Ron	171	“ Changed the name , have you ? ”
117102	117138	117096	117096	Ron	171	“ What are we now , then , the House - Elf Liberation Front ? I ’m not barging into that kitchen and trying to make them stop work , I ’m not doing it — ”
117139	117147	117148	117148	Hermione	169	“ I ’m not asking you to ! ”
117152	117182	117148	117148	Hermione	169	“ I came down here just now , to talk to them all , and I found — oh come on , Harry , I want to show you ! ”
117313	117322	117335	117337	the squealing elf	2966	“ Harry Potter , sir ! Harry Potter ! ”
117356	117361	117362	117362	Harry	158	“ D - Dobby ? ”
117365	117375	117335	117337	the squealing elf	2966	“ It is Dobby , sir , it is ! ”
117385	117410	117335	117337	the squealing elf	2966	“ Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see Harry Potter , sir , and Harry Potter has come to see him , sir ! ”
117618	117627	117628	117628	Harry	158	“ Dobby , what ’re you doing here ? ”
117633	117644	117645	117645	Dobby	428	“ Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts , sir ! ”
117649	117660	117645	117645	Dobby	428	“ Professor Dumbledore gave Dobby and Winky jobs , sir ! ”
117661	117664	117666	117666	Harry	158	“ Winky ? ”
117668	117674	117666	117666	Harry	158	“ She ’s here too ? ”
117675	117682	117684	117684	Dobby	428	“ Yes , sir , yes ! ”
117842	117847	117848	117848	he	428	“ Winky , sir ! ”
117950	117955	117957	117957	Harry	158	“ Hello , Winky , ”
117995	117999	118003	118003	She	169	“ Oh dear , ”
118018	118029	118005	118005	Ron	171	“ Winky , do n’t cry , please do n’t ... ”
118049	118059	118060	118060	he	428	“ Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea ? ”
118069	118076	118078	118078	Harry	158	“ Er — yeah , okay , ”
118123	118127	118128	118128	Ron	171	“ Good service ! ”
118155	118165	118166	118166	Harry	158	“ How long have you been here , Dobby ? ”
118175	118185	118187	118187	Dobby	428	“ Only a week , Harry Potter , sir ! ”
118190	118230	118187	118187	Dobby	428	“ Dobby came to see Professor Dumbledore , sir . You see , sir , it is very difficult for a house - elf who has been dismissed to get a new position , sir , very difficult indeed — ”
118262	118280	118281	118281	Dobby	428	“ Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years , sir , trying to find work ! ”
118284	118300	118281	118281	Dobby	428	“ But Dobby has n’t found work , sir , because Dobby wants paying now ! ”
118342	118349	118336	118336	Hermione	169	“ Good for you , Dobby ! ”
118350	118356	118358	118358	Dobby	428	“ Thank you , miss ! ”
118365	118433	118358	118358	Dobby	428	“ But most wizards does n’t want a house - elf who wants paying , miss . ‘ That ’s not the point of a house - elf , ’ they says , and they slammed the door in Dobby ’s face ! Dobby likes work , but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid , Harry Potter ... Dobby likes being free ! ”
118477	118501	118503	118503	Dobby	428	“ And then , Harry Potter , Dobby goes to visit Winky , and finds out Winky has been freed too , sir ! ”
118574	118651	118561	118561	Dobby	428	“ And then Dobby had the idea , Harry Potter , sir ! ‘ Why does n’t Dobby and Winky find work together ? ’ Dobby says . ‘ Where is there enough work for two house - elves ? ’ says Winky . And Dobby thinks , and it comes to him , sir ! Hogwarts ! So Dobby and Winky came to see Professor Dumbledore , sir , and Professor Dumbledore took us on ! ”
118666	118707	118724	118724	Winky	253	“ And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby , sir , if Dobby wants paying ! And so Dobby is a free elf , sir , and Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month ! ”
118708	118715	118716	118716	Hermione	169	“ That ’s not very much ! ”
118733	118747	118749	118749	Dobby	428	“ Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week , and weekends off , ”
118770	118800	118749	118749	Dobby	428	“ but Dobby beat him down , miss ... Dobby likes freedom , miss , but he is n’t wanting too much , miss , he likes work better . ”
118801	118813	118814	118814	Hermione	169	“ And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you , Winky ? ”
118863	118878	118879	118879	she	169	“ Winky is a disgraced elf , but Winky is not yet getting paid ! ”
118882	118900	118879	118879	she	169	“ Winky is not sunk so low as that ! Winky is properly ashamed of being freed ! ”
118901	118904	118906	118906	Hermione	169	“ Ashamed ? ”
118909	118943	118906	118906	Hermione	169	“ But — Winky , come on ! It ’s Mr. Crouch who should be ashamed , not you ! You did n’t do anything wrong , he was really horrible to you — ”

119011	119021	119023	119023	Dobby	428	“ Winky is having trouble adjusting , Harry Potter , ”
119026	119054	119023	119023	Dobby	428	“ Winky forgets she is not bound to Mr. Crouch anymore ; she is allowed to speak her mind now , but she wo n’t do it . ”
119055	119070	119071	119071	Harry	158	“ Ca n’t house - elves speak their minds about their masters , then ? ”
119074	119082	119084	119084	Dobby	428	“ Oh no , sir , no , ”
119090	119151	119084	119084	Dobby	428	“ ’ Tis part of the house - elf ’s enslavement , sir . We keeps their secrets and our silence , sir . We upholds the family ’s honor , and we never speaks ill of them — though Professor Dumbledore told Dobby he does not insist upon this . Professor Dumbledore said we is free to — to — ”
119168	119189	119165	119165	Dobby	428	“ He said we is free to call him a — a barmy old codger if we likes , sir ! ”
119198	119209	119210	119210	he	428	“ But Dobby is not wanting to , Harry Potter , ”
119227	119250	119210	119210	he	428	“ Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore very much , sir , and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for him . ”
119251	119264	119265	119265	Harry	158	“ But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now ? ”
119282	119288	119289	119289	he	428	“ Dobby — Dobby could , ”
119299	119317	119293	119293	He	428	“ Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were — were — bad Dark wizards ! ”
119356	119363	119337	119337	he	428	“ Bad Dobby ! Bad Dobby ! ”
119381	119391	119393	119393	Dobby	428	“ Thank you , Harry Potter , thank you , ”
119400	119409	119410	119410	Harry	158	“ You just need a bit of practice , ”
119413	119416	119418	119418	Winky	253	“ Practice ! ”
119421	119440	119418	119418	Winky	253	“ You is ought to be ashamed of yourself , Dobby , talking that way about your masters ! ”
119441	119451	119453	119453	Dobby	428	“ They is n’t my masters anymore , Winky ! ”
119456	119466	119453	119453	Dobby	428	“ Dobby does n’t care what they think anymore ! ”
119467	119477	119479	119479	Winky	253	“ Oh you is a bad elf , Dobby ! ”
119489	119492	119494	119494	Hermione	169	“ Winky , ”
119497	119520	119494	119494	Hermione	169	“ I ’m quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you . We ’ve seen him , you know — ”
119521	119528	119530	119530	Winky	253	“ You is seeing my master ? ”
119548	119557	119546	119546	Hermione	169	“ You is seeing him here at Hogwarts ? ”
119558	119561	119563	119563	Hermione	169	“ Yes , ”
119565	119577	119563	119563	Hermione	169	“ he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Triwizard Tournament . ”
119578	119584	119586	119586	Winky	253	“ Mr. Bagman comes too ? ”
119616	119643	119611	119611	she	253	“ Mr. Bagman is a bad wizard ! A very bad wizard ! My master is n’t liking him , oh no , not at all ! ”
119644	119649	119651	119651	Harry	158	“ Bagman — bad ? ”
119653	119657	119658	119658	Winky	253	“ Oh yes , ”
119666	119690	119662	119662	her	253	“ My master is telling Winky some things ! But Winky is not saying ... Winky — Winky keeps her master ’s secrets ... ”
119707	119722	119701	119701	her	253	“ Poor master , poor master , no Winky to help him no more ! ”
119763	119776	119777	119777	he	428	“ Dobby is going to buy a sweater next , Harry Potter ! ”
119787	119794	119796	119796	Ron	171	“ Tell you what , Dobby , ”
119810	119840	119796	119796	Ron	171	“ I ’ll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas , I always get one from her . You do n’t mind maroon , do you ? ”
119845	119858	119859	119859	Ron	171	“ We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you , ”
119863	119874	119859	119859	Ron	171	“ but it ’ll go well with your tea cozy . ”
119930	119935	119936	119936	Harry	158	“ Thanks a lot ! ”
119954	119960	119936	119936	Harry	158	“ See you , Dobby ! ”
119961	119975	119976	119976	Dobby	428	“ Harry Potter ... can Dobby come and see you sometimes , sir ? ”
119980	119986	119988	119988	Harry	158	“ ’ Course you can , ”
119994	119999	120001	120001	Ron	171	“ You know what ? ”
120026	120066	120009	120009	Harry	158	“ All these years I ’ve been really impressed with Fred and George , nicking food from the kitchens — well , it ’s not exactly difficult , is it ? They ca n’t wait to give it away ! ”
120067	120086	120088	120088	Hermione	169	“ I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves , you know , ”
120099	120135	120088	120088	Hermione	169	“ Dobby coming to work here , I mean . The other elves will see how happy he is , being free , and slowly it ’ll dawn on them that they want that too ! ”
120136	120149	120151	120151	Harry	158	“ Let ’s hope they do n’t look too closely at Winky , ”
120153	120160	120165	120165	she	169	“ Oh she ’ll cheer up , ”
120171	120201	120165	120165	she	169	“ Once the shock ’s worn off , and she ’s got used to Hogwarts , she ’ll see how much better off she is without that Crouch man . ”
120202	120209	120211	120211	Ron	171	“ She seems to love him , ”
120224	120237	120239	120239	Harry	158	“ Does n’t think much of Bagman , though , does she ? ”
120241	120251	120239	120239	Harry	158	“ Wonder what Crouch says at home about him ? ”
120252	120265	120267	120267	Hermione	169	“ Probably says he ’s not a very good Head of Department , ”
120269	120286	120267	120267	Hermione	169	“ and let ’s face it ... he ’s got a point , has n’t he ? ”
120287	120299	120301	120301	Ron	171	“ I ’d still rather work for him than old Crouch , ”
120303	120314	120301	120301	Ron	171	“ At least Bagman ’s got a sense of humor . ”
120315	120325	120326	120326	Hermione	169	“ Do n’t let Percy hear you saying that , ”
120332	120354	120356	120356	Ron	171	“ Yeah , well , Percy would n’t want to work for anyone with a sense of humor , would he ? ”
120365	120386	120356	120356	Ron	171	“ Percy would n’t recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing Dobby ’s tea cozy . ”
120387	120397	120398	120399	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Potter ! Weasley ! Will you pay attention ? ”
120526	120541	120543	120544	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act their age , ”
120639	120646	120647	120648	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Dress robes will be worn , ”
120651	120675	120647	120648	Professor McGonagall	320	“ and the ball will start at eight o’clock on Christmas Day , finishing at midnight in the Great Hall . Now then — ”
120684	120705	120706	120706	she	320	“ The Yule Ball is of course a chance for us all to — er — let our hair down , ”
120767	120774	120775	120776	Professor McGonagall	320	“ But that does NOT mean , ”
120780	120813	120775	120776	Professor McGonagall	320	“ that we will be relaxing the standards of behavior we expect from Hogwarts students . I will be most seriously displeased if a Gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any way . ”
120845	120855	120838	120839	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Potter — a word , if you please . ”
120893	120902	120877	120878	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Potter , the champions and their partners — ”
120903	120907	120909	120909	Harry	158	“ What partners ? ”
120929	120939	120940	120940	she	320	“ Your partners for the Yule Ball , Potter , ”
120944	120949	120940	120940	she	320	“ Your dance partners . ”
120960	120964	120965	120965	He	158	“ Dance partners ? ”
120971	120977	120978	120978	he	158	“ I do n’t dance , ”
120982	120989	120991	120992	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Oh yes , you do , ”
120995	121015	120991	120992	Professor McGonagall	320	“ That ’s what I ’m telling you . Traditionally , the champions and their partners open the ball . ”
121052	121058	121059	121059	he	158	“ I ’m not dancing , ”
121062	121067	121069	121070	Professor McGonagall	320	“ It is traditional , ”
121073	121107	121069	121070	Professor McGonagall	320	“ You are a Hogwarts champion , and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the school . So make sure you get yourself a partner , Potter . ”
121108	121115	121125	121126	Professor McGonagall	320	“ But — I do n’t — ”
121116	121123	121125	121126	Professor McGonagall	320	“ You heard me , Potter , ”
121337	121347	121348	121348	Harry	158	“ Why do they have to move in packs ? ”
121367	121382	121352	121356	a dozen or so girls	3019	“ How ’re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them ? ”
121383	121387	121388	121388	Ron	171	“ Lasso one ? ”
121391	121402	121388	121388	Ron	171	“ Got any idea who you ’re going to try ? ”
121470	121507	121457	121457	Ron	171	“ Listen , you ’re not going to have any trouble . You ’re a champion . You ’ve just beaten a Hungarian Horntail . I bet they ’ll be queuing up to go with you . ”
121655	121663	121665	121665	Ron	171	“ She was quite good - looking , ”
121674	121683	121685	121685	Harry	158	“ She was a foot taller than me , ”
121690	121703	121685	121685	Harry	158	“ Imagine what I ’d look like trying to dance with her . ”
121715	121725	121708	121708	Krum	205	“ They only like him because he ’s famous ! ”
121929	121946	121947	121947	Hagrid	181	“ She didn ’ seem very int’rested in magical creatures , ter tell yeh the truth , ”

122047	122122	122040	122040	Hagrid	181	“ Well , I told her we ’d been friends since I went ter fetch yeh from the Dursleys . ‘ Never had to tell him off in four years ? ’ she said . ‘ Never played you up in lessons , has he ? ’ I told her no , an ’ she didn ’ seem happy at all . Yeh’d think she wanted me to say yeh were horrible , Harry . ”
122123	122129	122131	122131	Harry	158	“ ’ Course she did , ”
122153	122173	122146	122146	his	158	“ She ca n’t keep writing about what a tragic little hero I am , it ’ll get boring . ”
122174	122183	122185	122185	Ron	171	“ She wants a new angle , Hagrid , ”
122193	122205	122185	122185	Ron	171	“ You were supposed to say Harry ’s a mad delinquent ! ”
122206	122212	122214	122214	Hagrid	181	“ But he ’s not ! ”
122220	122227	122229	122229	Harry	158	“ She should ’ve interviewed Snape , ”
122232	122260	122229	122229	Harry	158	“ He ’d give her the goods on me any day . ‘ Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school ... ’ ”
122261	122268	122270	122270	Hagrid	181	“ Said that , did he ? ”

125566	125593	125561	125561	her	169	“ Just because it ’s taken you three years to notice , Ron , does n’t mean no one else has spotted I ’m a girl ! ”

129644	129650	129642	129642	Harry	158	“ See you in a minute ”
129934	129939	129940	129940	she	169	“ Hi , Harry ! ”

130443	130450	130451	130451	Harry	158	“ Why did n’t he come ? ”
130469	130486	130411	130411	he	187	“ I ’m afraid to say Mr. Crouch is n’t well , not well at all . ”
130500	130502	130494	130495	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Weatherby ”

130688	130711	130712	130712	he	158	“ Vell , ve have a castle also , not as big as this , nor as comfortable , I am thinking , ”
130717	130776	130712	130712	he	158	“ Ve have just four floors , and the fires are lit only for magical purposes . But ve have grounds larger even than these — though in vinter , ve have very little daylight , so ve are not enjoying them . But in summer ve are flying every day , over the lakes and the mountains — ”
130777	130784	130786	130786	Karkaroff	376	“ Now , now , Viktor ! ”
130798	130821	130786	130786	Karkaroff	376	“ do n’t go giving away anything else , now , or your charming friend will know exactly where to find us ! ”
130829	130846	130822	130822	Dumbledore	170	“ Igor , all this secrecy ... one would almost think you did n’t want visitors . ”
130847	130852	130854	130854	Karkaroff	376	“ Well , Dumbledore , ”
130865	130917	130854	130854	Karkaroff	376	“ we are all protective of our private domains , are we not ? Do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us ? Are we not right to be proud that we alone know our school ’s secrets , and right to protect them ? ”
130918	130935	130937	130937	Dumbledore	170	“ Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts ’ secrets , Igor , ”
130940	131043	130937	130937	Dumbledore	170	“ Only this morning , for instance , I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before , containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots . When I went back to investigate more closely , I discovered that the room had vanished . But I must keep an eye out for it . Possibly it is only accessible at five - thirty in the morning . Or it may only appear at the quarter moon — or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder . ”
131081	131086	131087	131087	she	386	“ Zis is nothing , ”
131102	131198	131199	131199	She	386	“ At ze Palace of Beauxbatons , we ’ ave ice sculptures all around ze dining chamber at Chreestmas . Zey do not melt , of course ... zey are like ’ uge statues of diamond , glittering around ze place . And ze food is seemply superb . And we ’ ave choirs of wood nymphs , ’ oo serenade us as we eat . We ’ ave none of zis ugly armor in ze ’ alls , and eef a poltergeist ever entaired into Beauxbatons , ’ e would be expelled like zat . ”
131254	131258	131259	131259	he	158	“ Absolutely right , ”
131276	131282	131259	131259	he	158	“ Like that . Yeah . ”
131357	131362	131353	131353	he	205	“ Hermy - own . ”
131363	131372	131373	131373	she	169	“ Her - my - oh - nee , ”
131379	131386	131353	131353	he	205	“ Herm - own - ninny . ”
131387	131391	131392	131392	she	169	“ Close enough , ”
131564	131568	131569	131569	Parvati	328	“ Come on ! ”
131572	131579	131569	131569	Parvati	328	“ We ’re supposed to dance ! ”

131824	131839	131841	131841	Harry	158	“ Oh — yeah , Dobby the house - elf knitted them for me , ”
131845	131851	131852	131852	Parvati	328	“ He is so creepy ! ”
131859	131870	131852	131852	Parvati	328	“ I do n’t think that eye should be allowed ! ”
131906	131915	131898	131898	Harry	158	“ Let ’s sit down , shall we ? ”
131916	131928	131929	131929	Parvati	328	“ Oh — but — this is a really good one ! ”
131946	131955	131956	131956	Harry	158	“ No , I do n’t like it , ”
132003	132009	132010	132010	Harry	158	“ How ’s it going ? ”
132107	132118	132119	132119	Parvati	328	“ You do n’t mind , do you , Harry ? ”
132122	132125	132127	132127	Harry	158	“ What ? ”
132137	132142	132144	132144	Parvati	328	“ Oh never mind , ”
132189	132192	132194	132194	Harry	158	“ Hi , ”
132202	132211	132216	132216	herself	169	“ It ’s hot , is n’t it ? ”
132221	132231	132216	132216	herself	169	“ Viktor ’s just gone to get some drinks . ”
132239	132242	132243	132243	he	171	“ Viktor ? ”
132246	132258	132243	132243	he	171	“ Has n’t he asked you to call him Vicky yet ? ”
132266	132273	132274	132274	she	169	“ What ’s up with you ? ”
132277	132284	132286	132286	Ron	171	“ If you do n’t know , ”
132289	132298	132286	132286	Ron	171	“ I ’m not going to tell you . ”
132311	132317	132299	132299	Hermione	169	“ Ron , what — ? ”
132318	132324	132326	132326	Ron	171	“ He ’s from Durmstrang ! ”
132328	132343	132344	132344	Ron	171	“ He ’s competing against Harry ! Against Hogwarts ! You — you ’re — ”
132359	132372	132344	132344	Ron	171	“ fraternizing with the enemy , that ’s what you ’re doing ! ”
132379	132386	132387	132387	she	169	“ Do n’t be so stupid ! ”
132393	132434	132387	132387	she	169	“ The enemy ! Honestly — who was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive ? Who was the one who wanted his autograph ? Who ’s got a model of him up in their dormitory ? ”
132441	132459	132435	132435	Ron	171	“ I s’pose he asked you to come with him while you were both in the library ? ”
132460	132466	132468	132468	Hermione	169	“ Yes , he did , ”
132480	132484	132468	132468	Hermione	169	“ So what ? ”
132485	132500	132435	132435	Ron	171	“ What happened — trying to get him to join spew , were you ? ”
132501	132548	132468	132468	Hermione	169	“ No , I was n’t ! If you really want to know , he — he said he ’d been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me , but he had n’t been able to pluck up the courage ! ”
132570	132580	132582	132582	Ron	171	“ Yeah , well — that ’s his story , ”
132585	132594	132468	132468	Hermione	169	“ And what ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
132595	132644	132645	132645	Hermione	169	“ Obvious , is n’t it ? He ’s Karkaroff ’s student , is n’t he ? He knows who you hang around with ... He ’s just trying to get closer to Harry — get inside information on him — or get near enough to jinx him — ”
132662	132681	132655	132655	she	169	“ For your information , he has n’t asked me one single thing about Harry , not one — ”
132691	132723	132682	132682	Ron	171	“ Then he ’s hoping you ’ll help him find out what his egg means ! I suppose you ’ve been putting your heads together during those cozy little library sessions — ”
132724	132735	132737	132737	Hermione	169	“ I ’d never help him work out that egg ! ”
132742	132771	132737	132737	Hermione	169	“ Never . How could you say something like that — I want Harry to win the tournament , Harry knows that , do n’t you , Harry ? ”
132772	132783	132785	132785	Ron	171	“ You ’ve got a funny way of showing it , ”
132787	132807	132809	132809	Hermione	169	“ This whole tournament ’s supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards and making friends with them ! ”
132812	132818	132820	132820	Ron	171	“ No it is n’t ! ”
132822	132828	132820	132820	Ron	171	“ It ’s about winning ! ”
132837	132840	132842	132842	Harry	158	“ Ron , ”
132845	132858	132842	132842	Harry	158	“ I have n’t got a problem with Hermione coming with Krum — ”
132865	132883	132885	132885	Ron	171	“ Why do n’t you go and find Vicky , he ’ll be wondering where you are , ”
132887	132894	132885	132885	Ron	171	“ Do n’t call him Vicky ! ”
132928	132940	132941	132941	Padma	435	“ Are you going to ask me to dance at all ? ”
132945	132948	132950	132950	Ron	171	“ No , ”
132957	132960	132962	132962	Padma	435	“ Fine , ”
133005	133014	132995	132995	he	158	“ Vare is Herm - own - ninny ? ”
133030	133034	133036	133036	Ron	171	“ No idea , ”
133044	133051	133036	133036	Ron	171	“ Lost her , have you ? ”
133058	133072	133073	133073	he	205	“ Vell , if you see her , tell her I haff drinks , ”
133081	133093	133094	133094	Percy	248	“ Made friends with Viktor Krum , have you , Ron ? ”
133108	133124	133094	133094	Percy	248	“ Excellent ! That ’s the whole point , you know — international magical cooperation ! ”
133226	133240	133241	133241	Percy	248	“ What do they think they ’re doing , annoying senior Ministry members ? ”
133250	133254	133241	133241	Percy	248	“ No respect ... ”
133280	133293	133295	133295	Percy	248	“ I hope my brothers were n’t bothering you , Mr. Bagman ? ”
133299	133311	133313	133313	Bagman	202	“ What ? Oh not at all , not at all ! ”
133315	133364	133313	133313	Bagman	202	“ No , they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs . Wondering if I could advise them on the marketing . I ’ve promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at Zonko ’s Joke Shop ... ”
133434	133460	133462	133462	he	202	“ How do you feel the tournament ’s going , Mr. Bagman ? Our department ’s quite satisfied — the hitch with the Goblet of Fire ”
133467	133491	133462	133462	he	202	“ was a little unfortunate , of course , but it seems to have gone very smoothly since , do n’t you think ? ”
133492	133496	133497	133497	Bagman	202	“ Oh yes , ”
133501	133521	133497	133497	Bagman	202	“ it ’s all been enormous fun . How ’s old Barty doing ? Shame he could n’t come . ”
133522	133538	133540	133540	Percy	248	“ Oh I ’m sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no time , ”
133543	133551	133552	133552	Ron	171	“ Let ’s go for a walk , ”
133557	133563	133552	133552	Ron	171	“ get away from Percy ... ”
133689	133703	133795	133795	Snape	390	“ ... do n’t see what there is to fuss about , Igor . ”
133704	133716	133717	133717	Karkaroff	376	“ Severus , you can not pretend this is n’t happening ! ”
133733	133756	133717	133717	Karkaroff	376	“ It ’s been getting clearer and clearer for months . I am becoming seriously concerned , I ca n’t deny it — ”
133757	133761	133763	133763	Snape	390	“ Then flee , ”
133768	133786	133763	133763	Snape	390	“ Flee — I will make your excuses . I , however , am remaining at Hogwarts . ”
133828	133836	133837	133837	Snape	390	“ Ten points from Ravenclaw , Fawcett ! ”
133846	133856	133837	133837	Snape	390	“ And ten points from Hufflepuff too , Stebbins ! ”
133865	133873	133874	133874	he	1781	“ And what are you two doing ? ”
133919	133924	133925	133925	Ron	171	“ We ’re walking , ”
133930	133939	133925	133925	Ron	171	“ Not against the law , is it ? ”
133940	133946	133947	133947	Snape	390	“ Keep walking , then ! ”
133979	133987	133988	133988	Ron	171	“ What ’s got Karkaroff all worried ? ”
133991	134006	134008	134008	Harry	158	“ And since when have he and Snape been on first - name terms ? ”

She wasn ’ really the maternal sort . Well ... it ’s not in their natures , is it ? Dunno what happened to her ... might be dead fer all I know ... ”

135249	135279	135242	135242	Ron	171	“ I always thought he ’d got in the way of a bad Engorgement Charm when he was a kid or something . Did n’t like to mention it ... ”
135280	135293	135295	135295	Harry	158	“ But what ’s it matter if his mother was a giantess ? ”
135297	135317	135319	135319	Ron	171	“ Well ... no one who knows him will care , ’cos they ’ll know he ’s not dangerous , ”
135322	135371	135319	135319	Ron	171	“ But ... Harry , they ’re just vicious , giants . It ’s like Hagrid said , it ’s in their natures , they ’re like trolls ... they just like killing , everyone knows that . There are n’t any left in Britain now , though . ”
135372	135378	135242	135242	Ron	171	“ What happened to them ? ”
135379	135414	135319	135319	Ron	171	“ Well , they were dying out anyway , and then loads got themselves killed by Aurors . There ’re supposed to be giants abroad , though ... They hide out in mountains mostly ... ”
135415	135427	135428	135428	Harry	158	“ I do n’t know who Maxime thinks she ’s kidding , ”
135446	135475	135432	135433	Madame Maxime	293	“ If Hagrid ’s half - giant , she definitely is . Big bones ... the only thing that ’s got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur . ”
135652	135657	135648	135648	someone	717	“ Hey — Harry ! ”
135676	135679	135681	135681	Harry	158	“ Yeah ? ”
135725	135728	135729	135729	Cedric	209	“ Listen ... ”
135737	135763	135729	135729	Cedric	209	“ I owe you one for telling me about the dragons . You know that golden egg ? Does yours wail when you open it ? ”
135764	135767	135769	135769	Harry	158	“ Yeah , ”
135771	135780	135729	135729	Cedric	209	“ Well ... take a bath , okay ? ”
135781	135784	135729	135729	Cedric	209	“ What ? ”
135785	135822	135729	135729	Cedric	209	“ Take a bath , and — er — take the egg with you , and — er — just mull things over in the hot water . It ’ll help you think ... Trust me . ”
135828	135833	135834	135834	Cedric	209	“ Tell you what , ”
135837	135878	135834	135834	Cedric	209	“ use the prefects ’ bathroom . Fourth door to the left of that statue of Boris the Bewildered on the fifth floor . Password ’s ‘ pine fresh . ’ Got ta go ... want to say good night — ”
135971	135975	135967	135967	Harry	158	“ Fairy lights ! ”
136026	136047	136049	136049	Hermione	169	“ Well , if you do n’t like it , you know what the solution is , do n’t you ? ”
136072	136076	136077	136077	Ron	171	“ Oh yeah ? ”
136081	136086	136077	136077	Ron	171	“ What ’s that ? ”
136087	136109	136077	136077	Ron	171	“ Next time there ’s a ball , ask me before someone else does , and not as a last resort ! ”
136142	136145	136146	136146	he	158	“ Well , ”
136152	136164	136146	136146	he	158	“ well — that just proves — completely missed the point — ”
136261	136274	136275	136275	she	169	“ but it ’s way too much bother to do every day , ”
136364	136373	136374	136374	she	169	“ Well , I thought he must be , ”
136379	136434	136374	136374	she	169	“ I knew he could n’t be pure giant because they ’re about twenty feet tall . But honestly , all this hysteria about giants . They ca n’t all be horrible ... It ’s the same sort of prejudice that people have toward werewolves ... It ’s just bigotry , is n’t it ? ”
136976	136989	136990	136990	she	3308	“ Hurry up , now , the bell rang five minutes ago , ”
137003	137008	137010	137010	Ron	171	“ Who ’re you ? ”
137016	137021	137010	137010	Ron	171	“ Where ’s Hagrid ? ”
137022	137031	137032	137032	she	3308	“ My name is Professor Grubbly - Plank , ”
137036	137047	137032	137032	she	3308	“ I am your temporary Care of Magical Creatures teacher . ”
137048	137053	137054	137054	Harry	158	“ Where ’s Hagrid ? ”
137058	137063	137065	137068	Professor Grubbly - Plank	449	“ He is indisposed , ”
137115	137121	137123	137126	Professor Grubbly - Plank	449	“ This way , please , ”
137176	137183	137184	137184	Harry	158	“ What ’s wrong with Hagrid ? ”
137197	137202	137203	137203	she	449	“ Never you mind , ”
137214	137221	137223	137223	Harry	158	“ I do mind , though , ”
137226	137233	137223	137223	Harry	158	“ What ’s up with him ? ”
137290	137293	137288	137289	the girls	1099	“ ooooohed ! ”
137301	137308	137310	137311	Lavender Brown	354	“ Oh it ’s so beautiful ! ”
137313	137330	137310	137311	Lavender Brown	354	“ How did she get it ? They ’re supposed to be really hard to catch ! ”
137363	137368	137370	137373	Professor Grubbly - Plank	449	“ Boys keep back ! ”
137387	137414	137381	137381	Harry	158	“ They prefer the woman ’s touch , unicorns . Girls to the front , and approach with care , come on , easy does it ... ”
137453	137470	137451	137451	Ron	171	“ What d’you reckon ’s wrong with him ? You do n’t think a skrewt — ? ”
137471	137489	137491	137491	Malfoy	257	“ Oh he has n’t been attacked , Potter , if that ’s what you ’re thinking , ”
137494	137510	137491	137491	Malfoy	257	“ No , he ’s just too ashamed to show his big , ugly face . ”
137511	137516	137518	137518	Harry	158	“ What d’you mean ? ”
137540	137545	137546	137546	he	257	“ There you go , ”
137549	137559	137546	137546	he	257	“ Hate to break it to you , Potter ... ”
137603	137611	137612	137612	he	257	“ I was just having some fun , ”
137636	137643	137644	137644	he	158	“ How did she find out ? ”
137656	137668	137669	137669	Harry	158	“ What d’you mean , ‘ we all hate Hagrid ’ ? ”
137674	137681	137683	137683	he	158	“ What ’s this rubbish about him ”
137688	137704	137683	137683	he	158	“ getting a bad bite off a flobberworm ? They have n’t even got teeth ! ”
137715	137732	137734	137734	Malfoy	257	“ Well , I think this should put an end to the oaf ’s teaching career , ”
137740	137793	137736	137736	his	257	“ Half - giant ... and there was me thinking he ’d just swallowed a bottle of Skele - Gro when he was young ... None of the mummies and daddies are going to like this at all ... They ’ll be worried he ’ll eat their kids , ha , ha ... ”
137794	137798	137736	137736	his	257	“ You — . ”
137799	137807	137736	137736	his	257	“ Are you paying attention over there ? ”
137880	137889	137891	137892	Parvati Patil	328	“ I hope she stays , that woman ! ”
137910	137933	137891	137892	Parvati Patil	328	“ That ’s more what I thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like ... proper creatures like unicorns , not monsters ... ”
137934	137939	137940	137940	Harry	158	“ What about Hagrid ? ”
137950	137955	137957	137957	Parvati	328	“ What about him ? ”
137963	137974	137957	137957	Parvati	328	“ He can still be gamekeeper , ca n’t he ? ”
138040	138048	138050	138050	Hermione	169	“ That was a really good lesson , ”
138058	138075	138050	138050	Hermione	169	“ I did n’t know half the things Professor Grubbly - Plank told us about uni — ”
138076	138081	138086	138086	he	158	“ Look at this ! ”
138116	138134	138086	138086	he	158	“ How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out ? You do n’t think Hagrid told her ? ”
138135	138138	138140	138140	Harry	158	“ No , ”
138159	138196	138152	138152	himself	158	“ He never even told us , did he ? I reckon she was so mad he would n’t give her loads of horrible stuff about me , she went ferreting around to get him back . ”
138197	138209	138211	138211	Hermione	169	“ Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball , ”
138214	138224	138226	138226	Ron	171	“ We ’d have seen her in the garden ! ”
138228	138247	138226	138226	Ron	171	“ Anyway , she ’s not supposed to come into school anymore , Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her ... ”
138248	138257	138259	138259	Harry	158	“ Maybe she ’s got an Invisibility Cloak , ”
138275	138294	138259	138259	Harry	158	“ Sort of thing she ’d do , is n’t it , hide in bushes listening to people . ”
138295	138305	138307	138307	Hermione	169	“ Like you and Ron did , you mean , ”
138309	138318	138320	138320	Ron	171	“ We were n’t trying to hear him ! ”
138323	138347	138320	138320	Ron	171	“ We did n’t have any choice ! The stupid prat , talking about his giantess mother where anyone could have heard him ! ”
138348	138358	138360	138360	Harry	158	“ We ’ve got to go and see him , ”
138362	138382	138383	138383	he	158	“ This evening , after Divination . Tell him we want him back ... you do want him back ? ”
138388	138430	138431	138431	Hermione	169	“ I — well , I ’m not going to pretend it did n’t make a nice change , having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once — but I do want Hagrid back , of course I do ! ”
138479	138486	138487	138487	Harry	158	“ Hagrid , it ’s us ! ”
138495	138499	138487	138487	Harry	158	“ Open up ! ”
138548	138556	138557	138557	Hermione	169	“ What ’s he avoiding us for ? ”
138573	138589	138557	138557	Hermione	169	“ He surely does n’t think we ’d care about him being half - giant ? ”
138657	138665	138666	138666	he	257	“ Missing your half - breed pal ? ”
138688	138695	138666	138666	he	257	“ Missing the elephant - man ? ”
138716	138733	138734	138734	she	169	“ I just thought you ’d want to take advantage of the common room being quiet , ”
138737	138746	138734	138734	she	169	“ Really get to work on that egg . ”
138747	138766	138767	138767	Harry	158	“ Oh I — I reckon I ’ve got a pretty good idea what it ’s about now , ”
138770	138775	138777	138777	Hermione	169	“ Have you really ? ”
138782	138786	138777	138777	Hermione	169	“ Well done ! ”
138935	138940	138942	138942	Harry	158	“ He ’s mad ! ”
138961	138971	138942	138942	Harry	158	“ It must be freezing , it ’s January ! ”
138972	138983	138985	138985	Hermione	169	“ It ’s a lot colder where he comes from , ”
138987	138997	138985	138985	Hermione	169	“ I suppose it feels quite warm to him . ”
138998	139009	139011	139011	Ron	171	“ Yeah , but there ’s still the giant squid , ”
139035	139044	139045	139045	she	169	“ He ’s really nice , you know , ”
139048	139074	139045	139045	she	169	“ He ’s not at all like you ’d think , coming from Durmstrang . He likes it much better here , he told me . ”
139232	139242	139243	139243	Hermione	169	“ Does n’t he ever go into the office ? ”
139247	139250	139243	139243	Hermione	169	“ Look ! ”
139387	139396	139399	139399	him	202	“ In a moment , in a moment ! ”
139422	139425	139426	139426	he	202	“ Harry ! ”
139429	139446	139426	139426	he	202	“ How are you ? Been hoping to run into you ! Everything going all right ? ”
139447	139452	139454	139454	Harry	158	“ Fine , thanks , ”
139456	139470	139472	139472	Bagman	202	“ Wonder if I could have a quick , private word , Harry ? ”
139475	139490	139472	139472	Bagman	202	“ You could n’t give us a moment , you two , could you ? ”
139491	139496	139498	139498	Ron	171	“ Er — okay , ”
139525	139546	139548	139548	Bagman	202	“ Well , I just thought I ’d congratulate you again on your splendid performance against that Horntail , Harry , ”
139550	139554	139548	139548	Bagman	202	“ Really superb . ”
139555	139558	139560	139560	Harry	158	“ Thanks , ”
139634	139638	139640	139640	Bagman	202	“ Absolute nightmare , ”
139662	139668	139669	139669	Harry	158	“ What do they want ? ”
139683	139688	139690	139690	Bagman	202	“ Er — well ... ”
139696	139708	139690	139690	Bagman	202	“ They ... er ... they ’re looking for Barty Crouch . ”
139709	139718	139720	139720	Harry	158	“ Why are they looking for him here ? ”
139722	139735	139720	139720	Harry	158	“ He ’s at the Ministry in London , is n’t he ? ”
139736	139753	139755	139755	Bagman	202	“ Er ... as a matter of fact , I ’ve no idea where he is , ”
139757	139849	139755	139755	Bagman	202	“ He ’s sort of ... stopped coming to work . Been absent for a couple of weeks now . Young Percy , his assistant , says he ’s ill . Apparently he ’s just been sending instructions in by owl . But would you mind not mentioning that to anyone , Harry ? Because Rita Skeeter ’s still poking around everywhere she can , and I ’m willing to bet she ’d work up Barty ’s illness into something sinister . Probably say he ’s gone missing like Bertha Jorkins . ”
139850	139859	139860	139860	Harry	158	“ Have you heard anything about Bertha Jorkins ? ”
139863	139866	139868	139868	Bagman	202	“ No , ”
139874	139884	139868	139868	Bagman	202	“ I ’ve got people looking , of course ... ”
139892	139985	139987	139987	he	3365	“ and it ’s all very strange . She definitely arrived in Albania , because she met her second cousin there . And then she left the cousin ’s house to go south and see an aunt ... and she seems to have vanished without trace en route . Blowed if I can see where she ’s got to ... she does n’t seem the type to elope , for instance ... but still ... What are we doing , talking about goblins and Bertha Jorkins ? I really wanted to ask you ”
139992	140003	139989	139989	his	3365	“ how are you getting on with your golden egg ? ”
140004	140010	140011	140011	Harry	158	“ Er ... not bad , ”
140025	140030	140031	140031	he	202	“ Listen , Harry , ”
140042	140068	140070	140070	his	202	“ I feel very bad about all this ... you were thrown into this tournament , you did n’t volunteer for it ... and if ... ”
140085	140124	140070	140070	his	202	“ if I can help at all ... a prod in the right direction ... I ’ve taken a liking to you ... the way you got past that dragon ! ... well , just say the word . ”
140144	140159	140160	140160	he	158	“ We ’re supposed to work out the clues alone , are n’t we ? ”
140192	140199	140201	140201	Bagman	202	“ Well ... well , yes , ”
140204	140223	140201	140201	Bagman	202	“ but — come on , Harry — we all want a Hogwarts victory , do n’t we ? ”
140224	140231	140232	140232	Harry	158	“ Have you offered Cedric help ? ”
140245	140252	140253	140253	he	158	“ No , I have n’t , ”
140256	140279	140253	140253	he	158	“ I — well , like I say , I ’ve taken a liking to you . Just thought I ’d offer ... ”
140280	140285	140287	140287	Harry	158	“ Well , thanks , ”
140289	140308	140287	140287	Harry	158	“ but I think I ’m nearly there with the egg ... couple more days should crack it . ”
140375	140381	140383	140383	Fred	175	“ Hello , Mr. Bagman , ”
140386	140394	140383	140383	Fred	175	“ Can we buy you a drink ? ”
140395	140400	140402	140402	Bagman	202	“ Er ... no , ”
140412	140420	140402	140402	Bagman	202	“ no , thank you , boys ... ”
140444	140451	140452	140452	he	202	“ Well , I must dash , ”
140455	140466	140452	140452	he	202	“ Nice seeing you all . Good luck , Harry . ”
140494	140500	140501	140501	Ron	171	“ What did he want ? ”
140511	140522	140524	140524	Harry	158	“ He offered to help me with the golden egg , ”
140526	140534	140536	140536	Hermione	169	“ He should n’t be doing that ! ”
140542	140564	140536	140536	Hermione	169	“ He ’s one of the judges ! And anyway , you ’ve already worked it out — have n’t you ? ”
140565	140570	140572	140572	Harry	158	“ Er ... nearly , ”
140574	140597	140599	140599	Hermione	169	“ Well , I do n’t think Dumbledore would like it if he knew Bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat ! ”
140606	140618	140599	140599	Hermione	169	“ I hope he ’s trying to help Cedric as much ! ”
140619	140627	140629	140629	Harry	158	“ He ’s not , I asked , ”
140631	140640	140642	140642	Ron	171	“ Who cares if Diggory ’s getting help ? ”
140648	140657	140659	140659	Hermione	169	“ Those goblins did n’t look very friendly , ”
140665	140672	140659	140659	Hermione	169	“ What were they doing here ? ”
140673	140682	140684	140684	Harry	158	“ Looking for Crouch , according to Bagman , ”
140686	140698	140684	140684	Harry	158	“ He ’s still ill . Has n’t been into work . ”
140699	140706	140708	140708	Ron	171	“ Maybe Percy ’s poisoning him , ”
140710	140730	140708	140708	Ron	171	“ Probably thinks if Crouch snuffs it he ’ll be made Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation . ”
140751	140776	140731	140731	Hermione	169	“ Funny , goblins looking for Mr. Crouch ... They ’d normally deal with the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures . ”
140777	140788	140790	140790	Harry	158	“ Crouch can speak loads of different languages , though , ”
140792	140799	140790	140790	Harry	158	“ Maybe they need an interpreter . ”
140800	140813	140814	140814	Ron	171	“ Worrying about poor ’ ickle goblins , now , are you ? ”
140818	140835	140814	140814	Ron	171	“ Thinking of starting up S.P.U.G. or something ? Society for the Protection of Ugly Goblins ? ”
140836	140843	140845	140845	Hermione	169	“ Ha , ha , ha , ”
140848	140872	140845	140845	Hermione	169	“ Goblins do n’t need protection . Have n’t you been listening to what Professor Binns has been telling us about goblin rebellions ? ”
140873	140876	140878	140878	Harry	158	“ No , ”
140883	140895	140897	140897	Hermione	169	“ Well , they ’re quite capable of dealing with wizards , ”
140905	140926	140897	140897	Hermione	169	“ They ’re very clever . They ’re not like house - elves , who never stick up for themselves . ”
140927	140932	140934	140934	Ron	171	“ Uh - oh , ”
141017	141122	141006	141006	She	304	“ ... did n’t seem very keen to talk to us , did he , Bozo ? Now , why would that be , do you think ? And what ’s he doing with a pack of goblins in tow anyway ? Showing them the sights ... what nonsense ... he was always a bad liar . Reckon something ’s up ? Think we should do a bit of digging ? ‘ Disgraced Ex - Head of Magical Games and Sports , Ludo Bagman ... ’ Snappy start to a sentence , Bozo — we just need to find a story to fit it — ”
141123	141132	141134	141134	Harry	158	“ Trying to ruin someone else ’s life ? ”
141159	141162	141163	141163	she	304	“ Harry ! ”
141168	141181	141163	141163	she	304	“ How lovely ! Why do n’t you come and join — ? ”
141182	141196	141198	141198	Harry	158	“ I would n’t come near you with a ten - foot broomstick , ”
141201	141213	141198	141198	Harry	158	“ What did you do that to Hagrid for , eh ? ”
141222	141240	141217	141217	her	304	“ Our readers have a right to the truth , Harry . I am merely doing my — ”
141241	141251	141252	141252	Harry	158	“ Who cares if he ’s half - giant ? ”
141255	141263	141252	141252	Harry	158	“ There ’s nothing wrong with him ! ”
141335	141373	141315	141315	she	304	“ How about giving me an interview about the Hagrid you know , Harry ? The man behind the muscles ? Your unlikely friendship and the reasons behind it . Would you call him a father substitute ? ”
141393	141398	141399	141399	she	304	“ You horrible woman , ”
141406	141433	141399	141399	she	304	“ you do n’t care , do you , anything for a story , and anyone will do , wo n’t they ? Even Ludo Bagman — ”
141434	141454	141460	141460	her	304	“ Sit down , you silly little girl , and do n’t talk about things you do n’t understand , ”
141469	141489	141490	141490	she	304	“ I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl ... not that it needs it — ”
141499	141504	141506	141506	Hermione	169	“ Let ’s go , ”
141508	141516	141506	141506	Hermione	169	“ c’m on , Harry — Ron ... ”
141564	141574	141576	141576	Ron	171	“ She ’ll be after you next , Hermione , ”

141608	141637	141602	141602	she	169	“ I ’ll show her ! Silly little girl , am I ? Oh , I ’ll get her back for this . First Harry , then Hagrid ... ”
141638	141649	141651	141651	Ron	171	“ You do n’t want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter , ”
141654	141669	141651	141651	Ron	171	“ I ’m serious , Hermione , she ’ll dig up something on you — ”
141670	141688	141690	141690	Hermione	169	“ My parents do n’t read the Daily Prophet . She ca n’t scare me into hiding ! ”
141734	141759	141725	141725	she	169	“ And Hagrid is n’t hiding anymore ! He should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him ! Come on ! ”
141810	141813	141814	141814	Hermione	169	“ Hagrid ! ”
141823	141872	141814	141814	Hermione	169	“ Hagrid , that ’s enough ! We know you ’re in there ! Nobody cares if your mum was a giantess , Hagrid ! You ca n’t let that foul Skeeter woman do this to you ! Hagrid , get out here , you ’re just being — ”
141880	141885	141877	141877	Hermione	169	“ About t — ! ”
141913	141917	141918	141918	he	170	“ Good afternoon , ”
141927	141938	141940	141940	Hermione	169	“ We — er — we wanted to see Hagrid , ”
141947	141955	141957	141957	Dumbledore	170	“ Yes , I surmised as much , ”
141963	141971	141959	141959	his	170	“ Why do n’t you come in ? ”
141972	141979	141981	141981	Hermione	169	“ Oh ... um ... okay , ”
142084	142089	142091	142091	Harry	158	“ Hi , Hagrid , ”
142097	142101	142102	142102	he	181	“ ’ Lo , ”
142110	142117	142119	142119	Dumbledore	170	“ More tea , I think , ”
142179	142194	142176	142176	Dumbledore	170	“ Did you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was shouting , Hagrid ? ”
142208	142236	142201	142201	Dumbledore	170	“ Hermione , Harry , and Ron still seem to want to know you , judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door . ”
142237	142247	142248	142248	Harry	158	“ Of course we still want to know you ! ”
142255	142269	142270	142270	he	158	“ You do n’t think anything that Skeeter cow — sorry , Professor , ”
142278	142295	142297	142297	Dumbledore	170	“ I have gone temporarily deaf and have n’t any idea what you said , Harry , ”
142308	142313	142315	142315	Harry	158	“ Er — right , ”
142318	142341	142315	142315	Harry	158	“ I just meant — Hagrid , how could you think we ’d care what that — woman — wrote about you ? ”
142362	142375	142377	142377	Dumbledore	170	“ Living proof of what I ’ve been telling you , Hagrid , ”
142387	142428	142377	142377	Dumbledore	170	“ I have shown you the letters from the countless parents who remember you from their own days here , telling me in no uncertain terms that if I sacked you , they would have something to say about it — ”
142429	142435	142437	142437	Hagrid	181	“ Not all of ’em , ”
142440	142451	142437	142437	Hagrid	181	“ Not all of ’em wan ’ me ter stay . ”
142452	142481	142483	142483	Dumbledore	170	“ Really , Hagrid , if you are holding out for universal popularity , I ’m afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time , ”
142495	142543	142483	142483	Dumbledore	170	“ Not a week has passed since I became headmaster of this school when I have n’t had at least one owl complaining about the way I run it . But what should I do ? Barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybody ? ”
142544	142553	142555	142555	Hagrid	181	“ Yeh — yeh’re not half - giant ! ”
142558	142569	142570	142570	Harry	158	“ Hagrid , look what I ’ve got for relatives ! ”
142574	142580	142570	142570	Harry	158	“ Look at the Dursleys ! ”
142581	142586	142588	142589	Professor Dumbledore	170	“ An excellent point , ”
142591	142659	142588	142589	Professor Dumbledore	170	“ My own brother , Aberforth , was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat . It was all over the papers , but did Aberforth hide ? No , he did not ! He held his head high and went about his business as usual ! Of course , I ’m not entirely sure he can read , so that may not have been bravery ... ”
142660	142668	142670	142670	Hermione	169	“ Come back and teach , Hagrid , ”
142673	142683	142670	142670	Hermione	169	“ please come back , we really miss you . ”

142831	142842	142829	142829	Ron	171	“ Can I have one of these cakes , Hagrid ? ”
142843	142847	142849	142849	Hagrid	181	“ Help yerself , ”

143011	143024	143025	143025	Hagrid	181	“ Tha ’ was taken jus ’ after I got inter Hogwarts , ”

Yeh don ’ have ter be ashamed of what yeh are . It ’d show ’em Dumbledore ’s the one who ’s got it righ ’ , lettin ’ anyone in as long as they can do magic . How you doin’ with that egg , Harry ? ”
143271	143274	143276	143276	Harry	158	“ Great , ”

144907	144910	144912	144912	Myrtle	434	“ Sometimes , ”
144917	144930	144912	144912	Myrtle	434	“ but I ’ve never come out to speak to anyone before . ”

145338	145347	145348	145348	she	434	“ Well , that ’s what Diggory thought , ”
145351	145374	145348	145348	she	434	“ He lay there talking to himself for ages about it . Ages and ages ... nearly all the bubbles had gone ... ”

145408	145434	145405	145405	she	434	“ I sometimes go down there ... sometimes do n’t have any choice , if someone flushes my toilet when I ’m not expecting it ... ”
145459	145474	145456	145456	Harry	158	“ Well , does anything in there have a human voice ? Hang on — ”

146994	147030	146990	146990	he	378	“ I ’m coming to get you , Peeves ... You ’ve gone and stolen a Triwizard clue , Peeves ... Dumbledore’ll have you out of here for this , you filthy , pilfering poltergeist ... ”
147140	147148	147127	147127	Filch	378	“ Filch ? What ’s going on ? ”

147259	147269	147247	147247	Snape	390	“ But Peeves could n’t get into my office ... ”
147270	147280	147315	147315	Snape	390	“ This egg was in your office , Professor ? ”
147281	147286	147287	147287	Snape	390	“ Of course not , ”
147290	147297	147287	147287	Snape	390	“ I heard banging and wailing — ”
147298	147304	147315	147315	Snape	390	“ But Peeves could n’t — ”
147305	147314	147315	147315	Snape	390	“ I know he could n’t , Filch ! ”
147319	147334	147315	147315	Snape	390	“ I seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break ! ”
147353	147369	147335	147335	Snape	390	“ I want you to come and help me search for the intruder , Filch . ”
147370	147379	147315	147315	Snape	390	“ I — yes , Professor — but — ”
147453	147460	147462	147462	Filch	378	“ The thing is , Professor , ”
147465	147503	147462	147462	Filch	378	“ the headmaster will have to listen to me this time . Peeves has been stealing from a student , it might be my chance to get him thrown out of the castle once and for all — ”
147504	147525	147562	147562	Moody	296	“ Filch , I do n’t give a damn about that wretched poltergeist ; it ’s my office that ’s — ”
147580	147587	147588	147588	he	296	“ Pajama party , is it ? ”
147594	147604	147606	147606	Filch	378	“ Professor Snape and I heard noises , Professor , ”
147610	147634	147606	147606	Filch	378	“ Peeves the Poltergeist , throwing things around as usual — and then Professor Snape discovered that someone had broken into his off — ”
147635	147639	147640	147640	Snape	333	“ Shut up ! ”
147764	147773	147774	147774	he	296	“ Did I hear that correctly , Snape ? ”
147778	147785	147774	147774	he	296	“ Someone broke into your office ? ”
147786	147791	147793	147793	Snape	333	“ It is unimportant , ”
147796	147801	147803	147803	Moody	296	“ On the contrary , ”
147805	147820	147803	147803	Moody	296	“ it is very important . Who ’d want to break into your office ? ”
147821	147828	147830	147830	Snape	333	“ A student , I daresay , ”
147845	147870	147803	147803	Moody	296	“ It has happened before . Potion ingredients have gone missing from my private store cupboard ... students attempting illicit mixtures , no doubt ... ”
147871	147881	147883	147883	Moody	296	“ Reckon they were after potion ingredients , eh ? ”
147885	147897	147883	147883	Moody	296	“ Not hiding anything else in your office , are you ? ”
147922	147932	147933	147933	he	333	“ You know I ’m hiding nothing , Moody , ”
147942	147953	147933	147933	he	333	“ as you ’ve searched my office pretty thoroughly yourself . ”
147962	147977	147954	147954	Moody	296	“ Auror ’s privilege , Snape . Dumbledore told me to keep an eye — ”
147978	147985	147987	147987	Snape	333	“ Dumbledore happens to trust me , ”
147992	148007	147987	147987	Snape	333	“ I refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my office ! ”
148008	148015	148017	148017	Moody	296	“ ’ Course Dumbledore trusts you , ”
148019	148063	148017	148017	Moody	296	“ He ’s a trusting man , is n’t he ? Believes in second chances . But me — I say there are spots that do n’t come off , Snape . Spots that never come off , d’you know what I mean ? ”
148094	148102	148091	148091	Moody	296	“ Get back to bed , Snape . ”
148103	148115	148116	148116	Snape	333	“ You do n’t have the authority to send me anywhere ! ”
148130	148146	148116	148116	Snape	333	“ I have as much right to prowl this school after dark as you do ! ”
148147	148151	148153	148153	Moody	296	“ Prowl away , ”
148163	148186	148156	148156	his	296	“ I look forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some time ... You ’ve dropped something , by the way ... ”
148249	148256	148231	148231	he	158	“ It ’s mine ! Mine ! ”
148274	148278	148257	148257	Snape	333	“ Accio Parchment ! ”
148304	148308	148309	148309	Moody	296	“ My mistake , ”
148313	148324	148309	148309	Moody	296	“ It ’s mine — must ’ve dropped it earlier — ”
148364	148367	148368	148368	he	296	“ Potter , ”
148372	148377	148379	148379	Moody	296	“ What ’s that ? ”
148390	148393	148394	148394	Snape	333	“ Potter ! ”
148421	148458	148415	148415	he	296	“ That egg is Potter ’s egg . That piece of parchment belongs to Potter . I have seen it before , I recognize it ! Potter is here ! Potter , in his Invisibility Cloak ! ”
148512	148520	148522	148522	Moody	296	“ There ’s nothing there , Snape ! ”
148524	148543	148522	148522	Moody	296	“ but I ’ll be happy to tell the headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to Harry Potter ! ”
148544	148548	148549	148549	Snape	333	“ Meaning what ? ”
148568	148586	148588	148588	Moody	296	“ Meaning that Dumbledore ’s very interested to know who ’s got it in for that boy ! ”
148600	148611	148588	148588	Moody	296	“ And so am I , Snape ... very interested ... ”
148675	148680	148682	148682	Snape	333	“ I merely thought , ”
148691	148722	148682	148682	Snape	333	“ that if Potter was wandering around after hours again ... it ’s an unfortunate habit of his ... he should be stopped . For — for his own safety . ”
148723	148729	148731	148731	Moody	296	“ Ah , I see , ”
148734	148746	148731	148731	Moody	296	“ Got Potter ’s best interests at heart , have you ? ”
148788	148798	148799	148799	Snape	333	“ I think I will go back to bed , ”
148803	148812	148814	148814	Moody	296	“ Best idea you ’ve had all night , ”
148816	148830	148814	148814	Moody	296	“ Now , Filch , if you ’ll just give me that egg — ”
148831	148834	148836	148836	Filch	378	“ No ! ”
148849	148861	148836	148836	Filch	378	“ Professor Moody , this is evidence of Peeves ’ treachery ! ”
148862	148875	148877	148877	Moody	346	“ It ’s the property of the champion he stole it from , ”
148879	148886	148877	148877	Moody	346	“ Hand it over , now . ”
148953	148976	148950	148951	Mrs. Norris	458	“ Never mind , my sweet ... we ’ll see Dumbledore in the morning ... tell him what Peeves was up to ... ”
149013	149019	149020	149020	he	346	“ Close shave , Potter , ”
149023	149032	149034	149034	Harry	158	“ Yeah ... I — er ... thanks , ”
149037	149043	149045	149045	Moody	346	“ What is this thing ? ”
149060	149065	149067	149067	Harry	158	“ Map of Hogwarts , ”
149089	149094	149095	149095	Moody	346	“ Merlin ’s beard , ”
149109	149119	149095	149095	Moody	346	“ This ... this is some map , Potter ! ”
149120	149129	149130	149130	Harry	158	“ Yeah , it ’s ... quite useful , ”
149143	149157	149130	149130	Harry	158	“ Er — Professor Moody , d’you think you could help me — ? ”
149158	149170	149171	149171	Moody	346	“ What ? Oh ! Yes ... yes , of course ... ”
149208	149211	149212	149212	he	346	“ Potter ... ”
149216	149245	149212	149212	he	346	“ you did n’t happen , by any chance , to see who broke into Snape ’s office , did you ? On this map , I mean ? ”
149246	149254	149255	149255	Harry	158	“ Er ... yeah , I did ... ”
149258	149264	149255	149255	Harry	158	“ It was Mr. Crouch . ”
149283	149286	149287	149287	he	346	“ Crouch ? ”
149290	149300	149287	149287	he	346	“ You ’re — you ’re sure , Potter ? ”
149301	149304	149306	149306	Harry	158	“ Positive , ”
149308	149317	149319	149319	Moody	346	“ Well , he ’s not here anymore , ”
149329	149339	149319	149319	Moody	346	“ Crouch ... that ’s very — very interesting ... ”
149399	149418	149387	149387	Moody	346	“ Er ... Professor Moody ... why d’you reckon Mr. Crouch wanted to look around Snape ’s office ? ”
149466	149474	149475	149475	Moody	346	“ Put it this way , Potter , ”
149479	149505	149475	149475	Moody	346	“ they say old Mad - Eye ’s obsessed with catching Dark wizards ... but I ’m nothing — nothing — compared to Barty Crouch . ”
149521	149525	149526	149526	he	158	“ Professor Moody ? ”
149530	149552	149526	149526	he	158	“ D’you think ... could this have anything to do with ... maybe Mr. Crouch thinks there ’s something going on ... ”
149553	149557	149559	149559	Moody	346	“ Like what ? ”
149596	149602	149603	149603	Harry	158	“ I do n’t know , ”
149606	149641	149603	149603	Harry	158	“ odd stuff ’s been happening lately , has n’t it ? It ’s been in the Daily Prophet ... the Dark Mark at the World Cup , and the Death Eaters and everything ... ”
149650	149659	149660	149660	he	158	“ You ’re a sharp boy , Potter , ”
149674	149683	149684	149684	he	346	“ Crouch could be thinking along those lines , ”
149688	149723	149684	149684	he	346	“ Very possible ... there have been some funny rumors flying around lately — helped along by Rita Skeeter , of course . It ’s making a lot of people nervous , I reckon . ”
149732	149742	149743	149743	he	346	“ Oh if there ’s one thing I hate , ”
149769	149779	149743	149743	he	346	“ it ’s a Death Eater who walked free ... ”
149795	149808	149810	149810	Moody	346	“ And now I want to ask you a question , Potter , ”
149901	149907	149899	149899	himself	158	“ Can I borrow this ? ”
149908	149911	149913	149913	Harry	158	“ Oh ! ”
149956	149961	149950	149950	he	158	“ Yeah , okay . ”
149962	149966	149968	149968	Moody	346	“ Good boy , ”
149970	150001	149968	149968	Moody	346	“ I can make good use of this ... this might be exactly what I ’ve been looking for ... Right , bed , Potter , come on , now ... ”
150054	150067	150046	150046	he	346	“ You ever thought of a career as an Auror , Potter ? ”
150068	150071	150073	150073	Harry	158	“ No , ”
150078	150085	150087	150087	Moody	346	“ You want to consider it , ”
150096	150119	150087	150087	Moody	346	“ Yes , indeed ... and incidentally ... I ’m guessing you were n’t just taking that egg for a walk tonight ? ”
150120	150125	150127	150127	Harry	158	“ Er — no , ”
150131	150140	150127	150127	Harry	158	“ I ’ve been working out the clue . ”
150153	150172	150173	150173	He	346	“ Nothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas , Potter ... See you in the morning ... ”
150320	150332	150334	150334	Hermione	169	“ You said you ’d already worked out that egg clue ! ”
150337	150343	150345	150345	Harry	158	“ Keep your voice down ! ”
150348	150364	150345	150345	Harry	158	“ I just need to — sort of fine - tune it , all right ? ”
150489	150501	150502	150502	Harry	158	“ Just forget the egg for a minute , all right ? ”
150521	150533	150505	150506	Professor Flitwick	330	“ I ’m trying to tell you about Snape and Moody ... ”
150578	150589	150590	150590	Ron	171	“ Snape said Moody ’s searched his office as well ? ”
150623	150642	150599	150599	he	171	“ What ... d’you reckon Moody ’s here to keep an eye on Snape as well as Karkaroff ? ”
150643	150665	150667	150667	Harry	158	“ Well , I dunno if that ’s what Dumbledore asked him to do , but he ’s definitely doing it , ”
150692	150712	150670	150670	his	158	“ Moody said Dumbledore only lets Snape stay here because he ’s giving him a second chance or something ... ”
150713	150716	150718	150718	Ron	171	“ What ? ”
150746	150762	150742	150742	Flitwick	330	“ Harry ... maybe Moody thinks Snape put your name in the Goblet of Fire ! ”
150763	150767	150769	150769	Hermione	169	“ Oh Ron , ”
150776	150800	150772	150772	her	169	“ we thought Snape was trying to kill Harry before , and it turned out he was saving Harry ’s life , remember ? ”
150902	150911	150912	150912	Hermione	169	“ I do n’t care what Moody says , ”
150916	150961	150912	150912	Hermione	169	“ Dumbledore ’s not stupid . He was right to trust Hagrid and Professor Lupin , even though loads of people would n’t have given them jobs , so why should n’t he be right about Snape , even if Snape is a bit — ”
150962	150966	150968	150968	Ron	171	“ — evil , ”
150971	150990	150968	150968	Ron	171	“ Come on , Hermione , why are all these Dark wizard catchers searching his office , then ? ”
150991	151002	151004	151004	Hermione	169	“ Why has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill ? ”
151009	151049	151004	151004	Hermione	169	“ It ’s a bit funny , is n’t it , that he ca n’t manage to come to the Yule Ball , but he can get up here in the middle of the night when he wants to ? ”
151050	151064	151066	151066	Ron	171	“ You just do n’t like Crouch because of that elf , Winky , ”
151076	151088	151090	151090	Hermione	169	“ You just want to think Snape ’s up to something , ”
151101	151123	151125	151125	Harry	158	“ I just want to know what Snape did with his first chance , if he ’s on his second one , ”
151331	151351	151352	151352	Hermione	169	“ Of course , the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into a submarine or something , ”
151355	151393	151352	151352	Hermione	169	“ If only we ’d done human Transfiguration already ! But I do n’t think we start that until sixth year , and it can go badly wrong if you do n’t know what you ’re doing ... ”
151394	151412	151414	151414	Harry	158	“ Yeah , I do n’t fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head , ”
151416	151436	151414	151414	Harry	158	“ I s’pose I could always attack someone in front of Moody ; he might do it for me ... ”
151437	151457	151459	151459	Hermione	169	“ I do n’t think he ’d let you choose what you wanted to be turned into , though , ”
151462	151476	151459	151459	Hermione	169	“ No , I think your best chance is some sort of charm . ”
151834	151839	151841	151841	Hermione	169	“ Weekend after next , ”
151853	151867	151841	151841	Hermione	169	“ Here — take my quill and send this owl back straight away . ”
151933	151947	151949	151949	Ron	171	“ What ’s he want to know about the next Hogsmeade weekend for ? ”
151951	151954	151956	151956	Harry	158	“ Dunno , ”
151976	151985	151956	151956	Harry	158	“ Come on ... Care of Magical Creatures . ”
152132	152135	152137	152137	Hagrid	181	“ Harry , ”

Merchieftainess Murcus has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake , and we have therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions , as follows ... Fleur Delacour , though she demonstrated excellent use of the Bubble - Head Charm , was attacked by grindylows as she approached her goal , and failed to retrieve her hostage . We award her twenty - five points . ”
159631	159636	159642	159642	her	386	“ I deserved zero , ”
159646	159680	159684	159688	the Hufflepuffs in the crowd	3706	“ Cedric Diggory , who also used the Bubble - Head Charm , was first to return with his hostage , though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour . ”

159783	159838	159780	159780	Bagman	202	“ He returned last , and well outside the time limit of an hour . However , the Merchieftainess informs us that Mr. Potter was first to reach the hostages , and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety , not merely his own . ”
159854	159860	159864	159864	Bagman	202	“ Most of the judges , ”
159872	159896	159864	159864	Bagman	202	“ feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks . However ... Mr. Potter ’s score is forty - five points . ”

160605	160611	160602	160602	Harry	158	“ if he ’s caught ... ”
160612	160624	160626	160626	Ron	171	“ Made it so far , though , has n’t he ? ”
160628	160642	160626	160626	Ron	171	“ And it ’s not like the place is swarming with dementors anymore . ”
160756	160765	160766	160766	she	401	“ There they are , there they are ! ”
160818	160831	160832	160832	Pansy	401	“ You might find something to interest you in there , Granger ! ”
160950	160956	160958	160959	Pansy Parkinson	401	“ She ’s really ugly , ”
160970	160998	160958	160959	Pansy Parkinson	401	“ but she ’d be well up to making a Love Potion , she ’s quite brainy . I think that ’s how she ’s doing it . ”
161048	161053	161054	161054	Ron	171	“ I told you ! ”
161066	161091	161054	161054	Ron	171	“ I told you not to annoy Rita Skeeter ! She ’s made you out to be some sort of — of scarlet woman ! ”
161101	161105	161106	161106	she	169	“ Scarlet woman ? ”
161120	161129	161130	161130	Ron	171	“ It ’s what my mum calls them , ”
161138	161154	161162	161162	she	169	“ If that ’s the best Rita can do , she ’s losing her touch , ”
161173	161181	161162	161162	she	169	“ What a pile of old rubbish . ”
161242	161250	161252	161252	Hermione	169	“ There ’s something funny , though , ”
161268	161277	161252	161252	Hermione	169	“ How could Rita Skeeter have known ... ? ”
161278	161282	161284	161284	Ron	171	“ Known what ? ”
161287	161300	161284	161284	Ron	171	“ You have n’t been mixing up Love Potions , have you ? ”
161301	161307	161308	161308	Hermione	169	“ Do n’t be stupid , ”
161319	161340	161315	161315	her	169	“ No , it ’s just ... how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer ? ”
161355	161358	161360	161360	Ron	171	“ What ? ”
161370	161385	161386	161386	Hermione	169	“ He asked me right after he ’d pulled me out of the lake , ”
161389	161443	161386	161386	Hermione	169	“ After he ’d got rid of his shark ’s head . Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they would n’t hear , and he said , if I was n’t doing anything over the summer , would I like to — ”
161444	161451	161453	161453	Ron	171	“ And what did you say ? ”
161484	161500	161501	161501	Hermione	169	“ And he did say he ’d never felt the same way about anyone else , ”
161520	161559	161518	161518	her	169	“ but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him ? She was n’t there ... or was she ? Maybe she has got an Invisibility Cloak ; maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task ... ”
161560	161567	161568	161568	Ron	171	“ And what did you say ? ”
161583	161599	161568	161568	Ron	171	“ Well , I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were okay to — ”
161600	161612	161518	161518	her	169	“ Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is , Miss Granger , ”
161628	161646	161622	161625	all three of them	1494	“ I must ask you not to discuss it in my class . Ten points from Gryffindor . ”
161683	161694	161695	161695	Snape	333	“ Ah ... reading magazines under the table as well ? ”
161706	161719	161695	161695	Snape	333	“ A further ten points from Gryffindor ... oh but of course ... ”
161734	161745	161720	161720	Snape	333	“ Potter has to keep up with his press cuttings ... ”
161778	161809	161770	161770	he	333	“ ‘ Harry Potter ’s Secret Heartache ’ ... dear , dear , Potter , what ’s ailing you now ? ‘ A boy like no other , perhaps ... ’ ”
161852	161882	161884	161884	Snape	333	“ ‘ ... Harry Potter ’s well - wishers must hope that , next time , he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate . ’ How very touching , ”
161899	161960	161884	161884	Snape	333	“ Well , I think I had better separate the three of you , so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives . Weasley , you stay here . Miss Granger , over there , beside Miss Parkinson . Potter — that table in front of my desk . Move . Now . ”
162028	162044	162046	162046	Snape	333	“ All this press attention seems to have inflated your already overlarge head , Potter , ”
162103	162121	162122	162122	Snape	333	“ You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire Wizarding world is impressed with you , ”
162158	162195	162134	162134	him	333	“ but I do n’t care how many times your picture appears in the papers . To me , Potter , you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him . ”
162241	162251	162252	162252	Snape	333	“ So I give you fair warning , Potter , ”
162262	162282	162252	162252	Snape	333	“ pint - sized celebrity or not — if I catch you breaking into my office one more time — ”
162283	162293	162295	162295	Harry	158	“ I have n’t been anywhere near your office ! ”
162303	162310	162311	162311	Snape	333	“ Do n’t lie to me , ”
162323	162343	162311	162311	Snape	333	“ Boomslang skin . Gillyweed . Both come from my private stores , and I know who stole them . ”
162423	162434	162435	162435	Harry	158	“ I do n’t know what you ’re talking about , ”
162439	162454	162455	162455	Snape	333	“ You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into ! ”
162458	162501	162455	162455	Snape	333	“ I know it , Potter ! Now , Mad - Eye Moody might have joined your fan club , but I will not tolerate your behavior ! One more nighttime stroll into my office , Potter , and you will pay ! ”
162502	162505	162507	162507	Harry	158	“ Right , ”
162517	162535	162507	162507	Harry	158	“ I ’ll bear that in mind if I ever get the urge to go in there . ”
162595	162605	162606	162606	Snape	333	“ Do you know what this is , Potter ? ”
162615	162618	162620	162620	Harry	158	“ No , ”
162628	162655	162657	162657	Snape	333	“ It is Veritaserum — a Truth Potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear , ”
162660	162691	162693	162693	he	333	“ Now , the use of this potion is controlled by very strict Ministry guidelines . But unless you watch your step , you might just find that my hand slips ”
162700	162728	162693	162693	he	333	“ right over your evening pumpkin juice . And then , Potter ... then we ’ll find out whether you ’ve been in my office or not . ”
162898	162901	162903	162903	Snape	333	“ Enter , ”
162947	162953	162955	162955	Karkaroff	376	“ We need to talk , ”
163006	163018	163019	163019	Snape	333	“ I ’ll talk to you after my lesson , Karkaroff , ”
163027	163049	163023	163023	Karkaroff	376	“ I want to talk now , while you ca n’t slip off , Severus . You ’ve been avoiding me . ”
163050	163055	163056	163056	Snape	333	“ After the lesson , ”
163182	163188	163191	163191	Snape	333	“ What ’s so urgent ? ”
163196	163199	163201	163201	Karkaroff	376	“ This , ”
163235	163238	163240	163240	Karkaroff	376	“ Well ? ”
163252	163267	163240	163240	Karkaroff	376	“ Do you see ? It ’s never been this clear , never since — ”
163268	163273	163275	163275	Snape	333	“ Put it away ! ”
163284	163291	163292	163292	Karkaroff	376	“ But you must have noticed — ”
163299	163307	163309	163309	Snape	333	“ We can talk later , Karkaroff ! ”
163311	163319	163309	163309	Snape	333	“ Potter ! What are you doing ? ”
163320	163329	163331	163331	Harry	158	“ Clearing up my armadillo bile , Professor , ”
163673	163678	163680	163680	Harry	158	“ Hello , Sirius , ”
164029	164032	164033	164033	he	178	“ Chicken ! ”
164070	164073	164075	164075	Sirius	178	“ Thanks , ”
164101	164126	164098	164098	his	178	“ I ’ve been living off rats mostly . Ca n’t steal too much food from Hogsmeade ; I ’d draw attention to myself . ”
164141	164150	164151	164151	he	158	“ What ’re you doing here , Sirius ? ”
164154	164161	164163	164163	Sirius	178	“ Fulfilling my duty as godfather , ”
164176	164192	164163	164163	Sirius	178	“ Do n’t worry about it , I ’m pretending to be a lovable stray . ”
164211	164266	164193	164193	He	178	“ I want to be on the spot . Your last letter ... well , let ’s just say things are getting fishier . I ’ve been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out , and by the looks of things , I ’m not the only one who ’s getting worried . ”
164298	164311	164267	164267	He	178	“ What if they catch you ? What if you ’re seen ? ”
164312	164330	164332	164332	Sirius	178	“ You three and Dumbledore are the only ones around here who know I ’m an Animagus , ”
164431	164442	164444	164444	Harry	158	“ They ’re making it sound like he ’s dying , ”
164447	164463	164444	164444	Harry	158	“ But he ca n’t be that ill if he managed to get up here ... ”
164464	164473	164474	164474	Ron	171	“ My brother ’s Crouch ’s personal assistant , ”
164478	164487	164474	164474	Ron	171	“ He says Crouch is suffering from overwork . ”
164488	164505	164507	164507	Harry	158	“ Mind you , he did look ill , last time I saw him up close , ”
164515	164526	164507	164507	Harry	158	“ The night my name came out of the goblet ... ”
164527	164539	164541	164541	Hermione	169	“ Getting his comeuppance for sacking Winky , is n’t he ? ”
164563	164590	164549	164549	She	169	“ I bet he wishes he had n’t done it now — bet he feels the difference now she ’s not there to look after him . ”
164591	164600	164601	164601	Ron	171	“ Hermione ’s obsessed with house - elves , ”
164619	164627	164612	164612	Sirius	178	“ Crouch sacked his house - elf ? ”
164628	164637	164639	164639	Harry	158	“ Yeah , at the Quidditch World Cup , ”
164694	164701	164702	164702	he	158	“ Let me get this straight , ”
164714	164734	164702	164702	he	158	“ You first saw the elf in the Top Box . She was saving Crouch a seat , right ? ”
164735	164738	164740	164740	Harry	158	“ Right , ”
164748	164759	164702	164702	he	158	“ But Crouch did n’t turn up for the match ? ”
164760	164763	164765	164765	Harry	158	“ No , ”
164767	164778	164765	164765	Harry	158	“ I think he said he ’d been too busy . ”
164792	164811	164789	164789	he	178	“ Harry , did you check your pockets for your wand after you ’d left the Top Box ? ”
164812	164815	164816	164816	Harry	158	“ Erm ... ”
164820	164823	164824	164824	he	158	“ No , ”
164828	164863	164864	164864	He	158	“ I did n’t need to use it before we got in the forest . And then I put my hand in my pocket , and all that was in there were my Omnioculars . ”
164869	164885	164864	164864	He	158	“ Are you saying whoever conjured the Mark stole my wand in the Top Box ? ”
164886	164891	164893	164893	Sirius	178	“ It ’s possible , ”
164895	164903	164904	164904	Hermione	169	“ Winky did n’t steal that wand ! ”
164907	164919	164921	164921	Sirius	178	“ The elf was n’t the only one in that box , ”
164932	164940	164927	164927	he	178	“ Who else was sitting behind you ? ”
164941	164946	164948	164948	Harry	158	“ Loads of people , ”
164950	164961	164948	164948	Harry	158	“ Some Bulgarian ministers ... Cornelius Fudge ... the Malfoys ... ”
164962	164966	164968	164968	Ron	171	“ The Malfoys ! ”
164989	164997	164985	164985	his	179	“ I bet it was Lucius Malfoy ! ”
164998	165002	165004	165004	Sirius	178	“ Anyone else ? ”
165006	165010	165012	165012	Harry	158	“ No one , ”
165014	165025	165028	165028	him	158	“ Yes , there was , there was Ludo Bagman , ”
165030	165034	165026	165026	Hermione	169	“ Oh yeah ... ”
165035	165055	165057	165057	Sirius	178	“ I do n’t know anything about Bagman except that he used to be Beater for the Wimbourne Wasps , ”
165062	165068	165057	165057	Sirius	178	“ What ’s he like ? ”
165069	165074	165076	165076	Harry	158	“ He ’s okay , ”
165078	165090	165076	165076	Harry	158	“ He keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard Tournament . ”
165091	165097	165099	165099	Sirius	178	“ Does he , now ? ”
165105	165114	165099	165099	Sirius	178	“ I wonder why he ’d do that ? ”
165115	165125	165127	165127	Harry	158	“ Says he ’s taken a liking to me , ”
165129	165132	165134	165134	Sirius	178	“ Hmm , ”
165139	165153	165156	165156	Sirius	178	“ We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared , ”
165158	165161	165162	165162	she	169	“ Remember ? ”
165169	165184	165186	165186	Ron	171	“ Yeah , but he did n’t stay in the forest , did he ? ”
165188	165205	165186	165186	Ron	171	“ The moment we told him about the riot , he went off to the campsite . ”
165206	165211	165212	165212	Hermione	169	“ How d’you know ? ”
165216	165225	165212	165212	Hermione	169	“ How d’you know where he Disapparated to ? ”
165226	165231	165233	165233	Ron	171	“ Come off it , ”
165236	165249	165233	165233	Ron	171	“ Are you saying you reckon Ludo Bagman conjured the Dark Mark ? ”
165250	165261	165263	165263	Hermione	169	“ It ’s more likely he did it than Winky , ”
165266	165270	165272	165272	Ron	171	“ Told you , ”
165279	165288	165272	165272	Ron	171	“ told you she ’s obsessed with house — ”
165299	165324	165290	165290	Sirius	178	“ When the Dark Mark had been conjured , and the elf had been discovered holding Harry ’s wand , what did Crouch do ? ”
165325	165333	165335	165335	Harry	158	“ Went to look in the bushes , ”
165337	165346	165335	165335	Harry	158	“ but there was n’t anyone else there . ”
165347	165351	165352	165352	Sirius	178	“ Of course , ”
165360	165383	165352	165352	Sirius	178	“ of course , he ’d want to pin it on anyone but his own elf ... and then he sacked her ? ”
165384	165387	165389	165389	Hermione	169	“ Yes , ”
165395	165415	165389	165389	Hermione	169	“ he sacked her , just because she had n’t stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled — ”
165416	165429	165431	165431	Ron	171	“ Hermione , will you give it a rest with the elf ! ”
165440	165481	165435	165435	his	178	“ She ’s got the measure of Crouch better than you have , Ron . If you want to know what a man ’s like , take a good look at how he treats his inferiors , not his equals . ”
165495	165580	165482	165482	He	178	“ All these absences of Barty Crouch ’s ... he goes to the trouble of making sure his house - elf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup , but does n’t bother to turn up and watch . He works very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament , and then stops coming to that too ... It ’s not like Crouch . If he ’s ever taken a day off work because of illness before this , I ’ll eat Buckbeak . ”
165581	165588	165590	165590	Harry	158	“ D’you know Crouch , then ? ”
165625	165633	165634	165634	he	178	“ Oh I know Crouch all right , ”
165638	165659	165634	165634	he	178	“ He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban — without a trial . ”
165660	165663	165665	165665	Ron	171	“ What ? ”
165670	165675	165677	165677	Harry	158	“ You ’re kidding ! ”
165679	165686	165688	165688	Sirius	178	“ No , I ’m not , ”
165697	165716	165688	165688	Sirius	178	“ Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement , did n’t you know ? ”
165727	165738	165740	165740	Sirius	178	“ He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic , ”
165742	165766	165767	165767	he	178	“ He ’s a great wizard , Barty Crouch , powerfully magical — and power - hungry . Oh never a Voldemort supporter , ”
165778	165817	165767	165767	he	178	“ No , Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against the Dark Side . But then a lot of people who were against the Dark Side ... well , you would n’t understand ... you ’re too young ... ”
165818	165830	165832	165832	Ron	171	“ That ’s what my dad said at the World Cup , ”
165843	165852	165840	165840	his	171	“ Try us , why do n’t you ? ”
165862	165871	165872	165872	Sirius	178	“ All right , I ’ll try you ... ”
165876	165913	165872	165872	Sirius	178	“ Crouch ’s own son was caught with a group of Death Eaters who ’d managed to talk their way out of Azkaban . Apparently they were trying to find Voldemort and return him to power . ”
165914	165921	165923	165923	Hermione	169	“ Crouch ’s son was caught ? ”
165925	165928	165930	165930	Sirius	178	“ Yep , ”
165958	166006	165940	165940	himself	178	“ Nasty little shock for old Barty , I ’d imagine . Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family , should n’t he ? Ought to have left the office early once in a while ... gotten to know his own son . ”
166017	166025	166027	166027	Harry	158	“ Was his son a Death Eater ? ”
166029	166033	166035	166035	Sirius	178	“ No idea , ”
166042	166107	166035	166035	Sirius	178	“ I was in Azkaban myself when he was brought in . This is mostly stuff I ’ve found out since I got out . The boy was definitely caught in the company of people I ’d bet my life were Death Eaters — but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time , just like the house - elf . ”
166108	166118	166119	166119	Hermione	169	“ Did Crouch try and get his son off ? ”
166135	166252	166122	166122	Sirius	178	“ Crouch let his son off ? I thought you had the measure of him , Hermione ! Anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go ; he had dedicated his whole life to becoming Minister of Magic . You saw him dismiss a devoted house - elf because she associated him with the Dark Mark again — does n’t that tell you what he ’s like ? Crouch ’s fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial , and by all accounts , it was n’t much more than an excuse for Crouch to show how much he hated the boy ... then he sent him straight to Azkaban . ”
166253	166263	166265	166265	Harry	158	“ He gave his own son to the dementors ? ”
166268	166273	166275	166275	Sirius	178	“ That ’s right , ”
166286	166358	166278	166278	he	178	“ I saw the dementors bringing him in , watched them through the bars in my cell door . He ca n’t have been more than nineteen . They took him into a cell near mine . He was screaming for his mother by nightfall . He went quiet after a few days , though ... they all went quiet in the end ... except when they shrieked in their sleep ... ”
166384	166392	166393	166393	Harry	158	“ So he ’s still in Azkaban ? ”
166396	166399	166401	166401	Sirius	178	“ No , ”
166404	166425	166401	166401	Sirius	178	“ No , he ’s not in there anymore . He died about a year after they brought him in . ”
166426	166430	166573	166573	Sirius	178	“ He died ? ”
166431	166439	166441	166441	Sirius	178	“ He was n’t the only one , ”
166444	166572	166441	166441	Sirius	178	“ Most go mad in there , and plenty stop eating in the end . They lose the will to live . You could always tell when a death was coming , because the dementors could sense it , they got excited . That boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived . Crouch being an important Ministry member , he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit . That was the last time I saw Barty Crouch , half carrying his wife past my cell . She died herself , apparently , shortly afterward . Grief . Wasted away just like the boy . Crouch never came for his son ’s body . The dementors buried him outside the fortress ; I watched them do it . ”
166598	166615	166616	166616	he	178	“ So old Crouch lost it all , just when he thought he had it made , ”
166710	166721	166722	166722	Harry	158	“ Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards , ”
166726	166743	166745	166745	Sirius	178	“ Yeah , I ’ve heard it ’s become a bit of a mania with him , ”
166749	166772	166745	166745	Sirius	178	“ If you ask me , he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more Death Eater . ”
166773	166785	166787	166787	Ron	171	“ And he sneaked up here to search Snape ’s office ! ”
166794	166806	166808	166808	Sirius	178	“ Yes , and that does n’t make sense at all , ”
166810	166816	166818	166818	Ron	171	“ Yeah , it does ! ”
166827	166867	166824	166824	his	178	“ Listen , if Crouch wants to investigate Snape , why has n’t he been coming to judge the tournament ? It would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to Hogwarts and keep an eye on him . ”
166868	166881	166883	166883	Harry	158	“ So you think Snape could be up to something , then ? ”
166890	166905	166824	166824	his	178	“ Look , I do n’t care what you say , Dumbledore trusts Snape — ”
166906	166915	166917	166917	Ron	171	“ Oh give it a rest , Hermione , ”
166920	166944	166917	166917	Ron	171	“ I know Dumbledore ’s brilliant and everything , but that does n’t mean a really clever Dark wizard could n’t fool him — ”
166945	166969	166824	166824	his	178	“ Why did Snape save Harry ’s life in the first year , then ? Why did n’t he just let him die ? ”
166970	166983	166917	166917	Ron	171	“ I dunno — maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out — ”
166984	166991	166992	166992	Harry	158	“ What d’you think , Sirius ? ”
167005	167015	167017	167017	Sirius	178	“ I think they ’ve both got a point , ”
167037	167145	167026	167026	Sirius	178	“ Rosier and Wilkes — they were both killed by Aurors the year before Voldemort fell . The Lestranges — they ’re a married couple — they ’re in Azkaban . Avery — from what I ’ve heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying he ’d been acting under the Imperius Curse — he ’s still at large . But as far as I know , Snape was never even accused of being a Death Eater — not that that means much . Plenty of them were never caught . And Snape ’s certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble . ”
167146	167161	167163	167163	Ron	171	“ Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well , but he wants to keep that quiet , ”
167165	167183	167185	167185	Harry	158	“ Yeah , you should ’ve seen Snape ’s face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday ! ”
167188	167226	167185	167185	Harry	158	“ Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape , he says Snape ’s been avoiding him . Karkaroff looked really worried . He showed Snape something on his arm , but I could n’t see what it was . ”
167227	167236	167238	167238	Sirius	178	“ He showed Snape something on his arm ? ”
167258	167286	167244	167244	He	178	“ Well , I ’ve no idea what that ’s about ... but if Karkaroff ’s genuinely worried , and he ’s going to Snape for answers ... ”
167301	167346	167287	167287	Sirius	178	“ There ’s still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape , and I know Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people would n’t , but I just ca n’t see him letting Snape teach at Hogwarts if he ’d ever worked for Voldemort . ”
167347	167363	167365	167365	Ron	171	“ Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snape ’s office then ? ”
167368	167371	167373	167373	Sirius	178	“ Well , ”
167413	167437	167407	167407	Sirius	178	“ You say your brother ’s Crouch ’s personal assistant ? Any chance you could ask him if he ’s seen Crouch lately ? ”
167438	167443	167445	167445	Ron	171	“ I can try , ”
167448	167470	167445	167445	Ron	171	“ Better not make it sound like I reckon Crouch is up to anything dodgy , though . Percy loves Crouch . ”
167471	167494	167496	167496	Sirius	178	“ And you might try and find out whether they ’ve got any leads on Bertha Jorkins while you ’re at it , ”
167508	167516	167518	167518	Harry	158	“ Bagman told me they had n’t , ”
167520	167532	167534	167534	Sirius	178	“ Yes , he ’s quoted in the article in there , ”
167541	167646	167534	167534	Sirius	178	“ Blustering on about how bad Bertha ’s memory is . Well , maybe she ’s changed since I knew her , but the Bertha I knew was n’t forgetful at all — quite the reverse . She was a bit dim , but she had an excellent memory for gossip . It used to get her into a lot of trouble ; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut . I can see her being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic ... maybe that ’s why Bagman did n’t bother to look for her for so long ... ”
167658	167664	167722	167722	He	178	“ What ’s the time ? ”
167688	167695	167697	167697	Hermione	169	“ It ’s half past three , ”
167699	167708	167709	167709	Sirius	178	“ You ’d better get back to school , ”
167717	167721	167709	167709	Sirius	178	“ Now listen ... ”
167729	167786	167722	167722	He	178	“ I do n’t want you lot sneaking out of school to see me , all right ? Just send notes to me here . I still want to hear about anything odd . But you ’re not to go leaving Hogwarts without permission ; it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you . ”
167787	167807	167808	167808	Harry	158	“ No one ’s tried to attack me so far , except a dragon and a couple of grindylows , ”
167817	167861	167862	167862	He	178	“ I do n’t care ... I ’ll breathe freely again when this tournament ’s over , and that ’s not until June . And do n’t forget , if you ’re talking about me among yourselves , call me Snuffles , okay ? ”
167879	167892	167894	167894	Sirius	178	“ I ’ll walk to the edge of the village with you , ”
167896	167905	167894	167894	Sirius	178	“ see if I can scrounge another paper . ”
167987	167998	167999	167999	Ron	171	“ Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch ? ”
168011	168051	167999	167999	Ron	171	“ But maybe he does n’t care ... it ’d probably just make him admire Crouch even more . Yeah , Percy loves rules . He ’d just say Crouch was refusing to break them for his own son . ”
168052	168065	168067	168067	Hermione	169	“ Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors , ”
168070	168076	168078	168078	Ron	171	“ I do n’t know , ”
168080	168102	168078	168078	Ron	171	“ If he thought we were standing in the way of his career ... Percy ’s really ambitious , you know ... ”
168128	168133	168135	168135	Ron	171	“ Poor old Snuffles , ”
168140	168156	168135	168135	Ron	171	“ He must really like you , Harry ... Imagine having to live off rats . ”
168266	168275	168276	168276	he	428	“ Harry Potter is too good to Dobby ! ”
168288	168303	168305	168305	Harry	158	“ You saved my life with that gillyweed , Dobby , you really did , ”
168307	168319	168321	168321	Ron	171	“ No chance of more of those eclairs , is there ? ”
168336	168343	168345	168345	Hermione	169	“ You ’ve just had breakfast ! ”
168366	168378	168379	168379	Harry	158	“ We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles , ”
168382	168386	168388	168388	Ron	171	“ Good idea , ”
168390	168411	168412	168412	he	171	“ Give Pig something to do . You could n’t give us a bit of extra food , could you ? ”
168431	168438	168440	168440	Hermione	169	“ Dobby , where ’s Winky ? ”
168447	168458	168460	168460	Dobby	428	“ Winky is over there by the fire , miss , ”
168468	168472	168476	168476	she	169	“ Oh dear , ”
168560	168571	168572	168572	Dobby	428	“ Winky is getting through six bottles a day now , ”
168577	168588	168589	168589	Harry	158	“ Well , it ’s not strong , that stuff , ”
168598	168610	168611	168611	he	428	“ ’ Tis strong for a house - elf , sir , ”
168635	168643	168644	168644	Dobby	428	“ Winky is pining , Harry Potter , ”
168648	168681	168644	168644	Dobby	428	“ Winky wants to go home . Winky still thinks Mr. Crouch is her master , sir , and nothing Dobby says will persuade her that Professor Dumbledore is her master now . ”
168682	168687	168689	168689	Harry	158	“ Hey , Winky , ”
168706	168734	168689	168689	Harry	158	“ you do n’t know what Mr. Crouch might be up to , do you ? Because he ’s stopped turning up to judge the Triwizard Tournament . ”
168755	168766	168747	168747	She	253	“ M — Master is stopped — hic — coming ? ”
168767	168770	168772	168772	Harry	158	“ Yeah , ”
168774	168794	168772	168772	Harry	158	“ we have n’t seen him since the first task . The Daily Prophet ’s saying he ’s ill . ”
168805	168812	168747	168747	She	253	“ Master — hic — ill ? ”
168820	168831	168833	168833	Hermione	169	“ But we ’re not sure if that ’s true , ”
168836	168846	168848	168849	the elf	1241	“ Master is needing his — hic — Winky ! ”
168851	168866	168848	168849	the elf	1241	“ Master can not — hic — manage — hic — all by himself ... ”
168867	168882	168883	168883	Hermione	169	“ Other people manage to do their own housework , you know , Winky , ”
168887	168904	168905	168905	Winky	253	“ Winky — hic — is not only — hic — doing housework for Mr. Crouch ! ”
168923	168945	168905	168905	Winky	253	“ Master is — hic — trusting Winky with — hic — the most important — hic — the most secret — ”
168946	168949	168951	168951	Harry	158	“ What ? ”
168967	168978	168979	168979	she	253	“ Winky keeps — hic — her master ’s secrets , ”
168997	169008	168979	168979	she	253	“ You is — hic — nosing , you is . ”
169009	169020	169022	169022	Dobby	428	“ Winky must not talk like that to Harry Potter ! ”
169025	169039	169022	169022	Dobby	428	“ Harry Potter is brave and noble and Harry Potter is not nosy ! ”
169040	169089	168979	168979	she	253	“ He is nosing — hic — into my master ’s — hic — private and secret — hic — Winky is a good house - elf — hic — Winky keeps her silence — hic — people trying to — hic — pry and poke — hic — ”
169168	169182	169189	169189	his	3820	“ We is sorry you had to see that , sirs and miss ! ”
169196	169213	169189	169189	his	3820	“ We is hoping you will not judge us all by Winky , sirs and miss ! ”
169214	169219	169221	169221	Hermione	169	“ She ’s unhappy ! ”
169225	169241	169221	169221	Hermione	169	“ Why do n’t you try and cheer her up instead of covering her up ? ”
169242	169249	169251	169254	the house - elf	1258	“ Begging your pardon , miss , ”
169260	169284	169251	169254	the house - elf	1258	“ but house - elves has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and masters to be served . ”
169285	169292	169293	169293	Hermione	169	“ Oh for heaven ’s sake ! ”
169296	169346	169293	169293	Hermione	169	“ Listen to me , all of you ! You ’ve got just as much right as wizards to be unhappy ! You ’ve got the right to wages and holidays and proper clothes , you do n’t have to do everything you ’re told — look at Dobby ! ”
169347	169357	169358	169358	Dobby	428	“ Miss will please keep Dobby out of this , ”
169395	169402	169404	169405	an elf	5160	“ We has your extra food ! ”
169430	169435	169412	169412	he	5160	“ Good - bye ! ”
169468	169478	169479	169479	Dobby	428	“ Thank you for the socks , Harry Potter ! ”
169499	169513	169515	169515	Ron	171	“ You could n’t keep your mouth shut , could you , Hermione ? ”
169526	169550	169515	169515	Ron	171	“ They wo n’t want us visiting them now ! We could ’ve tried to get more stuff out of Winky about Crouch ! ”
169551	169560	169562	169562	Hermione	169	“ Oh as if you care about that ! ”
169564	169575	169562	169562	Hermione	169	“ You only like coming down here for the food ! ”
169942	169953	169955	169955	Ron	171	“ Percy wo n’t ’ve had time to answer yet , ”
169957	169964	169955	169955	Ron	171	“ We only sent Hedwig yesterday . ”
169965	169973	169975	169975	Hermione	169	“ No , it ’s not that , ”
169977	170001	169975	169975	Hermione	169	“ I ’ve taken out a subscription to the Daily Prophet . I ’m getting sick of finding everything out from the Slytherins . ”
170002	170006	170008	170008	Harry	158	“ Good thinking ! ”
170017	170029	170008	170008	Harry	158	“ Hey , Hermione , I think you ’re in luck — ”
170039	170049	170050	170050	she	169	“ It has n’t got a newspaper , though , ”
170056	170060	170050	170050	she	169	“ It ’s — ”
170091	170100	170102	170102	Harry	158	“ How many subscriptions did you take out ? ”
170136	170142	170143	170143	Hermione	169	“ What on earth — ? ”
170162	170166	170167	170167	she	169	“ Oh really ! ”
170174	170179	170181	170181	Ron	171	“ What ’s up ? ”
170183	170191	170192	170192	She	169	“ It ’s — oh how ridiculous — ”
170242	170249	170251	170251	Hermione	169	“ They ’re all like it ! ”
170260	170288	170251	170251	Hermione	169	“ ‘ Harry Potter can do much better than the likes of you ... ’ ‘ You deserve to be boiled in frog spawn ... ’ Ouch ! ”
170319	170324	170326	170326	Ron	171	“ Undiluted bubotuber pus ! ”
170337	170340	170342	170342	Hermione	169	“ Ow ! ”
170390	170401	170403	170403	Harry	158	“ You ’d better get up to the hospital wing , ”
170412	170423	170403	170403	Harry	158	“ We ’ll tell Professor Sprout where you ’ve gone ... ”

171721	171726	171727	171727	Ron	171	“ Must be nice , ”
171746	171764	171727	171727	Ron	171	“ To have so much money you do n’t notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing . ”
171765	171778	171780	171780	Harry	158	“ Listen , I had other stuff on my mind that night ! ”
171783	171790	171780	171780	Harry	158	“ We all did , remember ? ”
171791	171800	171801	171801	Ron	171	“ I did n’t know leprechaun gold vanishes , ”
171804	171826	171801	171801	Ron	171	“ I thought I was paying you back . You should n’t ’ve given me that Chudley Cannon hat for Christmas . ”
171827	171834	171836	171836	Harry	158	“ Forget it , all right ? ”

171898	171924	171889	171889	Ron	171	“ I do n’t blame Fred and George for trying to make some extra money . Wish I could . Wish I had a niffler . ”
171925	171937	171939	171939	Hermione	169	“ Well , we know what to get you next Christmas , ”
171954	171975	171951	171951	she	169	“ Come on , Ron , it could be worse . At least your fingers are n’t full of pus . ”
171997	172004	172005	172005	she	169	“ I hate that Skeeter woman ! ”
172010	172027	172005	172005	she	169	“ I ’ll get her back for this if it ’s the last thing I do ! ”
172115	172123	172124	172124	he	158	“ It ’ll die down , though , ”
172128	172148	172124	172124	he	158	“ if we just ignore it ... People got bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time — ”
172149	172172	172174	172174	Hermione	169	“ I want to know how she ’s listening into private conversations when she ’s supposed to be banned from the grounds ! ”
172254	172266	172267	172267	Hermione	169	“ Well , Rita ’s definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak ! ”
172302	172327	172285	172285	Harry	158	“ Moody says he did n’t see her anywhere near the judges ’ table at the second task , or anywhere near the lake ! ”
172328	172342	172344	172344	Ron	171	“ Hermione , is there any point in telling you to drop this ? ”
172346	172349	172351	172351	Hermione	169	“ No ! ”
172354	172377	172351	172351	Hermione	169	“ I want to know how she heard me talking to Viktor ! And how she found out about Hagrid ’s mum ! ”
172378	172385	172387	172387	Harry	158	“ Maybe she had you bugged , ”
172389	172392	172394	172394	Ron	171	“ Bugged ? ”
172397	172407	172394	172394	Ron	171	“ What ... put fleas on her or something ? ”
172427	172441	172423	172423	Hermione	169	“ Are n’t you two ever going to read Hogwarts : A History ? ”
172442	172448	172450	172450	Ron	171	“ What ’s the point ? ”
172452	172465	172450	172450	Ron	171	“ You know it by heart , we can just ask you . ”
172466	172538	172423	172423	Hermione	169	“ All those substitutes for magic Muggles use — electricity , computers , and radar , and all those things — they all go haywire around Hogwarts , there ’s too much magic in the air . No , Rita ’s using magic to eavesdrop , she must be ... If I could just find out what it is ... ooh , if it ’s illegal , I ’ll have her ... ”
172539	172549	172550	172550	Ron	171	“ Have n’t we got enough to worry about ? ”
172554	172568	172550	172550	Ron	171	“ Do we have to start a vendetta against Rita Skeeter as well ? ”
172569	172578	172579	172579	Hermione	169	“ I ’m not asking you to help ! ”
172582	172591	172579	172579	Hermione	169	“ I ’ll do it on my own ! ”
172615	172633	172635	172635	Ron	171	“ What ’s the betting she comes back with a box of I Hate Rita Skeeter badges ? ”
172849	172867	172868	172868	she	169	“ Your mum does n’t read Witch Weekly , by any chance , does she , Ron ? ”
172872	172875	172877	172877	Ron	171	“ Yeah , ”
172886	172893	172877	172877	Ron	171	“ Gets it for the recipes . ”
172902	172914	172915	172915	Harry	158	“ Do n’t you want to see what Percy ’s written ? ”
173089	173106	173107	173107	she	320	“ You are to go down to the Quidditch field tonight at nine o’clock , Potter , ”
173111	173126	173107	173107	she	320	“ Mr. Bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third task . ”

173192	173210	173174	173174	he	209	“ Fleur keeps going on about underground tunnels ; she reckons we ’ve got to find treasure . ”
173211	173219	173221	173221	Harry	158	“ That would n’t be too bad , ”
173266	173274	173275	173275	Cedric	209	“ What ’ve they done to it ? ”
173315	173320	173322	173322	Harry	158	“ They ’re hedges ! ”
173331	173335	173352	173352	Krum	205	“ Hello there ! ”

173417	173441	173442	173442	he	202	“ Growing nicely , are n’t they ? Give them a month and Hagrid’ll have them twenty feet high . Do n’t worry , ”
173463	173492	173442	173442	he	202	“ you ’ll have your Quidditch field back to normal once the task is over ! Now , I imagine you can guess what we ’re making here ? ”

173589	173635	173586	173586	his	202	“ Hagrid is providing a number of creatures ... then there will be spells that must be broken ... all that sort of thing , you know . Now , the champions who are leading on points will get a head start into the maze . ”
173643	173680	173636	173636	Bagman	202	“ Then Mr. Krum will enter ... then Miss Delacour . But you ’ll all be in with a fighting chance , depending how well you get past the obstacles . Should be fun , eh ? ”
173725	173755	173717	173717	he	158	“ Very well ... if you have n’t got any questions , we ’ll go back up to the castle , shall we , it ’s a bit chilly ... ”

175707	175715	175717	175717	Harry	158	“ I need to see Professor Dumbledore ! ”
175735	175757	175732	175732	Snape	333	“ It ’s Mr. Crouch ... he ’s just turned up ... he ’s in the forest ... he ’s asking — ”
175758	175764	175766	175766	Snape	333	“ What is this rubbish ? ”
175773	175780	175766	175766	Snape	333	“ What are you talking about ? ”
175781	175785	175786	175786	Harry	158	“ Mr. Crouch ! ”
175789	175820	175786	175786	Harry	158	“ From the Ministry ! He ’s ill or something — he ’s in the forest , he wants to see Dumbledore ! Just give me the password up to — ”
175821	175829	175831	175831	Snape	333	“ The headmaster is busy , Potter , ”
175842	175850	175851	175851	Harry	158	“ I ’ve got to tell Dumbledore ! ”
175854	175863	175867	175867	Snape	333	“ Did n’t you hear me , Potter ? ”
175885	175888	175890	175890	Harry	158	“ Look , ”
175893	175916	175890	175890	Harry	158	“ Crouch is n’t right — he ’s — he ’s out of his mind — he says he wants to warn — ”
175940	175946	175947	175947	he	170	“ Is there a problem ? ”
175956	175959	175960	175960	Harry	158	“ Professor ! ”
175970	175990	175960	175960	Harry	158	“ Mr. Crouch is here — he ’s down in the forest , he wants to speak to you ! ”
176010	176015	176016	176016	he	170	“ Lead the way , ”
176043	176052	176054	176054	Dumbledore	170	“ What did Mr. Crouch say , Harry ? ”
176064	176099	176108	176108	he	170	“ Said he wants to warn you ... said he ’s done something terrible ... he mentioned his son ... and Bertha Jorkins ... and — and Voldemort ... something about Voldemort getting stronger ... ”
176100	176103	176108	176108	he	170	“ Indeed , ”
176122	176129	176130	176130	Harry	158	“ He ’s not acting normally , ”
176138	176180	176130	176130	Harry	158	“ He does n’t seem to know where he is . He keeps talking like he thinks Percy Weasley ’s there , and then he changes , and says he needs to see you ... I left him with Viktor Krum . ”
176181	176185	176191	176191	he	170	“ You did ? ”
176208	176219	176191	176191	he	170	“ Do you know if anybody else saw Mr. Crouch ? ”
176220	176223	176225	176225	Harry	158	“ No , ”
176227	176262	176225	176225	Harry	158	“ Krum and I were talking , Mr. Bagman had just finished telling us about the third task , we stayed behind , and then we saw Mr. Crouch coming out of the forest — ”
176263	176268	176270	176270	Dumbledore	170	“ Where are they ? ”
176280	176284	176286	176286	Harry	158	“ Over here , ”
176332	176335	176336	176336	Harry	158	“ Viktor ? ”
176343	176348	176349	176349	Harry	158	“ They were here , ”
176354	176362	176349	176349	Harry	158	“ They were definitely somewhere around here ... ”
176363	176366	176367	176367	Dumbledore	170	“ Lumos , ”
176445	176448	176449	176449	he	170	“ Stunned , ”
176471	176479	176481	176481	Harry	158	“ Should I go and get someone ? ”
176483	176487	176481	176481	Harry	158	“ Madam Pomfrey ? ”
176488	176491	176493	176493	Dumbledore	170	“ No , ”
176496	176500	176493	176493	Dumbledore	170	“ Stay here . ”
176554	176557	176546	176546	his	170	“ Rennervate . ”
176592	176597	176598	176598	Krum	205	“ He attacked me ! ”
176609	176632	176598	176598	Krum	205	“ The old madman attacked me ! I vos looking around to see vare Potter had gone and he attacked from behind ! ”
176633	176640	176641	176641	Dumbledore	170	“ Lie still for a moment , ”
176670	176674	176675	176675	he	353	“ Professor Dumbledore ! ”
176682	176689	176675	176675	he	353	“ Harry — what the — ? ”
176690	176701	176703	176703	Dumbledore	170	“ Hagrid , I need you to fetch Professor Karkaroff , ”
176705	176723	176703	176703	Dumbledore	170	“ His student has been attacked . When you ’ve done that , kindly alert Professor Moody — ”
176724	176730	176675	176675	he	353	“ No need , Dumbledore , ”
176736	176741	176675	176675	he	353	“ I ’m here . ”
176757	176761	176762	176762	he	346	“ Damn leg , ”
176766	176783	176762	176762	he	346	“ Would ’ve been here quicker ... what ’s happened ? Snape said something about Crouch — ”
176784	176787	176789	176789	Hagrid	181	“ Crouch ? ”
176792	176799	176801	176801	Dumbledore	170	“ Karkaroff , please , Hagrid ! ”
176804	176813	176815	176815	Hagrid	181	“ Oh yeah ... right y’are , Professor ... ”
176832	176842	176843	176843	Dumbledore	170	“ I do n’t know where Barty Crouch is , ”
176847	176857	176843	176843	Dumbledore	170	“ but it is essential that we find him . ”
176858	176864	176866	176866	Moody	346	“ I ’m onto it , ”
176920	176925	176926	176926	he	376	“ What is this ? ”
176942	176948	176938	176938	Harry	158	“ What ’s going on ? ”
176949	176954	176956	176956	Krum	205	“ I vos attacked ! ”
176966	176974	176956	176956	Krum	205	“ Mr. Crouch or votever his name — ”
176975	176988	176938	176938	Harry	158	“ Crouch attacked you ? Crouch attacked you ? The Triwizard judge ? ”
176989	176992	176993	176993	Dumbledore	170	“ Igor , ”
177012	177015	177016	177016	he	376	“ Treachery ! ”
177023	177126	177016	177016	he	376	“ It is a plot ! You and your Ministry of Magic have lured me here under false pretenses , Dumbledore ! This is not an equal competition ! First you sneak Potter into the tournament , though he is underage ! Now one of your Ministry friends attempts to put my champion out of action ! I smell double - dealing and corruption in this whole affair , and you , Dumbledore , you , with your talk of closer international Wizarding links , of rebuilding old ties , of forgetting old differences — here ’s what I think of you ! ”
177165	177168	177169	177169	Hagrid	181	“ Apologize ! ”
177191	177196	177197	177197	Dumbledore	170	“ Hagrid , no ! ”
177243	177255	177257	177257	Dumbledore	170	“ Kindly escort Harry back up to the castle , Hagrid , ”
177270	177280	177263	177263	Hagrid	181	“ Maybe I ’d better stay here , Headmaster ... ”
177281	177292	177293	177293	Dumbledore	170	“ You will take Harry back to school , Hagrid , ”
177297	177342	177293	177293	Dumbledore	170	“ Take him right up to Gryffindor Tower . And Harry — I want you to stay there . Anything you might want to do — any owls you might want to send — they can wait until morning , do you understand me ? ”
177343	177348	177350	177350	Harry	158	“ Er — yes , ”
177385	177395	177396	177396	Hagrid	181	“ I ’ll leave Fang with yeh , Headmaster , ”
177422	177432	177402	177402	Karkaroff	376	“ Stay , Fang . C’m on , Harry . ”
177447	177452	177453	177453	Hagrid	181	“ How dare he , ”
177462	177468	177470	177470	Harry	158	“ Krum ’s all right ! ”
177481	177498	177470	177470	Harry	158	“ He was n’t trying to jinx me , he just wanted to talk about Hermione — ”
177499	177514	177516	177516	Hagrid	181	“ I ’ll be havin’ a few words with her , an ’ all , ”
177524	177550	177516	177516	Hagrid	181	“ The less you lot ’ ave ter do with these foreigners , the happier yeh’ll be . Yeh can ’ trust any of ’em . ”
177551	177562	177563	177563	Harry	158	“ You were getting on all right with Madame Maxime , ”
177568	177579	177581	177581	Hagrid	181	“ Don ’ you talk ter me abou ’ her ! ”
177592	177637	177584	177584	he	181	“ I ’ve got her number now ! Tryin ’ ter get back in me good books , tryin ’ ter get me ter tell her what ’s comin ’ in the third task . Ha ! You can ’ trust any of ’em ! ”
177694	177701	177703	177703	Hermione	169	“ It comes down to this , ”
177709	177729	177703	177703	Hermione	169	“ Either Mr. Crouch attacked Viktor , or somebody else attacked both of them when Viktor was n’t looking . ”
177730	177737	177739	177739	Ron	171	“ It must ’ve been Crouch , ”
177743	177763	177739	177739	Ron	171	“ That ’s why he was gone when Harry and Dumbledore got there . He ’d done a runner . ”
177764	177771	177773	177773	Harry	158	“ I do n’t think so , ”
177779	177797	177773	177773	Harry	158	“ He seemed really weak — I do n’t reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything . ”
177798	177816	177818	177818	Hermione	169	“ You ca n’t Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds , have n’t I told you enough times ? ”
177820	177830	177832	177832	Ron	171	“ Okay ... how ’s this for a theory , ”
177835	177851	177832	177832	Ron	171	“ Krum attacked Crouch — no , wait for it — and then Stunned himself ! ”
177852	177861	177863	177863	Hermione	169	“ And Mr. Crouch evaporated , did he ? ”
177866	177870	177832	177832	Ron	171	“ Oh yeah ... ”
177937	177946	177948	177948	Hermione	169	“ Just go through it again , Harry , ”
177950	177958	177948	177948	Hermione	169	“ What did Mr. Crouch actually say ? ”
177959	177972	177974	177974	Harry	158	“ I ’ve told you , he was n’t making much sense , ”
177976	178015	177974	177974	Harry	158	“ He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about something . He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins , and he seemed to think she was dead . He kept saying stuff was his fault ... He mentioned his son . ”
178016	178024	178026	178026	Hermione	169	“ Well , that was his fault , ”
178029	178037	178039	178039	Harry	158	“ He was out of his mind , ”
178041	178070	178039	178039	Harry	158	“ Half the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive , and he kept talking to Percy about work and giving him instructions . ”
178071	178086	178088	178088	Ron	171	“ And ... remind me what he said about You - Know - Who ? ”
178091	178097	178098	178098	Harry	158	“ I ’ve told you , ”
178102	178110	178098	178098	Harry	158	“ He said he ’s getting stronger . ”
178125	178147	178117	178117	Ron	171	“ But he was out of his mind , like you said , so half of it was probably just raving ... ”
178148	178161	178163	178163	Harry	158	“ He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort , ”
178175	178216	178166	178166	Ron	171	“ He was having real trouble stringing two words together , but that was when he seemed to know where he was , and know what he wanted to do . He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore . ”
178267	178276	178277	178277	Harry	158	“ If Snape had n’t held me up , ”
178281	178318	178277	178277	Harry	158	“ we might ’ve got there in time . ‘ The headmaster is busy , Potter ... what ’s this rubbish , Potter ? ’ Why could n’t he have just got out of the way ? ”
178319	178330	178332	178332	Ron	171	“ Maybe he did n’t want you to get there ! ”
178335	178365	178332	178332	Ron	171	“ Maybe — hang on — how fast d’you reckon he could ’ve gotten down to the forest ? D’you reckon he could ’ve beaten you and Dumbledore there ? ”
178366	178379	178381	178381	Harry	158	“ Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something , ”
178383	178391	178392	178392	Ron	171	“ Would n’t put it past him , ”
178395	178403	178405	178405	Hermione	169	“ We need to see Professor Moody , ”
178407	178419	178405	178405	Hermione	169	“ We need to find out whether he found Mr. Crouch . ”
178420	178437	178439	178439	Harry	158	“ If he had the Marauder ’s Map on him , it would ’ve been easy , ”
178441	178450	178452	178452	Ron	171	“ Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds , ”
178454	178467	178452	178452	Ron	171	“ because it only shows up to the boundaries , does n’t — ”
178468	178471	178473	178473	Hermione	169	“ Shh ! ”
178498	178518	178476	178476	Somebody	1529	“ — that ’s blackmail , that is , we could get into a lot of trouble for that — ”
178519	178550	178452	178452	Ron	171	“ — we ’ve tried being polite ; it ’s time to play dirty , like him . He would n’t like the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did — ”
178551	178568	178476	178476	Somebody	1529	“ I ’m telling you , if you put that in writing , it ’s blackmail ! ”
178569	178589	178452	178452	Ron	171	“ Yeah , and you wo n’t be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff , will you ? ”
178617	178624	178625	178625	Ron	171	“ What ’re you doing here ? ”
178634	178639	178641	178641	Harry	158	“ Sending a letter , ”
178647	178654	178658	178658	Fred	175	“ What , at this time ? ”
178663	178683	178684	178684	he	3969	“ Fine — we wo n’t ask you what you ’re doing , if you do n’t ask us , ”
178723	178734	178735	178735	Fred	175	“ Well , do n’t let us hold you up , ”
178753	178759	178760	178760	he	171	“ Who ’re you blackmailing ? ”
178784	178795	178796	178796	he	171	“ Do n’t be stupid , I was only joking , ”
178800	178807	178809	178809	Ron	171	“ Did n’t sound like that , ”
178824	178855	178820	178820	Fred	175	“ I ’ve told you before , Ron , keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is . Ca n’t see why you would , but — ”
178856	178867	178869	178869	Ron	171	“ It ’s my business if you ’re blackmailing someone , ”
178871	178886	178869	178869	Ron	171	“ George ’s right , you could end up in serious trouble for that . ”
178887	178895	178897	178897	George	176	“ Told you , I was joking , ”
178926	178957	178899	178899	He	171	“ You ’re starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother , you are , Ron . Carry on like this and you ’ll be made a prefect . ”
178958	178965	178967	178967	Ron	171	“ No , I wo n’t ! ”
178992	179007	178984	178984	George	176	“ Well , stop telling people what to do then . See you later . ”
179026	179041	179042	179042	Hermione	169	“ You do n’t think they know something about all this , do you ? ”
179045	179051	179042	179042	Hermione	169	“ About Crouch and everything ? ”
179052	179055	179057	179057	Harry	158	“ No , ”
179059	179077	179057	179057	Harry	158	“ If it was something that serious , they ’d tell someone . They ’d tell Dumbledore . ”
179086	179092	179095	179095	him	171	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
179097	179100	179102	179102	Ron	171	“ Well ... ”
179105	179139	179102	179102	Ron	171	“ I dunno if they would . They ’re ... they ’re obsessed with making money lately , I noticed it when I was hanging around with them — when — you know — ”
179140	179146	179147	179147	Harry	158	“ We were n’t talking . ”
179154	179160	179147	179147	Harry	158	“ Yeah , but blackmail ... ”
179161	179172	179174	179174	Ron	171	“ It ’s this joke shop idea they ’ve got , ”
179176	179240	179174	179174	Ron	171	“ I thought they were only saying it to annoy Mum , but they really mean it , they want to start one . They ’ve only got a year left at Hogwarts , they keep going on about how it ’s time to think about their future , and Dad ca n’t help them , and they need gold to get started . ”
179247	179264	179241	179241	Hermione	169	“ Yes , but ... they would n’t do anything against the law to get gold . ”
179265	179270	179272	179272	Ron	171	“ Would n’t they ? ”
179277	179292	179272	179272	Ron	171	“ I dunno ... they do n’t exactly mind breaking rules , do they ? ”
179293	179302	179304	179304	Hermione	169	“ Yes , but this is the law , ”
179309	179338	179304	179304	Hermione	169	“ This is n’t some silly school rule ... They ’ll get a lot more than detention for blackmail ! Ron ... maybe you ’d better tell Percy ... ”
179339	179344	179346	179346	Ron	171	“ Are you mad ? ”
179348	179363	179346	179346	Ron	171	“ Tell Percy ? He ’d probably do a Crouch and turn them in . ”
179382	179392	179364	179364	He	171	“ Come on , let ’s get some breakfast . ”
179393	179407	179408	179408	Hermione	169	“ D’you think it ’s too early to go and see Professor Moody ? ”
179418	179421	179423	179423	Harry	158	“ Yes , ”
179425	179465	179423	179423	Harry	158	“ He ’d probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn ; he ’ll think we ’re trying to attack him while he ’s asleep . Let ’s give it till break . ”
179608	179612	179613	179613	Harry	158	“ Professor Moody ? ”
179626	179631	179633	179633	Moody	346	“ Hello , Potter , ”
179673	179678	179669	179669	he	346	“ Come in here . ”
179700	179706	179707	179707	Harry	158	“ Did you find him ? ”
179712	179716	179707	179707	Harry	158	“ Mr. Crouch ? ”
179717	179720	179722	179722	Moody	346	“ No , ”
179751	179758	179759	179759	Harry	158	“ Did you use the map ? ”
179762	179766	179768	179768	Moody	346	“ Of course , ”
179777	179804	179768	179768	Moody	346	“ Took a leaf out of your book , Potter . Summoned it from my office into the forest . He was n’t anywhere on there . ”
179805	179811	179813	179813	Ron	171	“ So he did Disapparate ? ”
179815	179826	179828	179828	Hermione	169	“ You ca n’t Disapparate on the grounds , Ron ! ”
179830	179846	179828	179828	Hermione	169	“ There are other ways he could have disappeared , are n’t there , Professor ? ”
179858	179873	179874	179874	he	346	“ You ’re another one who might think about a career as an Auror , ”
179878	179887	179874	179874	he	346	“ Mind works the right way , Granger . ”
179894	179902	179904	179904	Harry	158	“ Well , he was n’t invisible , ”
179906	179922	179904	179904	Harry	158	“ The map shows invisible people . He must ’ve left the grounds , then . ”
179923	179930	179932	179932	Hermione	169	“ But under his own steam ? ”
179935	179942	179932	179932	Hermione	169	“ or because someone made him ? ”
179943	179967	179969	179969	Ron	171	“ Yeah , someone could ’ve — could ’ve pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him , could n’t they ? ”
179992	180000	180002	180002	Moody	346	“ We ca n’t rule out kidnap , ”
180004	180007	180009	180009	Ron	171	“ So , ”
180011	180020	180009	180009	Ron	171	“ d’you reckon he ’s somewhere in Hogsmeade ? ”
180021	180026	180028	180028	Moody	346	“ Could be anywhere , ”
180034	180048	180028	180028	Moody	346	“ Only thing we know for sure is that he ’s not here . ”
180074	180123	180071	180071	he	346	“ Now , Dumbledore ’s told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators , but there ’s nothing you can do for Crouch . The Ministry’ll be looking for him now , Dumbledore ’s notified them . Potter , you just keep your mind on the third task . ”
180124	180127	180129	180129	Harry	158	“ What ? ”
180131	180135	180129	180129	Harry	158	“ Oh yeah ... ”
180156	180167	180169	180169	Moody	346	“ Should be right up your street , this one , ”
180183	180225	180169	180169	Moody	346	“ From what Dumbledore ’s said , you ’ve managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times . Broke your way through a series of obstacles guarding the Sorcerer ’s Stone in your first year , did n’t you ? ”
180226	180230	180231	180231	Ron	171	“ We helped , ”
180235	180241	180231	180231	Ron	171	“ Me and Hermione helped . ”
180245	180267	180269	180269	Moody	346	“ Well , help him practice for this one , and I ’ll be very surprised if he does n’t win , ”
180271	180284	180285	180285	He	346	“ In the meantime ... constant vigilance , Potter . Constant vigilance . ”
180316	180320	180322	180322	Moody	346	“ You two , ”
180332	180364	180324	180324	his	346	“ you stick close to Potter , all right ? I ’m keeping an eye on things , but all the same ... you can never have too many eyes out . ”
180418	180429	180405	180405	She	169	“ Ha ! She has n’t got wind of Crouch ! ”
180640	180656	180658	180658	Harry	158	“ Who ’s he , to lecture me about being out - of - bounds ? ”
180676	180686	180663	180663	he	158	“ After all the stuff he did at school ! ”
180687	180694	180696	180696	Hermione	169	“ He ’s worried about you ! ”
180699	180711	180696	180696	Hermione	169	“ Just like Moody and Hagrid ! So listen to them ! ”
180712	180723	180725	180725	Harry	158	“ No one ’s tried to attack me all year , ”
180727	180738	180725	180725	Harry	158	“ No one ’s done anything to me at all — ”
180739	180750	180752	180752	Hermione	169	“ Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire , ”
180754	180791	180752	180752	Hermione	169	“ And they must ’ve done that for a reason , Harry . Snuffles is right . Maybe they ’ve been biding their time . Maybe this is the task they ’re going to get you . ”
180792	180795	180797	180797	Harry	158	“ Look , ”
180800	180864	180797	180797	Harry	158	“ let ’s say Sirius is right , and someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch . Well , they would ’ve been in the trees near us , would n’t they ? But they waited till I was out of the way until they acted , did n’t they ? So it does n’t look like I ’m their target , does it ? ”
180865	180885	180887	180887	Hermione	169	“ They could n’t have made it look like an accident if they ’d murdered you in the forest ! ”
180889	180898	180887	180887	Hermione	169	“ But if you die during a task — ”
180899	180911	180913	180913	Harry	158	“ They did n’t care about attacking Krum , did they ? ”
180915	180945	180913	180913	Harry	158	“ Why did n’t they just polish me off at the same time ? They could ’ve made it look like Krum and I had a duel or something . ”
180946	180956	180958	180958	Hermione	169	“ Harry , I do n’t understand it either , ”
180961	181028	180958	180958	Hermione	169	“ I just know there are a lot of odd things going on , and I do n’t like it ... Moody ’s right — Sirius is right — you ’ve got to get in training for the third task , straight away . And you make sure you write back to Sirius and promise him you ’re not going to go sneaking off alone again . ”
181114	181122	181123	181123	Ron	171	“ Ca n’t we kidnap Mrs. Norris ? ”
181159	181192	181194	181194	he	158	“ Let ’s Stun her for a bit . Or you could use Dobby , Harry , I bet he ’d do anything to help you . I ’m not complaining or anything ”
181205	181213	181194	181194	he	158	“ but I ’m aching all over ... ”
181214	181227	181229	181229	Hermione	169	“ Well , you keep missing the cushions , do n’t you ! ”
181253	181260	181246	181246	Flitwick	330	“ Just try and fall backward ! ”
181261	181276	181278	181278	Ron	171	“ Once you ’re Stunned , you ca n’t aim too well , Hermione ! ”
181281	181290	181278	181278	Ron	171	“ Why do n’t you take a turn ? ”
181291	181304	181306	181306	Hermione	169	“ Well , I think Harry ’s got it now , anyway , ”
181309	181345	181306	181306	Hermione	169	“ And we do n’t have to worry about Disarming , because he ’s been able to do that for ages ... I think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening . ”
181358	181367	181368	181368	she	169	“ I like the look of this one , ”
181371	181396	181368	181368	she	169	“ this Impediment Curse . Should slow down anything that ’s trying to attack you , Harry . We ’ll start with that one . ”
181418	181424	181429	181429	she	169	“ See you at dinner ! ”
181478	181497	181499	181499	Ron	171	“ It ’s going to be boiling in Trelawney ’s room , she never puts out that fire , ”
181601	181605	181607	181608	Professor Trelawney	306	“ My dears , ”
181633	181685	181628	181628	her	306	“ we have almost finished our work on planetary divination . Today , however , will be an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of Mars , for he is placed most interestingly at the present time . If you will all look this way , I will dim the lights ... ”
182004	182012	182142	182144	the cold voice	658	“ You are in luck , Wormtail , ”
182034	182052	182142	182144	the cold voice	658	“ You are very fortunate indeed . Your blunder has not ruined everything . He is dead . ”
182053	182057	182059	182063	the man on the floor	4013	“ My Lord ! ”
182065	182081	182059	182063	the man on the floor	4013	“ My Lord , I am ... I am so pleased ... and so sorry ... ”
182082	182085	182087	182089	the cold voice	658	“ Nagini , ”
182091	182123	182087	182089	the cold voice	658	“ you are out of luck . I will not be feeding Wormtail to you , after all ... but never mind , never mind ... there is still Harry Potter ... ”
182135	182140	182142	182144	the cold voice	658	“ Now , Wormtail , ”
182146	182162	182142	182144	the cold voice	658	“ perhaps one more little reminder why I will not tolerate another blunder from you ... ”
182163	182173	182199	182201	the cold voice	658	“ My Lord ... no ... I beg you ... ”
182194	182197	182199	182201	the cold voice	658	“ Crucio ! ”
182250	182255	182234	182234	he	158	“ Harry ! Harry ! ”
182317	182322	182323	182323	he	171	“ You all right ? ”
182326	182333	182335	182336	Professor Trelawney	306	“ Of course he is n’t ! ”
182353	182371	182342	182342	Her	306	“ What was it , Potter ? A premonition ? An apparition ? What did you see ? ”
182372	182375	182376	182376	Harry	158	“ Nothing , ”
182412	182419	182421	182422	Professor Trelawney	306	“ You were clutching your scar ! ”
182424	182448	182421	182422	Professor Trelawney	306	“ You were rolling on the floor , clutching your scar ! Come now , Potter , I have experience in these matters ! ”
182455	182468	182469	182469	he	158	“ I need to go to the hospital wing , I think , ”
182472	182476	182449	182449	Harry	158	“ Bad headache . ”
182477	182494	182496	182497	Professor Trelawney	306	“ My dear , you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room ! ”
182499	182518	182496	182497	Professor Trelawney	306	“ If you leave now , you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever — ”
182519	182532	182534	182534	Harry	158	“ I do n’t want to see anything except a headache cure , ”
182550	182555	182556	182556	Harry	158	“ See you later , ”
182815	182819	182820	182820	he	158	“ Lemon drop ? ”
182830	182833	182835	182835	Harry	158	“ Okay , ”
182841	182887	182888	182888	he	158	“ Pear Drop . Er — Licorice Wand . Fizzing Whizbee . Drooble ’s Best Blowing Gum . Bertie Bott ’s Every Flavor Beans ... oh no , he does n’t like them , does he ? ... oh just open , ca n’t you ? ”
182892	182904	182888	182888	he	158	“ I really need to see him , it ’s urgent ! ”
182925	182929	182930	182930	he	158	“ Chocolate Frog ! ”
182939	182946	182930	182930	he	158	“ Sugar Quill ! Cockroach Cluster ! ”
182959	182963	182964	182964	he	158	“ Cockroach Cluster ? ”
182969	182975	182964	182964	he	158	“ I was only joking ... ”
183040	183060	183029	183029	He	158	“ Dumbledore , I ’m afraid I do n’t see the connection , do n’t see it at all ! ”
183074	183129	183071	183072	Cornelius Fudge	255	“ Ludo says Bertha ’s perfectly capable of getting herself lost . I agree we would have expected to have found her by now , but all the same , we ’ve no evidence of foul play , Dumbledore , none at all . As for her disappearance being linked with Barty Crouch ’s ! ”
183130	183144	183146	183146	Moody	346	“ And what do you think ’s happened to Barty Crouch , Minister ? ”
183151	183159	183161	183161	Fudge	255	“ I see two possibilities , Alastor , ”
183163	183196	183161	183161	Fudge	255	“ Either Crouch has finally cracked — more than likely , I ’m sure you ’ll agree , given his personal history — lost his mind , and gone wandering off somewhere — ”
183197	183211	183213	183213	Dumbledore	170	“ He wandered extremely quickly , if that is the case , Cornelius , ”
183216	183222	183223	183223	Fudge	255	“ Or else — well ... ”
183227	183266	183223	183223	Fudge	255	“ Well , I ’ll reserve judgment until after I ’ve seen the place where he was found , but you say it was just past the Beauxbatons carriage ? Dumbledore , you know what that woman is ? ”
183267	183283	183285	183285	Dumbledore	170	“ I consider her to be a very able headmistress — and an excellent dancer , ”
183288	183293	183295	183295	Fudge	255	“ Dumbledore , come ! ”
183298	183340	183295	183295	Fudge	255	“ Do n’t you think you might be prejudiced in her favor because of Hagrid ? They do n’t all turn out harmless — if , indeed , you can call Hagrid harmless , with that monster fixation he ’s got — ”
183341	183351	183353	183353	Dumbledore	170	“ I no more suspect Madame Maxime than Hagrid , ”
183359	183374	183353	183353	Dumbledore	170	“ I think it possible that it is you who are prejudiced , Cornelius . ”
183375	183383	183385	183385	Moody	346	“ Can we wrap up this discussion ? ”
183387	183402	183404	183404	Fudge	255	“ Yes , yes , let ’s go down to the grounds , then , ”
183407	183415	183417	183417	Moody	346	“ No , it ’s not that , ”
183419	183440	183417	183417	Moody	346	“ it ’s just that Potter wants a word with you , Dumbledore . He ’s just outside the door . ”
183448	183453	183455	183455	Moody	346	“ Hello , Potter , ”
183457	183463	183455	183455	Moody	346	“ Come in , then . ”
183535	183538	183540	183540	Fudge	255	“ Harry ! ”
183546	183551	183540	183540	Fudge	255	“ How are you ? ”
183552	183555	183556	183556	Harry	158	“ Fine , ”
183559	183576	183578	183578	Fudge	255	“ We were just talking about the night when Mr. Crouch turned up on the grounds , ”
183580	183592	183578	183578	Fudge	255	“ It was you who found him , was it not ? ”
183593	183596	183598	183598	Harry	158	“ Yes , ”
183622	183645	183619	183619	he	158	“ I did n’t see Madame Maxime anywhere , though , and she ’d have a job hiding , would n’t she ? ”
183659	183664	183666	183666	Fudge	255	“ Yes , well , ”
183671	183703	183666	183666	Fudge	255	“ we ’re about to go for a short walk on the grounds , Harry , if you ’ll excuse us ... perhaps if you just go back to your class — ”
183704	183714	183715	183715	Harry	158	“ I wanted to talk to you , Professor , ”
183732	183740	183741	183741	he	255	“ Wait here for me , Harry , ”
183744	183755	183741	183741	he	255	“ Our examination of the grounds will not take long . ”
183794	183799	183800	183800	he	158	“ Hello , Fawkes , ”
184866	184869	184870	184870	Harry	158	“ Professor ! ”
184879	184907	184870	184870	Harry	158	“ I ’m sorry — I did n’t mean to — I was just looking at that basin in your cabinet — I — where are we ? ”
185478	185482	185510	185510	Crouch	200	“ Igor Karkaroff , ”
185529	185559	185523	185523	he	200	“ You have been brought from Azkaban to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic . You have given us to understand that you have important information for us . ”
185574	185580	185581	185581	he	376	“ I have , sir , ”
185603	185653	185581	185581	he	376	“ I wish to be of use to the Ministry . I wish to help . I — I know that the Ministry is trying to — to round up the last of the Dark Lord ’s supporters . I am eager to assist in any way I can ... ”
185699	185702	185687	185687	Dumbledore	170	“ Filth . ”
185762	185771	185772	185772	Moody	296	“ Crouch is going to let him out , ”
185778	185830	185772	185772	Moody	296	“ He ’s done a deal with him . Took me six months to track him down , and Crouch is going to let him go if he ’s got enough new names . Let ’s hear his information , I say , and throw him straight back to the dementors . ”
185845	185864	185866	185866	Moody	296	“ Ah , I was forgetting ... you do n’t like the dementors , do you , Albus ? ”
185872	185875	185877	185877	Dumbledore	170	“ No , ”
185880	185903	185877	185877	Dumbledore	170	“ I ’m afraid I do n’t . I have long felt the Ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures . ”
185904	185911	185912	185912	Moody	296	“ But for filth like this ... ”
185916	185927	185929	185930	Mr. Crouch	200	“ You say you have names for us , Karkaroff , ”
185932	185940	185929	185930	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Let us hear them , please . ”
185941	185946	185948	185948	Karkaroff	376	“ You must understand , ”
185951	186000	185948	185948	Karkaroff	376	“ that He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named operated always in the greatest secrecy ... He preferred that we — I mean to say , his supporters — and I regret now , very deeply , that I ever counted myself among them — ”
186001	186007	186009	186009	Moody	296	“ Get on with it , ”
186011	186034	186009	186009	Moody	296	“ — we never knew the names of every one of our fellows — He alone knew exactly who we all were — ”
186035	186062	186064	186064	Moody	296	“ Which was a wise move , was n’t it , as it prevented someone like you , Karkaroff , from turning all of them in , ”
186066	186077	186079	186080	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Yet you say you have some names for us ? ”
186082	186088	186090	186090	Karkaroff	376	“ I — I do , ”
186093	186141	186090	186090	Karkaroff	376	“ And these were important supporters , mark you . People I saw with my own eyes doing his bidding . I give this information as a sign that I fully and totally renounce him , and am filled with a remorse so deep I can barely — ”
186142	186147	186149	186150	Mr. Crouch	200	“ These names are ? ”
186159	186165	186166	186166	he	376	“ There was Antonin Dolohov , ”
186169	186189	186166	186166	he	376	“ I — I saw him torture countless Muggles and — and non - supporters of the Dark Lord . ”
186190	186197	186199	186199	Moody	296	“ And helped him do it , ”
186201	186208	186210	186210	Crouch	200	“ We have already apprehended Dolohov , ”
186212	186220	186210	186210	Crouch	200	“ He was caught shortly after yourself . ”
186221	186224	186226	186226	Karkaroff	376	“ Indeed ? ”
186232	186242	186226	186226	Karkaroff	376	“ I — I am delighted to hear it ! ”
186272	186276	186278	186278	Crouch	200	“ Any others ? ”
186281	186290	186292	186292	Karkaroff	376	“ Why , yes ... there was Rosier , ”
186295	186299	186292	186292	Karkaroff	376	“ Evan Rosier . ”
186300	186305	186307	186307	Crouch	200	“ Rosier is dead , ”
186309	186334	186307	186307	Crouch	200	“ He was caught shortly after you were too . He preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was killed in the struggle . ”
186335	186346	186348	186348	Moody	296	“ Took a bit of me with him , though , ”
186376	186385	186387	186387	Karkaroff	376	“ No — no more than Rosier deserved ! ”
186443	186447	186449	186449	Crouch	200	“ Any more ? ”
186451	186454	186456	186456	Karkaroff	376	“ Yes ! ”
186458	186514	186456	186456	Karkaroff	376	“ There was Travers — he helped murder the McKinnons ! Mulciber — he specialized in the Imperius Curse , forced countless people to do horrific things ! Rookwood , who was a spy , and passed He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named useful information from inside the Ministry itself ! ”
186536	186539	186541	186542	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Rookwood ? ”
186563	186572	186558	186558	her	4119	“ Augustus Rookwood of the Department of Mysteries ? ”
186573	186578	186580	186580	Karkaroff	376	“ The very same , ”
186583	186607	186580	186580	Karkaroff	376	“ I believe he used a network of well - placed wizards , both inside the Ministry and out , to collect information — ”
186608	186616	186618	186619	Mr. Crouch	200	“ But Travers and Mulciber we have , ”
186621	186642	186618	186619	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Very well , Karkaroff , if that is all , you will be returned to Azkaban while we decide — ”
186643	186647	186649	186649	Karkaroff	376	“ Not yet ! ”
186655	186662	186649	186649	Karkaroff	376	“ Wait , I have more ! ”
186686	186689	186690	186690	he	158	“ Snape ! ”
186693	186697	186690	186690	he	158	“ Severus Snape ! ”
186698	186707	186709	186709	Crouch	200	“ Snape has been cleared by this council , ”
186712	186722	186709	186709	Crouch	200	“ He has been vouched for by Albus Dumbledore . ”
186723	186726	186728	186728	Karkaroff	376	“ No ! ”
186741	186753	186728	186728	Karkaroff	376	“ I assure you ! Severus Snape is a Death Eater ! ”
186761	186771	186772	186772	he	170	“ I have given evidence already on this matter , ”
186776	186819	186772	186772	he	170	“ Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater . However , he rejoined our side before Lord Voldemort ’s downfall and turned spy for us , at great personal risk . He is now no more a Death Eater than I am . ”
186843	186849	186850	186850	Crouch	200	“ Very well , Karkaroff , ”
186854	186876	186850	186850	Crouch	200	“ you have been of assistance . I shall review your case . You will return to Azkaban in the meantime ... ”
187187	187216	187218	187219	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Ludo Bagman , you have been brought here in front of the Council of Magical Law to answer charges relating to the activities of the Death Eaters , ”
187221	187252	187218	187219	Mr. Crouch	200	“ We have heard the evidence against you , and are about to reach our verdict . Do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce judgment ? ”
187267	187270	187272	187272	Bagman	202	“ Only , ”
187277	187291	187272	187272	Bagman	202	“ well — I know I ’ve been a bit of an idiot — ”
187332	187342	187343	187343	someone	717	“ You never spoke a truer word , boy , ”
187361	187387	187356	187356	Moody	296	“ If I did n’t know he ’d always been dim , I ’d have said some of those Bludgers had permanently affected his brain ... ”
187388	187403	187405	187406	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Ludovic Bagman , you were caught passing information to Lord Voldemort ’s supporters , ”
187408	187425	187405	187406	Mr. Crouch	200	“ For this , I suggest a term of imprisonment in Azkaban lasting no less than — ”
187462	187474	187475	187475	Bagman	497	“ But I ’ve told you , I had no idea ! ”
187490	187575	187484	187484	his	497	“ None at all ! Old Rookwood was a friend of my dad ’s ... never crossed my mind he was in with You - Know - Who ! I thought I was collecting information for our side ! And Rookwood kept talking about getting me a job in the Ministry later on ... once my Quidditch days are over , you know ... I mean , I ca n’t keep getting hit by Bludgers for the rest of my life , can I ? ”
187583	187592	187594	187595	Mr. Crouch	200	“ It will be put to the vote , ”
187610	187625	187598	187598	He	200	“ The jury will please raise their hands ... those in favor of imprisonment ... ”
187668	187671	187673	187673	Crouch	200	“ Yes ? ”
187675	187699	187700	187701	the witch	4144	“ We ’d just like to congratulate Mr. Bagman on his splendid performance for England in the Quidditch match against Turkey last Saturday , ”
187728	187731	187732	187733	Mr. Crouch	200	“ Despicable , ”
187748	187772	187741	187741	Bagman	202	“ Rookwood get him a job indeed ... The day Ludo Bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the Ministry ... ”
187872	187877	187878	187878	he	158	“ Bring them in , ”
188096	188109	188110	188110	he	200	“ You have been brought here before the Council of Magical Law , ”
188114	188130	188110	188110	he	200	“ so that we may pass judgment on you , for a crime so heinous — ”
188131	188134	188136	188143	the boy with the straw - colored hair	4162	“ Father , ”
188145	188150	188136	188143	the boy with the straw - colored hair	4162	“ Father ... please ... ”
188151	188166	188168	188168	Crouch	200	“ — that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court , ”
188181	188238	188168	188168	Crouch	200	“ We have heard the evidence against you . The four of you stand accused of capturing an Auror — Frank Longbottom — and subjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse , believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master , He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named — ”
188239	188246	188248	188252	the boy in chains below	4164	“ Father , I did n’t ! ”
188254	188274	188248	188252	the boy in chains below	4164	“ I did n’t , I swear it , Father , do n’t send me back to the dementors — ”
188275	188281	188283	188284	Mr. Crouch	200	“ You are further accused , ”
188286	188345	188283	188284	Mr. Crouch	200	“ of using the Cruciatus Curse on Frank Longbottom ’s wife , when he would not give you information . You planned to restore He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named to power , and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong . I now ask the jury — ”
188346	188349	188351	188352	the boy	4759	“ Mother ! ”
188371	188390	188356	188361	the wispy little witch beside Crouch	4161	“ Mother , stop him , Mother , I did n’t do it , it was n’t me ! ”
188391	188398	188400	188401	Mr. Crouch	200	“ I now ask the jury , ”
188403	188426	188400	188401	Mr. Crouch	200	“ to raise their hands if they believe , as I do , that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban ! ”
188474	188509	188468	188469	The boy	4759	“ No ! Mother , no ! I did n’t do it , I did n’t do it , I did n’t know ! Do n’t send me there , do n’t let him ! ”
188545	188597	188541	188541	Crouch	200	“ The Dark Lord will rise again , Crouch ! Throw us into Azkaban ; we will wait ! He will rise again and will come for us , he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters ! We alone were faithful ! We alone tried to find him ! ”
188652	188658	188659	188659	he	4759	“ I ’m your son ! ”
188665	188671	188659	188659	he	4759	“ I ’m your son ! ”
188672	188680	188682	188683	Mr. Crouch	200	“ You are no son of mine ! ”
188690	188696	188685	188685	his	200	“ I have no son ! ”
188723	188728	188729	188729	Crouch	200	“ Take them away ! ”
188741	188752	188729	188729	Crouch	200	“ Take them away , and may they rot there ! ”
188753	188771	188729	188729	Crouch	200	“ Father ! Father , I was n’t involved ! No ! No ! Father , please ! ”
188772	188787	188729	188729	Crouch	200	“ I think , Harry , it is time to return to my office , ”
188848	188851	188853	188854	the Dumbledore	170	“ Come , ”
188947	188950	188951	188951	Harry	158	“ Professor , ”
188954	188976	188951	188951	Harry	158	“ I know I should n’t ’ve — I did n’t mean — the cabinet door was sort of open and — ”
188977	188982	188984	188984	Dumbledore	170	“ I quite understand , ”
189054	189059	189060	189060	Harry	158	“ What is it ? ”
189064	189073	189075	189075	Dumbledore	170	“ This ? It is called a Pensieve , ”
189077	189105	189075	189075	Dumbledore	170	“ I sometimes find , and I am sure you know the feeling , that I simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind . ”
189106	189109	189111	189111	Harry	158	“ Er , ”
189128	189133	189135	189135	Dumbledore	170	“ At these times , ”
189142	189192	189135	189135	Dumbledore	170	“ I use the Pensieve . One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one ’s mind , pours them into the basin , and examines them at one ’s leisure . It becomes easier to spot patterns and links , you understand , when they are in this form . ”
189193	189203	189204	189204	Harry	158	“ You mean ... that stuff ’s your thoughts ? ”
189217	189220	189222	189222	Dumbledore	170	“ Certainly , ”
189224	189230	189222	189222	Dumbledore	170	“ Let me show you . ”
189376	189392	189363	189363	his	333	“ It ’s coming back ... Karkaroff ’s too ... stronger and clearer than ever ... ”
189393	189403	189404	189404	Dumbledore	170	“ A connection I could have made without assistance , ”
189407	189412	189413	189413	He	170	“ but never mind . ”
189444	189483	189431	189431	Snape	333	“ I was using the Pensieve when Mr. Fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather hastily . Undoubtedly I did not fasten the cabinet door properly . Naturally , it would have attracted your attention . ”
189484	189489	189490	189490	Harry	158	“ I ’m sorry , ”
189498	189505	189506	189506	he	170	“ Curiosity is not a sin , ”
189509	189523	189506	189506	he	170	“ But we should exercise caution with our curiosity ... yes , indeed ... ”
189610	189645	189588	189588	her	4192	“ He put a hex on me , Professor Dumbledore , and I was only teasing him , sir , I only said I ’d seen him kissing Florence behind the greenhouses last Thursday ... ”
189646	189652	189654	189654	Dumbledore	170	“ But why , Bertha , ”
189666	189679	189654	189654	Dumbledore	170	“ why did you have to follow him in the first place ? ”
189680	189683	189684	189684	Harry	158	“ Bertha ? ”
189692	189701	189684	189684	Harry	158	“ Is that — was that Bertha Jorkins ? ”
189702	189705	189707	189707	Dumbledore	170	“ Yes , ”
189732	189743	189717	189717	Bertha	160	“ That was Bertha as I remember her at school . ”
189794	189799	189801	189801	Dumbledore	170	“ So , Harry , ”
189804	189820	189801	189801	Dumbledore	170	“ Before you got lost in my thoughts , you wanted to tell me something . ”
189821	189824	189826	189826	Harry	158	“ Yes , ”
189828	189846	189826	189826	Harry	158	“ Professor — I was in Divination just now , and — er — I fell asleep . ”
189863	189869	189859	189859	Dumbledore	170	“ Quite understandable . Continue . ”
189870	189878	189880	189880	Harry	158	“ Well , I had a dream , ”
189882	189899	189880	189880	Harry	158	“ A dream about Lord Voldemort . He was torturing Wormtail ... you know who Wormtail — ”
189900	189905	189907	189907	Dumbledore	170	“ I do know , ”
189910	189914	189907	189907	Dumbledore	170	“ Please continue . ”
189915	189992	189993	189993	Harry	158	“ Voldemort got a letter from an owl . He said something like , Wormtail ’s blunder had been repaired . He said someone was dead . Then he said , Wormtail would n’t be fed to the snake — there was a snake beside his chair . He said — he said he ’d be feeding me to it , instead . Then he did the Cruciatus Curse on Wormtail — and my scar hurt , ”
189996	190007	189993	189993	Harry	158	“ It woke me up , it hurt so badly . ”
190014	190021	190023	190023	Harry	158	“ Er — that ’s all , ”
190025	190029	190031	190031	Dumbledore	170	“ I see , ”
190034	190062	190031	190031	Dumbledore	170	“ I see . Now , has your scar hurt at any other time this year , excepting the time it woke you up over the summer ? ”
190063	190080	190082	190082	Harry	158	“ No , I — how did you know it woke me up over the summer ? ”
190086	190095	190097	190097	Dumbledore	170	“ You are not Sirius ’s only correspondent , ”
190099	190133	190097	190097	Dumbledore	170	“ I have also been in contact with him ever since he left Hogwarts last year . It was I who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay . ”
190200	190203	190204	190204	he	170	“ Professor ? ”
190222	190226	190227	190227	he	170	“ My apologies , ”
190239	190251	190231	190231	He	170	“ D’you — d’you know why my scar ’s hurting me ? ”
190266	190305	190252	190252	Dumbledore	170	“ I have a theory , no more than that ... It is my belief that your scar hurts both when Lord Voldemort is near you , and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred . ”
190306	190311	190252	190252	Dumbledore	170	“ But ... why ? ”
190312	190325	190327	190327	Dumbledore	170	“ Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed , ”
190329	190336	190327	190327	Dumbledore	170	“ That is no ordinary scar . ”
190337	190350	190252	190252	Dumbledore	170	“ So you think ... that dream ... did it really happen ? ”
190351	190356	190358	190358	Dumbledore	170	“ It is possible , ”
190360	190374	190358	190358	Dumbledore	170	“ I would say — probable . Harry — did you see Voldemort ? ”
190375	190378	190380	190380	Harry	158	“ No , ”
190382	190429	190430	190430	Harry	158	“ Just the back of his chair . But — there would n’t have been anything to see , would there ? I mean , he has n’t got a body , has he ? But ... but then how could he have held the wand ? ”
190434	190438	190440	190440	Dumbledore	170	“ How indeed ? ”
190442	190446	190440	190440	Dumbledore	170	“ How indeed ... ”
190492	190495	190496	190496	Harry	158	“ Professor , ”
190501	190510	190496	190496	Harry	158	“ do you think he ’s getting stronger ? ”
190511	190514	190516	190516	Dumbledore	170	“ Voldemort ? ”
190565	190579	190547	190547	Dumbledore	170	“ Once again , Harry , I can only give you my suspicions . ”
190595	190605	190606	190606	he	170	“ The years of Voldemort ’s ascent to power , ”
190616	190642	190609	190609	Dumbledore	170	“ These disappearances seem to me to be linked . The Ministry disagrees — as you may have heard , while waiting outside my office . ”
190678	190681	190682	190682	he	158	“ Professor ? ”
190686	190691	190693	190693	Dumbledore	170	“ Yes , Harry ? ”
190695	190715	190693	190693	Dumbledore	170	“ Er ... could I ask you about ... that court thing I was in ... in the Pensieve ? ”
190716	190720	190722	190722	Dumbledore	170	“ You could , ”
190725	190747	190722	190722	Dumbledore	170	“ I attended it many times , but some trials come back to me more clearly than others ... particularly now ... ”
190748	190778	190693	190693	Dumbledore	170	“ You know — you know the trial you found me in ? The one with Crouch ’s son ? Well ... were they talking about Neville ’s parents ? ”
190787	190803	190804	190804	he	170	“ Has Neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother ? ”
190837	190848	190850	190850	Dumbledore	170	“ Yes , they were talking about Neville ’s parents , ”
190852	190888	190850	190850	Dumbledore	170	“ His father , Frank , was an Auror just like Professor Moody . He and his wife were tortured for information about Voldemort ’s whereabouts after he lost his powers , as you heard . ”
190889	190895	190897	190897	Harry	158	“ So they ’re dead ? ”
190900	190903	190905	190905	Dumbledore	170	“ No , ”
190920	190959	190905	190905	Dumbledore	170	“ They are insane . They are both in St. Mungo ’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries . I believe Neville visits them , with his grandmother , during the holidays . They do not recognize him . ”
190984	190991	190993	190993	Dumbledore	170	“ The Longbottoms were very popular , ”
190995	191060	190993	190993	Dumbledore	170	“ The attacks on them came after Voldemort ’s fall from power , just when everyone thought they were safe . Those attacks caused a wave of fury such as I have never known . The Ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it . Unfortunately , the Longbottoms ’ evidence was — given their condition — none too reliable . ”
191061	191073	191075	191075	Harry	158	“ Then Mr. Crouch ’s son might not have been involved ? ”
191083	191093	191080	191080	his	170	“ As to that , I have no idea . ”
191129	191132	191133	191133	he	158	“ Er , ”
191136	191140	191133	191133	he	158	“ Mr. Bagman ... ”
191141	191153	191155	191155	Dumbledore	170	“ ... has never been accused of any Dark activity since , ”
191158	191161	191163	191163	Harry	158	“ Right , ”
191188	191193	191182	191182	Dumbledore	170	“ And ... er ... ”
191228	191235	191236	191236	he	170	“ No more has Professor Snape , ”
191267	191281	191242	191242	Dumbledore	170	“ What made you think he ’d really stopped supporting Voldemort , Professor ? ”
191296	191310	191282	191282	Dumbledore	170	“ That , Harry , is a matter between Professor Snape and myself . ”
191351	191354	191355	191355	he	158	“ Harry , ”
191363	191390	191355	191355	he	158	“ Please do not speak about Neville ’s parents to anybody else . He has the right to let people know , when he is ready . ”
191391	191396	191398	191398	Harry	158	“ Yes , Professor , ”
191404	191407	191355	191355	he	158	“ And — ”
191448	191456	191436	191436	He	170	“ Good luck with the third task . ”
191457	191472	191473	191473	Ron	171	“ Dumbledore reckons You - Know - Who ’s getting stronger again as well ? ”
191606	191612	191613	191613	Ron	171	“ And he trusts Snape ? ”
191616	191632	191613	191613	Ron	171	“ He really trusts Snape , even though he knows he was a Death Eater ? ”
191633	191636	191638	191638	Harry	158	“ Yes , ”
191678	191682	191683	191683	she	169	“ Rita Skeeter , ”
191687	191697	191699	191699	Ron	171	“ How can you be worrying about her now ? ”
191705	191713	191714	191714	Hermione	169	“ I ’m not worrying about her , ”
191720	191812	191714	191714	Hermione	169	“ I ’m just thinking ... remember what she said to me in the Three Broomsticks ? ‘ I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl . ’ This is what she meant , is n’t it ? She reported his trial , she knew he ’d passed information to the Death Eaters . And Winky too , remember ... ‘ Ludo Bagman ’s a bad wizard . ’ Mr. Crouch would have been furious he got off , he would have talked about it at home . ”
191813	191828	191829	191829	Hermione	169	“ Yeah , but Bagman did n’t pass information on purpose , did he ? ”
191832	191841	191842	191842	Ron	171	“ And Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked Crouch ? ”
191850	191853	191855	191855	Harry	158	“ Yeah , ”
191857	191872	191855	191855	Harry	158	“ but he ’s only saying that because Crouch disappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage . ”
191873	191883	191885	191885	Ron	171	“ We never thought of her , did we ? ”
191888	191908	191885	191885	Ron	171	“ Mind you , she ’s definitely got giant blood , and she does n’t want to admit it — ”
191909	191916	191918	191918	Hermione	169	“ Of course she does n’t , ”
191924	191984	191918	191918	Hermione	169	“ Look what happened to Hagrid when Rita found out about his mother . Look at Fudge , jumping to conclusions about her , just because she ’s part giant . Who needs that sort of prejudice ? I ’d probably say I had big bones if I knew that ’s what I ’d get for telling the truth . ”
191991	191999	192000	192000	she	169	“ We have n’t done any practicing ! ”
192006	192039	192000	192000	she	169	“ We were going to do the Impediment Curse ! We ’ll have to really get down to it tomorrow ! Come on , Harry , you need to get some sleep . ”
192306	192313	192314	192314	Hermione	169	“ Do n’t worry about it , ”
192338	192366	192318	192318	Harry	158	“ at least we ’ll get top marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts . We ’d never have found out about all these hexes in class . ”
192367	192377	192379	192379	Ron	171	“ Good training for when we ’re all Aurors , ”
192676	192686	192687	192687	Hermione	169	“ You ’re still doing really well , though , ”
192705	192716	192693	192693	her	169	“ Some of these are bound to come in handy . ”
192717	192724	192726	192726	Ron	171	“ Come and look at this , ”
192743	192749	192735	192735	He	171	“ What ’s Malfoy doing ? ”
192801	192813	192815	192815	Harry	158	“ He looks like he ’s using a walkie - talkie , ”
192818	192824	192826	192826	Hermione	169	“ He ca n’t be , ”
192828	192849	192850	192850	she	169	“ I ’ve told you , those sorts of things do n’t work around Hogwarts . Come on , Harry , ”
192869	192878	192850	192850	she	169	“ let ’s try that Shield Charm again . ”
193197	193200	193202	193202	Harry	158	“ What ? ”
193211	193214	193216	193216	Hermione	169	“ Nothing , ”
193241	193252	193233	193233	He	171	“ No way . Not today . That old cow . ”
193253	193256	193258	193258	Harry	158	“ What ? ”
193260	193265	193258	193258	Harry	158	“ Rita Skeeter again ? ”
193266	193269	193271	193271	Ron	171	“ No , ”
193288	193298	193300	193300	Harry	158	“ It ’s about me , is n’t it ? ”
193302	193305	193307	193307	Ron	171	“ No , ”
193337	193365	193325	193326	Draco Malfoy	257	“ Hey , Potter ! Potter ! How ’s your head ? You feeling all right ? Sure you ’re not going to go berserk on us ? ”
193396	193402	193403	193403	Harry	158	“ Let me see it , ”
193408	193413	193403	193403	Harry	158	“ Give it here . ”
193441	193452	193454	193454	Harry	158	“ Gone off me a bit , has n’t she ? ”
193498	193509	193510	193510	Ron	171	“ How did she know your scar hurt in Divination ? ”
193513	193531	193510	193510	Ron	171	“ There ’s no way she was there , there ’s no way she could ’ve heard — ”
193532	193538	193540	193540	Harry	158	“ The window was open , ”
193542	193549	193540	193540	Harry	158	“ I opened it to breathe . ”
193550	193560	193561	193561	Hermione	169	“ You were at the top of North Tower ! ”
193564	193579	193561	193561	Hermione	169	“ Your voice could n’t have carried all the way down to the grounds ! ”
193580	193598	193600	193600	Harry	158	“ Well , you ’re the one who ’s supposed to be researching magical methods of bugging ! ”
193602	193611	193600	193600	Harry	158	“ You tell me how she did it ! ”
193612	193618	193620	193620	Hermione	169	“ I ’ve been trying ! ”
193622	193628	193620	193620	Hermione	169	“ But I ... but ... ”
193654	193660	193662	193662	Ron	171	“ Are you all right ? ”
193668	193671	193673	193673	Hermione	169	“ Yes , ”
193713	193720	193721	193721	Hermione	169	“ I ’ve had an idea , ”
193728	193793	193721	193721	Hermione	169	“ I think I know ... because then no one would be able to see ... even Moody ... and she ’d have been able to get onto the window ledge ... but she ’s not allowed ... she ’s definitely not allowed ... I think we ’ve got her ! Just give me two seconds in the library — just to make sure ! ”
193810	193813	193814	193814	Ron	171	“ Oi ! ”
193819	193834	193835	193835	he	171	“ We ’ve got our History of Magic exam in ten minutes ! Blimey , ”
193843	193874	193835	193835	he	171	“ she must really hate that Skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam . What ’re you going to do in Binns ’s class — read again ? ”
193912	193916	193917	193917	Harry	158	“ S’pose so , ”
193937	193953	193954	193954	she	320	“ Potter , the champions are congregating in the chamber off the Hall after breakfast , ”
193957	193966	193968	193968	Harry	158	“ But the task ’s not till tonight ! ”
193985	193994	193995	193995	she	320	“ I ’m aware of that , Potter , ”
193998	194025	193995	193995	she	320	“ The champions ’ families are invited to watch the final task , you know . This is simply a chance for you to greet them . ”
194035	194049	194050	194050	he	158	“ She does n’t expect the Dursleys to turn up , does she ? ”
194055	194058	194060	194060	Ron	171	“ Dunno , ”
194062	194083	194060	194060	Ron	171	“ Harry , I ’d better hurry , I ’m going to be late for Binns . See you later . ”
194205	194217	194201	194201	his	209	“ Harry , come on , they ’re waiting for you ! ”
194350	194353	194354	194355	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Surprise ! ”
194368	194379	194380	194380	She	174	“ Thought we ’d come and watch you , Harry ! ”
194390	194395	194397	194397	Bill	185	“ You all right ? ”
194407	194430	194397	194397	Bill	185	“ Charlie wanted to come , but he could n’t get time off . He said you were incredible against the Horntail . ”
194467	194475	194476	194476	Harry	158	“ This is really nice of you , ”
194482	194492	194476	194476	Harry	158	“ I thought for a moment — the Dursleys — ”
194493	194496	194498	194499	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Hmm , ”
194528	194536	194538	194538	Bill	185	“ It ’s great being back here , ”
194561	194584	194545	194545	Violet	393	“ Have n’t seen this place for five years . Is that picture of the mad knight still around ? Sir Cadogan ? ”
194585	194589	194591	194591	Harry	158	“ Oh yeah , ”
194602	194608	194610	194610	Bill	185	“ And the Fat Lady ? ”
194612	194620	194622	194623	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ She was here in my time , ”
194625	194648	194622	194623	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ She gave me such a telling off one night when I got back to the dormitory at four in the morning — ”
194649	194664	194666	194666	Bill	185	“ What were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning ? ”
194682	194694	194695	194695	she	174	“ Your father and I had been for a nighttime stroll , ”
194698	194722	194695	194695	she	174	“ He got caught by Apollyon Pringle — he was the caretaker in those days — your father ’s still got the marks . ”
194723	194732	194734	194734	Bill	185	“ Fancy giving us a tour , Harry ? ”
194736	194741	194743	194743	Harry	158	“ Yeah , okay , ”
194769	194777	194778	194778	he	208	“ There you are , are you ? ”
194787	194810	194778	194778	he	208	“ Bet you ’re not feeling quite as full of yourself now Cedric ’s caught you up on points , are you ? ”
194811	194814	194816	194816	Harry	158	“ What ? ”
194818	194822	194824	194824	Cedric	209	“ Ignore him , ”
194837	194867	194824	194824	Cedric	209	“ He ’s been angry ever since Rita Skeeter ’s article about the Triwizard Tournament — you know , when she made out you were the only Hogwarts champion . ”
194868	194881	194883	194884	Amos Diggory	208	“ Did n’t bother to correct her , though , did he ? ”
194907	194926	194905	194905	Bill	185	“ Still ... you ’ll show him , Ced . Beaten him once before , have n’t you ? ”
194927	194941	194942	194943	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Rita Skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble , Amos ! ”
194947	194962	194942	194943	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ I would have thought you ’d know that , working at the Ministry ! ”
195055	195060	195061	195061	Harry	158	“ How ’s Percy ? ”
195070	195074	195076	195076	Bill	185	“ Not good , ”
195078	195084	195086	195087	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ He ’s very upset , ”
195096	195176	195090	195090	her	174	“ The Ministry wants to keep Mr. Crouch ’s disappearance quiet , but Percy ’s been hauled in for questioning about the instructions Mr. Crouch has been sending in . They seem to think there ’s a chance they were n’t genuinely written by him . Percy ’s been under a lot of strain . They ’re not letting him fill in for Mr. Crouch as the fifth judge tonight . Cornelius Fudge is going to be doing it . ”
195185	195190	195192	195192	Ron	171	“ Mum — Bill ! ”
195204	195211	195192	195192	Ron	171	“ What ’re you doing here ? ”
195212	195222	195224	195225	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Come to watch Harry in the last task ! ”
195228	195249	195224	195225	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ I must say , it makes a lovely change , not having to cook . How was your exam ? ”
195250	195255	195257	195257	Ron	171	“ Oh ... okay , ”
195259	195281	195282	195282	he	171	“ Could n’t remember all the goblin rebels ’ names , so I invented a few . It ’s all right , ”
195298	195318	195293	195294	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ they ’re all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean ; it was n’t hard . ”
195388	195397	195379	195379	she	169	“ Are you going to tell us — ? ”
195409	195414	195416	195417	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Hello , Hermione , ”
195425	195428	195430	195430	Hermione	169	“ Hello , ”
195453	195480	195445	195445	Harry	158	“ Mrs. Weasley , you did n’t believe that rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote in Witch Weekly , did you ? Because Hermione ’s not my girlfriend . ”
195481	195484	195486	195487	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Oh ! ”
195489	195498	195486	195487	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ No — of course I did n’t ! ”
195654	195703	195643	195643	his	170	“ Ladies and gentlemen , in five minutes ’ time , I will be asking you to make your way down to the Quidditch field for the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament . Will the champions please follow Mr. Bagman down to the stadium now . ”

203746	203798	203742	203742	he	159	“ A Muggle and a fool ... very like your dear mother . But they both had their uses , did they not ? Your mother died to defend you as a child ... and I killed my father , and see how useful he has proved himself , in death ... ”
203840	203849	203850	203850	he	159	“ Listen to me , reliving family history ... ”

204915	204940	204909	204910	Mr. Malfoy	258	“ Yes , I know all about that , Lucius ... You have disappointed me ... I expect more faithful service in the future . ”

205102	205107	205061	205061	Voldemort	159	“ Yes , Master ... ”
205108	205114	205061	205061	Voldemort	159	“ We will , Master ... ”
205115	205124	205126	205126	Voldemort	159	“ The same goes for you , Nott , ”
205141	205157	205061	205061	Voldemort	159	“ My Lord , I prostrate myself before you , I am your most faithful — ”
205158	205163	205165	205165	Voldemort	159	“ That will do , ”
205197	205260	205177	205177	he	159	“ And here we have six missing Death Eaters ... three dead in my service . One , too cowardly to return ... he will pay . One , who I believe has left me forever ... he will be killed , of course ... and one , who remains my most faithful servant , and who has already reentered my service . ”
205280	205306	205313	205313	his	159	“ He is at Hogwarts , that faithful servant , and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight ... Yes , ”
205328	205354	205313	205313	his	159	“ Harry Potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party . One might go so far as to call him my guest of honor . ”
205383	205415	205373	205374	Lucius Malfoy	256	“ Master , we crave to know ... we beg you to tell us ... how you have achieved this ... this miracle ... how you managed to return to us ... ”
205416	205427	205429	205429	Voldemort	159	“ Ah , what a story it is , Lucius , ”
205431	205445	205429	205429	Voldemort	159	“ And it begins — and ends — with my young friend here . ”
205495	205535	205481	205481	his	159	“ His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice ... This is old magic , I should have remembered it , I was foolish to overlook it ... but no matter . I can touch him now . ”
205685	205688	205680	205680	He	159	“ Crucio ! ”
205787	205811	205813	205813	Voldemort	159	“ You see , I think , how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me , ”
205815	205829	205830	205830	Wormtail	154	“ Now untie him , Wormtail , and give him back his wand . ”
205995	206007	206012	206012	his	159	“ You have been taught how to duel , Harry Potter ? ”

206149	206158	206160	206160	Voldemort	159	“ We bow to each other , Harry , ”
206175	206198	206160	206160	Voldemort	159	“ Come , the niceties must be observed ... Dumbledore would like you to show manners ... Bow to death , Harry ... ”
206242	206248	206249	206249	Voldemort	159	“ I said , bow , ”
206284	206288	206295	206295	he	159	“ Very good , ”
206308	206337	206304	206304	Harry	158	“ And now you face me , like a man ... straight - backed and proud , the way your father died ... And now — we duel . ”
206477	206482	206484	206484	Voldemort	159	“ A little break , ”
206495	206522	206484	206484	Voldemort	159	“ a little pause ... That hurt , did n’t it , Harry ? You do n’t want me to do that again , do you ? ”
206585	206598	206600	206600	Voldemort	159	“ I asked you whether you want me to do that again , ”
206603	206609	206600	206600	Voldemort	159	“ Answer me ! Imperio ! ”

206793	206822	206785	206787	the Death Eaters	5231	“ You wo n’t say no ? Harry , obedience is a virtue I need to teach you before you die ... Perhaps another little dose of pain ? ”
206874	206887	206889	206889	Voldemort	159	“ We are not playing hide - and - seek , Harry , ”
207059	207062	207056	207056	Harry	158	“ Expelliarmus ! ”

209891	209903	209904	209904	Dumbledore	170	“ That ’s right , Harry ... just let go now ... ”
209967	209972	209950	209953	The crowd around them	4499	“ What ’s happened ? ”
209973	209980	209950	209953	The crowd around them	4499	“ What ’s wrong with him ? ”
209981	209986	209950	209953	The crowd around them	4499	“ Diggory ’s dead ! ”
209987	209998	209999	209999	Fudge	255	“ He ’ll need to go to the hospital wing ! ”
210004	210029	209999	209999	Fudge	255	“ He ’s ill , he ’s injured — Dumbledore , Diggory ’s parents , they ’re here , they ’re in the stands ... ”
210030	210043	209999	209999	Fudge	255	“ I ’ll take Harry , Dumbledore , I ’ll take him — ”

210052	210079	209999	209999	Fudge	255	“ Dumbledore , Amos Diggory ’s running ... he ’s coming over ... Do n’t you think you should tell him — before he sees — ? ”
210080	210086	209999	209999	Fudge	255	“ Harry , stay here — ”
210103	210122	210087	210087	Girls	4882	“ It ’s all right , son , I ’ve got you ... come on ... hospital wing ... ”
210123	210128	210130	210130	Harry	158	“ Dumbledore said stay , ”
210158	210169	210185	210187	the frightened crowd	4502	“ You need to lie down ... Come on now ... ”
210242	210248	210249	210250	the man	1678	“ What happened , Harry ? ”
210348	210368	210328	210328	He	296	“ Voldemort ’s back , Harry ? You ’re sure he ’s back ? How did he do it ? ”
210369	210386	210388	210388	Harry	158	“ He took stuff from his father ’s grave , and from Wormtail , and me , ”
210432	210442	210444	210444	Moody	296	“ What did the Dark Lord take from you ? ”
210446	210449	210451	210451	Harry	158	“ Blood , ”
210481	210490	210472	210472	his	296	“ And the Death Eaters ? They returned ? ”
210491	210494	210496	210496	Harry	158	“ Yes , ”
210498	210503	210496	210496	Harry	158	“ Loads of them ... ”
210504	210511	210512	210512	Moody	296	“ How did he treat them ? ”
210516	210522	210512	210512	Moody	296	“ Did he forgive them ? ”
210542	210578	210535	210535	he	158	“ There ’s a Death Eater at Hogwarts ! There ’s a Death Eater here — they put my name in the Goblet of Fire , they made sure I got through to the end — ”
210592	210601	210602	210602	he	296	“ I know who the Death Eater is , ”
210606	210609	210611	210611	Harry	158	“ Karkaroff ? ”
210614	210629	210611	210611	Harry	158	“ Where is he ? Have you got him ? Is he locked up ? ”
210630	210633	210635	210635	Moody	296	“ Karkaroff ? ”
210641	210691	210635	210635	Moody	296	“ Karkaroff fled tonight , when he felt the Dark Mark burn upon his arm . He betrayed too many faithful supporters of the Dark Lord to wish to meet them ... but I doubt he will get far . The Dark Lord has ways of tracking his enemies . ”
210692	210714	210611	210611	Harry	158	“ Karkaroff ’s gone ? He ran away ? But then — he did n’t put my name in the goblet ? ”
210715	210718	210720	210720	Moody	296	“ No , ”
210723	210737	210720	210720	Moody	296	“ No , he did n’t . It was I who did that . ”
210746	210753	210754	210754	he	158	“ No , you did n’t , ”
210757	210770	210754	210754	he	158	“ You did n’t do that ... you ca n’t have done ... ”
210771	210778	210780	210780	Moody	296	“ I assure you I did , ”
210825	210832	210833	210833	he	296	“ He forgave them , then ? ”
210836	210850	210833	210833	he	296	“ The Death Eaters who went free ? The ones who escaped Azkaban ? ”
210851	210854	210856	210856	Harry	158	“ What ? ”
210881	210886	210888	210888	Moody	296	“ I asked you , ”
210891	210956	210888	210888	Moody	296	“ whether he forgave the scum who never even went to look for him . Those treacherous cowards who would n’t even brave Azkaban for him . The faithless , worthless bits of filth who were brave enough to cavort in masks at the Quidditch World Cup , but fled at the sight of the Dark Mark when I fired it into the sky . ”
210957	210968	210833	210833	he	296	“ You fired ... What are you talking about ... ? ”
210969	211036	211037	211037	Moody	296	“ I told you , Harry ... I told you . If there ’s one thing I hate more than any other , it ’s a Death Eater who walked free . They turned their backs on my master when he needed them most . I expected him to punish them . I expected him to torture them . Tell me he hurt them , Harry ... ”
211048	211080	211037	211037	Moody	296	“ Tell me he told them that I , I alone remained faithful ... prepared to risk everything to deliver to him the one thing he wanted above all ... you . ”
211081	211094	211037	211037	Moody	296	“ You did n’t ... it — it ca n’t be you ... ”
211095	211168	211037	211037	Moody	296	“ Who put your name in the Goblet of Fire , under the name of a different school ? I did . Who frightened off every person I thought might try to hurt you or prevent you from winning the tournament ? I did . Who nudged Hagrid into showing you the dragons ? I did . Who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon ? I did . ”
211223	211280	211282	211282	Moody	296	“ You were so long in that lake , Potter , I thought you had drowned . But luckily , Dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility , and marked you high for it . I breathed again . You had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight , of course , ”
211375	211394	211396	211396	Moody	296	“ The Dark Lord did n’t manage to kill you , Potter , and he so wanted to , ”
211398	211463	211396	211396	Moody	296	“ Imagine how he will reward me when he finds I have done it for him . I gave you to him — the thing he needed above all to regenerate — and then I killed you for him . I will be honored beyond all other Death Eaters . I will be his dearest , his closest supporter ... closer than a son ... ”
211496	211503	211505	211505	Moody	296	“ The Dark Lord and I , ”
211523	211588	211508	211508	he	296	“ have much in common . Both of us , for instance , had very disappointing fathers ... very disappointing indeed . Both of us suffered the indignity , Harry , of being named after those fathers . And both of us had the pleasure ... the very great pleasure ... of killing our fathers to ensure the continued rise of the Dark Order ! ”
211589	211594	211595	211595	Harry	158	“ You ’re mad , ”
211604	211609	211595	211595	Harry	158	“ you ’re mad ! ”
211610	211616	211618	211618	Moody	296	“ Mad , am I ? ”
211625	211671	211620	211620	his	296	“ We ’ll see ! We ’ll see who ’s mad , now that the Dark Lord has returned , with me at his side ! He is back , Harry Potter , you did not conquer him — and now — I conquer you ! ”
211691	211694	211684	211684	his	158	“ Stupefy ! ”
211949	211955	211956	211956	she	320	“ Come along , Potter , ”
211975	211982	211969	211969	she	320	“ Come along ... hospital wing ... ”
211983	211986	211988	211988	Dumbledore	170	“ No , ”
211991	212009	211969	211969	she	320	“ Dumbledore , he ought to — look at him — he ’s been through enough tonight — ”
212010	212023	212025	212025	Dumbledore	170	“ He will stay , Minerva , because he needs to understand , ”
212028	212065	212025	212025	Dumbledore	170	“ Understanding is the first step to acceptance , and only with acceptance can there be recovery . He needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered tonight , and why . ”
212066	212069	212070	212070	Harry	158	“ Moody , ”
212083	212091	212073	212073	He	158	“ How can it have been Moody ? ”
212092	212099	212101	212101	Dumbledore	170	“ This is not Alastor Moody , ”
212104	212141	212101	212101	Dumbledore	170	“ You have never known Alastor Moody . The real Moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight . The moment he took you , I knew — and I followed . ”
212183	212259	212175	212175	he	170	“ Severus , please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion you possess , and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the house - elf called Winky . Minerva , kindly go down to Hagrid ’s house , where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch . Take the dog up to my office , tell him I will be with him shortly , then come back here . ”
212541	212553	212554	212554	he	170	“ Stunned — controlled by the Imperius Curse — very weak , ”
212557	212599	212554	212554	he	170	“ Of course , they would have needed to keep him alive . Harry , throw down the imposter ’s cloak — he ’s freezing . Madam Pomfrey will need to see him , but he seems in no immediate danger . ”
212658	212664	212666	212666	Dumbledore	170	“ Polyjuice Potion , Harry , ”
212668	212727	212666	212666	Dumbledore	170	“ You see the simplicity of it , and the brilliance . For Moody never does drink except from his hip flask , he ’s well known for it . The imposter needed , of course , to keep the real Moody close by , so that he could continue making the potion . You see his hair ... ”
212738	212793	212728	212728	Dumbledore	170	“ The imposter has been cutting it off all year , see where it is uneven ? But I think , in the excitement of tonight , our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he should have done ... on the hour ... every hour ... We shall see . ”
213043	213046	213047	213047	Snape	333	“ Crouch ! ”
213056	213060	213047	213047	Snape	333	“ Barty Crouch ! ”
213061	213065	213067	213068	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Good heavens , ”
213105	213118	213098	213098	she	253	“ Master Barty , Master Barty , what is you doing here ? ”
213130	213148	213119	213119	She	253	“ You is killed him ! You is killed him ! You is killed Master ’s son ! ”
213149	213157	213159	213159	Dumbledore	170	“ He is simply Stunned , Winky , ”
213161	213174	213159	213159	Dumbledore	170	“ Step aside , please . Severus , you have the potion ? ”
213286	213289	213274	213274	he	170	“ Rennervate . ”
213318	213324	213325	213325	Dumbledore	170	“ Can you hear me ? ”
213335	213338	213339	213339	he	6517	“ Yes , ”
213342	213351	213353	213353	Dumbledore	170	“ I would like you to tell us , ”
213356	213371	213353	213353	Dumbledore	170	“ how you came to be here . How did you escape from Azkaban ? ”
213391	213473	213372	213372	Crouch	243	“ My mother saved me . She knew she was dying . She persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favor to her . He loved her as he had never loved me . He agreed . They came to visit me . They gave me a draught of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my mother ’s hairs . She took a draught of Polyjuice Potion containing one of my hairs . We took on each other ’s appearance . ”
213482	213502	213477	213477	her	253	“ Say no more , Master Barty , say no more , you is getting your father into trouble ! ”
213517	213605	213503	213504	But Crouch	243	“ The dementors are blind . They sensed one healthy , one dying person entering Azkaban . They sensed one healthy , one dying person leaving it . My father smuggled me out , disguised as my mother , in case any prisoners were watching through their doors . My mother died a short while afterward in Azkaban . She was careful to drink Polyjuice Potion until the end . She was buried under my name and bearing my appearance . Everyone believed her to be me . ”
213612	213629	213631	213631	Dumbledore	170	“ And what did your father do with you , when he had got you home ? ”
213634	213709	213503	213504	But Crouch	243	“ Staged my mother ’s death . A quiet , private funeral . That grave is empty . The house - elf nursed me back to health . Then I had to be concealed . I had to be controlled . My father had to use a number of spells to subdue me . When I had recovered my strength , I thought only of finding my master ... of returning to his service . ”
213710	213718	213720	213720	Dumbledore	170	“ How did your father subdue you ? ”
213722	213727	213728	213728	Crouch	243	“ The Imperius Curse , ”
213731	213788	213728	213728	Crouch	243	“ I was under my father ’s control . I was forced to wear an Invisibility Cloak day and night . I was always with the house - elf . She was my keeper and caretaker . She pitied me . She persuaded my father to give me occasional treats . Rewards for my good behavior . ”
213789	213796	213798	213798	Winky	253	“ Master Barty , Master Barty , ”
213803	213818	213798	213798	Winky	253	“ You is n’t ought to tell them , we is getting in trouble ... ”
213819	213830	213832	213832	Dumbledore	170	“ Did anybody ever discover that you were still alive ? ”
213835	213848	213832	213832	Dumbledore	170	“ Did anyone know except your father and the house - elf ? ”
213849	213852	213854	213854	Crouch	243	“ Yes , ”
213861	213971	213854	213854	Crouch	243	“ A witch in my father ’s office . Bertha Jorkins . She came to the house with papers for my father ’s signature . He was not at home . Winky showed her inside and returned to the kitchen , to me . But Bertha Jorkins heard Winky talking to me . She came to investigate . She heard enough to guess who was hiding under the Invisibility Cloak . My father arrived home . She confronted him . He put a very powerful Memory Charm on her to make her forget what she ’d found out . Too powerful . He said it damaged her memory permanently . ”
213972	213986	213988	213988	Winky	253	“ Why is she coming to nose into my master ’s private business ? ”
213990	213999	213988	213988	Winky	253	“ Why is n’t she leaving us be ? ”
214000	214009	214011	214011	Dumbledore	170	“ Tell me about the Quidditch World Cup , ”
214013	214021	214023	214023	Winky	253	“ Master Barty , you bad boy ! ”
214031	214038	214040	214040	Dumbledore	170	“ So you took the wand , ”
214042	214051	214040	214040	Dumbledore	170	“ and what did you do with it ? ”
214097	214167	214090	214090	She	253	“ It was very quick . My father was placed under the Imperius Curse by my master . Now my father was the one imprisoned , controlled . My master forced him to go about his business as usual , to act as though nothing was wrong . And I was released . I awoke . I was myself again , alive as I had n’t been in years . ”
214168	214179	214181	214181	Dumbledore	170	“ And what did Lord Voldemort ask you to do ? ”
214183	214289	214090	214090	She	253	“ He asked me whether I was ready to risk everything for him . I was ready . It was my dream , my greatest ambition , to serve him , to prove myself to him . He told me he needed to place a faithful servant at Hogwarts . A servant who would guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament without appearing to do so . A servant who would watch over Harry Potter . Ensure he reached the Triwizard Cup . Turn the Cup into a Portkey , which would take the first person to touch it to my master . But first — ”
214290	214296	214298	214298	Dumbledore	170	“ You needed Alastor Moody , ”
214312	214323	214325	214325	Dumbledore	170	“ And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody ? ”
214327	214350	214090	214090	She	253	“ Wormtail returned to care for my master , in my father ’s house , and to keep watch over my father . ”
214351	214357	214359	214359	Dumbledore	170	“ But your father escaped , ”
214361	214364	214366	214366	Dumbledore	170	“ Map ? ”
214369	214375	214366	214366	Dumbledore	170	“ What map is this ? ”
214376	214425	214090	214090	She	253	“ Potter ’s map of Hogwarts . Potter saw me on it . Potter saw me stealing more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape ’s office one night . He thought I was my father . We have the same first name . I killed my father . ”
214426	214429	214431	214431	Winky	253	“ Noooo ! ”
214433	214445	214431	214431	Winky	253	“ Master Barty , Master Barty , what is you saying ? ”
214446	214452	214453	214453	Dumbledore	170	“ You killed your father , ”
214462	214471	214453	214453	Dumbledore	170	“ What did you do with the body ? ”
214472	214486	214090	214090	She	253	“ Carried it into the forest . Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak . ”
214504	214508	214501	214501	Dumbledore	170	“ And tonight ... ”
214509	214523	214525	214526	Barty Crouch	243	“ I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner , ”
214528	214559	214525	214526	Barty Crouch	243	“ Turned it into a Portkey . My master ’s plan worked . He is returned to power and I will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards . ”
214636	214653	214630	214630	He	170	“ Minerva , could I ask you to stand guard here while I take Harry upstairs ? ”
214654	214658	214660	214661	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Of course , ”
214699	214701	214703	214703	Dumbledore	170	“ Severus ”
214708	214777	214703	214703	Dumbledore	170	“ please tell Madam Pomfrey to come down here ; we need to get Alastor Moody into the hospital wing . Then go down into the grounds , find Cornelius Fudge , and bring him up to this office . He will undoubtedly want to question Crouch himself . Tell him I will be in the hospital wing in half an hour ’s time if he needs me . ”
214788	214791	214792	214792	Dumbledore	170	“ Harry ? ”
214851	214865	214866	214866	he	170	“ I want you to come up to my office first , Harry , ”
214876	214884	214866	214866	he	170	“ Sirius is waiting for us there . ”
215006	215009	215010	215010	Harry	158	“ Professor , ”
215013	215021	215010	215010	Harry	158	“ where are Mr. and Mrs. Diggory ? ”
215022	215029	215031	215031	Dumbledore	170	“ They are with Professor Sprout , ”
215056	215070	215033	215033	His	170	“ She was Head of Cedric ’s House , and knew him best . ”
215139	215160	215133	215133	he	178	“ Harry , are you all right ? I knew it — I knew something like this — what happened ? ”
215177	215181	215182	215182	he	170	“ What happened ? ”
215272	215278	215280	215280	Harry	158	“ ’ Lo , Fawkes , ”
215353	215371	215373	215373	Dumbledore	170	“ I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze , Harry , ”
215375	215389	215391	215391	Sirius	178	“ We can leave that till morning , ca n’t we , Dumbledore ? ”
215404	215415	215394	215394	He	178	“ Let him have a sleep . Let him rest . ”
215455	215464	215465	215465	Dumbledore	170	“ If I thought I could help you , ”
215740	215758	215759	215759	Harry	158	“ He said my blood would make him stronger than if he ’d used someone else ’s , ”
215763	215800	215761	215761	Dumbledore	170	“ He said the protection my — my mother left in me — he ’d have it too . And he was right — he could touch me without hurting himself , he touched my face . ”
215858	215862	215863	215863	he	170	“ Very well , ”
215870	215884	215863	215863	he	170	“ Voldemort has overcome that particular barrier . Harry , continue , please . ”
216014	216019	216020	216020	he	178	“ The wands connected ? ”
216029	216032	216020	216020	he	178	“ Why ? ”
216049	216053	216054	216054	he	170	“ Priori Incantatem , ”
216078	216084	216086	216086	Sirius	178	“ The Reverse Spell effect ? ”
216089	216092	216094	216094	Dumbledore	170	“ Exactly , ”
216096	216127	216128	216128	he	170	“ Harry ’s wand and Voldemort ’s wand share cores . Each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix . This phoenix , in fact , ”
216150	216159	216160	216160	Harry	158	“ My wand ’s feather came from Fawkes ? ”
216165	216168	216170	216170	Dumbledore	170	“ Yes , ”
216172	216196	216170	216170	Dumbledore	170	“ Mr. Ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand , the moment you left his shop four years ago . ”
216197	216208	216210	216210	Sirius	178	“ So what happens when a wand meets its brother ? ”
216212	216222	216224	216224	Dumbledore	170	“ They will not work properly against each other , ”
216226	216281	216224	216224	Dumbledore	170	“ If , however , the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle ... a very rare effect will take place . One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed — in reverse . The most recent first ... and then those which preceded it ... ”
216292	216296	216298	216298	Dumbledore	170	“ Which means , ”
216308	216318	216301	216301	his	170	“ that some form of Cedric must have reappeared . ”
216323	216330	216332	216332	Sirius	178	“ Diggory came back to life ? ”
216335	216343	216345	216345	Dumbledore	170	“ No spell can reawaken the dead , ”
216348	216380	216345	216345	Dumbledore	170	“ All that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo . A shadow of the living Cedric would have emerged from the wand ... am I correct , Harry ? ”
216381	216387	216388	216388	Harry	158	“ He spoke to me , ”
216397	216411	216391	216391	He	158	“ The ... the ghost Cedric , or whatever he was , spoke . ”
216412	216416	216418	216418	Dumbledore	170	“ An echo , ”
216420	216445	216418	216418	Dumbledore	170	“ which retained Cedric ’s appearance and character . I am guessing other such forms appeared ... less recent victims of Voldemort ’s wand ... ”
216446	216451	216452	216452	Harry	158	“ An old man , ”
216460	216466	216452	216452	Harry	158	“ Bertha Jorkins . And ... ”
216467	216471	216473	216473	Dumbledore	170	“ Your parents ? ”
216476	216479	216481	216481	Harry	158	“ Yes , ”
216498	216506	216508	216508	Dumbledore	170	“ The last murders the wand performed , ”
216512	216547	216508	216508	Dumbledore	170	“ In reverse order . More would have appeared , of course , had you maintained the connection . Very well , Harry , these echoes , these shadows ... what did they do ? ”
216688	216695	216697	216697	Dumbledore	170	“ I will say it again , ”
216715	216726	216697	216697	Dumbledore	170	“ Sirius , would you like to stay with him ? ”
216835	216841	216825	216826	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Harry ! Oh Harry ! ”
216855	216858	216859	216859	he	170	“ Molly , ”
216867	216919	216920	216920	he	170	“ please listen to me for a moment . Harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight . He has just had to relive it for me . What he needs now is sleep , and peace , and quiet . If he would like you all to stay with him , ”
216934	216961	216920	216920	he	170	“ you may do so . But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer , and certainly not this evening . ”
216990	216999	216971	216971	She	174	“ Did you hear ? He needs quiet ! ”
217000	217003	217005	217006	Madam Pomfrey	305	“ Headmaster , ”
217018	217025	217005	217006	Madam Pomfrey	305	“ may I ask what — ? ”
217026	217038	217040	217040	Dumbledore	170	“ This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while , ”
217043	217065	217040	217040	Dumbledore	170	“ I assure you , he is extremely well trained . Harry — I will wait while you get into bed . ”
217122	217141	217143	217143	Dumbledore	170	“ I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge , Harry , ”
217145	217162	217163	217163	He	170	“ I would like you to remain here tomorrow until I have spoken to the school . ”
217209	217214	217215	217215	Harry	158	“ Is he okay ? ”
217218	217224	217226	217227	Madam Pomfrey	305	“ He ’ll be fine , ”
217299	217305	217306	217306	he	158	“ I ’m all right , ”
217310	217314	217306	217306	he	158	“ Just tired . ”
217353	217365	217366	217366	she	305	“ You ’ll need to drink all of this , Harry , ”
217369	217378	217366	217366	she	305	“ It ’s a potion for dreamless sleep . ”
217526	217538	217562	217562	Someone	717	“ They ’ll wake him if they do n’t shut up ! ”
217539	217555	217562	217562	Someone	717	“ What are they shouting about ? Nothing else can have happened , can it ? ”
217589	217596	217597	217597	she	174	“ That ’s Fudge ’s voice , ”
217600	217619	217597	217597	she	174	“ And that ’s Minerva McGonagall ’s , is n’t it ? But what are they arguing about ? ”
217636	217646	217624	217624	them	4592	“ Regrettable , but all the same , Minerva — ”
217653	217664	217666	217667	Professor McGonagall	320	“ You should never have brought it inside the castle ! ”
217669	217675	217666	217667	Professor McGonagall	320	“ When Dumbledore finds out — ”
217735	217740	217741	217741	Fudge	255	“ Where ’s Dumbledore ? ”
217747	217753	217755	217756	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ He ’s not here , ”
217759	217778	217755	217756	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ This is a hospital wing , Minister , do n’t you think you ’d do better to — ”
217792	217797	217799	217799	Dumbledore	170	“ What has happened ? ”
217809	217835	217806	217807	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Why are you disturbing these people ? Minerva , I ’m surprised at you — I asked you to stand guard over Barty Crouch — ”
217836	217850	217851	217851	she	4598	“ There is no need to stand guard over him anymore , Dumbledore ! ”
217854	217862	217851	217851	she	4598	“ The Minister has seen to that ! ”
217898	217917	217919	217919	Snape	390	“ When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for tonight ’s events , ”
217926	217962	217919	217919	Snape	390	“ he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question . He insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle . He brought it up to the office where Barty Crouch — ”
217963	217974	217975	217976	Professor McGonagall	320	“ I told him you would not agree , Dumbledore ! ”
217979	217997	217975	217976	Professor McGonagall	320	“ I told him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle , but — ”
217998	218003	218005	218005	Fudge	503	“ My dear woman ! ”
218018	218042	218005	218005	Fudge	503	“ as Minister of Magic , it is my decision whether I wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous — ”
218052	218063	218064	218064	she	320	“ The moment that — that thing entered the room , ”
218075	218085	218064	218064	she	320	“ it swooped down on Crouch and — and — ”
218151	218161	218163	218163	Fudge	503	“ By all accounts , he is no loss ! ”
218165	218176	218163	218163	Fudge	503	“ It seems he has been responsible for several deaths ! ”
218177	218188	218190	218190	Dumbledore	170	“ But he can not now give testimony , Cornelius , ”
218209	218222	218192	218192	He	170	“ He can not give evidence about why he killed those people . ”
218223	218239	218241	218241	Fudge	255	“ Why he killed them ? Well , that ’s no mystery , is it ? ”
218243	218278	218241	218241	Fudge	255	“ He was a raving lunatic ! From what Minerva and Severus have told me , he seems to have thought he was doing it all on You - Know - Who ’s instructions ! ”
218279	218289	218290	218290	Dumbledore	170	“ Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions , Cornelius , ”
218293	218326	218290	218290	Dumbledore	170	“ Those people ’s deaths were mere by - products of a plan to restore Voldemort to full strength again . The plan succeeded . Voldemort has been restored to his body . ”
218374	218390	218364	218364	He	255	“ You - Know - Who ... returned ? Preposterous . Come now , Dumbledore ... ”
218391	218401	218403	218403	Dumbledore	170	“ As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you , ”
218405	218471	218403	218403	Dumbledore	170	“ we heard Barty Crouch confess . Under the influence of Veritaserum , he told us how he was smuggled out of Azkaban , and how Voldemort — learning of his continued existence from Bertha Jorkins — went to free him from his father and used him to capture Harry . The plan worked , I tell you . Crouch has helped Voldemort to return . ”
218472	218478	218480	218480	Fudge	255	“ See here , Dumbledore , ”
218496	218552	218493	218493	his	255	“ you — you ca n’t seriously believe that . You - Know - Who — back ? Come now , come now ... certainly , Crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon You - Know - Who ’s orders — but to take the word of a lunatic like that , Dumbledore ... ”
218553	218569	218571	218571	Dumbledore	170	“ When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight , he was transported straight to Voldemort , ”
218574	218598	218571	218571	Dumbledore	170	“ He witnessed Lord Voldemort ’s rebirth . I will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office . ”
218618	218632	218599	218599	Dumbledore	170	“ I am afraid I can not permit you to question Harry tonight . ”
218654	218674	218639	218639	He	255	“ You are — er — prepared to take Harry ’s word on this , are you , Dumbledore ? ”
218703	218710	218712	218712	Dumbledore	170	“ Certainly , I believe Harry , ”
218720	218762	218714	218714	His	170	“ I heard Crouch ’s confession , and I heard Harry ’s account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup ; the two stories make sense , they explain everything that has happened since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer . ”
218783	218810	218776	218776	he	255	“ You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned , on the word of a lunatic murderer , and a boy who ... well ... ”
218822	218833	218834	218834	he	255	“ You ’ve been reading Rita Skeeter , Mr. Fudge , ”
218875	218881	218882	218882	he	255	“ And if I have ? ”
218889	218921	218882	218882	he	255	“ If I have discovered that you ’ve been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet ? A Parselmouth , eh ? And having funny turns all over the place — ”
218922	218940	218942	218942	Dumbledore	170	“ I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar ? ”
218945	218958	218960	218960	Fudge	255	“ You admit that he has been having these pains , then ? ”
218963	218972	218960	218960	Fudge	255	“ Headaches ? Nightmares ? Possibly — hallucinations ? ”
218973	218980	218982	218982	Dumbledore	170	“ Listen to me , Cornelius , ”
219014	219051	219011	219012	young Crouch	243	“ Harry is as sane as you or I. That scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains . I believe it hurts him when Lord Voldemort is close by , or feeling particularly murderous . ”
219069	219093	219063	219063	he	255	“ You ’ll forgive me , Dumbledore , but I ’ve never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before ... ”
219094	219103	219104	219104	Harry	158	“ Look , I saw Voldemort come back ! ”
219123	219140	219117	219118	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ I saw the Death Eaters ! I can give you their names ! Lucius Malfoy — ”
219162	219167	219169	219169	Fudge	255	“ Malfoy was cleared ! ”
219174	219185	219169	219169	Fudge	255	“ A very old family — donations to excellent causes — ”
219186	219189	219190	219190	Harry	158	“ Macnair ! ”
219193	219203	219169	219169	Fudge	255	“ Also cleared ! Now working for the Ministry ! ”
219204	219224	219226	219226	Fudge	255	“ You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being Death Eaters thirteen years ago ! ”
219229	219233	219234	219235	Professor McGonagall	320	“ You fool ! ”
219238	219256	219234	219235	Professor McGonagall	320	“ Cedric Diggory ! Mr. Crouch ! These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic ! ”
219257	219266	219268	219268	Fudge	255	“ I see no evidence to the contrary ! ”
219279	219306	219275	219275	his	255	“ It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years ! ”
219379	219384	219385	219385	Dumbledore	170	“ Voldemort has returned , ”
219388	219431	219385	219385	Dumbledore	170	“ If you accept that fact straightaway , Fudge , and take the necessary measures , we may still be able to save the situation . The first and most essential step is to remove Azkaban from the control of the dementors — ”
219432	219435	219437	219437	Fudge	255	“ Preposterous ! ”
219440	219478	219437	219437	Fudge	255	“ Remove the dementors ? I ’d be kicked out of office for suggesting it ! Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing guard at Azkaban ! ”
219479	219519	219521	219521	Dumbledore	170	“ The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds , Cornelius , knowing that you have put Lord Voldemort ’s most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them ! ”
219523	219585	219521	219521	Dumbledore	170	“ They will not remain loyal to you , Fudge ! Voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can ! With the dementors behind him , and his old supporters returned to him , you will be hard - pressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago ! ”
219602	219614	219615	219615	Dumbledore	170	“ The second step you must take — and at once , ”
219619	219628	219615	219615	Dumbledore	170	“ is to send envoys to the giants . ”
219629	219635	219636	219636	Fudge	255	“ Envoys to the giants ? ”
219644	219650	219636	219636	Fudge	255	“ What madness is this ? ”
219651	219667	219669	219669	Dumbledore	170	“ Extend them the hand of friendship , now , before it is too late , ”
219671	219697	219669	219669	Dumbledore	170	“ or Voldemort will persuade them , as he did before , that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom ! ”
219698	219707	219708	219708	Fudge	255	“ You — you can not be serious ! ”
219720	219745	219712	219712	his	255	“ If the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants — people hate them , Dumbledore — end of my career — ”
219746	219751	219753	219753	Dumbledore	170	“ You are blinded , ”
219774	219855	219768	219768	his	170	“ by the love of the office you hold , Cornelius ! I tell you now — take the steps I have suggested , and you will be remembered , in office or out , as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers of Magic we have ever known . Fail to act — and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild ! ”
219856	219859	219861	219861	Fudge	255	“ Insane , ”
219867	219870	219861	219861	Fudge	255	“ Mad ... ”
219926	219944	219946	219946	Dumbledore	170	“ If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this , Cornelius , ”
219948	219977	219946	219946	Dumbledore	170	“ we have reached a parting of the ways . You must act as you see fit . And I — I shall act as I see fit . ”
220009	220017	220018	220018	he	170	“ Now , see here , Dumbledore , ”
220026	220102	220018	220018	he	170	“ I ’ve given you free rein , always . I ’ve had a lot of respect for you . I might not have agreed with some of your decisions , but I ’ve kept quiet . There are n’t many who ’d have let you hire werewolves , or keep Hagrid , or decide what to teach your students without reference to the Ministry . But if you ’re going to work against me — ”
220103	220114	220116	220116	Dumbledore	170	“ The only one against whom I intend to work , ”
220118	220140	220116	220116	Dumbledore	170	“ is Lord Voldemort . If you are against him , then we remain , Cornelius , on the same side . ”
220188	220203	220175	220175	he	255	“ He ca n’t be back , Dumbledore , he just ca n’t be ... ”
220237	220240	220242	220242	Snape	390	“ There , ”
220245	220292	220242	220242	Snape	390	“ There . The Dark Mark . It is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago , when it burned black , but you can still see it . Every Death Eater had the sign burned into him by the Dark Lord . ”
220342	220397	220320	220320	He	255	“ I do n’t know what you and your staff are playing at , Dumbledore , but I have heard enough . I have no more to add . I will be in touch with you tomorrow , Dumbledore , to discuss the running of this school . I must return to the Ministry . ”
220425	220429	220430	220430	he	255	“ Your winnings , ”
220453	220471	220430	220430	he	255	“ One thousand Galleons . There should have been a presentation ceremony , but under the circumstances ... ”
220511	220519	220520	220520	he	170	“ There is work to be done , ”
220523	220540	220520	220520	he	170	“ Molly ... am I right in thinking that I can count on you and Arthur ? ”
220541	220547	220560	220560	she	174	“ Of course you can , ”
220564	220598	220560	220560	she	174	“ We know what Fudge is . It ’s Arthur ’s fondness for Muggles that has held him back at the Ministry all these years . Fudge thinks he lacks proper Wizarding pride . ”
220599	220610	220612	220612	Dumbledore	170	“ Then I need to send a message to Arthur , ”
220614	220648	220612	220612	Dumbledore	170	“ All those that we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately , and he is well placed to contact those at the Ministry who are not as shortsighted as Cornelius . ”
220649	220656	220658	220658	Bill	185	“ I ’ll go to Dad , ”
220663	220669	220658	220658	Bill	185	“ I ’ll go now . ”
220670	220673	220675	220675	Dumbledore	170	“ Excellent , ”
220677	220715	220675	220675	Dumbledore	170	“ Tell him what has happened . Tell him I will be in direct contact with him shortly . He will need to be discreet , however . If Fudge thinks I am interfering at the Ministry — ”
220716	220722	220724	220724	Bill	185	“ Leave it to me , ”
220754	220757	220759	220759	Dumbledore	170	“ Minerva , ”
220766	220792	220759	220759	Dumbledore	170	“ I want to see Hagrid in my office as soon as possible . Also — if she will consent to come — Madame Maxime . ”
220802	220805	220806	220806	Dumbledore	170	“ Poppy , ”
220812	220868	220806	220806	Dumbledore	170	“ would you be very kind and go down to Professor Moody ’s office , where I think you will find a house - elf called Winky in considerable distress ? Do what you can for her , and take her back to the kitchens . I think Dobby will look after her for us . ”
220869	220875	220877	220878	Madam Pomfrey	305	“ Very — very well , ”
220912	220916	220917	220917	he	170	“ And now , ”
220920	220948	220917	220917	he	170	“ it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are . Sirius ... if you could resume your usual form . ”
220980	220984	220985	220985	she	174	“ Sirius Black ! ”
220992	220998	220999	220999	Ron	171	“ Mum , shut up ! ”
221002	221007	220999	220999	Ron	171	“ It ’s okay ! ”
221030	221033	221034	221034	he	390	“ Him ! ”
221047	221054	221039	221039	Sirius	527	“ What is he doing here ? ”
221055	221063	221065	221065	Dumbledore	170	“ He is here at my invitation , ”
221071	221099	221065	221065	Dumbledore	170	“ as are you , Severus . I trust you both . It is time for you to lay aside your old differences and trust each other . ”
221122	221132	221134	221134	Dumbledore	170	“ I will settle , in the short term , ”
221145	221192	221142	221142	his	170	“ for a lack of open hostility . You will shake hands . You are on the same side now . Time is short , and unless the few of us who know the truth stand united , there is no hope for any of us . ”
221229	221239	221241	221241	Dumbledore	170	“ That will do to be going on with , ”
221249	221313	221241	221241	Dumbledore	170	“ Now I have work for each of you . Fudge ’s attitude , though not unexpected , changes everything . Sirius , I need you to set off at once . You are to alert Remus Lupin , Arabella Figg , Mundungus Fletcher — the old crowd . Lie low at Lupin ’s for a while ; I will contact you there . ”
221314	221317	221319	221319	Harry	158	“ But — ”
221342	221352	221354	221354	Sirius	527	“ You ’ll see me very soon , Harry , ”
221360	221380	221354	221354	Sirius	527	“ I promise you . But I must do what I can , you understand , do n’t you ? ”
221381	221384	221386	221386	Harry	158	“ Yeah , ”
221388	221396	221386	221386	Harry	158	“ Yeah ... of course I do . ”
221438	221441	221443	221443	Dumbledore	170	“ Severus , ”
221449	221470	221443	221443	Dumbledore	170	“ you know what I must ask you to do . If you are ready ... if you are prepared ... ”
221471	221475	221477	221477	Snape	390	“ I am , ”
221495	221500	221502	221502	Dumbledore	170	“ Then good luck , ”
221533	221539	221540	221540	he	170	“ I must go downstairs , ”
221544	221568	221540	221540	he	170	“ I must see the Diggorys . Harry — take the rest of your potion . I will see all of you later . ”
221602	221616	221617	221618	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ You ’ve got to take the rest of your potion , Harry , ”
221644	221674	221635	221635	she	174	“ You have a good long sleep . Try and think about something else for a while ... think about what you ’re going to buy with your winnings ! ”
221675	221683	221685	221685	Harry	158	“ I do n’t want that gold , ”
221691	221715	221685	221685	Harry	158	“ You have it . Anyone can have it . I should n’t have won it . It should ’ve been Cedric ’s . ”
221767	221776	221777	221778	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ It was n’t your fault , Harry , ”
221781	221792	221794	221794	Harry	158	“ I told him to take the Cup with me , ”
221957	221960	221961	221961	she	169	“ Sorry , ”
221964	221970	221972	221973	Mrs. Weasley	174	“ Your potion , Harry , ”
222130	222137	222138	222138	she	522	“ He suffered very little then , ”
222151	222174	222138	222138	she	522	“ And after all , Amos ... he died just when he ’d won the tournament . He must have been happy . ”
222190	222198	222182	222182	she	522	“ You look after yourself , now . ”
222210	222215	222216	222216	he	158	“ You take this , ”
222221	222238	222216	222216	he	158	“ It should ’ve been Cedric ’s , he got there first , you take it — ”
222246	222264	222240	222240	she	522	“ Oh no , it ’s yours , dear , I could n’t ... you keep it . ”
222508	222524	222525	222525	he	171	“ She went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer , ”
222528	222545	222525	222525	he	171	“ But he wants you to go back to the Dursleys , at least at first . ”
222546	222549	222551	222551	Harry	158	“ Why ? ”
222553	222562	222564	222564	Ron	171	“ She said Dumbledore ’s got his reasons , ”
222571	222585	222567	222567	his	171	“ I suppose we ’ve got to trust him , have n’t we ? ”
222666	222671	222673	222673	Hagrid	181	“ Who ’s that ? ”
222680	222683	222673	222673	Hagrid	181	“ Harry ! ”
222707	222720	222684	222684	He	181	“ Good ter see yeh , mate . Good ter see yeh . ”
222746	222754	222755	222755	Hagrid	181	“ Bin havin’ a cuppa with Olympe , ”
222758	222765	222755	222755	Hagrid	181	“ She ’s jus ’ left . ”
222766	222769	222771	222771	Ron	171	“ Who ? ”
222774	222782	222784	222784	Hagrid	181	“ Madame Maxime , o ’ course ! ”
222786	222795	222797	222797	Ron	171	“ You two made up , have you ? ”
222799	222807	222809	222809	Hagrid	181	“ Dunno what yeh’re talkin ’ about , ”
222850	222856	222857	222857	he	181	“ You all righ ’ ? ”
222861	222864	222866	222866	Harry	158	“ Yeah , ”
222868	222874	222876	222876	Hagrid	181	“ No , yeh’re not , ”
222878	222889	222876	222876	Hagrid	181	“ ’ Course yeh’re not . But yeh will be . ”
222894	222903	222905	222905	Hagrid	181	“ Knew he was goin’ ter come back , ”
222921	223009	222913	222913	Hermione	169	“ Known it fer years , Harry . Knew he was out there , bidin ’ his time . It had ter happen . Well , now it has , an ’ we ’ll jus ’ have ter get on with it . We ’ll fight . Migh ’ be able ter stop him before he gets a good hold . That ’s Dumbledore ’s plan , anyway . Great man , Dumbledore . ’S long as we ’ve got him , I ’m not too worried . ”
223023	223034	223035	223035	he	181	“ No good sittin ’ worryin ’ abou ’ it , ”
223038	223066	223035	223035	he	181	“ What ’s comin ’ will come , an ’ we ’ll meet it when it does . Dumbledore told me wha ’ you did , Harry . ”
223077	223102	223075	223075	Harry	158	“ Yeh did as much as yer father would ’ve done , an ’ I can ’ give yeh no higher praise than that . ”
223120	223131	223132	223132	he	181	“ What ’s Dumbledore asked you to do , Hagrid ? ”
223135	223153	223132	223132	he	181	“ He sent Professor McGonagall to ask you and Madame Maxime to meet him — that night . ”
223154	223165	223167	223167	Hagrid	181	“ Got a little job fer me over the summer , ”
223169	223217	223167	223167	Hagrid	181	“ Secret , though . I ’m not s’pposed ter talk abou ’ it , no , not even ter you lot . Olympe — Madame Maxime ter you — might be comin ’ with me . I think she will . Think I got her persuaded . ”
223218	223226	223132	223132	he	181	“ Is it to do with Voldemort ? ”
223236	223241	223242	223242	he	181	“ Migh ’ be , ”

223677	223683	223670	223670	Snape	390	“ at great personal risk . ”
223771	223775	223777	223777	Dumbledore	170	“ The end , ”
223785	223790	223777	223777	Dumbledore	170	“ of another year . ”
223831	223846	223848	223848	Dumbledore	170	“ There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight , ”
223850	223870	223871	223871	he	170	“ but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person , who should be sitting here , ”
223877	223904	223871	223871	he	170	“ enjoying our feast with us . I would like you all , please , to stand , and raise your glasses , to Cedric Diggory . ”
223940	223944	223925	223925	their	2233	“ Cedric Diggory . ”
223977	223993	223994	223994	Dumbledore	170	“ Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish Hufflepuff House , ”
223997	224048	223994	223994	Dumbledore	170	“ He was a good and loyal friend , a hard worker , he valued fair play . His death has affected you all , whether you knew him well or not . I think that you have the right , therefore , to know exactly how it came about . ”
224058	224067	224049	224049	Harry	158	“ Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort . ”
224100	224106	224107	224107	Dumbledore	170	“ The Ministry of Magic , ”
224110	224213	224107	224107	Dumbledore	170	“ does not wish me to tell you this . It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so — either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned , or because they think I should not tell you so , young as you are . It is my belief , however , that the truth is generally preferable to lies , and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident , or some sort of blunder of his own , is an insult to his memory . ”
224273	224289	224290	224290	Dumbledore	170	“ There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with Cedric ’s death , ”
224294	224306	224290	224290	Dumbledore	170	“ I am talking , of course , about Harry Potter . ”
224331	224340	224342	224342	Dumbledore	170	“ Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort , ”
224344	224388	224342	224342	Dumbledore	170	“ He risked his own life to return Cedric ’s body to Hogwarts . He showed , in every respect , the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort , and for this , I honor him . ”
224489	224526	224486	224486	Dumbledore	170	“ The Triwizard Tournament ’s aim was to further and promote magical understanding . In the light of what has happened — of Lord Voldemort ’s return — such ties are more important than ever before . ”
224576	224583	224585	224585	Dumbledore	170	“ Every guest in this Hall , ”
224596	224668	224588	224588	his	170	“ will be welcomed back here at any time , should they wish to come . Remember Cedric . Remember , if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy , remember what happened to a boy who was good , and kind , and brave , because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort . Remember Cedric Diggory . ”
224761	224765	224770	224771	Fleur Delacour	386	“ ’ Arry ! ”
224817	224829	224831	224831	Fleur	386	“ We will see each uzzer again , I ’ ope , ”
224842	224859	224831	224831	Fleur	386	“ I am ’ oping to get a job ’ ere , to improve my Eenglish . ”
224860	224867	224869	224869	Ron	171	“ It ’s very good already , ”
224885	224893	224895	224895	Fleur	386	“ Good - bye , ’ Arry , ”
224901	224911	224895	224895	Fleur	386	“ It ’ az been a pleasure meeting you ! ”
224942	224952	224954	224954	Ron	171	“ Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting back , ”
224956	224967	224954	224954	Ron	171	“ D’you reckon they can steer that ship without Karkaroff ? ”
224968	224974	224994	224994	Krum	205	“ Karkaroff did not steer , ”
224980	224993	224994	224994	Krum	205	“ He stayed in his cabin and let us do the vork . ”
225005	225012	225013	225013	he	205	“ Could I have a vord ? ”
225017	225025	225027	225027	Hermione	169	“ Oh ... yes ... all right , ”
225044	225051	225052	225052	Ron	171	“ You ’d better hurry up ! ”
225058	225067	225052	225052	Ron	171	“ The carriages’ll be here in a minute ! ”
225122	225127	225129	225129	Krum	205	“ I liked Diggory , ”
225134	225154	225155	225155	he	158	“ He vos alvays polite to me . Alvays . Even though I vos from Durmstrang — with Karkaroff , ”
225160	225169	225171	225171	Harry	158	“ Have you got a new headmaster yet ? ”
225221	225228	225217	225217	Ron	171	“ Can I have your autograph ? ”
225499	225568	225488	225488	Hermione	169	“ There ’s nothing in there . You can look for yourself , but there ’s nothing at all . I ’ve been checking every day . Just a small piece the day after the third task saying you won the tournament . They did n’t even mention Cedric . Nothing about any of it . If you ask me , Fudge is forcing them to keep quiet . ”
225569	225577	225579	225579	Harry	158	“ He ’ll never keep Rita quiet , ”
225581	225589	225579	225579	Harry	158	“ Not on a story like this . ”
225590	225605	225607	225607	Hermione	169	“ Oh , Rita has n’t written anything at all since the third task , ”
225614	225621	225622	225622	she	169	“ As a matter of fact , ”
225631	225659	225622	225622	she	169	“ Rita Skeeter is n’t going to be writing anything at all for a while . Not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her . ”
225660	225667	225669	225669	Ron	171	“ What are you talking about ? ”
225671	225695	225697	225697	Hermione	169	“ I found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she was n’t supposed to be coming onto the grounds , ”
225733	225740	225742	225742	Harry	158	“ How was she doing it ? ”
225746	225753	225755	225755	Ron	171	“ How did you find out ? ”
225761	225778	225779	225779	she	169	“ Well , it was you , really , who gave me the idea , Harry , ”
225782	225786	225788	225788	Harry	158	“ Did I ? ”
225792	225795	225788	225788	Harry	158	“ How ? ”
225796	225799	225801	225801	Hermione	169	“ Bugging , ”
225804	225813	225788	225788	Harry	158	“ But you said they did n’t work — ”
225814	225820	225822	225822	Hermione	169	“ Oh not electronic bugs , ”
225824	225832	225822	225822	Hermione	169	“ No , you see ... Rita Skeeter ”
225842	225852	225822	225822	Hermione	169	“ is an unregistered Animagus . She can turn — ”
225865	225871	225853	225853	Hermione	169	“ — into a beetle . ”
225872	225877	225879	225879	Ron	171	“ You ’re kidding , ”
225881	225890	225879	225879	Ron	171	“ You have n’t ... she ’s not ... ”
225891	225897	225899	225899	Hermione	169	“ Oh yes she is , ”
225922	225931	225932	225932	Ron	171	“ That ’s never — you ’re kidding — ”
225942	225949	225951	225951	Hermione	169	“ No , I ’m not , ”
225955	225989	225951	225951	Hermione	169	“ I caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing . Look very closely , and you ’ll notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears . ”
226005	226025	225951	225951	Hermione	169	“ There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard Hagrid telling Madame Maxime about his mum ! ”
226026	226029	226031	226031	Hermione	169	“ Exactly , ”
226033	226087	226031	226031	Hermione	169	“ And Viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after we ’d had our conversation by the lake . And unless I ’m very much mistaken , Rita was perched on the windowsill of the Divination class the day your scar hurt . She ’s been buzzing around for stories all year . ”
226088	226097	226099	226099	Ron	171	“ When we saw Malfoy under that tree ... ”
226102	226113	226115	226115	Hermione	169	“ He was talking to her , in his hand , ”
226117	226165	226115	226115	Hermione	169	“ He knew , of course . That ’s how she ’s been getting all those nice little interviews with the Slytherins . They would n’t care that she was doing something illegal , as long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us and Hagrid . ”
226187	226204	226206	226206	Hermione	169	“ I ’ve told her I ’ll let her out when we get back to London , ”
226208	226261	226206	226206	Hermione	169	“ I ’ve put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar , you see , so she ca n’t transform . And I ’ve told her she ’s to keep her quill to herself for a whole year . See if she ca n’t break the habit of writing horrible lies about people . ”
226282	226288	226290	226291	Draco Malfoy	257	“ Very clever , Granger , ”
226324	226327	226329	226329	Malfoy	257	“ So , ”
226351	226370	226348	226348	his	257	“ You caught some pathetic reporter , and Potter ’s Dumbledore ’s favorite boy again . Big deal . ”
226380	226391	226393	226393	Malfoy	257	“ Trying not to think about it , are we ? ”
226404	226413	226393	226393	Malfoy	257	“ Trying to pretend it has n’t happened ? ”
226414	226418	226420	226420	Harry	158	“ Get out , ”
226467	226519	226520	226520	He	158	“ You ’ve picked the losing side , Potter ! I warned you ! I told you you ought to choose your company more carefully , remember ? When we met on the train , first day at Hogwarts ? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like this ! ”
226529	226567	226522	226522	his	158	“ Too late now , Potter ! They ’ll be the first to go , now the Dark Lord ’s back ! Mudbloods and Muggle - lovers first ! Well — second — Diggory was the f — ”
226659	226671	226673	226673	Fred	175	“ Thought we ’d see what those three were up to , ”
226712	226716	226718	226718	George	176	“ Interesting effect , ”
226725	226732	226718	226718	George	176	“ Who used the Furnunculus Curse ? ”
226733	226736	226738	226738	Harry	158	“ Me , ”
226740	226743	226745	226745	George	176	“ Odd , ”
226748	226795	226745	226745	George	176	“ I used Jelly - Legs . Looks as though those two should n’t be mixed . He seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face . Well , let ’s not leave them here , they do n’t add much to the decor . ”
226853	226859	226861	226861	Fred	175	“ Exploding Snap , anyone ? ”
226884	226893	226894	226894	he	158	“ You going to tell us , then ? ”
226899	226905	226894	226894	he	158	“ Who you were blackmailing ? ”
226906	226909	226911	226911	George	176	“ Oh , ”
226914	226917	226911	226911	George	176	“ That . ”
226918	226924	226926	226926	Fred	175	“ It does n’t matter , ”
226933	226945	226926	226926	Fred	175	“ It was n’t anything important . Not now , anyway . ”
226946	226952	226954	226954	George	176	“ We ’ve given up , ”
226975	226994	226972	226972	Fred	175	“ All right , all right , if you really want to know ... it was Ludo Bagman . ”
226995	226998	227000	227000	Harry	158	“ Bagman ? ”
227003	227012	227000	227000	Harry	158	“ Are you saying he was involved in — ”
227013	227016	227018	227018	George	176	“ Nah , ”
227021	227036	227018	227018	George	176	“ Nothing like that . Stupid git . He would n’t have the brains . ”
227037	227044	227046	227046	Ron	171	“ Well , what , then ? ”
227054	227082	227048	227048	Fred	175	“ You remember that bet we had with him at the Quidditch World Cup ? About how Ireland would win , but Krum would get the Snitch ? ”
227083	227086	227088	227088	Harry	158	“ Yeah , ”
227093	227111	227048	227048	Fred	175	“ Well , the git paid us in leprechaun gold he ’d caught from the Irish mascots . ”
227112	227115	227048	227048	Fred	175	“ So ? ”
227116	227119	227121	227121	Fred	175	“ So , ”
227124	227140	227121	227121	Fred	175	“ it vanished , did n’t it ? By next morning , it had gone ! ”
227141	227155	227157	227157	Hermione	169	“ But — it must ’ve been an accident , must n’t it ? ”
227164	227232	227159	227159	George	176	“ Yeah , that ’s what we thought , at first . We thought if we just wrote to him , and told him he ’d made a mistake , he ’d cough up . But nothing doing . Ignored our letter . We kept trying to talk to him about it at Hogwarts , but he was always making some excuse to get away from us . ”
227233	227243	227245	227245	Fred	175	“ In the end , he turned pretty nasty , ”
227247	227265	227245	227245	Fred	175	“ Told us we were too young to gamble , and he was n’t giving us anything . ”
227266	227275	227277	227277	George	176	“ So we asked for our money back , ”
227281	227287	227289	227289	Hermione	169	“ He did n’t refuse ! ”
227291	227296	227298	227298	Fred	175	“ Right in one , ”
227300	227308	227310	227310	Ron	171	“ But that was all your savings ! ”
227312	227318	227320	227320	George	176	“ Tell me about it , ”
227322	227448	227320	227320	George	176	“ ’ Course , we found out what was going on in the end . Lee Jordan ’s dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off Bagman as well . Turns out he ’s in big trouble with the goblins . Borrowed loads of gold off them . A gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the gold he had , and it still was n’t enough to cover all his debts . They followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him . He ’s lost everything gambling . Has n’t got two Galleons to rub together . And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back ? ”
227449	227452	227454	227454	Harry	158	“ How ? ”
227456	227466	227468	227468	Fred	175	“ He put a bet on you , mate , ”
227470	227487	227468	227468	Fred	175	“ Put a big bet on you to win the tournament . Bet against the goblins . ”
227488	227501	227503	227503	Harry	158	“ So that ’s why he kept trying to help me win ! ”
227505	227524	227503	227503	Harry	158	“ Well — I did win , did n’t I ? So he can pay you your gold ! ”
227525	227528	227530	227530	George	176	“ Nope , ”
227536	227580	227530	227530	George	176	“ The goblins play as dirty as him . They say you drew with Diggory , and Bagman was betting you ’d win outright . So Bagman had to run for it . He did run for it right after the third task . ”
227705	227714	227715	227716	The twins	920	“ Fred — George — wait a moment . ”
227731	227735	227736	227736	he	158	“ Take it , ”
227749	227752	227754	227754	Fred	175	“ What ? ”
227759	227763	227764	227764	Harry	158	“ Take it , ”
227768	227775	227764	227764	Harry	158	“ I do n’t want it . ”
227776	227781	227783	227783	George	176	“ You ’re mental , ”
227793	227800	227802	227802	Harry	158	“ No , I ’m not , ”
227804	227820	227802	227802	Harry	158	“ You take it , and get inventing . It ’s for the joke shop . ”
227821	227826	227827	227827	Fred	175	“ He is mental , ”
227835	227838	227840	227840	Harry	158	“ Listen , ”
227843	227906	227840	227840	Harry	158	“ If you do n’t take it , I ’m throwing it down the drain . I do n’t want it and I do n’t need it . But I could do with a few laughs . We could all do with a few laughs . I ’ve got a feeling we ’re going to need them more than usual before long . ”
227907	227910	227912	227912	George	176	“ Harry , ”
227923	227935	227912	227912	George	176	“ there ’s got to be a thousand Galleons in here . ”
227936	227939	227941	227941	Harry	158	“ Yeah , ”
227945	227954	227941	227941	Harry	158	“ Think how many Canary Creams that is . ”
227961	227994	227912	227912	George	176	“ Just do n’t tell your mum where you got it ... although she might not be so keen for you to join the Ministry anymore , come to think of it ... ”
227995	227998	227999	227999	Fred	175	“ Harry , ”
228009	228012	228013	228013	he	158	“ Look , ”
228017	228055	228013	228013	he	158	“ take it , or I ’ll hex you . I know some good ones now . Just do me one favor , okay ? Buy Ron some different dress robes and say they ’re from you . ”
228119	228140	228110	228110	she	174	“ I think Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer . Keep in touch , Harry . ”
228141	228147	228149	228149	Ron	171	“ See you , Harry , ”
228157	228163	228168	228168	she	169	“ ’ Bye , Harry ! ”
228184	228189	228190	228190	George	176	“ Harry — thanks , ”
