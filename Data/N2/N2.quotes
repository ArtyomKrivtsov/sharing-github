368	375	377	377	Edmund	71	" What 's up , Lu ? "
389	392	377	377	Edmund	71	" Ow ! "
393	399	401	401	Peter	69	" What on earth — — "
422	440	419	419	he	69	" Susan , let go ! What are you doing ? Where are you dragging me to ? "
441	448	450	450	Susan	70	" I 'm not touching you , "
452	467	450	450	Susan	70	" Someone is pulling me . Oh — oh — oh — stop it ! "
481	488	490	490	Edmund	71	" I felt just the same , "
496	517	490	490	Edmund	71	" As if I were being dragged along . A most frightful pulling — ugh ! it 's beginning again . "
518	522	524	524	Lucy	72	" Me too , "
526	535	524	524	Lucy	72	" Oh , I ca n't bear it . "
536	540	542	542	Edmund	71	" Look sharp ! "
544	565	542	542	Edmund	71	" All catch hands and keep together . This is magic — I can tell by the feeling . Quick ! "
566	569	571	571	Susan	70	" Yes , "
573	588	571	571	Susan	70	" Hold hands . Oh , I do wish it would stop — oh ! "
653	658	660	660	Lucy	72	" Oh , Peter ! "
662	675	660	660	Lucy	72	" Do you think we can possibly have got back to Narnia ? "
676	682	684	684	Peter	69	" It might be anywhere , "
686	713	684	684	Peter	69	" I ca n't see a yard in all these trees . Let 's try to get into the open — if there is any open . "
839	843	845	845	Peter	69	" By Jove ! "
847	853	845	845	Peter	69	" This is good enough . "
868	889	891	891	Edmund	71	" This is better than being in a stuffy train on the way back to Latin and French and Algebra ! "
915	920	922	922	Susan	70	" All the same , "
925	945	922	922	Susan	70	" I suppose we 'll have to make some plans . We shall want something to eat before long . "
946	959	961	961	Edmund	71	" We 've got the sandwiches Mother gave us for the journey , "
963	971	961	961	Edmund	71	" At least I 've got mine . "
972	976	978	978	Lucy	72	" Not me , "
980	988	978	978	Lucy	72	" Mine were in my little bag . "
989	994	996	996	Susan	70	" So were mine , "
998	1012	1014	1014	Peter	69	" Mine are in my coat - pocket , there on the beach , "
1016	1034	1014	1014	Peter	69	" That 'll be two lunches among four . This is n't going to be such fun . "
1035	1039	1041	1041	Lucy	72	" At present , "
1043	1055	1041	1041	Lucy	72	" I want something to drink more than something to eat . "
1076	1083	1085	1085	Edmund	71	" It 's like being shipwrecked , "
1087	1113	1085	1085	Edmund	71	" In the books they always find springs of clear , fresh water on the island . We 'd better go and look for them . "
1114	1129	1131	1131	Susan	70	" Does that mean we have to go back into all that thick wood ? "
1133	1140	1142	1142	Peter	69	" Not a bit of it , "
1144	1174	1142	1142	Peter	69	" If there are streams they 're bound to come down to the sea , and if we walk along the beach we 're bound to come to them . "
1242	1250	1251	1251	she	70	" We might never find them again , "
1255	1276	1251	1251	she	70	" and we shall want them if we 're still here when night comes and it begins to be cold . "
1522	1539	1541	1541	Lucy	72	" I wonder , is that an island or do we join on to it presently ? "
1543	1548	1550	1550	Peter	69	" Do n't know , "
1622	1625	1627	1627	Edmund	71	and—"Oh bother ! "
1629	1655	1627	1627	Edmund	71	" it 's no good . We sha n't be able to get to those other woods at all . We 're on an island ! "
1734	1737	1739	1739	Lucy	72	" Look ! "
1742	1747	1748	1748	She	72	" What 's that ? "
1765	1772	1774	1775	the others	271	" A stream ! A stream ! "
1908	1911	1913	1913	Edmund	71	" Now , "
1915	1921	1913	1913	Edmund	71	" what about those sandwiches ? "
1922	1932	1934	1934	Susan	70	" Oh , had n't we better save them ? "
1936	1946	1934	1934	Susan	70	" We may need them far worse later on . "
1947	1952	1954	1954	Lucy	72	" I do wish , "
1956	1981	1954	1954	Lucy	72	" now that we 're not thirsty , we could go on feeling as not - hungry as we did when we were thirsty . "
1982	1989	1991	1991	Edmund	71	" But what about those sandwiches ? "
1993	2032	1991	1991	Edmund	71	" There 's no good saving them till they go bad . You 've got to remember it 's a good deal hotter here than in England and we 've been carrying them about in pockets for hours . "
2204	2252	2201	2201	Edmund	71	" Look here . There 's only one thing to be done . We must explore the wood . Hermits and knights - errant and people like that always manage to live somehow if they 're in a forest . They find roots and berries and things . "
2253	2259	2261	2261	Susan	70	" What sort of roots ? "
2263	2273	2275	2275	Lucy	72	" I always thought it meant roots of trees , "
2277	2281	2283	2283	Peter	69	" Come on , "
2285	2314	2283	2283	Peter	69	" Ed is right . And we must try to do something . And it 'll be better than going out into the glare and the sun again . "
2423	2427	2429	2429	Lucy	72	" I say ! "
2431	2441	2429	2429	Lucy	72	" I do believe that 's an apple tree . "
2487	2496	2498	2498	Edmund	71	" And this is not the only tree , "
2506	2513	2498	2498	Edmund	71	" Look there — and there . "
2514	2523	2525	2525	Susan	70	" Why , there are dozens of them , "
2540	2564	2525	2525	Susan	70	" This must have been an orchard — long , long ago , before the place went wild and the wood grew up . "
2565	2574	2576	2576	Peter	69	" Then this was once an inhabited island , "
2578	2584	2586	2586	Lucy	72	" And what 's that ? "
2591	2600	2602	2602	Peter	69	" By Jove , it 's a wall , "
2604	2610	2602	2602	Peter	69	" An old stone wall . "
2792	2799	2801	2801	Susan	70	" This was n't a garden , "
2804	2817	2801	2801	Susan	70	" It was a castle and this must have been the courtyard . "
2818	2825	2827	2827	Peter	69	" I see what you mean , "
2829	2890	2827	2827	Peter	69	" Yes . That is the remains of a tower . And there is what used to be a flight of steps going up to the top of the walls . And look at those other steps — the broad , shallow ones — going up to that doorway . It must have been the door into the great hall . "
2891	2901	2903	2903	Edmund	71	" Ages ago , by the look of it , "
2905	2911	2913	2913	Peter	69	" Yes , ages ago , "
2915	2937	2913	2913	Peter	69	" I wish we could find out who the people were that lived in this castle ; and how long ago . "
2938	2946	2948	2948	Lucy	72	" It gives me a queer feeling , "
2950	2956	2958	2958	Peter	69	" Does it , Lu ? "
2967	2999	2958	2958	Peter	69	" Because it does the same to me . It is the queerest thing that has happened this queer day . I wonder where we are and what it all means ? "
3080	3090	3092	3092	Susan	70	" I wonder , was it really the hall ? "
3094	3102	3092	3092	Susan	70	" What that terrace kind of thing ? "
3103	3109	3111	3111	Peter	69	" Why , you silly , "
3120	3173	3111	3111	Peter	69	" do n't you see ? That was the dais where the High Table was , where the King and the great lords sat . Anyone would think you had forgotten that we ourselves were once Kings and Queens and sat on a dais just like that , in our great hall . "
3174	3182	3184	3184	Susan	70	" In our castle of Cair Paravel , "
3195	3211	3184	3184	Susan	70	" at the mouth of the great river of Narnia . How could I forget ? "
3212	3219	3221	3221	Lucy	72	" How it all comes back ! "
3223	3248	3221	3221	Lucy	72	" We could pretend we were in Cair Paravel now . This hall must have been very like the great hall we feasted in . "
3249	3256	3258	3258	Edmund	71	" But unfortunately without the feast , "
3260	3287	3258	3258	Edmund	71	" It 's getting late , you know . Look how long the shadows are . And have you noticed that it is n't so hot ? "
3288	3305	3307	3307	Peter	69	" We shall need a camp fire if we 've got to spend the night here , "
3309	3328	3307	3307	Peter	69	" I 've got matches . Let 's go and see if we can collect some dry wood . "
3669	3684	3685	3685	he	71	all—"I should n't mind a good thick slice of bread and margarine this minute , "
3742	3745	3746	3746	she	70	" Look , "
3756	3764	3746	3746	she	70	" I found it by the well . "
3815	3823	3825	3825	Peter	69	" Well , I'm — I'm jiggered , "
3896	3899	3901	3901	Lucy	72	" Why ! "
3903	3928	3901	3901	Lucy	72	" it 's exactly like one of the golden chessmen we used to play with when we were Kings and Queens at Cair Paravel . "
3929	3935	3937	3937	Peter	69	" Cheer up , Su , "
3943	3950	3952	3952	Susan	70	" I ca n't help it , "
3954	3996	3952	3952	Susan	70	" It brought back — oh , such lovely times . And I remembered playing chess with fauns and good giants , and the mer - people singing in the sea , and my beautiful horse — and — and — — "
3997	4000	4002	4002	Peter	69	" Now , "
4009	4021	4002	4002	Peter	69	" it 's about time we four started using our brains . "
4022	4026	4028	4028	Edmund	71	" What about ? "
4030	4040	4042	4042	Peter	69	" Have none of you guessed where we are ? "
4044	4051	4053	4053	Lucy	72	" Go on , go on , "
4055	4072	4053	4053	Lucy	72	" I 've felt for hours that there was some wonderful mystery hanging over this place . "
4073	4079	4081	4081	Edmund	71	" Fire ahead , Peter , "
4083	4089	4081	4081	Edmund	71	" We 're all listening . "
4090	4101	4103	4103	Peter	69	" We are in the ruins of Cair Paravel itself , "
4105	4111	4113	4113	Edmund	71	" But , I say , "
4115	4166	4113	4113	Edmund	71	" I mean , how do you make that out ? This place has been ruined for ages . Look at all those big trees growing right up to the gates . Look at the very stones . Anyone can see that nobody has lived here for hundreds of years . "
4167	4171	4173	4173	Peter	69	" I know , "
4175	4249	4173	4173	Peter	69	" That is the difficulty . But let 's leave that out for the moment . I want to take the points one by one . First point : this hall is exactly the same shape and size as the hall at Cair Paravel . Just picture a roof on this , and a coloured pavement instead of grass , and tapestries on the walls , and you get our royal banqueting hall . "
4255	4259	4261	4261	Peter	69	" Second point , "
4263	4294	4261	4261	Peter	69	" The castle well is exactly where our well was , a little to the south of the great hall ; and it is exactly the same size and shape . "
4301	4326	4113	4113	Edmund	71	" Third point : Susan has just found one of our old chessmen — or something as like one of them as two peas . "
4331	4450	4328	4328	nobody	278	" Fourth point . Do n't you remember — it was the very day before the ambassadors came from the King of Calormen — don't you remember planting the orchard outside the north gate of Cair Paravel ? The greatest of all the wood - people , Pomona herself , came to put good spells on it . It was those very decent little chaps the moles who did the actual digging . Can you have forgotten that funny old Lilygloves , the chief mole , leaning on his spade and saying , ' Believe me , your Majesty , you 'll be glad of these fruit trees one day . ' And by Jove he was right . "
4451	4458	4460	4460	Lucy	72	" I do ! I do ! "
4467	4474	4476	4476	Edmund	71	" But look here , Peter , "
4478	4509	4476	4476	Edmund	71	" This must be all rot . To begin with , we did n't plant the orchard slap up against the gate . We would n't have been such fools . "
4510	4517	4519	4519	Peter	69	" No , of course not , "
4521	4532	4519	4519	Peter	69	" But it has grown up to the gate since . "
4533	4539	4541	4541	Edmund	71	" And for another thing , "
4543	4552	4541	4541	Edmund	71	" Cair Paravel was n't on an island . "
4553	4603	4519	4519	Peter	69	" Yes , I 've been wondering about that . But it was a what - do - you - call - it , a peninsula . Jolly nearly an island . Could n't it have been made an island since our time ? Somebody has dug a channel . "
4604	4610	4612	4612	Edmund	71	" But half a moment ! "
4614	4685	4612	4612	Edmund	71	" You keep on saying since our time . But it 's only a year ago since we came back from Narnia . And you want to make out that in one year castles have fallen down , and great forests have grown up , and little trees we saw planted ourselves have turned into a big old orchard , and goodness knows what else . It 's all impossible . "
4686	4692	4694	4694	Lucy	72	" There 's one thing , "
4696	4744	4694	4694	Lucy	72	" If this is Cair Paravel there ought to be a door at this end of the dais . In fact we ought to be sitting with our backs against it at this moment . You know — the door that led down to the treasure chamber . "
4745	4754	4756	4756	Peter	69	" I suppose there is n't a door , "
4771	4778	4780	4780	Edmund	71	" We can soon find out , "
4846	4850	4852	4852	Edmund	71	" Great Scott ! "
4854	4862	4864	4864	Peter	69	" We must clear this ivy away , "
4866	4876	4878	4878	Susan	70	" Oh , do let 's leave it alone , "
4880	4935	4878	4878	Susan	70	" We can try it in the morning . If we 've got to spend the night here I do n't want an open door at my back and a great big black hole that anything might come out of , besides the draught and the damp . And it 'll soon be dark . "
4936	4943	4945	4945	Lucy	72	" Susan ! How can you ? "
5017	5023	5025	5025	Peter	69	" Locked , of course , "
5027	5035	5037	5037	Edmund	71	" But the wood 's all rotten , "
5039	5060	5037	5037	Edmund	71	" We can pull it to bits in no time , and it will make extra firewood . Come on . "
5132	5138	5140	5140	Peter	69	" Now for a torch , "
5142	5150	5152	5152	Susan	70	" Oh , what is the good ? "
5154	5161	5152	5152	Susan	70	" And as Edmund said — — "
5162	5170	5171	5171	Edmund	71	" I 'm not saying it now , "
5174	5197	5171	5171	Edmund	71	" I still do n't understand , but we can settle that later . I suppose you 're coming down , Peter ? "
5198	5202	5204	5204	Peter	69	" We must , "
5206	5251	5204	5204	Peter	69	" Cheer up , Susan . It 's no good behaving like kids now that we are back in Narnia . You 're a queen here . And anyway no - one could go to sleep with a mystery like this on our minds . "
5353	5364	5366	5366	Edmund	71	" I 've come to the top of the steps , "
5368	5372	5374	5374	Peter	69	" Count them , "
5376	5383	5385	5385	Edmund	71	" One — two — three , "
5399	5406	5407	5407	he	71	" And this is the bottom , "
5411	5420	5422	5422	Lucy	72	" Then it really must be Cair Paravel , "
5424	5429	5422	5422	Lucy	72	" There were sixteen . "
5458	5468	5470	5472	all the children	327	" O — o — o — oh ! ! "
5753	5819	5748	5748	them	325	" Oh look ! Our coronation rings — do you remember first wearing this?—Why , this is the little brooch we all thought was lost — I say , is n't that the armour you wore in the great tournament in the Lone Islands?—do you remember the dwarf making that for me?—do you remember drinking out of that horn?—do you remember , do you remember ? "
5825	5858	5822	5822	Edmund	71	" Look here . We must n't waste the battery : goodness knows how often we shall need it . Had n't we better take what we want and get out again ? "
5859	5866	5868	5868	Peter	69	" We must take the gifts , "
6085	6089	6091	6091	Lucy	72	but—"Oh , Susan , "
6093	6099	6091	6091	Lucy	72	" Where 's the horn ? "
6100	6108	6110	6110	Susan	70	" Oh bother , bother , bother , "
6119	6163	6110	6110	Susan	70	" I remember now . I took it with me the last day of all , the day we went hunting the White Stag . It must have got lost when we blundered back into that other place — England , I mean . "
6200	6217	6219	6219	Edmund	71	" Just the sort of thing that might come in handy in a place like this , "
6221	6225	6227	6227	Susan	70	" Never mind , "
6229	6237	6227	6227	Susan	70	" I 've still got the bow . "
6243	6253	6255	6255	Peter	69	" Wo n't the string be perished , Su ? "
6467	6474	6475	6475	he	69	" It is my sword Rhindon , "
6478	6486	6475	6475	he	69	" with it I killed the Wolf . "
6659	6670	6652	6652	Edmund	71	" We 've simply got to get off this island . "
6704	6711	6713	6713	Edmund	71	" We 'll have to swim , "
6715	6724	6726	6726	Peter	69	" It would be all right for Su , "
6738	6750	6726	6726	Peter	69	" But I do n't know about the rest of us . "
6752	6757	6758	6758	he	69	" the rest of us "
6785	6788	6790	6790	Susan	70	" Anyway , "
6792	6814	6790	6790	Susan	70	" there may be currents . Father says it 's never wise to bathe in a place you do n't know . "
6815	6820	6822	6822	Lucy	72	" But , Peter , "
6824	6888	6822	6822	Lucy	72	" look here . I know I ca n't swim for nuts at home — in England , I mean . But could n't we all swim long ago — if it was long ago — when we were kings and queens in Narnia ? We could ride then too , and do all sorts of things . Do n't you think — — "
6889	6902	6904	6904	Peter	69	" Ah , but we were sort of grown - up then , "
6906	6931	6904	6904	Peter	69	" We reigned for years and years and learned to do things . Are n't we just back at our proper ages again now ? "
6932	6935	6937	6937	Edmund	71	" Oh ! "
6951	6959	6960	6960	he	71	" I 've just seen it all , "
6963	6967	6969	6969	Peter	69	" Seen what ? "
6971	6978	6980	6980	Edmund	71	" Why , the whole thing , "
6982	7059	6980	6980	Edmund	71	" You know what we were puzzling about last night , that it was only a year ago since we left Narnia but everything looks as if no one had lived in Cair Paravel for hundreds of years ? Well , do n't you see ? You know that , however long we seemed to have lived in Narnia , when we got back through the wardrobe it seemed to have taken no time at all ? "
7060	7064	7066	7066	Susan	70	" Go on , "
7068	7077	7066	7066	Susan	70	" I think I 'm beginning to understand . "
7078	7083	7085	7085	Edmund	71	" And that means , "
7087	7129	7085	7085	Edmund	71	" that , once you 're out of Narnia , you have no idea how Narnian time is going . Why should n't hundreds of years have gone past in Narnia while only one year has passed for us in England ? "
7130	7136	7138	7138	Peter	69	" By Jove , Ed , "
7140	7194	7138	7138	Peter	69	" I believe you 've got it . In that sense it really was hundreds of years ago that we lived in Cair Paravel . And now we 're coming back to Narnia just as if we were Crusaders or Anglo - Saxons or Ancient Britons or someone coming back to modern England ! "
7195	7206	7208	7208	Lucy	72	" How excited they 'll be to see us — — "
7218	7221	7215	7216	everyone else	247	" Hush ! "
7223	7226	7215	7216	everyone else	247	" Look ! "
7373	7378	7380	7384	the soldier in the stern	373	" This 'll do , "
7395	7407	7409	7410	the other	375	" What about tying a stone to his feet , Corporal ? "
7417	7420	7422	7423	the other	375	" Garn ! "
7425	7458	7422	7423	the other	375	" We do n't need that , and we have n't brought one . He 'll drown sure enough without a stone , as long as we 've tied the cords right . "
7634	7641	7643	7643	Peter	69	" Quick ! Before she drifts ! "
7762	7776	7749	7749	he	1552	" Well , whatever they say , you do n't feel like ghosts . "
7832	7835	7836	7836	he	1552	" Anyway , "
7839	7857	7836	7836	he	1552	" ghosts or not , you 've saved my life and I 'm extremely obliged to you . "
7858	7866	7868	7868	Lucy	72	" But why should we be ghosts ? "
7870	7879	7881	7882	the Dwarf	1552	" I 've been told all my life , "
7884	7999	7881	7882	the Dwarf	1552	" that these woods along the shore were as full of ghosts as they were of trees . That 's what the story is . And that 's why , when they want to get rid of anyone , they usually bring him down here ( like they were doing with me ) and say they 'll leave him to the ghosts . But I always wondered if they did n't really drown 'em or cut their throats . I never quite believed in the ghosts . But those two cowards you 've just shot believed all right . They were more frightened of taking me to my death than I was of going ! "
8000	8003	8005	8005	Susan	70	" Oh , "
8007	8017	8005	8005	Susan	70	" So that 's why they both ran away . "
8018	8025	8027	8028	the Dwarf	1552	" Eh ? What 's that ? "
8030	8035	8037	8037	Edmund	71	" They got away , "
8039	8044	8037	8037	Edmund	71	" To the mainland . "
8045	8056	8058	8058	Susan	70	" I was n't shooting to kill , you know , "
8077	8080	8082	8083	the Dwarf	1552	" Hm , "
8085	8109	8082	8083	the Dwarf	1552	" That 's not so good . That may mean trouble later on . Unless they hold their tongues for their own sake . "
8110	8120	8122	8122	Peter	69	" What were they going to drown you for ? "
8124	8136	8138	8139	the Dwarf	1552	" Oh , I 'm a dangerous criminal , I am , "
8142	8180	8138	8139	the Dwarf	1552	" But that 's a long story . Meantime , I was wondering if perhaps you were going to ask me to breakfast ? You 've no idea what an appetite it gives one , being executed . "
8181	8187	8189	8189	Lucy	72	" There 's only apples , "
8192	8205	8207	8208	the Dwarf	1552	" Better than nothing , but not so good as fresh fish , "
8210	8264	8207	8208	the Dwarf	1552	" It looks as if I 'll have to ask you to breakfast instead . I saw some fishing tackle in that boat . And anyway , we must take her round to the other side of the island . We do n't want anyone from the mainland coming down and seeing her . "
8265	8275	8277	8277	Peter	69	" I ought to have thought of that myself , "
8508	8519	8534	8535	The Dwarf	1552	" Now , what we want next is some firewood . "
8520	8530	8532	8532	Edmund	71	" We 've got some up at the castle , "
8541	8546	8547	8547	he	1552	" Beards and bedsteads ! "
8550	8561	8547	8547	he	1552	" So there really is a castle , after all ? "
8562	8569	8571	8571	Lucy	72	" It 's only a ruin , "
8591	8598	8599	8599	he	1552	" And who on earth — — "
8609	8655	8599	8599	he	1552	" No matter . Breakfast first . But one thing before we go on . Can you lay your hand on your hearts and tell me I 'm really alive ? Are you sure I was n't drowned and we 're not all ghosts together ? "
8744	8760	8735	8735	He	1552	" H'm . Looks a bit spooky after all . Smells like ghosts , too . "
8890	8893	8870	8870	his	1552	" Now . "
8894	8902	8904	8904	Peter	69	" You tell us your story first , "
8906	8915	8904	8904	Peter	69	" And then we 'll tell you ours . "
8916	8919	8921	8922	the Dwarf	1552	" Well , "
8924	8962	8921	8922	the Dwarf	1552	" as you 've saved my life it is only fair you should have your own way . But I hardly know where to begin . First of all I 'm a messenger of King Caspian 's . "
8963	8968	8970	8974	four voices all at once	439	" Who 's he ? "
8976	8991	8993	8994	the Dwarf	1552	" Caspian the Tenth , King of Narnia , and long may he reign ! "
8996	9028	8993	8994	the Dwarf	1552	" That is to say , he ought to be King of Narnia and we hope he will be . At present he is only King of us Old Narnians — — "
9029	9040	9042	9042	Lucy	72	" What do you mean by old Narnians , please ? "
9044	9051	9053	9054	the Dwarf	1552	" Why , that 's us , "
9056	9067	9053	9054	the Dwarf	1552	" We 're a kind of rebellion , I suppose . "
9068	9072	9074	9074	Peter	69	" I see , "
9076	9085	9074	9074	Peter	69	" And Caspian is the chief Old Narnian . "
9086	9095	9097	9098	the Dwarf	1552	" Well , in a manner of speaking , "
9104	9122	9097	9098	the Dwarf	1552	" But he 's really a New Narnian himself , a Telmarine , if you follow me . "
9123	9128	9130	9130	Edmund	71	" I do n't , "
9132	9143	9145	9145	Lucy	72	" It 's worse than the Wars of the Roses , "
9147	9151	9153	9154	the Dwarf	1552	" Oh dear , "
9156	9211	9153	9154	the Dwarf	1552	" I 'm doing this very badly . Look here : I think I 'll have to go right back to the beginning and tell you how Caspian grew up in his uncle 's court and how he comes to be on our side at all . But it 'll be a long story . "
9212	9217	9219	9219	Lucy	72	" All the better , "
9221	9226	9219	9219	Lucy	72	" We love stories . "
9465	9517	9459	9460	the King	1497	" Well , boy , we must soon teach you to ride and use a sword . You know that your aunt and I have no children , so it looks as if you might have to be King when I 'm gone . How shall you like that , eh ? "
9518	9526	9528	9528	Caspian	87	" I do n't know , Uncle , "
9530	9537	9539	9539	Miraz	92	" Do n't know , eh ? "
9541	9556	9539	9539	Miraz	92	" Why , I should like to know what more anyone could wish for ! "
9557	9566	9568	9568	Caspian	87	" All the same , I do wish , "
9570	9576	9578	9579	the King	1497	" What do you wish ? "
9581	9599	9601	9601	Caspian	87	" I wish — I wish — I wish I could have lived in the Old Days , "
9663	9670	9671	9671	he	92	" Eh ? What 's that ? "
9674	9682	9671	9671	he	92	" What old days do you mean ? "
9683	9693	9695	9695	Caspian	87	" Oh , do n't you know , Uncle ? "
9697	9757	9695	9695	Caspian	87	" When everything was quite different . When all the animals could talk , and there were nice people who lived in the streams and the trees . Naiads and Dryads they were called . And there were Dwarfs . And there were lovely little Fauns in all the woods . They had feet like goats . And — — "
9758	9767	9769	9770	the King	1497	" That 's all nonsense , for babies , "
9773	9811	9769	9770	the King	1497	" Only fit for babies , do you hear ? You 're getting too old for that sort of stuff . At your age you ought to be thinking of battles and adventures , not fairy tales . "
9812	9825	9827	9827	Caspian	87	" Oh , but there were battles and adventures in those days , "
9829	9922	9827	9827	Caspian	87	" Wonderful adventures . Once there was a White Witch and she made herself Queen of the whole country . And she made it so that it was always winter . And then two boys and two girls came from somewhere and so they killed the Witch and they were made Kings and Queens of Narnia , and their names were Peter and Susan and Edmund and Lucy . And so they reigned for ever so long and everyone had a lovely time , and it was all because of Aslan — — "
9923	9928	9930	9930	Miraz	92	" Who 's he ? "
9967	9975	9976	9976	he	87	" Oh , do n't you know ? "
9979	9992	9976	9976	he	87	" Aslan is the great Lion who comes from over the sea . "
9993	10003	10005	10006	the King	1497	" Who has been telling you all this nonsense ? "
10020	10025	10027	10028	King Miraz	92	" Your Royal Highness , "
10045	10068	10038	10038	he	92	" I insist upon being answered . Look me in the face . Who has been telling you this pack of lies ? "
10069	10074	10076	10076	Caspian	87	" N — Nurse , "
10083	10088	10090	10091	his uncle	1593	" Stop that noise , "
10104	10179	10090	10091	his uncle	1593	" Stop it . And never let me catch you talking — or thinking either — about all those silly stories again . There never were those Kings and Queens . How could there be two Kings at the same time ? And there 's no such person as Aslan . And there are no such things as lions . And there never was a time when animals could talk . Do you hear ? "
10180	10185	10187	10187	Caspian	87	" Yes , Uncle , "
10189	10199	10201	10202	the King	1497	" Then let 's have no more of it , "
10233	10253	10205	10205	he	87	" Conduct His Royal Highness to his apartments and send His Royal Highness 's nurse to me AT ONCE . "
10552	10564	10566	10567	Doctor Cornelius	96	" It was your Highness 's ancestor , Caspian the First , "
10569	10635	10566	10567	Doctor Cornelius	96	" who first conquered Narnia and made it his kingdom . It was he who brought all your nation into the country . You are not native Narnians at all . You are all Telmarines — that is , you all came from the Land of Telmar , far beyond the Western Mountains . That is why Caspian the First is called Caspian the Conqueror . "
10636	10641	10643	10643	Caspian	87	" Please , Doctor , "
10647	10661	10643	10643	Caspian	87	" who lived in Narnia before we all came here out of Telmar ? "
10662	10679	10681	10682	Doctor Cornelius	96	" No men — or very few — lived in Narnia before the Telmarines took it , "
10684	10696	10566	10567	Doctor Cornelius	96	" Then who did my great - great - grandcesters conquer ? "
10697	10706	10708	10709	Doctor Cornelius	96	" Whom , not who , your Highness , "
10711	10723	10708	10709	Doctor Cornelius	96	" Perhaps it is time to turn from History to Grammar . "
10724	10731	10733	10733	Caspian	87	" Oh please , not yet , "
10735	10762	10733	10733	Caspian	87	" I mean , was n't there a battle ? Why is he called Caspian the Conqueror if there was nobody here to fight with him ? "
10763	10774	10776	10777	the Doctor	487	" I said there were very few men in Narnia , "
10806	10811	10812	10812	he	87	" Do you mean , "
10815	10837	10812	10812	he	87	" that there were other things ? Do you mean it was like in the stories ? Were there — — ? "
10838	10841	10843	10844	Doctor Cornelius	96	" Hush ! "
10855	10905	10847	10847	his	96	" Not a word more . Do n't you know your nurse was sent away for telling you about Old Narnia ? The King does n't like it . If he found me telling you secrets , you 'd be whipped and I should have my head cut off . "
10906	10910	10912	10912	Caspian	87	" But why ? "
10914	10925	10927	10928	Doctor Cornelius	96	" It is high time we turned to Grammar now , "
10935	10965	10927	10928	Doctor Cornelius	96	" Will your Royal Highness be pleased to open Pulverulentus Siccus at the fourth page of his Grammatical Garden or the Arbour of Accidence pleasantlie open'd to Tender Wits ? "
11029	11117	11025	11026	his Tutor	489	" To - night I am going to give you a lesson in Astronomy . At dead of night two noble planets , Tarva and Alambil , will pass within one degree of each other . Such a conjunction has not occurred for two hundred years , and your Highness will not live to see it again . It will be best if you go to bed a little earlier than usual . When the time of the conjunction draws near I will come and wake you . "
11568	11577	11578	11578	he	87	" Are they going to have a collision ? "
11587	11593	11595	11596	the Doctor	487	" Nay , dear Prince , "
11607	11670	11599	11599	he	487	" The great lords of the upper sky know the steps of their dance too well for that . Look well upon them . Their meeting is fortunate and means some great good for the sad realm of Narnia . Tarva , the Lord of Victory , salutes Alambil , the Lady of Peace . They are just coming to their nearest . "
11671	11683	11685	11685	Caspian	87	" It 's a pity that tree gets in the way , "
11687	11705	11685	11685	Caspian	87	" We 'd really see better from the West Tower , though it is not so high . "
11738	11741	11742	11742	he	96	" There , "
11745	11787	11742	11742	he	96	" You have seen what no man now alive has seen , nor will see again . And you are right . We should have seen it even better from the smaller tower . I brought you here for another reason . "
11805	11812	11814	11815	Doctor Cornelius	96	" The virtue of this tower , "
11817	11851	11814	11815	Doctor Cornelius	96	" is that we have six empty rooms beneath us , and a long stair , and the door at the bottom of the stair is locked . We can not be overheard . "
11852	11869	11871	11871	Caspian	87	" Are you going to tell me what you would n't tell me the other day ? "
11873	11877	11879	11880	the Doctor	487	" I am , "
11882	11907	11879	11880	the Doctor	487	" But remember . You and I must never talk about these things except here — on the very top of the Great Tower . "
11908	11916	11918	11918	Caspian	87	" No . That 's a promise , "
11920	11927	11918	11918	Caspian	87	" But do go on please . "
11928	11931	11933	11934	the Doctor	487	" Listen , "
11936	12053	11933	11934	the Doctor	487	" All you have heard about Old Narnia is true . It is not the land of Men . It is the country of Aslan , the country of the Waking Trees and Visible Naiads , of Fauns and Satyrs , of Dwarfs and Giants , of the gods and the Centaurs , of Talking Beasts . It was against these that the first Caspian fought . It is you Telmarines who silenced the beasts and the trees and the fountains , and who killed and drove away the Dwarfs and Fauns , and are now trying to cover up even the memory of them . The King does not allow them to be spoken of . "
12054	12064	12066	12066	Caspian	87	" Oh , I do wish we had n't , "
12068	12085	12066	12066	Caspian	87	" And I am glad it was all true , even if it is all over . "
12086	12096	12098	12099	Doctor Cornelius	96	" Many of your race wish that in secret , "
12101	12106	12108	12108	Caspian	87	" But , Doctor , "
12110	12129	12108	12108	Caspian	87	" why do you say my race ? After all , I suppose you 're a Telmarine too . "
12130	12134	12136	12137	the Doctor	487	" Am I ? "
12139	12148	12150	12150	Caspian	87	" Well , you 're a Man anyway , "
12152	12156	12158	12159	the Doctor	487	" Am I ? "
12238	12267	12268	12269	The other	375	terror—"He 's not a real man , not a man at all , he 's a Dwarf , and he 's brought me up here to kill me . "
12272	12286	12268	12269	The other	375	delight—"There are real Dwarfs still , and I 've seen one at last . "
12287	12297	12299	12300	Doctor Cornelius	96	" So you 've guessed it in the end , "
12302	12429	12299	12300	Doctor Cornelius	96	" Or guessed it nearly right . I 'm not a pure Dwarf . I have human blood in me too . Many Dwarfs escaped in the great battles and lived on , shaving their beards and wearing high - heeled shoes and pretending to be men . They have mixed with your Telmarines . I am one of those , only a half - Dwarf , and if any of my kindred , the true Dwarfs , are still alive anywhere in the world , doubtless they would despise me and call me a traitor . But never in all these years have we forgotten our own people and all the other happy creatures of Narnia , and the long - lost days of freedom . "
12430	12438	12440	12440	Caspian	87	" I'm — I'm sorry , Doctor , "
12442	12452	12440	12440	Caspian	87	" It was n't my fault , you know . "
12453	12468	12470	12471	the Doctor	487	" I am not saying these things in blame of you , dear Prince , "
12473	12554	12470	12471	the Doctor	487	" You may well ask why I say them at all . But I have two reasons . Firstly , because my old heart has carried these secret memories so long that it aches with them and would burst if I did not whisper them to you . But secondly , for this : that when you become King you may help us , for I know that you also , Telmarine though you are , love the Old Things . "
12555	12562	12564	12564	Caspian	87	" I do , I do , "
12566	12573	12564	12564	Caspian	87	" But how can I help ? "
12574	12639	12470	12471	the Doctor	487	" You can be kind to the poor remnants of the Dwarf people , like myself . You can gather learned magicians and try to find a way of awaking the trees once more . You can search through all the nooks and wild places of the land to see if any Fauns or Talking Beasts or Dwarfs are perhaps still alive in hiding . "
12640	12648	12650	12650	Caspian	87	" Do you think there are any ? "
12653	12664	12666	12667	the Doctor	487	" I do n't know — I do n't know , "
12673	12787	12666	12667	the Doctor	487	" Sometimes I am afraid there ca n't be . I have been looking for traces of them all my life . Sometimes I have thought I heard a Dwarf - drum in the mountains . Sometimes at night , in the woods , I thought I had caught a glimpse of Fauns and Satyrs dancing a long way off ; but when I came to the place , there was never anything there . I have often despaired ; but something always happens to start me hoping again . I do n't know . But at least you can try to be a King like Peter , and not like your uncle . "
12788	12806	12808	12808	Caspian	87	" Then it 's true about the Kings and Queens too , and about the White Witch ? "
12810	12816	12818	12818	Cornelius	96	" Certainly it is true , "
12820	12837	12818	12818	Cornelius	96	" Their reign was the Golden Age in Narnia and the land has never forgotten them . "
12838	12848	12666	12667	the Doctor	487	" Did they live in this castle , Doctor ? "
12849	12855	12857	12859	the old man	520	" Nay , my dear , "
12861	12957	12857	12859	the old man	520	" This castle is a thing of yesterday . Your great - great - grandfather built it . But when the two sons of Adam and the two daughters of Eve were made Kings and Queens of Narnia by Aslan himself , they lived in the castle of Cair Paravel . No man alive has seen that blessed place and perhaps even the ruins of it have now vanished . But we believe it was far from here , down at the mouth of the Great River , on the very shore of the sea . "
12958	12961	12963	12963	Caspian	87	" Ugh ! "
12968	12990	12963	12963	Caspian	87	" Do you mean in the Black Woods ? Where all the — the — you know , the ghosts live ? "
12991	13001	13003	13004	the Doctor	487	" Your Highness speaks as you have been taught , "
13006	13184	13003	13004	the Doctor	487	" But it is all lies . There are no ghosts there . That is a story invented by the Telmarines . Your Kings are in deadly fear of the sea because they can never quite forget that in all stories Aslan comes from over the sea . They do n't want to go near it and they do n't want anyone else to go near it . So they have let great woods grow up to cut their people off from the coast . But because they have quarrelled with the trees they are afraid of the woods . And because they are afraid of the woods they imagine that they are full of ghosts . And the Kings and great men , hating both the sea and the wood , partly believe these stories , and partly encourage them . They feel safer if no one in Narnia dares to go down to the coast and look out to sea — towards Aslan 's land and the morning and the eastern end of the world . "
13202	13222	13198	13199	Doctor Cornelius	96	" Come . We have been here long enough . It is time to go down and to bed . "
13223	13227	13229	13229	Caspian	87	" Must we ? "
13231	13249	13229	13229	Caspian	87	" I 'd like to go on talking about these things for hours and hours and hours . "
13250	13263	13265	13266	Doctor Cornelius	96	" Someone might begin looking for us , if we did that , "
13433	13438	13439	13439	he	87	" And I myself , "
13442	13457	13439	13439	he	87	" am only a very imperfect magician and can do only the smallest experiments . "
13461	13470	13472	13473	the Doctor	487	" Which is a noble and heroical art , "
13633	13645	13647	13647	Caspian	87	" Are we going to do a little Astronomy , Doctor ? "
13649	13652	13654	13655	the Doctor	487	" Hush ! "
13657	13682	13654	13655	the Doctor	487	" Trust me and do exactly as I tell you . Put on all your clothes ; you have a long journey before you . "
13717	13744	13713	13714	the Doctor	487	" I have a wallet for you . We must go into the next room and fill it with victuals from your Highness 's supper table . "
13745	13756	13758	13758	Caspian	87	" My gentlemen - in - waiting will be there , "
13760	13770	13772	13773	the Doctor	487	" They are fast asleep and will not wake , "
13775	13792	13772	13773	the Doctor	487	" I am a very minor magician but I can at least contrive a charmed sleep . "
13888	13894	13896	13897	the Doctor	487	" Have you your sword ? "
13899	13902	13904	13904	Caspian	87	" Yes , "
13906	13937	13904	13904	Caspian	87	" Then put this mantle over all to hide the sword and the wallet . That 's right . And now we must go to the Great Tower and talk . "
13975	14004	13971	13972	Doctor Cornelius	96	" Dear Prince , you must leave this castle at once and go to seek your fortune in the wide world . Your life is in danger here . "
14005	14010	14089	14090	the Doctor	487	" Why ? asked Caspian .
14011	14039	13971	13972	Doctor Cornelius	96	" Because you are the true King of Narnia : Caspian the Tenth , the true son and heir of Caspian the Ninth . Long life to your Majesty"—and
14061	14073	14075	14075	Caspian	87	" What does it all mean ? I do n't understand , "
14077	14087	14089	14090	the Doctor	487	" I wonder you have never asked me before , "
14092	14347	14089	14090	the Doctor	487	" why , being the son of King Caspian , you are not King Caspian yourself . Everyone except your Majesty knows that Miraz is a usurper . When he first began to rule he did not even pretend to be the King : he called himself Lord Protector . But then your royal mother died , the good Queen and the only Telmarine who was ever kind to me . And then , one by one , all the great lords , who had known your father , died or disappeared . Not by accident , either . Miraz weeded them out . Belisar and Uvilas were shot with arrows on a hunting party : by chance , it was pretended . All the great house of the Passarids he sent to fight giants on the northern frontier till one by one they fell . Arlian and Erimon and a dozen more he executed for treason on a false charge . The two brothers of Beaversdam he shut up as madmen . And finally he persuaded the seven noble lords , who alone among all the Telmarines did not fear the sea , to sail away and look for new lands beyond the Eastern Ocean , and , as he intended , they never came back . And when there was no one left who could speak a word for you , then his flatterers ( as he had instructed them ) begged him to become King . And of course he did . "
14348	14360	14362	14362	Caspian	87	" Do you mean he now wants to kill me too ? "
14364	14370	14372	14373	Doctor Cornelius	96	" That is almost certain , "
14375	14380	14382	14382	Caspian	87	" But why now ? "
14384	14409	14382	14382	Caspian	87	" I mean , why did n't he do it long ago if he wanted to ? And what harm have I done him ? "
14410	14435	14089	14090	the Doctor	487	" He has changed his mind about you because of something that happened only two hours ago . The Queen has had a son . "
14436	14450	14452	14452	Caspian	87	" I do n't see what that 's got to do with it , "
14454	14459	14461	14462	the Doctor	487	" Do n't see ! "
14464	14564	14461	14462	the Doctor	487	" Have all my lessons in History and Politics taught you no more than that ? Listen . As long as he had no children of his own , he was willing enough that you should be King after he died . He may not have cared much about you , but he would rather you should have the throne than a stranger . Now that he has a son of his own he will want his own son to be the next King . You are in the way . He 'll clear you out of the way . "
14565	14574	14576	14576	Caspian	87	" Is he really as bad as that ? "
14578	14585	14576	14576	Caspian	87	" Would he really murder me ? "
14586	14592	14594	14595	Doctor Cornelius	96	" He murdered your Father , "
14605	14614	14616	14617	the Doctor	487	" I can tell you the whole story , "
14619	14635	14616	14617	the Doctor	487	" But not now . There is no time . You must fly at once . "
14636	14643	14645	14645	Caspian	87	" You 'll come with me ? "
14647	14652	14654	14655	the Doctor	487	" I dare not , "
14657	14717	14654	14655	the Doctor	487	" It would make your danger greater . Two are more easily tracked than one . Dear Prince , dear King Caspian , you must be very brave . You must go alone and at once . Try to get across the southern border to the court of King Nain of Archenland . He will be good to you . "
14718	14726	14728	14728	Caspian	87	" Shall I never see you again ? "
14734	14742	14744	14745	the Doctor	487	" I hope so , dear King , "
14747	14814	14744	14745	the Doctor	487	" What friend have I in the wide world except your Majesty ? And I have a little magic . But in the meantime , speed is everything . Here are two gifts before you go . This is a little purse of gold — alas , all the treasure in this castle should be your own by rights . And here is something far better . "
14839	14842	14844	14845	Doctor Cornelius	96	" That , "
14847	15012	14844	14845	Doctor Cornelius	96	" is the greatest and most sacred treasure of Narnia . Many terrors I endured , many spells did I utter , to find it , when I was still young . It is the magic horn of Susan herself which she left behind her when she vanished from Narnia at the end of the Golden Age . It is said that whoever blows it shall have strange help — no one can say how strange . It may have power to call Lucy and Edmund and Susan and Peter back from the past , and they will set all to rights . It may be that it will call up Aslan himself . Take it , King Caspian : but do not use it except at your greatest need . And now , haste , haste , haste . The little door at the very bottom of the Tower , the door into the garden , is unlocked . There we must part . "
15013	15022	15024	15024	Caspian	87	" Ca n't I get my horse Destrier ? "
15026	15043	14844	14845	Doctor Cornelius	96	" He is already saddled and waiting for you just at the corner of the orchard . "
15547	15554	15556	15556	Caspian	87	" Quiet , Destrier , quiet ! "
15715	15719	15721	15721	one	311	" And now , "
15723	15737	15721	15721	one	311	" before it wakes up we must decide what to do with it . "
15738	15742	15744	15744	another	586	" Kill it , "
15746	15759	15744	15744	another	586	" We ca n't let it live . It would betray us . "
15760	15776	15778	15780	a third voice	587	" We ought to have killed it at once , or else let it alone , "
15782	15811	15778	15780	a third voice	587	" We ca n't kill it now . Not after we 've taken it in and bandaged its head and all . It would be murdering a guest . "
15812	15815	15817	15817	Caspian	87	" Gentlemen , "
15823	15841	15817	15817	Caspian	87	" whatever you do to me , I hope you will be kind to my poor horse . "
15842	15854	15856	15858	the first voice	588	" Your horse had taken flight long before we found you , "
15872	15886	15888	15890	the second voice	589	" Now do n't let it talk you round with its pretty words , "
15892	15898	15888	15890	the second voice	589	" I still say — — "
15899	15904	15906	15908	the third voice	590	" Horns and halibuts ! "
15910	15940	15906	15908	the third voice	590	" Of course we 're not going to murder it . For shame , Nikabrik . What do you say , Trufflehunter ? What shall we do with it ? "
15941	15949	15951	15953	the first voice	588	" I shall give it a drink , "
16025	16034	16036	16036	Caspian	87	" It 's a mask of some sort , "
16038	16051	16036	16036	Caspian	87	" Or perhaps I 'm in a fever and imagining it all . "
16312	16316	16318	16318	Nikabrik	118	" And now , "
16334	16404	16318	16318	Nikabrik	118	" we still have to decide what to do with this Human . You two think you 've done it a great kindness by not letting me kill it . But I suppose the upshot is that we have to keep it a prisoner for life . I 'm certainly not going to let it go alive — to go back to its own kind and betray us all . "
16405	16412	16414	16414	Trumpkin	121	" Bulbs and bolsters ! Nikabrik , "
16416	16454	16414	16414	Trumpkin	121	" Why need you talk so unhandsomely ? It is n't the creature 's fault that it bashed its head against a tree outside our hole . And I do n't think it looks like a traitor . "
16455	16459	16461	16461	Caspian	87	" I say , "
16463	16506	16461	16461	Caspian	87	" you have n't yet found out whether I want to go back . I do n't . I want to stay with you — if you 'll let me . I 've been looking for people like you all my life . "
16507	16514	16516	16516	Nikabrik	118	" That 's a likely story , "
16518	16543	16516	16516	Nikabrik	118	" You 're a Telmarine and a Human , are n't you ? Of course you want to go back to your own kind . "
16544	16556	16558	16558	Caspian	87	" Well , even if I did , I could n't , "
16560	16597	16558	16558	Caspian	87	" I was flying for my life when I had my accident . The King wants to kill me . If you 'd killed me , you 'd have done the very thing to please him . "
16598	16602	16604	16604	Trufflehunter	119	" Well now , "
16606	16613	16604	16604	Trufflehunter	119	" you do n't say so ! "
16614	16617	16619	16619	Trumpkin	121	" Eh ? "
16621	16643	16619	16619	Trumpkin	121	" What 's that ? What have you been doing , Human , to fall foul of Miraz at your age ? "
16644	16650	16652	16652	Caspian	87	" He 's my uncle , "
16665	16670	16671	16671	he	87	" There you are ! "
16674	16700	16671	16671	he	87	" Not only a Telmarine but close kin and heir to our greatest enemy . Are you still mad enough to let this creature live ? "
16733	16743	16745	16745	Trumpkin	121	" Now , once and for all , Nikabrik , "
16747	16763	16745	16745	Trumpkin	121	" Will you contain yourself , or must Trufflehunter and I sit on your head ? "
16794	16804	16806	16806	Trumpkin	121	" This is the queerest thing I ever heard , "
16808	16815	16817	16817	Nikabrik	118	" I do n't like it , "
16819	16896	16817	16817	Nikabrik	118	" I did n't know there were stories about us still told among the Humans . The less they know about us the better . That old nurse , now . She 'd better have held her tongue . And it 's all mixed up with that Tutor : a renegade Dwarf . I hate 'em . I hate 'em worse than the Humans . You mark my words — no good will come of it . "
16897	16912	16914	16914	Trufflehunter	119	" Do n't you go talking about things you do n't understand , Nikabrik , "
16916	17008	16914	16914	Trufflehunter	119	" You Dwarfs are as forgetful and changeable as the Humans themselves . I 'm a beast , I am , and a Badger what 's more . We do n't change . We hold on . I say great good will come of it . This is the true King of Narnia we 've got here : a true King , coming back to true Narnia . And we beasts remember , even if Dwarfs forget , that Narnia was never right except when a son of Adam was King . "
17009	17016	17018	17018	Trumpkin	121	" Whistles and whirligigs ! Trufflehunter , "
17020	17034	17018	17018	Trumpkin	121	" You do n't mean you want to give the country to Humans ? "
17035	17042	17044	17045	the Badger	120	" I said nothing about that , "
17047	17099	17044	17045	the Badger	120	" It 's not Men 's country ( who should know that better than me ? ) but it 's a country for a man to be King of . We badgers have long enough memories to know that . Why , bless us all , was n't Peter a Man ? "
17100	17109	17111	17111	Trumpkin	121	" Do you believe all those old stories ? "
17113	17126	17128	17128	Trufflehunter	119	" I tell you , we do n't change , we beasts , "
17130	17158	17128	17128	Trufflehunter	119	" We do n't forget . I believe in Peter and the rest that reigned at Cair Paravel , as firmly as I believe in Aslan himself . "
17159	17169	17171	17171	Trumpkin	121	" As firmly as that , I dare say , "
17173	17181	17171	17171	Trumpkin	121	" But who believes in Aslan nowadays ? "
17182	17186	17188	17188	Caspian	87	" I do , "
17190	17259	17188	17188	Caspian	87	" And if I had n't believed in him before , I would now . Back there among the Humans the people who laughed at Aslan would have laughed at stories about Talking Beasts and Dwarfs . Sometimes I did wonder if there really was such a person as Aslan : but then sometimes I wondered if there were really people like you . Yet there you are . "
17260	17265	17267	17267	Trufflehunter	119	" That 's right , "
17269	17304	17267	17267	Trufflehunter	119	" You 're right , King Caspian . And as long as you will be true to Old Narnia you shall be my King , whatever they say . Long life to your Majesty . "
17305	17313	17315	17315	Nikabrik	118	" You make me sick , Badger , "
17317	17357	17358	17358	he	118	" Peter and the rest may have been Men , but they were a different sort of Men . This is one of the cursed Telmarines . He has hunted beasts for sport . Have n't you , now ? "
17366	17378	17380	17380	Caspian	87	" Well , to tell you the truth , I have , "
17382	17390	17380	17380	Caspian	87	" But they were n't Talking Beasts . "
17391	17399	17401	17401	Nikabrik	118	" It 's all the same thing , "
17403	17410	17412	17412	Trufflehunter	119	" No , no , no , "
17414	17473	17412	17412	Trufflehunter	119	" You know it is n't . You know very well that the beasts in Narnia nowadays are different and are no more than the poor dumb , witless creatures you 'd find in Kalormen or Telmar . They 're smaller too . They 're far more different from us than the half - Dwarfs are from you . "
17518	17521	17516	17516	Trumpkin	121	" the Others "
17608	17619	17621	17621	Trumpkin	121	" We will go first to the Three Bulgy Bears , "
17669	17682	17656	17656	he	119	" Go away . It 's not time to get up yet . "
17833	17840	17829	17829	Trufflehunter	119	" Pattertwig ! Pattertwig ! Pattertwig ! "
17975	18012	17968	17968	Trufflehunter	119	" Do n't look . Look the other way . It 's very bad manners among squirrels to watch anyone going to his store or to look as if you wanted to know where it was . "
18039	18052	18053	18053	he	87	" For I can go nearly everywhere without setting foot to ground , "
18097	18108	18110	18110	Trumpkin	121	" And you 'd better tell the three Bulgies too , "
18112	18121	18110	18110	Trumpkin	121	" We forgot to mention it to them . "
18429	18435	18425	18425	they	635	" Long live the King , "
18600	18614	18594	18597	the eldest of them	641	" If he is against Miraz , we 'll have him for King . "
18621	18654	18594	18597	the eldest of them	641	" Shall we go farther up for you , up to the crags ? There 's an Ogre or two and a Hag that we could introduce you to , up there . "
18655	18659	18661	18661	Caspian	87	" Certainly not , "
18663	18671	18673	18673	Trufflehunter	119	" I should think not , indeed , "
18675	18686	18673	18673	Trufflehunter	119	" We want none of that sort on our side . "
18731	18747	18749	18749	Trufflehunter	119	" We should not have Aslan for our friend if we brought in that rabble , "
18762	18767	18769	18769	Trumpkin	121	" Oh , Aslan ! "
18775	18788	18769	18769	Trumpkin	121	" What matters much more is that you would n't have me . "
18789	18796	18798	18798	Caspian	87	" Do you believe in Aslan ? "
18802	18811	18813	18813	Nikabrik	118	" I 'll believe in anyone or anything , "
18815	18846	18813	18813	Nikabrik	118	" that 'll batter these cursed Telmarine barbarians to pieces or drive them out of Narnia . Anyone or anything , Aslan or the White Witch , do you understand ? "
18847	18852	18854	18854	Trufflehunter	119	" Silence , silence , "
18856	18878	18854	18854	Trufflehunter	119	" You do not know what you are saying . She was a worse enemy than Miraz and all his race . "
18879	18888	18890	18890	Nikabrik	118	" Not to Dwarfs , she was n't , "
18955	18960	18951	18951	Trufflehunter	119	" Glenstorm ! Glenstorm ! "
19046	19052	19053	19053	he	130	" Long live the King , "
19056	19074	19053	19053	he	130	" I and my sons are ready for war . When is the battle to be joined ? "
19166	19180	19182	19182	Caspian	87	" Do you mean a real war to drive Miraz out of Narnia ? "
19184	19188	19190	19191	the Centaur	663	" What else ? "
19193	19208	19190	19191	the Centaur	663	" Why else does your Majesty go clad in mail and girt with sword ? "
19209	19216	19218	19219	the Badger	120	" Is it possible , Glenstorm ? "
19221	19227	19229	19229	Glenstorm	130	" The time is ripe , "
19231	19301	19302	19302	He	130	" I watch the skies , Badger , for it is mine to watch , as it is yours to remember . Tarva and Alambil have met in the halls of high heaven , and on earth a son of Adam has once more arisen to rule and name the creatures . The hour has struck . Our council at the Dancing Lawn must be a council of war . "
19533	19542	19543	19543	he	134	" There are twelve of us , Sire , "
19552	19569	19543	19543	he	134	" and I place all the resources of my people unreservedly at your Majesty 's disposal . "
19716	19719	19721	19722	the Badger	678	" Now , "
19724	19749	19721	19722	the Badger	678	" if only we could wake the spirits of these trees and this well , we should have done a good day 's work . "
19750	19755	19757	19757	Caspian	87	" Ca n't we ? "
19759	19762	19764	19764	Trufflehunter	119	" No , "
19766	19857	19764	19764	Trufflehunter	119	" We have no power over them . Since the Humans came into the land , felling forests and defiling streams , the Dryads and Naiads have sunk into a deep sleep . Who knows if ever they will stir again ? And that is a great loss to our side . The Telmarines are horribly afraid of the woods , and once the Trees moved in anger , our enemies would go mad with fright and be chased out of Narnia as quick as their legs could carry them . "
19858	19865	19867	19867	Trumpkin	121	" What imaginations you Animals have ! "
19877	19902	19867	19867	Trumpkin	121	" But why stop at Trees and Waters ? Would n't it be even nicer if the stones started throwing themselves at old Miraz ? "
20131	20134	20136	20136	Caspian	87	" Fauns ! "
20817	20830	20805	20805	they	707	" Silence ! Silence , everyone , for the King 's speech , "
20841	20844	20845	20845	he	87	" Narnians ! "
20865	20875	20860	20862	Camillo the Hare	137	" Hush ! There 's a Man somewhere near . "
20911	20922	20924	20924	Trufflehunter	119	" Smells like Man and yet not quite like Man , "
20926	20933	20935	20935	Camillo	137	" It 's getting steadily nearer , "
20937	20959	20961	20961	Caspian	87	" Two badgers and you three Dwarfs , with your bow at the ready , go softly off to meet it , "
20963	20970	20972	20974	a Black Dwarf	711	" We 'll settle ' un , "
20984	20993	20995	20995	Caspian	87	" Do n't shoot if it is alone , "
20997	21001	20995	20995	Caspian	87	" Catch it . "
21002	21005	21007	21008	the Dwarf	1552	" Why ? "
21010	21017	21019	21021	Glenstorm the Centaur	147	" Do as you 're told , "
21057	21064	20995	20995	Caspian	87	" Stop ! Who goes there ? "
21086	21123	20995	20995	Caspian	87	" All right , all right , I 'm unarmed . Take my wrists if you like , worthy Badgers , but do n't bite right through them . I want to speak to the King . "
21124	21128	21130	21130	Caspian	87	" Doctor Cornelius ! "
21148	21151	21153	21153	Nikabrik	118	" Pah ! "
21155	21176	21153	21153	Nikabrik	118	" A renegade Dwarf . A half - and - halfer ! Shall I pass my sword through its throat ? "
21177	21183	21185	21185	Trumpkin	121	" Be quiet , Nikabrik , "
21187	21196	21185	21185	Trumpkin	121	" The creature ca n't help its ancestry . "
21197	21210	21212	21212	Caspian	87	" This is my greatest friend and the saviour of my life , "
21214	21250	21212	21212	Caspian	87	" And anyone who does n't like his company may leave my army : at once . Dearest Doctor , I am glad to see you again . How ever did you find us out ? "
21251	21263	21265	21266	the Doctor	487	" By a little use of simple magic , your Majesty , "
21280	21325	21265	21266	the Doctor	487	" But there 's no time to go into that now . We must all fly from this place at once . You are already betrayed and Miraz is on the move . Before mid - day to - morrow you will be surrounded . "
21326	21329	21331	21331	Caspian	87	" Betrayed ! "
21333	21338	21331	21331	Caspian	87	" And by whom ? "
21339	21347	21349	21349	Nikabrik	118	" Another renegade Dwarf , no doubt , "
21351	21357	21359	21360	Doctor Cornelius	96	" By your horse Destrier , "
21362	21527	21359	21360	Doctor Cornelius	96	" The poor brute knew no better . When you were knocked off , of course , he went dawdling back to his stable in the castle . Then the secret of your flight was known . I made myself scarce , having no wish to be questioned about it in Miraz 's torture chamber . I had a pretty good guess from my crystal as to where I should find you . But all day — that was the day before yesterday — I saw Miraz 's tracking parties out in the woods . Yesterday I learned that his army is out . I do n't think some of your — um — pure - blooded Dwarfs have as much woodcraft as might be expected . You 've left tracks all over the place . Great carelessness . At any rate something has warned Miraz that Old Narnia is not so dead as he had hoped , and he is on the move . "
21528	21531	21542	21543	the Doctor	487	" Hurrah ! "
21547	21569	21542	21543	the Doctor	487	" Let them come ! All I ask is that the King will put me and my people in the front . "
21570	21575	21577	21578	Doctor Cornelius	96	" What on earth ? "
21580	21594	21577	21578	Doctor Cornelius	96	" Has your Majesty got grasshoppers — or mosquitoes — in your army ? "
21612	21617	21618	21618	he	96	" By the Lion , "
21621	21646	21618	21618	he	96	" it 's a mouse . Signior Mouse , I desire your better acquaintance . I am honoured by meeting so valiant a beast . "
21647	21657	21658	21659	piped Reepicheep	135	" My friendship you shall have , learned Man , "
21661	21687	21658	21659	piped Reepicheep	135	" And any Dwarf — or Giant — in the army who does not give you good language shall have my sword to reckon with . "
21688	21696	21698	21698	Nikabrik	118	" Is there time for this foolery ? "
21700	21710	21698	21698	Nikabrik	118	" What are our plans ? Battle or flight ? "
21711	21717	21719	21719	Trumpkin	121	" Battle if need be , "
21721	21739	21719	21719	Trumpkin	121	" But we are hardly ready for it yet , and this is no very defensible place . "
21740	21751	21753	21753	Caspian	87	" I do n't like the idea of running away , "
21755	21762	21764	21766	the Bulgy Bears	128	" Hear him ! Hear him ! "
21768	21794	21764	21766	the Bulgy Bears	128	" Whatever we do , do n't let 's have any running . Especially not before supper ; and not too soon after it neither . "
21795	21806	21808	21809	the Centaur	147	" Those who run first do not always run last , "
21811	21835	21808	21809	the Centaur	147	" And why should we let the enemy choose our position instead of choosing it ourselves ? Let us find a strong place . "
21836	21848	21850	21850	Trufflehunter	119	" That 's wise , your Majesty , that 's wise , "
21852	21860	21764	21766	the Bulgy Bears	128	" But where are we to go ? "
21865	21869	21871	21872	Doctor Cornelius	96	" Your Majesty , "
21874	21970	21871	21872	Doctor Cornelius	96	" and all you variety of creatures , I think we must fly east and down the river to the great woods . The Telmarines hate that region . They have always been afraid of the sea and of something that may come over the sea . That is why they have let the great woods grow up . If traditions speak true , the ancient Cair Paravel was at the river - mouth . All that part is friendly to us and hateful to our enemies . We must go to Aslan 's How . "
21971	21976	21978	21979	several voices	721	" Aslan 's How ? "
21981	21990	21978	21979	several voices	721	" We do not know what it is . "
21991	22135	21871	21872	Doctor Cornelius	96	" It lies within the skirts of the Great Woods and it is a huge mound which Narnians raised in very ancient times over a very magical place , where there stood — and perhaps still stands — a very magical Stone . The Mound is all hollowed out within into galleries and caves , and the Stone is in the central cave of all . There is room in the mound for all our stores , and those of us who have most need of cover and are most accustomed to underground life can be lodged in the caves . The rest of us can lie in the wood . At a pinch all of us ( except this worthy Giant ) could retreat into the Mound itself , and there we should be beyond the reach of every danger except famine . "
22136	22150	22152	22152	Trufflehunter	119	" It is a good thing we have a learned man among us , "
22161	22186	22155	22155	Trumpkin	121	" Soup and celery ! I wish our leaders would think less about these old wives ' tales and more about victuals and arms . "
23079	23090	23092	23092	Trufflehunter	119	" If your Majesty is ever to use the Horn , "
23094	23103	23092	23092	Trufflehunter	119	" I think the time has now come . "
23117	23125	23127	23127	Caspian	87	" We are certainly in great need , "
23129	23157	23127	23127	Caspian	87	" But it is hard to be sure we are at our greatest . Supposing there came an even worse need and we had already used it ? "
23158	23163	23165	23165	Nikabrik	118	" By that argument , "
23167	23180	23165	23165	Nikabrik	118	" your Majesty will never use it until it is too late . "
23181	23187	23189	23190	Doctor Cornelius	96	" I agree with that , "
23192	23201	23203	23203	Caspian	87	" And what do you think , Trumpkin ? "
23205	23212	23127	23127	Caspian	87	" Oh , as for me , "
23226	23307	23127	23127	Caspian	87	" your Majesty knows I think the Horn — and that bit of broken stone over there — and your great Peter — and your Lion Aslan — are all eggs in moonshine . It 's all one to me when your Majesty blows the Horn . All I insist is that the army is told nothing about it . There 's no good raising hopes of magical help which ( as I think ) are sure to be disappointed . "
23308	23322	23324	23324	Caspian	87	" Then in the name of Aslan we will wind Susan 's Horn , "
23326	23334	23336	23337	Doctor Cornelius	96	" There is one thing , Sire , "
23339	23413	23336	23337	Doctor Cornelius	96	" that should perhaps be done first . We do not know what form the help will take . It might call Aslan himself from oversea . But I think it is more likely to call Peter the High King and his mighty consorts down from the high past . But in either case , I do not think we can be sure that the help will come to this very spot — — "
23414	23422	23425	23425	Trumpkin	121	" You never said a truer word , "
23427	23431	23434	23436	the learned man	773	" I think , "
23438	23616	23434	23436	the learned man	773	" that they — or he — will come back to one or other of the Ancient Places of Narnia . This , where we now sit , is the most ancient and most deeply magical of all , and here , I think , the answer is likeliest to come . But there are two others . One is Lantern Waste , up - river , west of Beaversdam , where the Royal Children first appeared in Narnia , as the records tell . The other is down at the river - mouth , where their castle of Cair Paravel once stood . And if Aslan himself comes , that would be the best place for meeting him too , for every story says that he is the son of the great Emperor - over - Sea , and over the sea he will pass . I should like very much to send messengers to both places , to Lantern Waste and the river - mouth , to receive them — or him — or it . "
23617	23623	23625	23625	Trumpkin	121	" Just as I thought , "
23627	23648	23625	23625	Trumpkin	121	" The first result of all this foolery is not to bring us help but to lose us two fighters . "
23649	23660	23662	23662	Caspian	87	" Who would you think of sending , Doctor Cornelius ? "
23664	23677	23679	23679	Trufflehunter	119	" Squirrels are best for getting through enemy country without being caught , "
23681	23693	23695	23695	Nikabrik	118	" All our squirrels ( and we have n't many ) , "
23697	23717	23695	23695	Nikabrik	118	" are rather flighty . The only one I 'd trust on a job like that would be Pattertwig . "
23718	23726	23728	23729	King Caspian	87	" Let it be Pattertwig , then , "
23731	23760	23728	23729	King Caspian	87	" And who for our other messenger ? I know you 'd go , Trufflehunter , but you have n't the speed . Nor you , Doctor Cornelius . "
23761	23767	23769	23769	Nikabrik	118	" I wo n't go , "
23771	23795	23769	23769	Nikabrik	118	" With all these Humans and beasts about , there must be a Dwarf here to see that the Dwarfs are fairly treated . "
23796	23801	23803	23803	Trumpkin	121	" Thimbles and thunderstorms ! "
23808	23827	23803	23803	Trumpkin	121	" Is that how you speak to the King ? Send me , Sire , I 'll go . "
23828	23842	23844	23844	Caspian	87	" But I thought you did n't believe in the Horn , Trumpkin , "
23846	23910	23803	23803	Trumpkin	121	" No more I do , your Majesty . But what 's that got to do with it ? I might as well die on a wild goose chase as die here . You are my King . I know the difference between giving advice and taking orders . You 've had my advice , and now it 's the time for orders . "
23911	23920	23922	23922	Caspian	87	" I will never forget this , Trumpkin , "
23924	23941	23922	23922	Caspian	87	" Send for Pattertwig , one of you . And when shall I blow the Horn ? "
23942	23952	23954	23955	Doctor Cornelius	96	" I would wait for sunrise , your Majesty , "
23957	23969	23954	23955	Doctor Cornelius	96	" That sometimes has an effect in operations of White Magic . "
24070	24074	24076	24076	Trumpkin	121	" and so , "
24110	24242	24076	24076	Trumpkin	121	Paravel)—"and so I put a crust or two in my pocket , left behind all weapons but my dagger , and took to the woods in the grey of the morning . I 'd been plugging away for many hours when there came a sound that I 'd never heard the like of in my born days . Eh , I wo n't forget that . The whole air was full of it , loud as thunder but far longer , cool and sweet as music over water , but strong enough to shake the woods . And I said to myself , ' If that 's not the Horn , call me a rabbit . ' And a moment later I wondered why he had n't blown it sooner — — "
24243	24249	24251	24251	Edmund	71	" What time was it ? "
24253	24262	24264	24264	Trumpkin	121	" Between nine and ten of the clock , "
24266	24276	24278	24280	all the children	327	" Just when we were at the railway station ! "
24291	24296	24298	24298	Lucy	72	" Please go on , "
24303	24487	24489	24489	he	782	" Well , as I was saying , I wondered , but I went on as hard as I could pelt . I kept on all night — and then , when it was half light this morning , as if I 'd no more sense than a Giant , I risked a short cut across open country to cut off a big loop of the river , and was caught . Not by the army , but by a pompous old fool who has charge of a little castle which is Miraz 's last stronghold towards the coast . I need n't tell you they got no true tale out of me , but I was a Dwarf and that was enough . But , lobsters and lollipops ! it is a good thing the seneschal was a pompous fool . Anyone else would have run me through there and then . But nothing would do for him short of a grand execution : sending me down ' to the ghosts ' in the full ceremonial way . And then this young lady "
24494	24529	24530	24530	He	782	" does her bit of archery — and it was pretty shooting , let me tell you — and here we are . And without my armour , for of course they took that . "
24538	24542	24544	24544	Peter	69	" Great Scott ! "
24546	24584	24544	24544	Peter	69	" So it was the horn — your own horn , Su — that dragged us all off that seat on the platform yesterday morning ! I can hardly believe it ; yet it all fits in . "
24585	24597	24599	24599	Lucy	72	" I do n't know why you should n't believe it , "
24601	24662	24599	24599	Lucy	72	" if you believe in magic at all . Are n't there lots of stories about magic forcing people out of one place — out of one world — into another ? I mean , when a magician in The Arabian Nights calls up a Jinn , it has to come . We had to come , just like that . "
24663	24666	24668	24668	Peter	69	" Yes , "
24670	24709	24668	24668	Peter	69	" I suppose what makes it feel so queer is that in the stories it 's always someone in our world who does the calling . One does n't really think about where the Jinn 's coming from . "
24710	24723	24725	24725	Edmund	71	" And now we know what it feels like for the Jinn , "
24730	24765	24725	24725	Edmund	71	" Golly ! It 's a bit uncomfortable to know that we can be whistled for like that . It 's worse than what Father says about living at the mercy of the telephone . "
24766	24778	24780	24780	Lucy	72	" But we want to be here , do n't we , "
24782	24788	24780	24780	Lucy	72	" if Aslan wants us ? "
24789	24792	24794	24795	the Dwarf	1552	" Meanwhile , "
24797	24822	24794	24795	the Dwarf	1552	" what are we to do ? I suppose I 'd better go back to King Caspian and tell him no help has come . "
24823	24827	24829	24829	Susan	70	" No help ? "
24831	24842	24829	24829	Susan	70	" But it has worked . And here we are . "
24843	24858	24860	24861	the Dwarf	1552	" Um — um — yes , to be sure . I see that , "
24882	24891	24860	24861	the Dwarf	1552	" But — well — I mean — — "
24892	24903	24905	24905	Lucy	72	" But do n't you yet see who we are ? "
24907	24912	24905	24905	Lucy	72	" You are stupid . "
24913	24927	24929	24929	Trumpkin	121	" I suppose you are the four children out of the old stories , "
24931	24955	24956	24956	he	121	" And I 'm very glad to meet you of course . And it 's very interesting , no doubt . But — no offence?"—and
24960	24973	24975	24975	Edmund	71	" Do get on and say whatever you 're going to say , "
24977	24985	24987	24987	Trumpkin	121	" Well , then — no offence , "
24989	25067	24987	24987	Trumpkin	121	" But , you know , the King and Trufflehunter and Doctor Cornelius were expecting — well , if you see what I mean , help . To put it in another way , I think they 'd been imagining you as great warriors . As it is — we're awfully fond of children and all that , but just at the moment , in the middle of a war — but I 'm sure you understand . "
25068	25078	25080	25080	Edmund	71	" You mean you think we 're no good , "
25088	25096	25098	25099	the Dwarf	1552	" Now pray do n't be offended , "
25101	25112	25098	25099	the Dwarf	1552	" I assure you , my dear little friends — — "
25113	25124	25126	25126	Edmund	71	" Little from you is really a bit too much , "
25131	25160	25126	25126	Edmund	71	" I suppose you do n't believe we won the Battle of Beruna ? Well , you can say what you like about me because I know — — "
25161	25170	25172	25172	Peter	69	" There 's no good losing our tempers , "
25174	25199	25172	25172	Peter	69	" Let 's fit him out with fresh armour and fit ourselves out from the treasure chamber , and have a talk after that . "
25200	25210	25212	25212	Edmund	71	" I do n't quite see the point — — "
25221	25248	25215	25215	Lucy	72	" Had n't we better do what Peter says ? He is the High King , you know . And I think he has an idea . "
25315	25328	25310	25310	he	1552	" It would never do to let Nikabrik see this ; never . "
25477	25512	25474	25474	Edmund	71	" No , let me do it . It will be more of a sucks for him if I win , and less of a let - down for us all if I fail . "
25513	25519	25521	25521	Peter	69	" All right , Ed , "
25540	25582	25530	25530	Edmund	71	" I 've got something to ask you . Kids like us do n't often have the chance of meeting a great warrior like you . Would you have a little fencing match with me ? It would be frightfully decent . "
25583	25588	25590	25590	Trumpkin	121	" But , lad , "
25592	25598	25590	25590	Trumpkin	121	" these swords are sharps . "
25599	25603	25605	25605	Edmund	71	" I know , "
25607	25632	25605	25605	Edmund	71	" But I 'll never get anywhere near you and you 'll be quite clever enough to disarm me without doing me any damage . "
25633	25640	25642	25642	Trumpkin	121	" It 's a dangerous game , "
25644	25663	25642	25642	Trumpkin	121	" But since you make such a point of it , I 'll try a pass or two . "
25889	25896	25873	25873	Susan	70	" Oh , do be careful . "
25953	25955	25921	25921	Edmund	71	" sting "
25962	25974	25976	25976	Edmund	71	" Not hurt , I hope , my dear little friend ? "
25990	25996	25998	25998	Trumpkin	121	" I see the point , "
26001	26010	25998	25998	Trumpkin	121	" You know a trick I never learned . "
26011	26017	26020	26020	Peter	69	" That 's quite true , "
26022	26076	26020	26020	Peter	69	" The best swordsman in the world may be disarmed by a trick that 's new to him . I think it 's only fair to give Trumpkin a chance at something else . Will you have a shooting match with my sister ? There are no tricks in archery , you know . "
26077	26087	26089	26090	the Dwarf	1552	" Ah , you 're jokers , you are , "
26092	26125	26089	26090	the Dwarf	1552	" I begin to see . As if I did n't know how she can shoot , after what happened this morning . All the same , I 'll have a try . "
26156	26164	26166	26166	Peter	69	" What 's to be the target ? "
26168	26184	26186	26186	Susan	70	" I think that apple hanging over the wall on the branch there would do , "
26188	26196	26198	26198	Trumpkin	121	" That 'll do nicely , lass , "
26200	26213	26198	26198	Trumpkin	121	" You mean the yellow one near the middle of the arch ? "
26214	26220	26222	26222	Susan	70	" No , not that , "
26224	26235	26222	26222	Susan	70	" The red one up above — over the battlement . "
26242	26252	26253	26253	he	1552	" Looks more like a cherry than an apple , "
26465	26473	26475	26477	the other children	818	" Oh , well done , Su , "
26479	26489	26491	26491	Susan	70	" It was n't really any better than yours , "
26496	26510	26491	26491	Susan	70	" I think there was a tiny breath of wind as you shot . "
26511	26517	26519	26519	Trumpkin	121	" No there was n't , "
26521	26560	26519	26519	Trumpkin	121	" Do n't tell me . I know when I am fairly beaten . I wo n't even say that the scar of my last wound catches me a bit when I get my arm well back — — "
26561	26568	26570	26570	Lucy	72	" Oh , are you wounded ? "
26572	26578	26570	26570	Lucy	72	" Do let me look . "
26579	26589	26591	26591	Trumpkin	121	" It 's not a sight for little girls , "
26600	26610	26611	26611	he	121	" There I go talking like a fool again , "
26614	26644	26611	26611	he	121	" I suppose you 're as likely to be a great surgeon as your brother was to be a great swordsman or your sister to be a great archer . "
26716	26722	26724	26724	Lucy	72	" Oh , poor Trumpkin , "
26726	26730	26732	26732	she	72	" How horrid . "
26748	26758	26760	26760	Trumpkin	121	" Hullo . Eh ? What have you done ? "
26845	26861	26825	26825	he	121	" Giants and junipers ! It 's cured ! It 's as good as new . "
26873	26924	26864	26864	he	121	" Well , I 've made as big a fool of myself as ever a Dwarf did . No offence , I hope ? My humble duty to your Majesties all — humble duty . And thanks for my life , my cure , my breakfast — and my lesson . "
26940	26944	26946	26946	Peter	69	" And now , "
26948	26960	26946	26946	Peter	69	" if you 've really decided to believe in us — — "
26961	26965	26967	26968	the Dwarf	1552	" I have , "
26970	26989	26946	26946	Peter	69	" It 's quite clear what we have to do . We must join King Caspian at once . "
26990	26996	26998	26998	Trumpkin	121	" The sooner the better , "
27000	27013	26998	26998	Trumpkin	121	" My being such a fool has already wasted about an hour . "
27014	27028	27030	27030	Peter	69	" It 's about two days ' journey , the way you came , "
27032	27051	27030	27030	Peter	69	" For us , I mean . We ca n't walk all day and night like you Dwarfs . "
27059	27099	27053	27053	he	121	" What Trumpkin calls Aslan 's How is obviously the Stone Table itself . You remember it was about half a day 's march , or a little less , from there down to the Fords of Beruna — — "
27100	27109	27111	27111	Trumpkin	121	" Beruna 's Bridge , we call it , "
27113	27122	27124	27124	Peter	69	" There was no bridge in our time , "
27126	27173	27124	27124	Peter	69	" And then from Beruna down to here was another day and a bit . We used to get home about teatime on the second day , going easily . Going hard , we could do the whole thing in a day and a half perhaps . "
27174	27183	27185	27185	Trumpkin	121	" But remember it 's all woods now , "
27187	27195	27185	27185	Trumpkin	121	" and there are enemies to dodge . "
27196	27200	27202	27202	Edmund	71	" Look here , "
27204	27219	27202	27202	Edmund	71	" need we go by the same way that Our Dear Little Friend came ? "
27220	27234	27236	27237	the Dwarf	1552	" No more of that , your Majesty , if you love me , "
27239	27243	27245	27245	Edmund	71	" Very well , "
27247	27254	27245	27245	Edmund	71	" May I say our D.L.F. ? "
27255	27260	27262	27262	Susan	70	" Oh , Edmund , "
27264	27274	27262	27262	Susan	70	" Do n't keep on at him like that . "
27275	27288	27290	27290	Trumpkin	121	" That 's all right , lass — I mean your Majesty , "
27295	27304	27290	27290	Trumpkin	121	" A jibe wo n't raise a blister . "
27325	27331	27333	27333	Edmund	71	" As I was saying , "
27335	27419	27333	27333	Edmund	71	" we need n't go that way . Why should n't we row a little south till we come to Glasswater Creek and row up it ? That brings us up behind the Hill of the Stone Table , and we 'll be safe while we 're at sea . If we start at once , we can be at the head of Glasswater before dark , get a few hours ' sleep , and be with Caspian pretty early to - morrow . "
27420	27431	27433	27433	Trumpkin	121	" What a thing it is to know the coast , "
27435	27444	27433	27433	Trumpkin	121	" None of us know anything about Glasswater . "
27445	27450	27452	27452	Susan	70	" What about food ? "
27454	27465	27467	27467	Lucy	72	" Oh , we 'll have to do with apples , "
27469	27491	27467	27467	Lucy	72	" Do let 's get on . We 've done nothing yet , and we 've been here nearly two days . "
27492	27511	27513	27513	Edmund	71	" And anyway , no one 's going to have my hat for a fish - basket again , "
27595	27602	27604	27604	Peter	69	" The D.L.F. had better steer , "
27606	27683	27604	27604	Peter	69	" and Ed and I will take an oar each . Half a moment , though . We 'd better take off our mail : we 're going to be pretty warm before we 're done . The girls had better be in the bows and shout directions to the D.L.F. because he does n't know the way . You 'd better get us a fair way out to sea till we 've passed the island . "
27846	27853	27855	27855	Lucy	72	" It 's like old times , "
27857	27878	27855	27855	Lucy	72	" Do you remember our voyage to Terebinthia — and Galma — and Seven Isles — and the Lone Islands ? "
27879	27882	27884	27884	Susan	70	" Yes , "
27886	27916	27884	27884	Susan	70	" and our great ship the Splendour Hyaline , with the swan 's head at her prow and the carved swan 's wings coming back almost to her waist ? "
27917	27929	27855	27855	Lucy	72	" And the silken sails , and the great stern lanterns ? "
27930	27941	27884	27884	Susan	70	" And the feasts on the poop and the musicians . "
27942	27968	27855	27855	Lucy	72	" Do you remember when we had the musicians up in the rigging playing flutes so that it sounded like music out of the sky ? "
28029	28038	28040	28040	Peter	69	" Phew ! This is pretty gruelling work , "
28042	28051	28053	28053	Lucy	72	" Ca n't I row for a bit ? "
28055	28064	28066	28066	Peter	69	" The oars are too big for you , "
28547	28552	28553	28553	she	72	" Dear old Leopard , "
28643	28648	28650	28650	Lucy	72	" This is lovely , "
28937	28946	28948	28948	Lucy	72	" Oh , Trees , Trees , Trees , "
28962	28996	28948	28948	Lucy	72	" Oh , Trees , wake , wake , wake . Do n't you remember it ? Do n't you remember me ? Dryads and Hamadryads , come out , come to me . "
29226	29233	29235	29235	Trumpkin	121	" Apples , heigh - ho , "
29241	29256	29235	29235	Trumpkin	121	" I must say you ancient kings and queens do n't overfeed your courtiers ! "
29285	29296	29298	29299	the Dwarf	1552	" I suppose your Majesties know the way all right ? "
29301	29306	29308	29308	Susan	70	" I do n't , "
29310	29338	29308	29308	Susan	70	" I 've never seen these woods in my life before . In fact I thought all along that we ought to have gone by the river . "
29339	29352	29354	29354	Peter	69	" Then I think you might have said so at the time , "
29360	29371	29373	29373	Edmund	71	" Oh , do n't take any notice of her , "
29375	29439	29373	29373	Edmund	71	" She always is a wet blanket . You 've got that pocket compass of yours , Peter , have n't you ? Well , then , we 're as right as rain . We 've only got to keep on going north - west — cross that little river , the what - do - you - call - it?—the Rush — — "
29440	29444	29446	29446	Peter	69	" I know , "
29448	29473	29446	29446	Peter	69	" The one that joins the big river at the Fords of Beruna , or Beruna 's Bridge , as the D.L.F. calls it . "
29474	29518	29373	29373	Edmund	71	" That 's right . Cross it and strike uphill , and we 'll be at the Stone Table ( Aslan 's How , I mean ) by eight or nine o'clock . I hope King Caspian will give us a good breakfast ! "
29519	29526	29528	29528	Susan	70	" I hope you 're right , "
29530	29540	29528	29528	Susan	70	" I ca n't remember all that at all . "
29541	29549	29551	29551	Edmund	71	" That 's the worst of girls , "
29558	29569	29551	29551	Edmund	71	" They never can carry a map in their heads . "
29570	29581	29583	29583	Lucy	72	" That 's because our heads have something inside them , "
29730	29733	29726	29726	Trumpkin	121	" Stop . "
29738	29745	29746	29746	he	121	" There 's something following us , "
29753	29769	29746	29746	he	121	" Or rather , something keeping up with us : over there on the left . "
29785	29799	29801	29801	Susan	70	" You and I 'd better each have an arrow on the string , "
29935	29947	29949	29949	Peter	69	" The D.L.F. beat you in that shooting match , Su , "
29966	29975	29977	29977	Susan	70	" I — I left it too late , "
29984	30007	29977	29977	Susan	70	" I was so afraid it might be , you know — one of our kind of bears , a talking bear . "
30013	30021	30023	30023	Trumpkin	121	" That 's the trouble of it , "
30025	30061	30023	30023	Trumpkin	121	" when most of the beasts have gone enemy and gone dumb , but there are still some of the other kind left . You never know , and you dare n't wait to see . "
30062	30067	30069	30069	Susan	70	" Poor old Bruin , "
30071	30079	30069	30069	Susan	70	" You do n't think he was ? "
30080	30084	30086	30087	the Dwarf	1552	" Not he , "
30089	30199	30086	30087	the Dwarf	1552	" I saw the face and I heard the snarl . He only wanted Little Girl for his breakfast . And talking of breakfast , I did n't want to discourage your Majesties when you said you hoped King Caspian would give you a good one : but meat 's precious scarce in camp . And there 's good eating on a bear . It would be a shame to leave the carcass without taking a bit , and it wo n't delay us more than half an hour . I dare say you two youngsters — Kings , I should say — know how to skin a bear ? "
30200	30212	30214	30214	Susan	70	" Let 's go and sit down a fair way off , "
30218	30230	30231	30231	Lucy	72	" I know what a horrid messy business that will be . "
30244	30257	30241	30241	she	70	" Such a horrible idea has come into my head , Su . "
30258	30263	30086	30087	the Dwarf	1552	" What 's that ? "
30264	30309	30241	30241	she	70	" Would n't it be dreadful if some day , in our own world , at home , men started going wild inside , like the animals here , and still looked like men , so that you 'd never know which were which ? "
30310	30324	30326	30328	the practical Susan	70	" We 've got enough to bother about here and now in Narnia , "
30330	30337	30326	30328	the practical Susan	70	" without imagining things like that . "
30498	30506	30508	30508	Edmund	71	" I suppose we are going right ? "
30514	30537	30539	30539	Peter	69	" I do n't see how we can go wrong as long as we do n't bear too much to the left , "
30541	30575	30539	30539	Peter	69	" If we bear too much to the right , the worst that can happen is wasting a little time by striking the Great River too soon and not cutting off the corner . "
30598	30607	30609	30609	Edmund	71	" Where 's this bally Rush got to ? "
30615	30627	30629	30629	Peter	69	" I certainly thought we 'd have struck it by now , "
30631	30642	30629	30629	Peter	69	" But there 's nothing to do but keep on . "
30677	30682	30684	30684	Peter	69	" What on earth ? "
30744	30749	30751	30751	Peter	69	" I 'm sorry , "
30753	30778	30751	30751	Peter	69	" It 's my fault for coming this way . We 're lost . I 've never seen this place in my life before . "
30789	30803	30805	30805	Susan	70	" Oh , do let 's go back and go the other way , "
30807	30820	30805	30805	Susan	70	" I knew all along we 'd get lost in these woods . "
30821	30824	30826	30826	Lucy	72	" Susan ! "
30830	30852	30826	30826	Lucy	72	" do n't nag at Peter like that . It 's so rotten , and he 's doing all he can . "
30853	30866	30868	30868	Edmund	71	" And do n't you snap at Su like that , either , "
30870	30878	30868	30868	Edmund	71	" I think she 's quite right . "
30879	30884	30886	30886	Trumpkin	121	" Tubs and tortoiseshells ! "
30888	30951	30886	30886	Trumpkin	121	" If we 've got lost coming , what chance have we of finding our way back ? And if we 're to go back to the Island and begin all over again — even supposing we could — we might as well give the whole thing up . Miraz will have finished with Caspian before we get there at that rate . "
30952	30961	30963	30963	Lucy	72	" You think we ought to go on ? "
30965	30976	30978	30978	Trumpkin	121	" I 'm not sure the High King is lost , "
30980	30991	30978	30978	Trumpkin	121	" What 's to hinder this river being the Rush ? "
30992	31002	31004	31004	Peter	69	" Because the Rush is not in a gorge , "
31013	31019	31021	31022	the Dwarf	1552	" Your Majesty says is , "
31024	31112	31021	31022	the Dwarf	1552	" but ought n't you to say was ? You knew this country hundreds — it may be a thousand — years ago . May n't it have changed ? A landslide might have pulled off half the side of that hill , leaving bare rock , and there are your precipices beyond the gorge . Then the Rush might go on deepening its course year after year till you get the little precipices this side . Or there might have been an earthquake , or anything . "
31113	31120	31122	31122	Peter	69	" I never thought of that , "
31124	31128	31130	31130	Trumpkin	121	" And anyway , "
31132	31218	31130	31130	Trumpkin	121	" even if this is not the Rush , it 's flowing roughly north and so it must fall into the Great River anyway . I think I passed something that might have been it , on my way down . So if we go down - stream , to our right , we 'll hit the Great River . Perhaps not so high as we 'd hoped , but at least we 'll be no worse off than if you 'd come my way . "
31219	31227	31229	31229	Peter	69	" Trumpkin , you 're a brick , "
31231	31244	31229	31229	Peter	69	" Come on , then . Down this side of the gorge . "
31245	31252	31254	31254	Lucy	72	" Look ! Look ! Look ! "
31256	31261	31263	31263	everyone	230	" Where ? What ? "
31265	31269	31271	31271	Lucy	72	" The Lion , "
31273	31282	31271	31271	Lucy	72	" Aslan himself . Did n't you see ? "
31293	31300	31302	31302	Peter	69	" Do you really mean — — "
31304	31313	31315	31315	Susan	70	" Where did you think you saw him ? "
31317	31327	31329	31329	Lucy	72	" Do n't talk like a grown - up , "
31335	31348	31332	31332	her	72	" I did n't think I saw him . I saw him . "
31349	31354	31356	31356	Peter	69	" Where , Lu ? "
31358	31405	31332	31332	her	72	" Right up there between those mountain ashes . No , this side of the gorge . And up , not down . Just the opposite of the way you want to go . And he wanted us to go where he was — up there . "
31406	31417	31419	31419	Edmund	71	" How do you know that was what he wanted ? "
31421	31430	31432	31432	Lucy	72	" He — I — I just know , "
31434	31439	31432	31432	Lucy	72	" by his face . "
31451	31461	31464	31464	Trumpkin	121	" Her Majesty may well have seen a lion , "
31466	31502	31464	31464	Trumpkin	121	" There are lions in these woods , I 've been told . But it need n't have been a friendly and talking lion any more than the bear was a friendly and talking bear . "
31503	31512	31514	31514	Lucy	72	" Oh , do n't be so stupid , "
31516	31530	31514	31514	Lucy	72	" Do you think I do n't know Aslan when I see him ? "
31531	31542	31544	31544	Trumpkin	121	" He 'd be a pretty elderly lion by now , "
31546	31583	31544	31544	Trumpkin	121	" if he 's one you knew when you were here before ! And if it could be the same one , what 's to prevent him having gone wild and witless like so many others ? "
31608	31681	31598	31598	Peter	69	" The D.L.F. does n't understand . How could he ? You must just take it , Trumpkin , that we do really know about Aslan ; a little bit about him , I mean . And you must n't talk about him like that again . It is n't lucky for one thing : and it 's all nonsense for another . The only question is whether Aslan was really there . "
31682	31689	31691	31691	Lucy	72	" But I know he was , "
31699	31712	31714	31714	Peter	69	" Yes , Lu , but we do n't , you see , "
31716	31726	31728	31728	Edmund	71	" There 's nothing for it but a vote , "
31730	31734	31736	31736	Peter	69	" All right , "
31738	31755	31736	31736	Peter	69	" You 're the eldest , D.L.F. What do you vote for ? Up or down ? "
31756	31759	31761	31762	the Dwarf	1552	" Down , "
31764	31848	31761	31762	the Dwarf	1552	" I know nothing about Aslan . But I do know that if we turn left and follow the gorge up , it might lead us all day before we found a place where we could cross it . Whereas if we turn right and go down , we 're bound to reach the Great River in about a couple of hours . And if there are any real lions about , we want to go away from them , not towards them . "
31849	31857	31736	31736	Peter	69	" What do you say , Susan ? "
31858	31866	31868	31868	Susan	70	" Do n't be angry , Lu , "
31870	31912	31868	31868	Susan	70	" but I do think we should go down . I 'm dead tired . Do let 's get out of this wretched wood into the open as quick as we can . And none of us except you saw anything . "
31913	31916	31918	31918	Peter	69	" Edmund ? "
31920	31928	31930	31930	Edmund	71	" Well , there 's just this , "
31940	32010	31930	31930	Edmund	71	" When we first discovered Narnia a year ago — or a thousand years ago , whichever it is — it was Lucy who discovered it first and none of us would believe her . I was the worst of the lot , I know . Yet she was right after all . Would n't it be fair to believe her this time ? I vote for going up . "
32011	32016	32018	32018	Lucy	72	" Oh , Ed ! "
32024	32034	32036	32036	Susan	70	" And now it 's your turn , Peter , "
32038	32045	32036	32036	Susan	70	" and I do hope — — "
32046	32060	32062	32062	Peter	69	" Oh , shut up , shut up and let a chap think , "
32064	32074	32062	32062	Peter	69	" I 'd much rather not have to vote . "
32075	32082	32084	32084	Trumpkin	121	" You 're the High King , "
32087	32090	32092	32092	Peter	69	" Down , "
32098	32123	32092	32092	Peter	69	" I know Lucy may be right after all , but I ca n't help it . We must do one or the other . "
32795	32809	32792	32792	she	70	" to get on and finish it and get out of these beastly woods "
32941	32945	32947	32947	Susan	70	" At last ! "
32949	32954	32956	32956	Peter	69	" Oh , hurray ! "
33044	33048	33050	33050	Edmund	71	" By Jove , "
33052	33065	33050	33050	Edmund	71	" We fought the Battle of Beruna just where that town is ! "
33251	33254	33248	33248	Trumpkin	121	" Down , "
33336	33346	33348	33348	Trumpkin	121	" Quick ! Quick ! Get back ! Crawl ! "
33498	33505	33507	33507	Trumpkin	121	" So that 's all right , "
33514	33551	33507	33507	Trumpkin	121	" They 're not searching the wood . Only sentries , I expect . But it means that Miraz has an outpost down there . Bottles and battledores ! though , it was a near thing . "
33552	33568	33570	33570	Peter	69	" I ought to have my head smacked for bringing us this way at all , "
33572	33580	33582	33583	the Dwarf	1552	" On the contrary , your Majesty , "
33585	33609	33582	33583	the Dwarf	1552	" For one thing it was n't you , it was your royal brother , Edmund , who first suggested going by Glasswater . "
33610	33619	33621	33621	Edmund	71	" I 'm afraid the D.L.F. 's right , "
33636	33641	33643	33643	Trumpkin	121	" And for another , "
33645	33689	33643	33643	Trumpkin	121	" if we 'd gone my way , we 'd have walked straight into that new outpost , most likely ; or at least had just the same trouble avoiding it . I think this Glasswater route has turned out for the best . "
33690	33696	33698	33698	Susan	70	" A blessing in disguise , "
33700	33704	33706	33706	Edmund	71	" Some disguise ! "
33708	33723	33725	33725	Lucy	72	" I suppose we 'll have to go right up the gorge again now , "
33727	33735	33737	33737	Peter	69	" Lu , you 're a hero , "
33739	33762	33737	33737	Peter	69	" That 's the nearest you 've got to - day to saying I told you so . Let 's get on . "
33763	33776	33778	33778	Trumpkin	121	" And as soon as we 're well up into the forest , "
33780	33805	33778	33778	Trumpkin	121	" whatever anyone says , I 'm going to light a fire and cook supper . But we must get well away from here . "
34264	34267	34274	34275	her father	985	" Lucy , "
34372	34382	34383	34383	she	72	" Why , I do believe they 're moving , "
34389	34395	34383	34383	she	72	" They 're walking about . "
34543	34548	34550	34550	Lucy	72	" And I suppose , "
34552	34568	34550	34550	Lucy	72	" when trees dance , it must be a very , very country dance indeed . "
34774	34783	34785	34785	Lucy	72	" They are almost awake , not quite , "
35065	35073	35075	35075	Lucy	72	" Aslan , Aslan . Dear Aslan , "
35077	35081	35075	35075	Lucy	72	" At last . "
35134	35139	35140	35140	he	1007	" Welcome , child , "
35143	35146	35148	35148	Lucy	72	" Aslan , "
35150	35155	35148	35148	Lucy	72	" you 're bigger . "
35156	35167	35169	35169	he	1007	" That is because you are older , little one , "
35171	35177	35148	35148	Lucy	72	" Not because you are ? "
35178	35195	35148	35148	Lucy	72	" I am not . But every year you grow , you will find me bigger . "
35215	35218	35219	35219	he	1007	" Lucy , "
35222	35247	35219	35219	he	1007	" we must not lie here for long . You have work in hand , and much time has been lost to - day . "
35248	35257	35259	35259	Lucy	72	" Yes , was n't it a shame ? "
35261	35280	35259	35259	Lucy	72	" I saw you all right . They would n't believe me . They 're all so — — "
35297	35302	35304	35304	Lucy	72	" I 'm sorry , "
35313	35335	35304	35304	Lucy	72	" I did n't mean to start slanging the others . But it was n't my fault anyway , was it ? "
35344	35349	35351	35351	Lucy	72	" Oh , Aslan , "
35353	35427	35351	35351	Lucy	72	" You do n't mean it was ? How could I — I could n't have left the others and come up to you alone , how could I ? Do n't look at me like that ... oh well , I suppose I could . Yes , and it would n't have been alone , I know , not if I was with you . But what would have been the good ? "
35432	35436	35438	35438	Lucy	72	" You mean , "
35442	35467	35438	35438	Lucy	72	" that it would have turned out all right — somehow ? But how ? Please , Aslan ! Am I not to know ? "
35468	35478	35480	35480	Aslan	95	" To know what would have happened , child ? "
35482	35491	35480	35480	Aslan	95	" No . Nobody is ever told that . "
35492	35496	35498	35498	Lucy	72	" Oh dear , "
35500	35510	35512	35512	Aslan	95	" But anyone can find out what will happen , "
35514	35564	35512	35512	Aslan	95	" If you go back to the others now , and wake them up ; and tell them you have seen me again ; and that you must all get up at once and follow me — what will happen ? There is only one way of finding out . "
35565	35578	35580	35580	Lucy	72	" Do you mean that is what you want me to do ? "
35582	35588	35590	35590	Aslan	95	" Yes , little one , "
35592	35600	35602	35602	Lucy	72	" Will the others see you too ? "
35604	35610	35612	35612	Aslan	95	" Certainly not at first , "
35614	35621	35612	35612	Aslan	95	" Later on , it depends . "
35622	35630	35632	35632	Lucy	72	" But they wo n't believe me ! "
35634	35640	35642	35642	Aslan	95	" It does n't matter , "
35644	35651	35653	35653	Lucy	72	" Oh dear , oh dear , "
35655	35703	35653	35653	Lucy	72	" And I was so pleased at finding you again . And I thought you 'd let me stay . And I thought you 'd come roaring in and frighten all the enemies away — like last time . And now everything is going to be horrid . "
35704	35714	35716	35716	Aslan	95	" It is hard for you , little one , "
35718	35740	35716	35716	Aslan	95	" But things never happen the same way twice . It has been hard for us all in Narnia before now . "
35780	35787	35788	35788	she	72	" I 'm sorry , Aslan , "
35791	35797	35788	35788	she	72	" I 'm ready now . "
35798	35805	35807	35807	Aslan	95	" Now you are a lioness , "
35809	35828	35807	35807	Aslan	95	" And now all Narnia will be renewed . But come . We have no time to lose . "
35935	35940	35942	35942	Aslan	95	" Now , child , "
35953	35984	35942	35942	Aslan	95	" I will wait here . Go and wake the others and tell them to follow . If they will not , then you at least must follow me alone . "
36029	36043	36045	36045	Lucy	72	" I must n't think about it , I must just do it , "
36056	36059	36060	36060	she	72	" Peter , "
36066	36087	36060	36060	she	72	" wake up . Quick . Aslan is here . He says we 've got to follow him at once . "
36088	36097	36099	36099	Peter	69	" Certainly , Lu . Whatever you like , "
36147	36160	36139	36139	her	70	" You 've been dreaming , Lucy . Go to sleep again . "
36190	36193	36194	36194	he	71	" Eh ? "
36201	36208	36194	36194	he	71	" What are you talking about ? "
36239	36242	36244	36244	Edmund	71	" Aslan ! "
36249	36254	36244	36244	Edmund	71	" Hurray ! Where ? "
36274	36277	36278	36278	she	72	" There , "
36283	36286	36288	36288	Edmund	71	" Where ? "
36291	36308	36255	36255	Lucy	72	" There . There . Do n't you see ? Just this side of the trees . "
36319	36368	36309	36309	Edmund	71	" No . There 's nothing there . You 've got dazzled and muddled with the moonlight . One does , you know . I thought I saw something for a moment myself . It 's only an optical what - do - you - call - it . "
36369	36378	36380	36380	Lucy	72	" I can see him all the time , "
36382	36390	36380	36380	Lucy	72	" He 's looking straight at us . "
36391	36400	36309	36309	Edmund	71	" Then why ca n't I see him ? "
36401	36411	36380	36380	Lucy	72	" He said you might n't be able to . "
36412	36415	36309	36309	Edmund	71	" Why ? "
36416	36428	36380	36380	Lucy	72	" I do n't know . That 's what he said . "
36429	36436	36438	36438	Edmund	71	" Oh , bother it all , "
36440	36463	36438	36438	Edmund	71	" I do wish you would n't keep on seeing things . But I suppose we 'll have to wake the others . "
36496	36503	36505	36505	Peter	69	" I ca n't see anything , "
36514	36520	36505	36505	Peter	69	" Can you , Susan ? "
36521	36530	36532	36532	Susan	70	" No , of course I ca n't , "
36534	36558	36532	36532	Susan	70	" Because there is n't anything to see . She 's been dreaming . Do lie down and go to sleep , Lucy . "
36559	36565	36567	36567	Lucy	72	" And I do hope , "
36573	36599	36567	36567	Lucy	72	" that you will all come with me . Because — because I 'll have to go with him whether anyone else does or not . "
36600	36608	36610	36610	Susan	70	" Do n't talk nonsense , Lucy , "
36612	36637	36610	36610	Susan	70	" Of course you ca n't go off on your own . Do n't let her , Peter . She 's being downright naughty . "
36638	36650	36652	36652	Edmund	71	" I 'll go with her , if she must go , "
36654	36661	36652	36652	Edmund	71	" She 's been right before . "
36662	36668	36670	36670	Peter	69	" I know she has , "
36672	36728	36670	36670	Peter	69	" And she may have been right this morning . We certainly had no luck going down the gorge . Still — at this hour of the night . And why should Aslan be invisible to us ? He never used to be . It 's not like him . What does the D.L.F. say ? "
36729	36738	36740	36741	the Dwarf	1552	" Oh , I say nothing at all , "
36743	36872	36740	36741	the Dwarf	1552	" If you all go , of course , I 'll go with you ; and if your party splits up , I 'll go with the High King . That 's my duty to him and King Caspian . But , if you ask my private opinion , I 'm a plain dwarf who does n't think there 's much chance of finding a road by night where you could n't find one by day . And I have no use for magic lions which are talking lions and do n't talk , and friendly lions though they do n't do us any good , and whopping big lions though nobody can see them . It 's all bilge and beanstalks as far as I can see . "
36873	36887	36889	36889	Lucy	72	" He 's beating his paw on the ground for us to hurry , "
36891	36902	36889	36889	Lucy	72	" We must go now . At least I must . "
36903	36930	36932	36932	Susan	70	" You 've no right to try to force the rest of us like that . It 's four to one and you 're the youngest , "
36934	36940	36942	36942	Edmund	71	" Oh , come on , "
36944	36960	36942	36942	Edmund	71	" We 've got to go . There 'll be no peace till we do . "
36993	37000	37002	37002	Peter	69	" On the march , then , "
37083	37091	37092	37092	she	70	" Supposing I started behaving like Lucy , "
37095	37119	37092	37092	she	70	" I might threaten to stay here whether the rest of you went on or not . I jolly well think I shall . "
37120	37129	37131	37131	Trumpkin	121	" Obey the High King , your Majesty , "
37133	37160	37131	37131	Trumpkin	121	" and let 's be off . If I 'm not to be allowed to sleep , I 'd as soon march as stand here talking . "
37301	37308	37310	37310	Trumpkin	121	" Cobbles and kettle - drums ! "
37312	37330	37310	37310	Trumpkin	121	" I hope this madness is n't going to end in a moonlight climb and broken necks . "
37474	37501	37470	37471	the others	271	" Hi ! Lucy ! Look out , for goodness ' sake . You 're right on the edge of the gorge . Come back — — "
37514	37527	37509	37509	Edmund	71	" No , she 's right . There is a way down . "
37540	37543	37544	37544	he	71	" Look ! "
37550	37564	37544	37544	he	71	" Look ! What 's that shadow crawling down in front of us ? "
37565	37571	37573	37573	Lucy	72	" It 's his shadow , "
37575	37585	37587	37587	Edmund	71	" I do believe you 're right , Lu , "
37589	37607	37587	37587	Edmund	71	" I ca n't think how I did n't see it before . But where is he ? "
37608	37622	37675	37675	Peter	69	" With his shadow , of course . Ca n't you see him ? "
37623	37643	37587	37587	Edmund	71	" Well , I almost thought I did — for a moment . It 's such a rum light . "
37644	37653	37655	37655	Trumpkin	121	" Get on , Edmund , get on , "
37680	37707	37675	37675	Peter	69	" Oh , buck up , Susan . Give me your hand . Why , a baby could get down here . And do stop grousing . "
37780	37785	37786	37786	he	71	" Oh , Aslan ! "
37811	37816	37818	37818	Edmund	71	" Peter , Peter , "
37820	37825	37818	37818	Edmund	71	" Did you see ? "
37826	37831	37833	37833	Peter	69	" I saw something , "
37835	37868	37833	37833	Peter	69	" But it 's so tricky in this moonlight . On we go , though , and three cheers for Lucy . I do n't feel half so tired now , either . "
38115	38118	38120	38120	Susan	70	" Lucy , "
38127	38130	38132	38132	Lucy	72	" Yes ? "
38134	38144	38097	38098	the others	271	" I see him now . I 'm sorry . "
38145	38151	38120	38120	Susan	70	" That 's all right . "
38152	38256	38097	38098	the others	271	" But I 've been far worse than you know . I really believed it was him — he , I mean — yesterday . When he warned us not to go down to the fir wood . And I really believed it was him to - night , when you woke us up . I mean , deep down inside . Or I could have , if I 'd let myself . But I just wanted to get out of the woods and — and — oh , I do n't know . And what ever am I to say to him ? "
38257	38267	38269	38269	Lucy	72	" Perhaps you wo n't need to say much , "
38302	38312	38314	38314	Trumpkin	121	" Our side do n't keep very good watch , "
38316	38327	38314	38314	Trumpkin	121	" We ought to have been challenged before now — — "
38328	38331	38333	38335	the other four	1047	" Hush ! "
38392	38397	38399	38399	Peter	69	" Oh , Aslan , "
38416	38443	38399	38399	Peter	69	" I 'm so glad . And I 'm so sorry . I 've been leading them wrong ever since we started and especially yesterday morning . "
38444	38449	38451	38451	Aslan	95	" My dear son , "
38460	38464	38466	38466	his	95	" Well done , "
38481	38484	38476	38478	the deep voice	1052	" Susan . "
38497	38506	38508	38508	Aslan	95	" You have listened to fears , child , "
38510	38527	38508	38508	Aslan	95	" Come , let me breathe on you . Forget them . Are you brave again ? "
38528	38534	38536	38536	Susan	70	" A little , Aslan , "
38538	38542	38544	38544	Aslan	95	" And now ! "
38567	38598	38561	38561	his	95	" And now , where is this little Dwarf , this famous swordsman and archer , who does n't believe in lions ? Come here , son of Earth , come HERE!"—and
38616	38621	38623	38623	Trumpkin	121	" Wraiths and wreckage ! "
38822	38832	38834	38834	Aslan	95	" Son of Earth , shall we be friends ? "
38836	38845	38847	38848	the Dwarf	1552	" Ye — he — he — hes , "
38860	38863	38865	38865	Aslan	95	" Now , "
38867	38915	38865	38865	Aslan	95	" The Moon is setting . Look behind you : there is the dawn beginning . We have no time to lose . You three , you sons of Adam and son of Earth , hasten into the Mound and deal with what you will find there . "
39429	39434	39436	39436	their	1086	" Aslan , Aslan ! "
39552	39565	39541	39541	Edmund	71	" There 's a chap who might do anything — absolutely anything . "
39624	39637	39618	39619	every body	1109	" Euan , euan , eu - oi - oi - oi . "
39638	39646	39648	39649	the youth	1110	" Is it a Romp , Aslan ? "
39745	39752	39756	39756	his	311	" Refreshments ! Time for refreshments , "
39907	39912	39914	39916	the old man	520	" Refreshments ! Refreshments , "
40101	40113	40093	40093	Lucy	72	" I say , Su , I know who they are . "
40114	40117	40099	40099	Susan	70	" Who ? "
40118	40150	40093	40093	Lucy	72	" The boy with the wild face is Bacchus and the old one on the donkey is Silenus . Do n't you remember Mr Tumnus telling us about them long ago ? "
40151	40164	40099	40099	Susan	70	" Yes , of course . But I say , Lu — — "
40165	40168	40093	40093	Lucy	72	" What ? "
40169	40192	40099	40099	Susan	70	" I would n't have felt very safe with Bacchus and all his wild girls if we 'd met them without Aslan . "
40193	40199	40201	40201	Lucy	72	" I should think not , "
40256	40261	40226	40228	two sentinel badgers	1132	" Who goes there ? "
40262	40265	40267	40268	the Dwarf	1552	" Trumpkin , "
40270	40283	40267	40268	the Dwarf	1552	" Bringing the High King of Narnia out of the far past . "
40293	40297	40298	40298	they	1134	" At last , "
40301	40305	40298	40298	they	1134	" At last . "
40306	40314	40316	40316	Trumpkin	121	" Give us a light , friends , "
40337	40344	40345	40345	he	69	" The D.L.F. had better lead , "
40348	40359	40345	40345	he	69	" We do n't know our way about this place . "
40428	40434	40436	40436	Edmund	71	" I say , Peter , "
40438	40473	40436	40436	Edmund	71	" Look at those carvings on the walls . Do n't they look old ? And yet we 're older than that . When we were last here , they had n't been made . "
40474	40477	40479	40479	Peter	69	" Yes , "
40481	40487	40479	40479	Peter	69	" That makes one think . "
40582	40591	40593	40593	Trumpkin	121	" Do n't like the sound of that , "
40597	40605	40593	40593	Trumpkin	121	" Let 's listen for a moment . "
40618	40624	40637	40637	Trumpkin	121	" You know well enough , "
40629	40635	40637	40637	Trumpkin	121	" That 's the King , "
40640	40693	40637	40637	Trumpkin	121	" why the Horn was not blown at sunrise that morning . Have you forgotten that Miraz fell upon us almost before Trumpkin had gone , and we were fighting for our lives for the space of three hours and more ? I blew it when first I had a breathing space . "
40694	40703	40705	40707	the angry voice	1148	" I 'm not likely to forget it , "
40709	40727	40705	40707	the angry voice	1148	" when my Dwarfs bore the brunt of the attack and one in five of them fell . "
40729	40734	40736	40736	Trumpkin	121	" That 's Nikabrik , "
40739	40745	40757	40757	Trumpkin	121	" For shame , Dwarf , "
40751	40755	40757	40757	Trumpkin	121	" Trufflehunter 's , "
40760	40776	40757	40757	Trumpkin	121	" We all did as much as the Dwarfs and none more than the King . "
40777	40789	40791	40791	Nikabrik	118	" Tell that tale your own way for all I care , "
40793	40855	40791	40791	Nikabrik	118	" But whether it was that the Horn was blown too late , or whether there was no magic in it , no help has come . You , you great clerk , you master magician , you know - all ; are you still asking us to hang our hopes on Aslan and Peter and all the rest of it ? "
40856	40879	40894	40894	Trumpkin	121	" I must confess — I can not deny it — that I am deeply disappointed in the result of the operation , "
40885	40892	40894	40894	Trumpkin	121	" That 'll be Doctor Cornelius , "
40897	40902	40904	40904	Nikabrik	118	" To speak plainly , "
40906	40938	40904	40904	Nikabrik	118	" your wallet 's empty , your eggs addled , your fish uncaught , your promises broken . Stand aside then and let others work . And that is why — — "
40939	40945	40947	40947	Trufflehunter	119	" The help will come , "
40949	40976	40947	40947	Trufflehunter	119	" I stand by Aslan . Have patience , like us beasts . The help will come . It may be even now at the door . "
40977	40980	40982	40982	Nikabrik	118	" Pah ! "
40984	41032	40982	40982	Nikabrik	118	" You badgers would have us wait till the sky falls and we can all catch larks . I tell you we ca n't wait . Food is running short ; we lose more than we can afford at every encounter ; our followers are slipping away . "
41033	41037	41039	41039	Trufflehunter	119	" And why ? "
41041	41128	41039	41039	Trufflehunter	119	" I 'll tell you why . Because it is noised among them that we have called on the Kings of old and the Kings of old have not answered . The last words Trumpkin spoke before he went ( and went , most likely , to his death ) were , ' If you must blow the Horn , do not let the army know why you blow it or what you hope from it . ' But that same evening everyone seemed to know . "
41129	41154	41156	41156	Nikabrik	118	" You 'd better have shoved your grey snout in a hornets ' nest , Badger , than suggest that I am the blab , "
41158	41166	41156	41156	Nikabrik	118	" Take it back , or — — "
41167	41177	41179	41180	King Caspian	87	" Oh , stop it , both of you , "
41182	41232	41179	41180	King Caspian	87	" I want to know what it is that Nikabrik keeps on hinting we should do . But before that , I want to know who those two strangers are whom he has brought into our council and who stand there with their ears open and their mouths shut . "
41233	41240	41242	41242	Nikabrik	118	" They are friends of mine , "
41244	41306	41242	41242	Nikabrik	118	" And what better right have you yourself to be here than that you are a friend of Trumpkin 's and the Badger 's ? And what right has that old dotard in the black gown to be here except that he is your friend ? Why am I to be the only one who ca n't bring in his friends ? "
41307	41320	41322	41322	Trufflehunter	119	" His Majesty is the King to whom you have sworn allegiance , "
41325	41332	41334	41334	Nikabrik	118	" Court manners , court manners , "
41336	41381	41334	41334	Nikabrik	118	" But in this hole we may talk plainly . You know — and he knows — that this Telmarine boy will be king of nowhere and nobody in a week unless we can help him out of the trap in which he sits . "
41382	41385	41387	41387	Cornelius	96	" Perhaps , "
41389	41409	41387	41387	Cornelius	96	" your new friends would like to speak for themselves ? You there , who and what are you ? "
41410	41415	41334	41334	Nikabrik	118	" Worshipful Master Doctor , "
41423	41546	41334	41334	Nikabrik	118	" So please you , I 'm only a poor old woman , I am , and very obliged to his Worshipful Dwarfship for his friendship , I 'm sure . His Majesty , bless his handsome face , has no need to be afraid of an old woman that 's nearly doubled up with the rheumatics and has n't two sticks to put under her kettle . I have some poor little skill — not like yours , Master Doctor , of course — in small spells and cantrips that I 'd be glad to use against our enemies if it was agreeable to all concerned . For I hate 'em . Oh yes . No one hates better than me . "
41547	41559	41561	41562	Doctor Cornelius	96	" That is all most interesting and — er — satisfactory , "
41564	41590	41561	41562	Doctor Cornelius	96	" I think I now know what you are , Madam . Perhaps your other friend , Nikabrik , would give some account of himself ? "
41604	41683	41598	41598	Peter	69	" I 'm hunger . I 'm thirst . Where I bite , I hold till I die , and even after death they must cut out my mouthful from my enemy 's body and bury it with me . I can fast a hundred years and not die . I can lie a hundred nights on the ice and not freeze . I can drink a river of blood and not burst . Show me your enemies . "
41684	41702	41704	41704	Caspian	87	" And it is in the presence of these two that you wish to disclose your plan ? "
41706	41709	41711	41711	Nikabrik	118	" Yes , "
41713	41725	41711	41711	Nikabrik	118	" And by their help that I mean to execute it . "
41764	41769	41770	41770	he	87	" Well , Nikabrik , "
41773	41780	41770	41770	he	87	" we will hear your plan . "
41825	41831	41832	41832	he	118	" All said and done , "
41835	41909	41832	41832	he	118	" none of us knows the truth about the ancient days in Narnia . Trumpkin believed none of the stories . I was ready to put them to the trial . We tried first the Horn and it has failed . If there ever was Peter and Susan and Edmund and Lucy , then either they have not heard us , or they can not come , or they are our enemies — — "
41910	41918	41921	41921	Trufflehunter	119	" Or they are on the way , "
41923	41999	41814	41814	he	118	" You can go on saying that till Miraz has fed us all to his dogs . As I was saying , we have tried one link in the chain of old legends , and it has done us no good . Well . But when your sword breaks , you draw your dagger . The stories tell of other powers beside the ancient Kings and Queens . How if we could call them up ? "
42000	42006	42008	42008	Trufflehunter	119	" If you mean Aslan , "
42010	42052	42008	42008	Trufflehunter	119	" it 's all one calling on him and on the Kings . They were his servants . If he will not send them ( but I make no doubt he will ) , is he more likely to come himself ? "
42053	42061	42063	42063	Nikabrik	118	" No . You 're right there , "
42065	42175	42063	42063	Nikabrik	118	" Aslan and the Kings go together . Either Aslan is dead , or he is not on our side . Or else something stronger than himself keeps him back . And if he did come — how do we know he 'd be our friend ? He was not always a good friend to Dwarfs by all that 's told . Not even to all beasts . Ask the Wolves . And anyway , he was in Narnia only once that I ever heard of , and he did n't stay long . You may drop Aslan out of the reckoning . I was thinking of someone else . "
42203	42209	42211	42211	Caspian	87	" Who do you mean ? "
42215	42242	42211	42211	Caspian	87	" I mean a power so much greater than Aslan 's that it held Narnia spellbound for years and years , if the stories are true . "
42243	42248	42250	42254	three voices all at once	1153	" The White Witch ! "
42271	42274	42276	42276	Nikabrik	118	" Yes , "
42282	42358	42276	42276	Nikabrik	118	" I mean the Witch . Sit down again . Do n't all take fright at a name as if you were children . We want power : and we want a power that will be on our side . As for power , do not the stories say that the Witch defeated Aslan , and bound him , and killed him on that very stone which is over there , just beyond the light ? "
42359	42371	42373	42374	the Badger	678	" But they also say that he came to life again , "
42377	42383	42385	42385	Nikabrik	118	" Yes , they say , "
42387	42452	42385	42385	Nikabrik	118	" but you 'll notice that we hear precious little about anything he did afterwards . He just fades out of the story . How do you explain that , if he really came to life ? Is n't it much more likely that he did n't , and that the stories say nothing more about him because there was nothing more to say ? "
42453	42461	42463	42463	Caspian	87	" He established the Kings and Queens , "
42465	42487	42489	42489	Nikabrik	118	" A King who has just won a great battle can usually establish himself without the help of a performing lion , "
42501	42505	42506	42506	Nikabrik	118	" And anyway , "
42509	42560	42506	42506	Nikabrik	118	" what came of the Kings and their reign ? They faded too . But it 's very different with the Witch . They say she ruled for a hundred years : a hundred years of winter . There 's power , if you like . There 's something practical . "
42561	42568	42570	42571	the King	1497	" But , heaven and earth ! "
42573	42600	42570	42571	the King	1497	" have n't we always been told that she was the worst enemy of all ? Was n't she a tyrant ten times worse than Miraz ? "
42601	42604	42606	42606	Nikabrik	118	" Perhaps , "
42612	42690	42606	42606	Nikabrik	118	" Perhaps she was for you humans , if there were any of you in those days . Perhaps she was for some of the beasts . She stamped out the Beavers , I dare say ; at least there are none of them in Narnia now . But she got on all right with us Dwarfs . I 'm a Dwarf and I stand by my own people . We 're not afraid of the Witch . "
42691	42699	42701	42701	Trufflehunter	119	" But you 've joined with us , "
42703	42720	42722	42722	Nikabrik	118	" Yes , and a lot of good it has done my people , so far , "
42724	42751	42722	42722	Nikabrik	118	" Who is sent on all the dangerous raids ? The Dwarfs . Who goes short when the rations fail ? The Dwarfs . Who — — "
42752	42758	42760	42761	the Badger	678	" Lies ! All lies ! "
42763	42767	42769	42769	Nikabrik	118	" And so , "
42779	42796	42769	42769	Nikabrik	118	" if you ca n't help my people , I 'll go to someone who can . "
42797	42805	42807	42808	the King	1497	" Is this open treason , Dwarf ? "
42810	42821	42823	42823	Nikabrik	118	" Put that sword back in its sheath , Caspian , "
42825	42867	42823	42823	Nikabrik	118	" Murder at council , eh ? Is that your game ? Do n't be fool enough to try it . Do you think I 'm afraid of you ? There 's three on my side , and three on yours . "
42868	42874	42876	42876	Trufflehunter	119	" Come on , then , "
42884	42891	42893	42894	Doctor Cornelius	96	" Stop , stop , stop , "
42896	42925	42893	42894	Doctor Cornelius	96	" You go on too fast . The Witch is dead . All the stories agree on that . What does Nikabrik mean by calling on the Witch ? "
42939	42945	42823	42823	Nikabrik	118	" Oh , is she ? "
42955	43029	43077	43078	King Caspian	87	" Oh , bless his heart , his dear little Majesty need n't mind about the White Lady — that 's what we call her — being dead . The Worshipful Master Doctor is only making game of a poor old woman like me when he says that . Sweet Master Doctor , learned Master Doctor , who ever heard of a witch that really died ? You can always get them back . "
43030	43035	43037	43039	the grey voice	1159	" Call her up , "
43041	43056	43037	43039	the grey voice	1159	" We are all ready . Draw the circle . Prepare the blue fire . "
43069	43072	43066	43066	Cornelius	96	" What ? "
43082	43118	43037	43039	the grey voice	1159	" So that is your plan , Nikabrik ! Black sorcery and the calling up of an accursed ghost . And I see who your companions are — a Hag and a Wer - Wolf ! "
43283	43291	43423	43426	someone striking a match	1165	" Are you all right , Ed ? "
43292	43299	43301	43301	Edmund	71	" I — I think so , "
43303	43317	43301	43301	Edmund	71	" I 've got that brute Nikabrik , but he 's still alive . "
43318	43325	43423	43426	someone striking a match	1165	" Weights and water - bottles ! "
43331	43350	43423	43426	someone striking a match	1165	" It 's me you 're sitting on . Get off . You 're like a young elephant . "
43351	43356	43358	43358	Edmund	71	" Sorry , D.L.F. , "
43360	43365	43358	43358	Edmund	71	" Is that better ? "
43366	43371	43373	43373	Trumpkin	121	" Ow ! No ! "
43375	43388	43373	43373	Trumpkin	121	" You 're putting your boot in my mouth . Go away . "
43389	43395	43397	43397	Peter	69	" Is King Caspian anywhere ? "
43399	43404	43358	43358	Edmund	71	" I 'm here , "
43411	43416	43358	43358	Edmund	71	" Something bit me . "
43504	43515	43517	43517	Peter	69	" We do n't seem to have any enemies left , "
43519	43527	43517	43517	Peter	69	" There 's the Hag , dead . "
43539	43602	43517	43517	Peter	69	" And Nikabrik , dead too . And I suppose this thing is a Wer - Wolf . It 's so long since I 've seen one . Wolf 's head and man 's body . That means he was just turning from man into wolf at the moment he was killed . And you , I suppose , are King Caspian ? "
43603	43606	43608	43610	the other boy	1170	" Yes , "
43612	43622	43608	43610	the other boy	1170	" But I 've no idea who you are . "
43623	43632	43634	43634	Trumpkin	121	" It 's the High King , Peter , "
43636	43643	43645	43645	Caspian	87	" Your Majesty is very welcome , "
43647	43654	43656	43656	Peter	69	" And so is your Majesty , "
43658	43678	43656	43656	Peter	69	" I have n't come to take your place , you know , but to put you into it . "
43679	43683	43692	43692	He	69	" Your Majesty , "
43738	43743	43744	43744	he	69	" Best of badgers , "
43747	43755	43744	43744	he	69	" You never doubted us all through . "
43756	43765	43767	43767	Trufflehunter	119	" No credit to me , your Majesty , "
43769	43794	43767	43767	Trufflehunter	119	" I 'm a beast and we do n't change . I 'm a badger , what 's more , and we hold on . "
43795	43802	43804	43804	Caspian	87	" I am sorry for Nikabrik , "
43806	43864	43804	43804	Caspian	87	" though he hated me from the first moment he saw me . He had gone sour inside from long suffering and hating . If we had won quickly he might have become a good Dwarf in the days of peace . I do n't know which of us killed him . I 'm glad of that . "
43865	43870	43872	43872	Peter	69	" You 're bleeding , "
43874	43881	43883	43883	Caspian	87	" Yes , I 'm bitten , "
43885	43894	43883	43883	Caspian	87	" It was that — that wolf thing . "
43913	43924	43910	43910	Trumpkin	121	" Now . Before everything else we want some breakfast . "
43925	43930	43932	43932	Peter	69	" But not here , "
43934	43937	43939	43939	Caspian	87	" No , "
43944	43956	43939	43939	Caspian	87	" And we must send someone to take away the bodies . "
43957	43967	43969	43969	Peter	69	" Let the vermin be flung into a pit , "
43971	43989	43969	43969	Peter	69	" But the Dwarf we will give to his people to be buried in their own fashion . "
44092	44095	44097	44097	Peter	69	" Now , "
44105	44175	44097	44097	Peter	69	" Aslan and the girls ( that 's Susan and Lucy , Caspian ) are somewhere close . We do n't know when he will act . In his time , no doubt , not ours . In the meantime he would like us to do what we can on our own . You say , Caspian , we are not strong enough to meet Miraz in pitched battle . "
44176	44185	44187	44187	Caspian	87	" I 'm afraid not , High King , "
44228	44234	44236	44236	Peter	69	" Very well , then , "
44238	44249	44236	44236	Peter	69	" I 'll send him a challenge to single combat . "
44259	44262	44264	44264	Caspian	87	" Please , "
44266	44280	44264	44264	Caspian	87	" could it not be me ? I want to avenge my father . "
44281	44286	44288	44288	Peter	69	" You 're wounded , "
44290	44328	44288	44288	Peter	69	" And anyway , would n't he just laugh at a challenge from you ? I mean , we have seen that you are a king and a warrior but he thinks of you as a kid . "
44329	44334	44336	44337	the Badger	678	" But , Sire , "
44353	44371	44336	44337	the Badger	678	" Will he accept a challenge even from you ? He knows he has the stronger army . "
44372	44379	44381	44381	Peter	69	" Very likely he wo n't , "
44383	44461	44381	44381	Peter	69	" but there 's always the chance . And even if he does n't , we shall spend the best part of the day sending heralds to and fro and all that . By then Aslan may have done something . And at least I can inspect the army and strengthen the position . I will send the challenge . In fact I will write it at once . Have you pen and ink , Master Doctor ? "
44462	44473	44475	44476	Doctor Cornelius	96	" A scholar is never without them , your Majesty , "
44478	44486	44488	44488	Peter	69	" Very well , I will dictate , "
44539	44542	44543	44543	he	69	" Right , "
44548	44559	44543	44543	he	69	" And now , if you are ready , Doctor ? "
44573	44650	44568	44568	Peter	69	" Peter , by the gift of Aslan , by election , by prescription , and by conquest , High King over all Kings in Narnia , Emperor of the Lone Islands and Lord of Cair Paravel , Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Lion , to Miraz , Son of Caspian the Eighth , sometime Lord Protector of Narnia and now styling himself King of Narnia , Greeting . Have you got that ? "
44651	44658	44660	44661	the Doctor	487	" Narnia , comma , greeting , "
44663	44668	44660	44661	the Doctor	487	" Yes , Sire . "
44669	44676	44678	44678	Peter	69	" Then begin a new paragraph , "
44680	44921	44678	44678	Peter	69	" For to prevent the effusion of blood , and for the avoiding all other inconveniences likely to grow from the wars now levied in our realm of Narnia , it is our pleasure to adventure our royal person on behalf of our trusty and well - beloved Caspian in clean wager of battle to prove upon your Lordship 's body that the said Caspian is lawful King under us in Narnia both by our gift and by the laws of the Telmarines , and your Lordship twice guilty of treachery both in withholding the dominion of Narnia from the said Caspian and in the most abhominable,—don't forget to spell it with an H , Doctor — bloody , and unnatural murder of your kindly lord and brother King Caspian Ninth of that name . Wherefore we most heartily provoke , challenge and defy your Lordship to the said combat and monomachy , and have sent these letters by the hand of our well beloved and royal brother Edmund , sometime King under us in Narnia , Duke of Lantern Waste and Count of the Western March , Knight of the Noble Order of the Table , to whom we have given full power of determining with your Lordship all the conditions of the said battle . Given at our lodging in Aslan 's How this XII day of the month Greenroof in the first year of Caspian Tenth of Narnia .
44922	44928	44930	44930	Peter	69	" That ought to do , "
44937	44957	44930	44930	Peter	69	" And now we must send two others with Edmund . I think the Giant ought to be one . "
44958	44970	44972	44972	Caspian	87	" He's — he 's not very clever , you know , "
44974	44979	44981	44981	Peter	69	" Of course not , "
44983	45009	44981	44981	Peter	69	" But any giant looks impressive if only he will keep quiet . And it will cheer him up . But who for the other ? "
45010	45015	45017	45017	Trumpkin	121	" Upon my word , "
45019	45036	45017	45017	Trumpkin	121	" if you want someone who can kill with looks , Reepicheep would be the best . "
45037	45047	45049	45049	Peter	69	" He would indeed , from all I hear , "
45054	45074	45049	45049	Peter	69	" If only he was n't so small . They would n't even see him till he was close ! "
45075	45081	45083	45083	Trufflehunter	119	" Send Glenstorm , Sire , "
45085	45094	45083	45083	Trufflehunter	119	" No one ever laughed at a Centaur . "
45202	45208	45210	45212	the Lord Glozelle	182	" What 's to do ? "
45214	45218	45210	45212	the Lord Glozelle	182	" An attack ? "
45219	45225	45227	45227	Sopespian	183	" A parley , rather , "
45229	45245	45227	45227	Sopespian	183	" See , they carry green branches . They are coming to surrender most likely . "
45246	45266	45268	45268	Glozelle	182	" He that is walking between the Centaur and the Giant has no look of surrender in his face , "
45270	45283	45268	45268	Glozelle	182	" Who can he be ? It is not the boy Caspian . "
45284	45288	45290	45290	Sopespian	183	" No indeed , "
45292	45344	45290	45290	Sopespian	183	" This is a fell warrior , I warrant you , wherever the rebels have got him from . He is ( in your Lordship 's private ear ) a kinglier man than ever Miraz was . And what mail he wears ! None of our smiths can make the like . "
45345	45361	45363	45363	Glozelle	182	" I 'll wager my dappled Pomely he brings a challenge , not a surrender , "
45365	45369	45371	45371	Sopespian	183	" How then ? "
45373	45401	45371	45371	Sopespian	183	" We hold the enemy in our fist here . Miraz would never be so hair - brained as to throw away his advantage on a combat . "
45402	45410	45412	45412	Glozelle	182	" He might be brought to it , "
45419	45422	45424	45424	Sopespian	183	" Softly , "
45426	45450	45424	45424	Sopespian	183	" Step a little aside here out of earshot of those sentries . Now . Have I taken your Lordship 's meaning aright ? "
45451	45460	45462	45462	Glozelle	182	" If the King undertook wager of battle , "
45464	45475	45462	45462	Glozelle	182	" why , either he would kill or be killed . "
45476	45479	45484	45484	his	183	" So , "
45487	45499	45484	45484	his	183	" And if he killed we should have won this war . "
45500	45507	45462	45462	Glozelle	182	" Certainly . And if not ? "
45508	45558	45484	45484	his	183	" Why , if not , we should be as able to win it without the King 's grace as with him . For I need not tell your Lordship that Miraz is no very great captain . And after that , we should be both victorious and kingless . "
45559	45587	45462	45462	Glozelle	182	" And it is your meaning , my Lord , that you and I could hold this land quite as conveniently without a King as with one ? "
45594	45598	45600	45600	he	182	" Not forgetting , "
45602	45640	45600	45600	he	182	" that it was we who first put him on the throne . And in all the years that he has enjoyed it , what fruits have come our way ? What gratitude has he shown us ? "
45641	45646	45648	45648	Sopespian	183	" Say no more , "
45650	45666	45648	45648	Sopespian	183	" But look — here comes one to fetch us to the King 's tent . "
45751	45754	45755	45755	he	92	" There ! "
45767	45784	45755	45755	he	92	" See what a pack of nursery tales our jackanapes of a nephew has sent us . "
45785	45792	45794	45794	Glozelle	182	" By your leave , Sire , "
45796	45830	45794	45794	Glozelle	182	" If the young warrior whom we have just seen outside is the Edmund mentioned in the writing , then I would not call him a nursery tale but a very dangerous knight . "
45831	45836	45838	45838	Miraz	92	" Edmund , pah ! "
45840	45858	45838	45838	Miraz	92	" Does your Lordship believe those old wives ' fables about Peter and Edmund and the rest ? "
45859	45868	45870	45870	Glozelle	182	" I believe my eyes , your Majesty , "
45872	45881	45883	45883	Miraz	92	" Well , this is to no purpose , "
45885	45902	45883	45883	Miraz	92	" but as touching the challenge , I suppose there is only one opinion between us ? "
45903	45912	45914	45914	Glozelle	182	" I suppose so , indeed , Sire , "
45916	45922	45924	45925	the King	1497	" And what is that ? "
45927	45934	45936	45936	Glozelle	182	" Most infallibly to refuse it , "
45938	46008	45936	45936	Glozelle	182	" For though I have never been called a coward , I must plainly say that to meet that young man in battle is more than my heart would serve me for . And if ( as is likely ) his brother , the High King , is more dangerous than he — why , on your life , my Lord King , have nothing to do with him . "
46009	46014	46016	46016	Miraz	92	" Plague on you ! "
46018	46088	46016	46016	Miraz	92	" It was not that sort of council I wanted . Do you think I am asking you if I should be afraid to meet this Peter ( if there is such a man ) ? Do you think I fear him ? I wanted your counsel on the policy of the matter ; whether we , having the advantage , should hazard it on a wager of battle . "
46089	46100	46102	46102	Glozelle	182	" To which I can only answer , your Majesty , "
46104	46125	46102	46102	Glozelle	182	" that for all reasons the challenge should be refused . There is death in the strange knight 's face . "
46126	46132	46134	46134	Miraz	92	" There you are again ! "
46140	46159	46134	46134	Miraz	92	" Are you trying to make it appear that I am as great a coward as your Lordship ? "
46160	46168	46170	46170	Glozelle	182	" Your Majesty may say your pleasure , "
46173	46183	46185	46186	the King	1497	" You talk like an old woman , Glozelle , "
46188	46197	46185	46186	the King	1497	" What say you , my Lord Sopespian ? "
46198	46206	46134	46134	Miraz	92	" Do not touch it , Sire , "
46211	46249	46134	46134	Miraz	92	" And what your Majesty says of the policy of the thing comes in very happily . It gives your Majesty excellent grounds for a refusal without any cause for questioning your Majesty 's honour or courage . "
46250	46254	46256	46256	Miraz	92	" Great Heaven ! "
46263	46295	46256	46256	Miraz	92	" Are you also bewitched to - day ? Do you think I am looking for grounds to refuse it ? You might as well call me coward to my face . "
46312	46319	46321	46321	Miraz	92	" I see what it is , "
46338	46426	46321	46321	Miraz	92	" you are as lily - livered as hares yourselves and have the effrontery to imagine my heart after the likeness of yours ! Grounds for a refusal , indeed ! Excuses for not fighting ! Are you soldiers ? Are you Telmarines ? Are you men ? And if I do refuse it ( as all good reasons of captaincy and martial policy urge me to do ) you will think , and teach others to think , I was afraid . Is it not so ? "
46427	46436	46438	46438	Glozelle	182	" No man of your Majesty 's age , "
46440	46464	46438	46438	Glozelle	182	" would be called coward by any wise soldier for refusing the combat with a great warrior in the flower of his youth . "
46465	46486	46488	46488	Miraz	92	" So I 'm to be a dotard with one foot in the grave , as well as a dastard , "
46490	46566	46488	46488	Miraz	92	" I 'll tell you what it is , my Lords . With your womanish counsels ( ever shying from the true point , which is one of policy ) you have done the very opposite of your intent . I had meant to refuse it . But I 'll accept it . Do you hear , accept it ! I 'll not be shamed because some witchcraft or treason has frozen both your bloods . "
46567	46574	46576	46576	Glozelle	182	" We beseech your Majesty — — "
46609	46622	46624	46624	Glozelle	182	" I knew he 'd do it if he were properly chafed , "
46626	46643	46624	46624	Glozelle	182	" But I 'll not forget he called me coward . It shall be paid for . "
46776	46782	46783	46783	Peter	69	" Your Majesty , please . "
46795	46803	46804	46804	he	69	" If you please , your Majesty , "
46807	46816	46804	46804	he	69	" I 'm a bear , I am . "
46817	46837	46839	46839	Peter	69	" To be sure , so you are , and a good bear too , I do n't doubt , "
46841	46844	46846	46847	the Bear	1215	" Yes , "
46849	46867	46846	46847	the Bear	1215	" But it was always a right of the bears to supply one marshal of the lists . "
46868	46874	46876	46876	Trumpkin	121	" Do n't let him , "
46880	46913	46876	46876	Trumpkin	121	" He 's a good creature , but he 'll shame us all . He 'll go to sleep and he will suck his paws . In front of the enemy too . "
46914	46921	46923	46923	Peter	69	" I ca n't help that , "
46925	46960	46923	46923	Peter	69	" Because he 's quite right . The Bears had that privilege . I ca n't imagine how it has been remembered all these years , when so many other things have been forgotten . "
46961	46967	46969	46970	the Bear	186	" Please , your Majesty , "
46972	46978	46980	46980	Peter	69	" It is your right , "
46982	47002	46980	46980	Peter	69	" And you shall be one of the marshals . But you must remember not to suck your paws . "
47003	47008	47010	47011	the Bear	186	" Of course not , "
47018	47028	47030	47030	Trumpkin	121	" Why , you 're doing it this minute ! "
47048	47051	47032	47033	The Bear	186	" Sire ! "
47061	47066	47068	47068	Peter	69	" Ah — Reepicheep ! "
47086	47089	47091	47091	Reepicheep	135	" Sire , "
47093	47168	47091	47091	Reepicheep	135	" My life is ever at your command , but my honour is my own . Sire , I have among my people the only trumpeter in your Majesty 's army . I had thought , perhaps , we might have been sent with the challenge . Sire , my people are grieved . Perhaps if it were your pleasure that I should be a marshal of the lists , it would content them . "
47229	47238	47240	47240	Peter	69	" I am afraid it would not do , "
47244	47253	47240	47240	Peter	69	" Some humans are afraid of mice — — "
47254	47262	47264	47264	Reepicheep	135	" I had observed it , Sire , "
47266	47277	47278	47278	Peter	69	" And it would not be quite fair to Miraz , "
47281	47296	47278	47278	Peter	69	" to have in sight anything that might abate the edge of his courage . "
47297	47306	47308	47309	the Mouse	134	" Your Majesty is the mirror of honour , "
47317	47368	47308	47309	the Mouse	134	" And on this matter we have but a single mind .... I thought I heard someone laughing just now . If anyone present wishes to make me the subject of his wit , I am very much at his service — with my sword — whenever he has leisure . "
47383	47413	47380	47380	Peter	69	" Giant Wimbleweather and the Bear and the Centaur Glenstorm shall be our marshals . The combat will be at two hours after noon . Dinner at noon precisely . "
47414	47418	47420	47420	Edmund	71	" I say , "
47426	47444	47420	47420	Edmund	71	" I suppose it is all right . I mean , I suppose you can beat him ? "
47445	47457	47459	47459	Peter	69	" That 's what I 'm fighting him to find out , "
47647	47660	47662	47662	Trumpkin	121	" I wish Aslan had turned up before it came to this , "
47664	47669	47671	47671	Trufflehunter	119	" So do I , "
47673	47679	47671	47671	Trufflehunter	119	" But look behind you . "
47680	47685	47687	47688	the Dwarf	1552	" Crows and crockery ! "
47697	47730	47687	47688	the Dwarf	1552	" What are they ? Huge people — beautiful people — like gods and goddesses and giants . Hundreds and thousands of them , closing in behind us . What are they ? "
47731	47741	47744	47744	Trufflehunter	119	" It 's the Dryads and Hamadryads and Silvans , "
47746	47752	47744	47744	Trufflehunter	119	" Aslan has waked them . "
47753	47756	47758	47759	the Dwarf	1552	" Humph ! "
47761	47792	47758	47759	the Dwarf	1552	" That 'll be very useful if the enemy try any treachery . But it wo n't help the High King very much if Miraz proves handier with his sword . "
47885	47896	47898	47898	Edmund	71	" Well done , Peter , oh , well done ! "
47912	47919	47921	47921	Peter	69	" Follow it up , quick ! "
47957	47968	47973	47974	the Telmarines	99	" Miraz ! Miraz ! The King ! The King ! "
47985	47993	47995	47995	Edmund	71	" Peter is taking some dreadful knocks , "
47997	48000	48002	48002	Caspian	87	" Hullo ! "
48004	48010	48002	48002	Caspian	87	" What 's happening now ? "
48011	48016	48018	48018	Edmund	71	" Both falling apart , "
48020	48054	48018	48018	Edmund	71	" A bit blown , I expect . Watch . Ah , now they 're beginning again , more scientifically this time . Circling round and round , feeling each other 's defences . "
48055	48065	48067	48068	the Doctor	487	" I 'm afraid this Miraz knows his work , "
48099	48108	48110	48111	the Doctor	487	" What was it ? What was it ? "
48113	48120	48110	48111	the Doctor	487	" My old eyes missed it . "
48121	48134	48136	48136	Caspian	87	" The High King has pricked him in the arm - pit , "
48141	48159	48136	48136	Caspian	87	" Just where the arm - hole of the hauberk let the point through . First blood . "
48160	48170	48172	48172	Edmund	71	" It 's looking ugly again now , though , "
48174	48192	48172	48172	Edmund	71	" Peter 's not using his shield properly . He must be hurt in the left arm . "
48216	48225	48227	48227	Caspian	87	" You 've seen more battles than I , "
48229	48236	48227	48227	Caspian	87	" Is there any chance now ? "
48237	48241	48243	48243	Edmund	71	" Precious little , "
48245	48257	48243	48243	Edmund	71	" I suppose he might just do it . With luck . "
48258	48270	48272	48272	Caspian	87	" Oh , why did we let it happen at all ? "
48295	48328	48292	48292	he	71	" Oh , I see . They 've both agreed to a rest . Come on , Doctor . You and I may be able to do something for the High King . "
48355	48362	48364	48364	Edmund	71	" Is your left arm wounded ? "
48366	48374	48375	48375	Peter	69	" It 's not exactly a wound , "
48378	48437	48375	48375	Peter	69	" I got the full weight of his shoulder on my shield — like a load of bricks — and the rim of the shield drove into my wrist . I do n't think it 's broken , but it might be a sprain . If you could tie it up very tight I think I could manage . "
48448	48458	48444	48444	Edmund	71	" What do you think of him , Peter ? "
48459	48462	48464	48464	Peter	69	" Tough , "
48466	48566	48464	48464	Peter	69	" Very tough . I have a chance if I can keep him on the hop till his weight and short wind come against him — in this hot sun too . To tell the truth , I have n't much chance else . Give my love to — to everyone at home , Ed , if he gets me . Here he comes into the lists again . So long , old chap . Good - bye , Doctor . And I say , Ed , say something specially nice to Trumpkin . He 's been a brick . "
48644	48647	48649	48650	the Telmarines	99	" Coward ! "
48652	48682	48649	48650	the Telmarines	99	" Why do n't you stand up to him ? Do n't you like it , eh ? Thought you 'd come to fight , not dance . Yah ! "
48683	48696	48698	48698	Caspian	87	" Oh , I do hope he wo n't listen to them , "
48700	48704	48706	48706	Edmund	71	" Not he , "
48708	48715	48706	48706	Edmund	71	" You do n't know him — Oh!"—for
48754	48759	48760	48760	they	99	" Now , Miraz , "
48763	48773	48760	48760	they	99	" Now . Quick ! Quick ! Kill him . "
48845	48849	48851	48851	Edmund	71	" Great Scott ! "
48853	48866	48851	48851	Edmund	71	" He 's up again . Peter , go it , Peter . "
48867	48875	48877	48878	the Doctor	487	" I could n't see what happened , "
48880	48887	48877	48878	the Doctor	487	" How did he do it ? "
48888	48898	48900	48900	Trumpkin	121	" Grabbed Miraz 's arm as it came down , "
48906	48936	48900	48900	Trumpkin	121	" There 's a man for you ! Uses his enemy 's arm as a ladder . The High King ! The High King ! Up , Old Narnia ! "
48937	48940	48942	48942	Trufflehunter	119	" Look , "
48944	48953	48942	48942	Trufflehunter	119	" Miraz is angry . It is good . "
49044	49052	49054	49054	Edmund	71	" Oh bother , bother , bother , "
49058	49106	49054	49054	Edmund	71	" Need he be as gentlemanly as all that ? I suppose he must . Comes of being a Knight and a High King . I suppose it is what Aslan would like . But that brute will be up again in a minute and then — — "
49108	49111	49119	49119	Sopespian	183	" that brute "

49201	49209	49210	49210	Peter	69	" To arms , Narnia ! Treachery ! "
49242	49252	49253	49253	he	1248	" That 's for your insult , this morning , "
49298	49306	49290	49290	Edmund	71	" Narnia , Narnia ! The Lion ! "
49362	49372	49374	49374	Peter	69	" Come back , Reepicheep , you little ass ! "
49376	49390	49374	49374	Peter	69	" You 'll only be killed . This is no place for mice . "

49903	49908	49910	49910	he	95	" Come , children , "

51408	51416	51406	51406	Aslan	95	" But not the long journey yet . "
51455	51477	51449	51449	she	1353	" Why , I do declare I feel that better . I think I could take a little breakfast this morning . "
51478	51485	51487	51487	Bacchus	173	" Here you are , mother , "
51539	51550	51552	51554	the old woman	1358	" Eh , you 've done something to our well , "
51556	51566	51552	51554	the old woman	1358	" That makes a nice change , that does . "

51922	51927	51929	51929	Aslan	95	" Welcome , Prince , "
51931	51945	51929	51929	Aslan	95	" Do you feel yourself sufficient to take up the Kingship of Narnia ? "
51946	51958	51960	51960	Caspian	87	" I — I do n't think I do , Sir , "
51962	51969	51960	51960	Caspian	87	" I 'm only a kid . "
51970	51973	51975	51975	Aslan	95	" Good , "
51977	52043	51975	51975	Aslan	95	" If you had felt yourself sufficient , it would have been a proof that you were not . Therefore , under us and under the High King , you shall be King of Narnia , Lord of Cair Paravel and Emperor of the Lone Islands . You and your heirs while your race lasts . And your coronation — but what have we here ? "
52189	52194	52196	52196	Aslan	95	" Now , Lucy , "
52268	52273	52275	52275	his	1375	" Hail , Aslan ! "
52279	52286	52275	52275	his	1375	" I have the honour — — "
52426	52431	52433	52433	Reepicheep	135	" I am confounded , "
52437	52457	52433	52433	Reepicheep	135	" I am completely out of countenance . I must crave your indulgence for appearing in this unseemly fashion . "
52458	52468	52470	52470	Aslan	95	" It becomes you very well , Small One , "
52472	52477	52479	52479	Reepicheep	135	" All the same , "
52481	52492	52479	52479	Reepicheep	135	" if anything could be done ... Perhaps her Majesty ? "
52500	52510	52512	52512	Aslan	95	" But what do you want with a tail ? "
52514	52517	52519	52520	the Mouse	197	" Sir , "
52522	52548	52519	52520	the Mouse	197	" I can eat and sleep and die for my King without one . But a tail is the honour and glory of a Mouse . "
52549	52557	52559	52559	Aslan	95	" I have sometimes wondered , friend , "
52561	52573	52559	52559	Aslan	95	" whether you do not think too much about your honour . "
52574	52581	52583	52583	Reepicheep	135	" Highest of all High Kings , "
52585	52687	52583	52583	Reepicheep	135	" permit me to remind you that a very small size has been bestowed on us Mice , and if we did not guard our dignity , some ( who weigh worth by inches ) would allow themselves very unsuitable pleasantries at our expense . That is why I have been at some pains to make it known that no - one who does not wish to feel this sword as near his heart as I can reach shall talk in my presence about Traps or Toasted Cheese or Candles : no , Sir — not the tallest fool in Narnia ! "
52730	52744	52746	52746	Aslan	95	" Why have your followers all drawn their swords , may I ask ? "
52748	52756	52765	52765	Peepiceek	200	" May it please your High Majesty , "
52767	52804	52765	52765	Peepiceek	200	" we are all waiting to cut off our own tails if our Chief must go without his . We will not bear the shame of wearing an honour which is denied to the High Mouse . "
52805	52808	52810	52810	Aslan	95	" Ah ! "
52812	52899	52810	52810	Aslan	95	" You have conquered me . You have great hearts . Not for the sake of your dignity , Reepicheep , but for the love that is between you and your people , and still more for the kindness your people showed me long ago when you ate away the cords that bound me on the Stone Table ( and it was then , though you have long forgotten it , that you began to be Talking Mice ) , you shall have your tail again . "
54020	54034	54035	54035	they	1412	" Live here with a lot of blooming performing animals ! No fear , "
54038	54043	54044	54044	some	1416	" And ghosts too , "
54050	54065	54044	54044	some	1416	" That 's what those there Dryads really are . It 's not canny . "
54071	54078	54079	54079	they	1411	" I do n't trust 'em , "
54082	54105	54079	54079	they	1411	" Not with that awful Lion and all . He wo n't keep his claws off us long , you 'll see . "
54122	54138	54139	54139	they	1411	" Take us off to his den and eat us one by one most likely , "
54414	54419	54421	54421	Aslan	95	" Men of Telmar , "
54423	54453	54421	54421	Aslan	95	" you who seek a new land , hear my words . I will send you all to your own country , which I know and you do not . "
54454	54478	54480	54481	the Telmarines	99	" We do n't remember Telmar . We do n't know where it is . We do n't know what it is like , "
54483	54492	54494	54494	Aslan	95	" You came into Narnia out of Telmar , "
54496	54534	54494	54494	Aslan	95	" But you came into Telmar from another place . You do not belong to this world at all . You came hither , certain generations ago , out of that same world to which Peter belongs . "
54544	54569	54571	54573	the other half	1433	" There you are . Told you so . He 's going to kill us all , send us right out of the world , "
54589	54624	54577	54577	their	1433	" There you are . Might have guessed we did n't belong to this place with all its queer , nasty , unnatural creatures . We 're of royal blood , you 'll see . "
54644	54647	54649	54649	Aslan	95	" Peace , "
54680	54686	54688	54688	Aslan	95	" You , Sir Caspian , "
54690	55029	54688	54688	Aslan	95	" might have known that you could be no true King of Narnia unless , like the Kings of old , you were a son of Adam and came from the world of Adam 's sons . And so you are . Many years ago in that world , in a deep sea of that world which is called the South Sea , a shipload of pirates were driven by storm on an island . And there they did as pirates would : killed the natives and took the native women for wives , and made palm wine , and drank and were drunk , and lay in the shade of the palm trees , and woke up and quarrelled , and sometimes killed one another . And in one of these frays six were put to flight by the rest and fled with their women into the centre of the island and up a mountain , and went , as they thought , into a cave to hide . But it was one of the magical places of that world , one of the chinks or chasms between that world and this . There were many chinks or chasms between worlds in old times , but they have grown rarer . This was one of the last : I do not say the last . And so they fell , or rose , or blundered , or dropped right through , and found themselves in this world , in the Land of Telmar which was then unpeopled . But why it was unpeopled is a long story : I will not tell it now . And in Telmar their descendants lived and became a fierce and proud people ; and after many generations there was a famine in Telmar and they invaded Narnia , which was then in some disorder ( but that also would be a long story ) , and conquered it and ruled it . Do you mark all this well , King Caspian ? "
55030	55037	55039	55039	Caspian	87	" I do indeed , Sir , "
55041	55054	55039	55039	Caspian	87	" I was wishing that I came of a more honourable lineage . "
55055	55067	55069	55069	Aslan	95	" You come of the Lord Adam and the Lady Eve , "
55071	55104	55069	55069	Aslan	95	" And that is both honour enough to erect the head of the poorest beggar , and shame enough to bow the shoulders of the greatest emperor on earth . Be content . "
55108	55112	55114	55114	Aslan	95	" And now , "
55116	55247	55114	55114	Aslan	95	" you men and women of Telmar , will you go back to that island in the world of men from which your fathers first came ? It is no bad place . The race of those pirates who first found it has died out , and it is without inhabitants . There are good wells of fresh water , and fruitful soil , and timber for building , and fish in the lagoons ; and the other men of that world have not yet discovered it . The chasm is open for your return ; but this I must warn you , that once you have gone through , it will close behind you for ever . There will be no more commerce between the worlds by that door . "
55272	55281	55256	55266	a burly , decent - looking fellow among the Telmarine soldiers	1438	" Well , I 'll take the offer . "
55282	55288	55290	55290	Aslan	95	" It is well chosen , "
55292	55318	55290	55290	Aslan	95	" And because you have spoken first , strong magic is upon you . Your future in that world shall be good . Come forth . "
55349	55357	55359	55359	Aslan	95	" Go through it , my son , "
55483	55506	55475	55477	the remaining Telmarines	99	" Ugh ! What 's happened to him ? Do you mean to murder us ? We wo n't go that way . "
55516	55557	55511	55513	the clever Telmarines	99	" We do n't see any other world through those sticks . If you want us to believe in it , why does n't one of you go ? All your own friends are keeping well away from the sticks . "
55565	55577	55578	55578	he	1330	" If my example can be of any service , Aslan , "
55581	55599	55578	55578	he	1330	" I will take eleven mice through that arch at your bidding without a moment 's delay . "
55600	55606	55608	55608	Aslan	95	" Nay , little one , "
55622	55648	55611	55611	his	95	" They would do dreadful things to you in that world . They would show you at fairs . It is others who must lead . "
55649	55653	55655	55655	Peter	69	" Come on , "
55662	55668	55655	55655	Peter	69	" Our time 's up . "
55669	55675	55677	55677	Edmund	71	" What do you mean ? "
55679	55683	55685	55685	Susan	70	" This way , "
55695	55707	55685	55685	Susan	70	" Back into the trees . We 've got to change . "
55708	55712	55714	55714	Lucy	72	" Change what ? "
55716	55723	55725	55725	Susan	70	" Our clothes , of course , "
55727	55743	55725	55725	Susan	70	" Nice fools we 'd look on the platform of an English station in these . "
55744	55755	55757	55757	Edmund	71	" But our other things are at Caspian 's castle , "
55759	55766	55768	55768	Peter	69	" No , they 're not , "
55779	55799	55768	55768	Peter	69	" They 're all here . They were brought down in bundles this morning . It 's all arranged . "
55800	55815	55817	55817	Lucy	72	" Was that what Aslan was talking to you and Susan about this morning ? "
55819	55827	55829	55829	Peter	69	" Yes — that and other things , "
55836	55866	55829	55829	Peter	69	" I ca n't tell it to you all . There were things he wanted to say to Su and me because we 're not coming back to Narnia . "
55867	55870	55872	55872	Edmund	71	" Never ? "
55878	55885	55887	55887	Peter	69	" Oh , you two are , "
55889	55925	55887	55887	Peter	69	" At least , from what he said , I 'm pretty sure he means you to get back some day . But not Su and me . He says we 're getting too old . "
55926	55931	55933	55933	Lucy	72	" Oh , Peter , "
55935	55946	55933	55933	Lucy	72	" What awful bad luck . Can you bear it ? "
55947	55955	55957	55957	Peter	69	" Well , I think I can , "
55959	55990	55957	55957	Peter	69	" It 's all rather different from what I thought . You 'll understand when it comes to your last time . But , quick , here are our things . "
56360	56363	56365	56365	Peter	69	" Well ! "
56367	56374	56365	56365	Peter	69	" We have had a time . "
56375	56378	56380	56380	Edmund	71	" Bother ! "
56382	56392	56380	56380	Edmund	71	" I 've left my new torch in Narnia . "
