1409	1413	1414	1416	The young man	233	" Jon Green ? "
1448	1453	1436	1438	the other man	241	" Yes , sir . "
1477	1487	1469	1469	his	233	" I need to talk to this boy alone . "
1599	1646	1658	1660	the young man	233	" Congratulations , Mr Jon Green , because of your unique talent , Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has opened its doors to you . Just by simply signing this letter of acceptance , you will become a soon - to - be Junior Wizard . "
1647	1652	1658	1660	the young man	233	" Hog , Hogwarts ? "
1686	1697	1658	1660	the young man	233	" Notice of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry "
2111	2122	2103	2105	the other man	241	" I inquired about your life here , Mr Green . "
2146	2208	2130	2130	he	44	" A year or so ago , something happened to you that the muggles around you had no way to understand ; it is a sign that the gift of magic has manifested itself in you , and these people at the orphanage had no way of accepting the existence of magic , which is why they rejected you like this . "
2209	2269	2130	2130	he	44	" But in Hogwarts , it is very different , it is where all your kind is , you have the same kind of origin as them , along with the same abilities , you do n't have to suffer the same exclusion as you do here , and the professors at the school will teach you magic exclusively . "
2270	2328	2130	2130	he	44	" There will be a welcome dinner for you when you enter the school , there will be a warm common room , a variety of food that will vary from day to day , the professors will be kind , the students will be friendly , Hogwarts Castle is the best place for you to belong . "
2356	2360	2341	2341	he	233	" Sir , you- "
2361	2385	2386	2386	He	233	" Just sign your name on this notice , Mr Green . Or do you have any doubts about what I 've said ? "
2450	2465	2501	2501	he	233	" No , I have no doubts sir , it 's just that you ... "
2466	2499	2501	2501	he	233	" Since you have no doubts , sign the acceptance notice , we have other things to do next , like getting you a wand and buying a school uniform or something . "
2589	2599	2604	2605	The youth	244	" Sir , you have n't made a self ... "
2600	2603	2604	2605	The youth	244	" Sign ! "
2753	2756	2723	2723	He	244	" Stupefy ! "
2896	2916	2862	2862	she	265	" Lily Potter ! Did you really think I would n't dare to use a Killing Curse on you ! "
2969	3005	2947	2947	Lily	50	" Surely you would n't dare to disobey the orders of the master who you treat as if he is your own father , but against this boy , you would dare to use it . "
3027	3048	3009	3009	Lily	50	" Come with me , Jon , I 'll take you to the real Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . "
3049	3068	3009	3009	Lily	50	" Jon Green ! She is a wanted criminal whom the Ministry of Magic offers a bounty for ! "
3109	3197	3198	3198	He	244	" Go with her , and you too will be put on the Ministry of Magic 's most wanted list and become a terrorist . If you sign the notice child , you will become a student at Hogwarts , the only recognized wizarding school in the British wizarding world , not the fake terrorist group that is impersonating us . I will take you to the world where you belong , without having to be isolated and living an exiled life with this woman 's gang . "
3232	3237	3206	3206	Lily	50	" Take my hand . "
3238	3244	3200	3200	his	244	" Sign it , Green ! "
3504	3529	3487	3487	he	44	" Sir , what I 've actually been trying to say is that you have n't introduced yourself to me as who you are ? "
3609	3661	3595	3595	his	244	" I 'm sorry , Mr Green , I just forgot to introduce myself to you . My identity is that of a high - ranking official of the Ministry of Magic stationed at Hogwarts and also a Professor of Charms Class at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry - Barty Crouch "
3874	3888	3848	3850	the young man	233	" - I can give you plenty of care when we get to Hogwarts- "
3970	3987	3959	3959	he	44	" Jo ! En ! Gre ! En ! Damn it ! Lowlife mudbloods ! ! ! "
4059	4096	4097	4097	Lily	50	" The first time you Apparate it 's inevitable that you will be less accustomed to the sensation , so sit down and have a cup of hot chocolate , it might make you feel better . "
4386	4407	4383	4383	his	44	" Will Mrs Chris and the guys by any chance be in danger now that I 've escaped with you ? "
4491	4571	4473	4473	her	50	" Those people who want to take you away with them used to be nothing but evil , but after they have completely seized control of the magical world , their lord no longer allows them to kill people that readily . They will only erase the memories associated with you from the minds of everyone in the orphanage , destroy all traces of you ever existing in this world , and will not harm anyone associated with you . "
4592	4612	4613	4613	Lily	50	" You seem a lot more mature than your peers , not like an eleven - year - old . "
4652	4682	4626	4626	her	50	" A child living in an orphanage always has to know more things , do n't we ? Although I do n't think it 's something to boast about . "
4731	4808	4726	4726	she	50	" You 've already been told about your general situation by Crouch just now at the orphanage , at least he did n't lie about you having magical talent and being a wizard , and there 's no need for me to repeat that to you again . I know there are many questions in your mind besides that , and the good thing is that we have time until nightfall to have them answered next . "
4809	4831	4726	4726	she	50	" But before I proceed with your formal orientation , you 'll have to answer one of my doubts as well . "
4848	4880	4841	4841	her	50	" Why at the end , did you become so decisive in choosing to come with me when you heard the name , Barty Crouch ? Did you know him before ? "
5057	5089	5090	5090	Jon	44	" I do n't know him , but from the moment I first met him I got the impression that he was n't actually as friendly as he appeared to be . "
5104	5123	5090	5090	Jon	44	" He disliked and loathed me , I could feel it from the first moment he saw me . "
5124	5295	5090	5090	Jon	44	" The more he painted a rosy picture of that magic school to me with his words , the more I felt it was bogus . And I could n't understand a word of that letter of acceptance he asked me to sign , except for the title on it , and after I signed it , who knew if I would actually be attending a magic school or if I had sold myself out ? I had n't thought about signing and going with him even before you appeared . It was just that he was an adult who knew magic , and I am a child who had no way to resist directly . Your presence gave me more options , and although that option was also unknown and dangerous , it was better than going with another person of greater suspicion , right ? That 's why I asked his name to distract him at the time of your confrontation , and then followed you to escape . "
5341	5343	5348	5348	her	50	" break "
5385	5399	5381	5381	she	50	" I 've never seen any eleven - year - old like you . "
5421	5424	5381	5381	she	50	" Smart ? "
5425	5455	5403	5403	she	50	" No , it 's something like a ghost who looks young but is actually a good hundred years old , with so many twists and turns in mind . "
5611	5625	5602	5602	she	50	" Is that guy Barty Crouch really a professor at a magic school ? "
6050	6058	6081	6081	she	50	" Do you have a son named Harry "
6119	6143	6198	6198	Her	50	" If we go by the current official Ministry of Magic announcement , ninety percent of what he said to you is true . "
6144	6197	6198	6198	Her	50	" He is indeed a professor of charms class at that ' Hogwarts ' and he approached you in order to bring you in , and the notice that you were asked to sign was a real notice of acceptance to a wizarding school . But kind professor , friendly classmate , hehe "
6223	6235	6198	6198	Her	50	" Do you know about slave owners in the Middle Ages ? "
6254	6304	6198	6198	Her	50	" For that school , students like you , who came from Muggle society and whose parents are both Muggles , are considered slaves for them to train . For pureblood students , it is indeed a school , but for muggle students , it is a domestication camp ! "
6305	6334	6238	6238	she	50	" The so - called muggles are ordinary people in the normal world who do n't know about magic and do n't have the means to use it . "
6335	6374	6198	6198	Her	50	" That notice of acceptance , written in the Ancient Rune language , only requires the signature of the muggle students for them to enrol . Because that notice has another name - ' Elf Education Contract ' ! "
6471	6546	6451	6451	Lily	50	" You may not understand what an elf education means , but by signing that contract , you will be bound by that ' Hogwarts ' in all aspects to be educated to become a slave after entering the school , without even the right to obtain a wand , and never be recognised as a wizard , the only official title that is given to them is one word - ' Mudblood ' ! "
6768	6776	6757	6757	Jon	44	" And what about you Mrs Potter . "
6777	6786	6894	6894	Lily	50	" You can address me as Professor Potter . "
6826	6860	6894	6894	Lily	50	" Well Professor Potter , just now at the orphanage I remember you mentioning to me that you wanted to take me to the real Hogwarts . Is that also a wizarding school ? "
6861	6893	6894	6894	Lily	50	" No , and yes , I 'm taking you to the only wizarding school in Britain . That castle as it now has no qualifications to be called a school . "
6907	6951	6894	6894	Lily	50	" Seven years ago , the wizarding world was not what it is now . Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore failed to resist that man 's oppressive rule over the wizarding world , nevertheless , we never stopped resisting under his leadership till now . "
6952	7042	6894	6894	Lily	50	" The real Hogwarts is never bound to the ancient castle , and in the constant struggle to overthrow oppression and reclaim the equality of Muggle wizards , we have never given up on educating the next generation of young wizards properly and fairly . So even after leaving that castle , the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , which has been passed down for close to a thousand years , has never disappeared , and I am the Potions class professor responsible for taking you to school . "
7164	7172	7321	7321	Lily	50	" Are we going to Hogwarts now ? "
7207	7210	7321	7321	Lily	50	" Yeah . "
7211	7232	7321	7321	Lily	50	" Then why do n't we just go over there with that magic you used to bring me to escape ? "
7233	7289	7321	7321	Lily	50	" The Ministry of Magic can tell where the Apparition will descend through the starting point of the Apparition . This safe house will help us conceal the location of the drop point for a short time , but we wo n't be able to use that kind of magic when we travel to Hogwarts . "
7299	7320	7321	7321	Lily	50	" So are we going to walk to Hogwarts like this ? Or have you prepared some sort of transport ? "
7327	7348	7321	7321	Lily	50	" We just need to walk a little further first , then Hogwarts will come to us on its own . "
7402	7435	7376	7376	he	51	" Very well , it happens , quite literally , every year , again and again . Once again we let that woman slip away with a mudblood right under our noses . "
7486	7516	7465	7466	Barty Jr.	51	" I would love to know why , after all this time , the Auror office has not yet studied a way to deal with this safe house magic ! "
7538	7623	7531	7531	he	393	" Professor Crouch , a large part of the manpower in command has been put into cracking this magic , if it had been the kind of magic these fugitives used a year ago we would have been able to crack it at the first opportunity , but the concealment magic they cast on the safe houses keeps changing , and this one this year has a new spell being put on it , that 's why all the previous research went to nought . "
7652	7658	7659	7662	The young male wizard	394	" What 's your name ? "
7700	7727	7697	7697	he	394	" I ... My name is Andrew Williams , Professor . I also took your charms class during , during my last two years at Hogwarts . "
7746	7784	7741	7741	his	394	" I do n't seem to recall the family name Williams in pureblood families , and the Ministry of Magic would never recruit a mudblood as an employee , so , you 're a half - blood ? "
7785	7792	7741	7741	his	394	" Yes , yes , Professor . "
7793	7796	7741	7741	his	394	" Crucio ! "
7867	7872	7890	7890	He	51	" Ah ! ! ! "
7873	7889	7890	7890	He	51	" What are you , some bastard with dirty and impure blood in the body ! "
7923	7959	7908	7908	he	51	" The only person in the entire Auror command who is qualified to give me these words of explanation is your Head Lucius Malfoy , do you understand that ? ! Son of a whore ! "
8160	8166	8152	8152	Jon	44	" Hogwarts will come to us "
8250	8264	8242	8242	he	44	" Professor Potter , am I the only one coming to Hogwarts today ? "
8304	8341	8343	8343	she	50	" I am not the only professor who heads out from the school to guide Muggle students through their initial orientation . And you were n't the only student I was responsible to bring back today . "
8355	8398	8347	8347	her	50	" Before I went to meet you , I also went to the home of another girl named Hermione Granger , and by the time I got there , the girl 's parents could no longer remember that they had a daughter . "
8472	8506	8463	8466	the witch beside him	419	" You said that if a student like me got taken to another Hogwarts , those people would erase the memories of all those who knew them . This girl named Hermione Granger . "
8531	8557	8507	8507	Lily	50	" That 's right , she signed the acceptance notice and was taken away by a professor like Barty Crouch Jr. , to another Hogwarts . "
8656	8659	8661	8661	Lily	50	" domestication camp "
8872	8877	8851	8851	Lily	50	" Hogwarts is coming . "
9120	9146	9083	9083	he	437	" Hello there boy , nice to meet you for the first time , I 'm a Hogwarts coachman , you can call me Hagrid . "
9204	9214	9198	9198	his	44	" Hello Hagrid , my name is Jon Green . "
9215	9235	9198	9198	his	44	" Ah , it 's nice to meet you Jon and nice to see that you are safe Lily . "
9236	9260	9261	9261	Lily	50	" Thank you , Hagrid , but this is n't exactly a safe place , I 'm going to take him up there . "
9274	9311	9322	9322	she	50	" Go on , Professor McGonagall has already returned with a child in the middle of the afternoon , Dumbledore told me about a great place , we 'll be having our welcome dinner there later ! "
9472	9487	9492	9492	she	50	" Professor McGonagall , I 'm sorry , I only brought back one child . "
9527	9561	9518	9518	she	456	" Do n't say those words , it 's good to be back safely . Go and get some rest , there 's a dinner banquet later , leave the boy to me . "
9599	9667	9594	9594	she	456	" Mr Green , I am Minerva McGonagall , Deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts and also your Professor of Transfiguration as well as your Professor of Herbology , I believe Lily completed the initial orientation to you when she brought you in . Next , you need to come with me and I will take you to meet up with the other new students and receive your Wand . "
9719	9726	9711	9712	Professor McGonagall	71	" Do you have a question ? "
9737	9761	9727	9727	Jon	44	" I do n't have a question , Professor , I 'm just a little nervous about being here for the first time . "
9776	9829	9768	9768	her	71	" Strange surroundings do make it hard to adjust at first , Green , but the professors and students at Hogwarts are easy to get along with , well a life in exile is something that basically no one will like , but this is a place where you could make friends . "
10038	10056	10011	10012	Professor McGonagall	71	" Wait here for a moment and I will take you all to obtain your wands later . "
10057	10090	10098	10098	his	474	" Why does it have to be a sad thing to be separated from your family ? Think of it differently , it might be a good opportunity to gain some freedom . "
10107	10118	10119	10133	The dark - haired boy with red eyes , who had obviously just been crying	475	" I 'm not just being separated from my family ! "
10137	10154	10119	10133	The dark - haired boy with red eyes , who had obviously just been crying	475	" They 've all forgotten about me ! They 've forgotten that I 'm their son ! "
10163	10198	10158	10158	his	474	" It was only yesterday that Dad and Mum were celebrating with me for getting my acceptance letter to Eton , but today they ended up looking at me like I am a stranger . "
10227	10280	10281	10281	He	475	" There 's no way around it Justin , Professor McGonagall is doing this not only to protect you but your parents as well . If those people find out they have a son like you who can do magic , then maybe they will be in a danger in the future . "
10318	10332	10308	10308	he	475	" So will I ever get to see my mum and dad again ? "
10354	10362	10333	10335	The blond boy	481	" Yes , you will ! Justin ! "
10374	10417	10363	10368	The only girl in the room	482	" My mum and dad have always told me that good will triumph over evil ! The day when Professor Dumbledore leads us back to reclaiming what was rightfully ours with our equal status ! You 'll be reunited with your parents ! "
10544	10547	10574	10574	Justin	77	" blood traitors "
10657	10698	10652	10652	Neville	80	" Hello , my name is Neville Longbottom , and I 'm also a new student at Hogwarts this year . Sorry , Justine was in a bit of a bad mood just now , and we were comforting him . "
10723	10739	10716	10716	his	44	" That 's fine , my name is Jon Green , just call me Jon . "
10740	10780	10716	10716	his	44	" This is Justin Finch - Fletchley , this is Ron Weasley , and that girl is Lavender Brown , I guess there will be just the five of us going to be this year 's freshmen at Hogwarts . "
10816	10822	10802	10802	Justin	77	" Nice to meet you . "
10823	10832	10833	10833	Ron	79	" Are you brought in by Professor Potter ? "
10840	10852	10802	10802	Justin	77	" Yes , she 's the one who brought me here . "
10853	10876	10877	10877	Ron	79	" Well , then it does n't look like they 've managed to nab many students from the other Hogwarts this year . "
10882	10903	10877	10877	Ron	79	" Justine was brought in by Professor McGonagall this afternoon , and they only brought back the two of you . "
10928	10936	10919	10919	he	79	" What about the three of you ? "
10937	10958	10959	10959	Ron	79	" Me and Neville 's family are members of the Order of the Phoenix and have always been with Dumbledore . "
10966	11019	10959	10959	Ron	79	" According to the Ministry of Magic out there , the whole of our two families are wanted criminals , and from a young age we are destined to attend this Hogwarts at the age of eleven . Because there is no other wizarding school that could possibly even consider enrolling us . "
11020	11033	11034	11034	Lavender	82	" I am here because my father insisted on sending me here . "
11038	11080	11034	11034	Lavender	82	" He firmly believed that I could only get the best education here , and for that reason he even went as far as to take my mum with him and fled to Iceland , abandoning the family business in Britain ! "
11276	11292	11254	11254	Justin	77	" Were you also brought here after your mum and dad had their memories wiped ? "
11336	11363	11366	11366	Justine	81	" I was taken from an orphanage by Professor Potter and grew up without parents , so I do n't really feel that bad about it . "
11415	11445	11453	11453	Neville	80	" Look at it like this , there 's nothing wrong with being an orphan , at least it 's not sad and hard at a time like thi ... "
11476	11498	11453	11453	Neville	80	" Sorry Jon , he always talks like that without paying attention , Ron 's intention was not to mock you . "
11532	11546	11512	11512	he	79	" I 'm sorry Jon , I did n't mean it that way . "
11568	11572	11559	11559	he	44	" it 's okay "
11813	11874	11876	11876	he	80	" I have always wanted a wand of my own , and I used to steal Percy 's wand and play with it at home , which I one day almost dropped into the fireplace . My mum and dad threw a huge fit when they found out about it , and I 've never seen them that angry before . "
11890	11978	11880	11880	Ron	79	" They locked me up in the attic for two whole days to make me reflect on my mistake , during which I was only given a glass of water and two slices of bread . I really did n't understand why they reacted that violently when it is only a wand , I went to ask George and Fred about it and they both criticised me with a serious face without telling me why , even though they enjoyed playing tricks on Percy with me before . "
11983	11999	11880	11880	Ron	79	" Is that little wooden stick that Professor McGonagall had in her hand a wand ? "
12005	12040	12000	12000	Neville	80	" Yes , that 's the tool that wizards use to cast their magic . Maybe all the adults are very attached to their wands and that 's why they punished Ron like that . "
12041	12061	12062	12062	Lavender	82	" How will the professors distribute the wands to us later ? Just straight up give us one each ? "
12069	12095	12065	12065	Neville	80	" I suppose so , we certainly wo n't be able to just choose our own here like how it is in the wand shop . "
12453	12462	12439	12440	Professor McGonagall	71	" All of you come along with me . "
12583	12597	12573	12574	Professor McGonagall	71	" Albus , I 've brought the new students to collect their wands . "
12598	12602	12625	12625	Neville	80	" Come in . "
12862	12876	12877	12877	Dumbledore	61	" I love to see the arrival of new children to this wagon . "
12883	12911	12877	12877	Dumbledore	61	" It means that the cause we are taking on is not one that will be lost after us . I am your Headmaster , Albus Dumbledore . "
12977	13002	12971	12971	he	61	" A good working wand is , of course , essential to have before you can actually become a student at a wizarding school . "
13021	13050	13013	13013	his	61	" But for you all , the wand would certainly be more than simply essential ; it would be a representation of your , and another 's beliefs . "
13142	13210	13224	13224	he	61	" Regardless of how and by whom you were brought to this Hogwarts , I 'm sure you all can understand the current situation of the school . The Ministry of Magic has blocked and controlled all wand trading , leaving us with no means of being able to take you to the wand shop with a straight face and pick out the wand of your choice . "
13254	13335	13234	13234	his	61	" These wands before you , have all been used for a lifetime , it is true that they do not have the shine of those new wands in the wand shop , but each of the last owners who held them fought to the end for what they stood by . For me , seeing these wands is like seeing the people who used them , so I hope you wo n't dislike them just because they are old . "
13336	13395	13396	13396	Dumbledore	61	" If at some point in the future you have the opportunity to get your hands on the wand that you would like better and more , then please return the one that you took from here today , there will be other children who will need it in the future to truly enter the world of magic . "
13692	13697	13698	13698	Dumbledore	61	" Who 's first ? "
13767	13779	13747	13747	he	80	" I 've been waiting for this day , Professor Dumbledore . "
13797	13820	13794	13794	his	61	" You will be a source of pride for everyone in the Longbottom family , Neville , no one will doubt that . "
13868	13894	13895	13895	Dumbledore	56	" I agreed to your father 's request three years ago and never took it out before , only today , I put it here . "
13899	13982	13895	13895	Dumbledore	56	" Your mother , Alice Longbottom , used this same wand during her lifetime , the same cherry wood as your father , with a unicorn hair wand core , only slightly shorter by two inches , measuring eleven inches long . She died after being struck with three killing curses to protect the students on the Hogwarts wagon whose whereabouts were discovered at the time , and the last words she spoke in her life are considered a legacy to us all "
14017	14042	14005	14005	he	80	" These children , and my son , they will surely walk in the sunlight of equality , of justice , in the future ! "
14051	14072	14043	14043	Dumbledore	56	" Each and every one of us have never forgotten that statement , and that is why this Hogwarts exists . "
14182	14195	14171	14171	she	82	" This wand carries too much meaning for you to have it . "
14211	14307	14197	14197	Dumbledore	56	" Aspen wood with unicorn hair , 12 inches long . I am honoured that you would be able to wield it , Miss Brown , it once belonged to my colleague , Pomona Sprout , Professor of Herbology at Hogwarts and the last Head of Hufflepuff . She died in the battle that marked the fall of Hogwarts Castle seven years ago , choosing to hold off dozens of Death Eaters and Aurors alone in order to allow Minerva to retreat from the castle with the students , ultimately leaving only this wand behind . "
14317	14360	14311	14311	she	82	" Profess- Professor , my father always talked to me about her , she was his Head and the best possible mentor to him , should I put it back ? She is a great witch and I do n't deserve it . "
14361	14378	14379	14379	Dumbledore	56	" If you put it back , then Pomona would only be disappointed , Miss Brown . "
14385	14442	14379	14379	Dumbledore	56	" She died for the students in this school , then everyone who is a student of this school has the right and the responsibility to take this wand of hers out . I am sure that it will receive no less glory in your hands than it did in the hands of its previous wielder . "
14474	14480	14496	14496	Ron	79	" I will ! Professor ! "
14509	14558	14496	14496	Ron	79	" A combination of Elm wood with Dragon heartstrings , you would have met the owner of this wand when you were a child , Ron . Mundungus Fletcher , the short stocky man with the beard and the two short crooked legs , do you remember him ? "
14588	14630	14573	14573	he	56	" The thief who came to my house as a guest once when I was six years old and tried to take my family 's only silver goblet passed down through the generations and ended up getting caught by my mother ? "
14635	14655	14631	14631	Dumbledore	56	" Mundungus was indeed very prone to stealing and your father and mother never liked him much before either . "
14705	14730	14701	14701	he	56	" And do you know why your parents , who never liked him , still personally erected a tombstone for him at his funeral ? "
14750	14826	14733	14733	his	79	" He was besieged by the Ministry of Magic 's Aurors during an operation of the Order of the Phoenix , and in order to keep his memories from being read or being fed a Truth Serum that would lead him to reveal information about us , he made the most fearless decision of his life by not letting himself be captured - he used this wand in your hand to end his own life . "
14907	14918	14891	14891	Ron	79	" I 'll keep it safe for him , Professor . "
14919	14925	14891	14891	Ron	79	" That 's for sure . "
15034	15078	15025	15025	Dumbledore	56	" A combination of Cedar wood with Dragon heartstrings , it was owned by Sturgis Podmore , an early member of the Order of the Phoenix , a reliable male wizard who also died in that battle of the fall of Hogwarts Castle . "
15079	15092	15093	15093	Justin	77	" He was a mediocre guy , was n't he , Professor ? "
15100	15183	15097	15097	Dumbledore	56	" He may not have died as tragically as the others , and never did anything outstanding , but in this day and age , to dare to stand up against that other suffocating power would have been the greatest feat of all , Finch - Fletchley . As we look up at the stars , we too find most of them ordinary , but they are the only ones who shine in the darkness of the night , are n't they ? "
15193	15198	15097	15097	Dumbledore	56	" Yes , Professor . "
15905	15913	15877	15877	him	44	" Professor , is this wand pickable ? "
16091	16098	16066	16066	Jon	44	" It likes you a lot . "
16125	16209	16210	16210	He	61	" A wand made of chestnut wood with a phoenix tail feather core , an uncommon combination . With the exception of the current one who is not worthy of that title , the three consecutive Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot High Court have all used wands made of chestnut wood , only their wands had unicorn hair as the core , a combination that is extremely righteous , but when it is replaced with a phoenix tail feather , it becomes versatile . "
16271	16282	16226	16226	he	61	" And the person who had used this wand was ? "
16291	16331	16283	16283	Dumbledore	61	" I 've told enough sad stories for the day , so let 's call it a day son , and whoever once used this wand , I 'm sure you 'll use it well , wo n't you ? "
16332	16338	16283	16283	Dumbledore	61	" Is it mine now ? "
16339	16343	16283	16283	Dumbledore	61	" Why not ? "
16481	16608	16462	16462	Dumbledore	61	" The wands in your hands are engraved with the Turning Spell , each of the professors at Hogwarts and the wizards in the Order of the Phoenix will do their best to keep you safe , but if at some point something bad happens to you , and you lose all signs of life in your body , the Turning Spell will transport the wands back to me on its own . This is just an insurance measure , wands are the scarcest resource for us , but again , I would very much not want to find at some point in the future that this cupboard in which the wands are stored to have an additional wand that you have already taken with you . "
16652	16728	16625	16626	Professor McGonagall	71	" I 'll first take you to the dormitory room where you would live , by the time when you are all settled there , I believe Hagrid will also be able to find a suitable place , and although we are now on a wagon , the tradition of the Hogwarts orientation party has not been lost , and everyone will be celebrating your admission tonight , so let 's just relax until then . "
16849	16875	16885	16885	his	70	" Ladies and gentlemen , we 've arrived at the place where we can get out of the coach to prepare for the orientation dinner . "
16951	16961	16946	16947	One student	661	" Professor McGonagall , can we go out now ? "
16998	17022	16991	16991	she	71	" Since Hagrid said it 's fine , that means it 's safe out there , so all go down and get ready . "
17023	17029	16991	16991	she	71	" Hooray for the Professor ! "
17173	17208	17167	17167	she	71	" Then you will follow along , remember not to wander outside and stay with the older children , and make sure you do n't leave the area twenty metres away from the wagon . "
17209	17221	17167	17167	she	71	" We promise to do as we 're told , Professor ! "
17539	17560	17561	17561	Ron	79	" Hogwarts will find a place with a great view to hosting dinner on the night of orientation and Christmas . "
17583	17660	17661	17661	His	702	" My three older brothers all went here , and they told me that Hagrid always surprises people when he picks a dinner party location . They once had an orientation banquet on the top of Mount Ben Nevis ( the highest mountain in the British Isles ) and also spent Christmas Eve together on the Isle of Man . We also got a nice orientation dinner this year , it is surprisingly on the beach . "
17783	17825	17770	17770	he	702	" Do n't run too far , Lee Jordan , and be careful when you use the Full Body - Bind Curse on the crabs ! Your pronunciation is always wrong , try not to burn yourself to a crisp again ! "
17902	17908	17909	17909	Neville	80	" That is Professor Flitwick . "
17920	17948	17909	17909	Neville	80	" He 's our Professor of Charms and part - time Astronomy class , and he was the last Head of Ravenclaw House before Hogwarts Castle fell . "
17995	18005	18006	18006	Jon	44	" How did Professor Flitwick 's right hand gone ? "
18027	18063	18020	18020	he	80	" It was severed by a spell from one of the Dark Lord 's men . When the professor was young , he won Dueling Championships by wielding his wand with his right hand before . "
18064	18079	18020	18020	he	80	" Is there no solution in magic to put his severed arm back together ? "
18080	18147	18020	18020	he	80	" From what my father said , the battle at that time took too long , moreover , he did n't get his arm back after it was cut off . If it did n't take too long , magic could help you to connect the limb that was severed once again , but there is no way to help you to grow a new one . "
18258	18331	18245	18245	Neville	80	" But actually Professor Flitwick did n't think much of it , after learning about the permanent loss of his right arm , he was laughing and said to Dumbledore , ' Luckily I still have my left arm to use ' , my father told me this . It turns out he was right , he can still cast spells with his left arm and be our best Charms Class professor . "
18361	18380	18339	18339	he	44	" It 's okay , I 'm just sighing a little . So what can we do now ? "
18501	18580	18581	18581	Neville	80	" We can go to help the senior students to clean up the food ingredients to eat tonight , Hogwarts daily meals are prepared by the students themselves , and when we are officially started , a senior student will specifically teach us how to cook . In this wagon , the professor and the others usually have a very rough schedule already , so we should try to take care of ourselves and give them less stress . "
18868	18874	18859	18860	other students	752	" It 's Professor Slughorn ! "
18875	18880	18891	18891	Neville	80	" And this is ? "
18926	18929	18893	18893	He	80	" Professor Slughorn "
18939	19017	18931	18933	The senior girl	755	" He 's Professor Horace Slughorn , he taught us Defence Against the Dark Arts and History of Magic last year , but during the last term , he left Hogwarts because he had something important to do , and Professor Dumbledore substituted him for our Defence Against the Dark Arts and History of Magic classes . But I did n't expect Professor Slughorn to be back this year , he should be done with his business . "
19034	19060	19031	19031	his	80	" Was n't he also the head of Slytherin House when Hogwarts Castle had n't fallen ? I think my dad mentioned him to me . "
19647	19667	19630	19630	his	557	" Thank you for the delicacies you have prepared , and with that , please enjoy them happily too . "
19740	19760	19717	19717	he	44	" I have constantly heard George and Fred saying that Filch is the most annoying person on the wagon . "
19801	19838	19781	19781	he	79	" He always likes to treat people like animals or livestock , and never treats them well , as if he ca n't wait to hang up and whip those who have made the slightest mistake ! "
20053	20110	20039	20039	Dumbledore	61	" I am delighted that five new students have joined us , as well as our old friend Professor Slughorn who has finished dealing with some personal matters of his own , returned to continue his position as Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts together with his position as Professor of the History of Magic . "
20111	20134	20135	20135	He	61	" Tonight will mark another new beginning for us , and there will never be a time to celebrate more than this . "
20189	20200	20183	20183	his	61	" So why do n't we all sing a song ? "
20254	20257	20251	20251	their	817	" Hogwarts~ Hogwarts~ "
20281	20285	20263	20263	his	818	" Hoggy Warty~ Hogwarts~ ,
20365	20365	20349	20349	your	821	"
20845	20888	20903	20903	he	80	" I 've heard this wagon is improved based on the enchantments on the Knight 's Bus , we can go almost anywhere in Europe on it , but it seems Professor Dumbledore has never let this wagon travel out of England . "
20931	20944	20919	20919	he	44	" Did your family teach you magic before you came to Hogwarts ? "
20951	21046	20945	20945	Neville	80	" Of course , we are living a dangerous life together as a family even if it was n't at Hogwarts , both the Longbottoms and the Weasleys where Ron is from are wanted by the Ministry of Magic , so my dad taught me a few spells specifically with his wand before coming to school at Hogwarts , but they were minor spells used for help , I do n't have a wand myself and I do n't get to practice much , I do n't know any spells that are too advanced . "
21076	21084	21090	21090	he	80	" Can you give me a demonstration ? "
21131	21134	21121	21121	he	80	" Lumos . "
21184	21201	21176	21176	he	44	" A flick and a horizontal stroke as you recite the incantation , is that right ? "
21202	21265	21267	21267	he	44	" Yes , it 's a very simple spell , and if used skilfully you can even omit the wand gesture and cast it if your wand is nearby while you do n't have it in your hand , as a way to make it easier for the wizard to find the wand you 've just lost and forgotten where it is . "
21289	21339	21267	21267	he	44	" I would n't advise you to try it on your own right now , although this spell is simple , a beginner could easily ignite the tip of the wand if they made a mistake while learning it , which might cause irreversible damage to the wand itself . "
21403	21423	21424	21424	Jon	44	" Anyway , we 're in a wizarding school now , there 's really no rush to learn magic . "
21443	21451	21424	21424	Jon	44	" What classes do we have tomorrow ? "
21476	21538	21540	21540	he	44	" The first class in the morning is Professor Slughorn 's History of Magic , then Professor McGonagall 's Herbology class , there 's another class in the afternoon which is taught by Professor Flitwick on Charms , and finally in the early evening we 're scheduled to give a hand to our fifth - year seniors who are preparing dinner . "
21577	21590	21540	21540	he	44	" That Dark Lord you speak of does he have a name ? "
21591	21641	21540	21540	he	44	" Of course he does , it 's not like he 's a real demon who crawled out of hell , but his name is something that no one dares to say before , people in the wizarding world called him ' The You - know - who ' . "
21642	21671	21540	21540	he	44	" Is n't he now the First Lord of the Ministry of Magic and that Hogwarts castle ? People would n't still call him like that would they ? "
21672	21805	21540	21540	he	44	" You guessed right , from what my father said , after the Dark Lord consolidated his hold on authority throughout the wizarding world , he seems to have had a personality change and is n't as cruel and crazy as he used to be . He has given all wizards a different hierarchy of status according to their bloodlines , without completely removing or imprisoning the muggle wizards he used to hate and wanted to kill . No one dared to call him something like ' You - know - who ' or ' The Dark Lord ' in the outside world and apart from his inner circle , who still calls him ' Lord ' , the rest of the wizarding community address him as ' The Great Sir ! ' "
21806	21811	21540	21540	he	44	" Great sir haha . "
21812	21819	21540	21540	he	44	" What are you laughing at ? "
21820	21859	21540	21540	he	44	" If he came up with this title on his own , it 's too boastful , and if the others deliberately spread the word to call him that , then that 's pretty much a straightforward prostration . "
21860	21878	21540	21540	he	44	" Actually , come to think of it , those people are also trying to stay alive . "
21879	21887	21540	21540	he	44	" Yeah , nobody wants to die . "
21888	21906	21540	21540	he	44	" But for some people , there are things that are more important than life and death . "
22113	22165	22187	22187	he	876	" There is always someone who says that history is useless , and if at some point you are around that someone who says this same thing to you , then I suggest you better stay away from that person because the odds that this person is hopelessly stupid are high . "
22237	22286	22187	22187	he	876	" I 've met many such fools before , who ridicule the study of history saying that it is not even as significant as the study of how to make a slug clean , and called the historians a bunch of idle people with nothing better to do . "
22287	22358	22359	22359	Slughorn	99	" But history is far more meaningful than any kind of magic just by existing , and what it records is about who we are ourselves because we will always exist in history . And in the other Hogwarts , one of the most notable ways they erase the human rights of Muggle students is by erasing all the various historical mentions of Muggle wizards from the history of magic . "
22380	22420	22359	22359	Slughorn	99	" This being your first class at Hogwarts today , we wo n't start with those boring chronicles , compared to that , I think ' The History of the Creation of Hogwarts ' might hold your interest better . "
22712	22717	22744	22745	Professor McGonagall	71	" Greenhouse 1 to 5 "
22755	22864	22744	22745	Professor McGonagall	71	" I 'm not specialized in herbology , and as far as my knowledge pool on this subject is concerned , I 'm nowhere near as good as my predecessor , the late Professor Sprout . But the basics of magical plants are not too profound , and if any of you are extremely gifted in this area in the future , I can be a guide , and you can come to me with any ideas or doubts you may have on herbology . But even so , I will not relax my demands on you , and may even be much stricter than the Transfiguration class . "
23040	23055	23060	23060	Ron	79	" I heard that George and Fred and their grade cooked the lunch today . "
23076	23116	23073	23073	his	79	" It must be Fred 's work , he fries sausages like this at home , they 're all mushy , and he always justifies it by saying that 's how he likes them whenever Ginny reprimands him loudly . "
23385	23395	23373	23373	he	922	" The first years are helping with dinner today ? "
23408	23441	23403	23404	the boy	291	" Actually , I 've been meaning to mention to Professor McGonagall that the first years are still too young to offer much help in the kitchen other than adding a mess . "
23442	23479	23496	23496	Ron	79	" Why do n't you guys head over to the storage room and bring in two bags of potatoes and a basket of onions , I hope you wo n't mess up even this little thing . "
23790	23856	23857	23857	Ron	79	" Percy is really the worst , did you guys see that look on his face , ' I hope you wo n't mess up even this little thing ' , what does he take us for ? Some troll that only knows how to eat and sleep , and spends the rest of the time goofing off , barking and swinging a wooden club ? "
23904	23911	23879	23880	Percy Weasley	86	" This is the storage room ? "
23979	23981	23998	24001	the five of them	920	" Meat "
23983	23985	23998	24001	the five of them	920	" Vegetables "
23987	23989	23998	24001	the five of them	920	" Liquor "
24028	24030	24044	24044	Lavender	82	" vegetables "
24058	24065	24075	24075	she	82	" What 's this room for ? "
24104	24132	24075	24075	she	82	" It 's probably a pile of other miscellaneous supplies that are n't being used , let 's just take these food ingredients to the kitchen first . "
24160	24169	24142	24142	he	80	" It 's best not to delay dinner . "
24225	24267	24216	24216	they	288	" Just a quick look wo n't waste much time . Do n't worry , if there is a problem behind this door , George and Fred would have scared me with it a long time ago when they were home . "
24320	24340	24341	24341	Ron	79	" I thought there would be some kind of fun hidden magic item or something like that in there . "
24369	24379	24351	24351	his	79	" Who told you to casually open that door ! "
24464	24503	24450	24450	he	102	" Professor McGonagall should have probably stressed to you freshmen that in the wagon , you are only allowed to open the doors of the rooms that are marked with door signs , do n't you remember that ! "
24515	24524	24450	24450	he	102	" But it 's just an empty room . "
24525	24552	24507	24507	he	79	" Spare me the useless explanations , you will be cleaning the boys ' toilets for the next week , this will teach you a lesson ! "
24574	24587	24589	24589	he	102	" I would have deducted 20 points from your House seven years ago "
24634	24665	24608	24608	he	77	" George and the others were right , this old man is a pain in the arse , even more than Percy , there 's obviously nothing in that room ! "
24959	24997	25033	25034	the potions	983	" There is no difference in essence between Crow 's Head - shaped aconite and Boat - shaped aconite , they are just called in different ways , both of them are the same kind of aconite . "
24998	25027	25033	25034	the potions	983	" Many novice potion students can easily mistake them for a different species of aconite , and as a result , they are deceived by some unscrupulous merchants . "
25135	25183	25203	25203	she	990	" That 's it for today 's lesson , next time you are in class , each of you will have to hand me a one - foot assignment , write down what you know about all the potion ingredients I have talked over in this lesson . "
25387	25399	25400	25400	Ron	79	" Wanna go play wizard 's chess in the common room ? "
25509	25523	25500	25500	he	44	" You guys go ahead , I want to go to the library . "
25704	25706	25692	25692	He	44	" stain "
25943	25945	25906	25911	the only one in the library	1018	" rustle "
26461	26491	26495	26495	he	44	" So nowadays people wo n't even leave a glass ball alone ? Why do n't you go steal that golden perch at the feet of Dumbledore 's phoenix ? "
26547	26587	26543	26543	I	0	" Well , so you really tried to steal it in the past ! Now you are not daring enough to do that , so you have chosen to steal from me , the first - year weak student ? "
26628	26635	26643	26644	the Niffler	110	" Give me my thing back . "
26793	26801	26806	26806	Beech	111	" Beech , Beech are you here ? "
26892	26901	26875	26875	Hagrid	101	" Hagrid , are you looking for it ? "
26928	26963	26922	26922	his	101	" Ah ! Yes , you little naughty boy ! I finally found you ! You must n't get lost again , I 've already lost Fang and I ca n't lose you too . "
27030	27060	27024	27024	he	111	" Thank you , boy , I remember you , your name is Jon is n't it , it was Lily who brought you to the wagon , right ? "
27121	27139	27104	27104	Neville	80	" It stole something from me Hagrid , can you help me get it back from it ? "
27140	27146	27186	27186	he	111	" So that 's it . "
27159	27175	27186	27186	he	111	" Give it back , I told you not to steal anything from this wagon . "
27225	27238	27186	27186	he	111	" I 'm really sorry , I 'll restrain him in future . "
27256	27283	27216	27216	Hagrid	101	" That 's fine , but do n't you have to drive the wagon ? Can you leave from the front of the wagon while travelling ? "
27292	27339	27288	27288	Hagrid	101	" I certainly do n't have to watch them all the time , and Thestrals can travel on their own even if I leave . Wanna come with me to have a look at them ? Consider it my way of making up for this one . "
27355	27364	27404	27404	Hagrid	101	" Wo n't that be against school rules ? "
27365	27399	27404	27404	Hagrid	101	" Do n't worry about it , it 's not like you 're leaving the wagon , and besides , you have me with you , so it wo n't be a problem . "
27507	27519	27520	27520	Hagrid	101	" Follow me , Jon , do n't just stand there . "
27928	27935	27936	27936	Jon	44	" Do we have any destination ? "
28004	28060	27997	27997	his	101	" I asked Dumbledore the same question at the beginning when I started to drive this wagon , and he told me that the moment we stepped into this wagon , there would be only one end to this journey , and that would be to return to that Hogwarts castle that was originally ours . "
28100	28114	28078	28078	he	44	" It has a very poetic feel to it , I like it ! "
28115	28143	28078	28078	he	44	" Oh yes , I was almost in tears when I heard him say that . Well , actually I did burst into tears for a while . "
28144	28159	28078	28078	he	44	" Do n't you get bored driving the wagon all by yourself out here ? "
28160	28236	28078	28078	he	44	" Well , sometimes I do get a bit bored , but it 's all right , I 've got Beech to keep me company , and I 've named every Thestrals in front of me . I almost forgot that you should n't be able to see these lovely fellows , the horses that are pulling us are called Thestrals , magical creatures that can only be seen by those who have witnessed death . "
28293	28301	28490	28490	Hagrid	101	" What kind of horses are they ? "
28302	28393	28490	28490	Hagrid	101	" Black , with heads that actually look more like dragons , skinny bodies , and a pair of bat - like wings , they are one of the kinds of Pegasus . We ca n't have them carry us up though , it 's not that we ca n't fly , it 's just that the Ministry of Magic has stricter controls on the sky compared to the ground , and if we flew in the sky we 'd be an easy target for the Aurors and Death Eaters . "
28394	28402	28490	28490	Hagrid	101	" They can keep running without resting ? "
28403	28489	28490	28490	Hagrid	101	" Of course not , there are eight Thestral pulling the wagon in front of us , but there are over twenty Thestral on Hogwarts , they are kept in a separate room with grass and an open sky to nurture them , every week they will change shifts , when they are not working they will be given plenty of rest and meat , pulling the wagon is same as activity walking outside for them , and their life is much better than ours . "
28525	28574	28506	28506	he	101	" Try some more Jon , I made these myself in the kitchen during the night , my speciality is actually rock crust cakes , unfortunately , you did n't arrive at a perfect time and I had already eaten the last bit of my stock this morning . "
28575	28584	28506	28506	he	101	" Thanks , but I 'm full Hagrid . "
28933	28944	28914	28914	Jon	44	" Uh , Professor , do you need some help ? "
28945	28948	28951	28951	his	99	" Aha ! "
28984	29031	28951	28951	his	99	" You 're right on time , Jon , the students have gone to eat , and I could n't find anyone who would help . Go on , take this packet of sweets and follow me , maybe I will share a few with you . "
29243	29300	29241	29241	them	1082	" Just place them over here , do n't laugh at me for enjoying them at my age , that 's all I have left , one of the terms Dumbledore offered when he recruited me here was that there would be enough sweets to go around , good thing he did n't lie about that . "
29341	29371	29326	29326	he	99	" You did quite well on the Defence class homework you handed in last week , Jon , you have gained great knowledge about Dark Magic curses very well . "
29372	29410	29462	29462	he	99	" I just go to the library a bit more when I 'm not doing anything , but I actually could n't even use a single magic spell right now if I really asked to do it . "
29445	29458	29459	29459	Slughorn	99	" A solid theoretical foundation is the key to successful practical skills . "
29472	29510	29462	29462	he	99	" I never failed to judge people 's potential , you will have a great future ahead of you . If this is peacetime I would have given the invitation to join my club in a heartbeat . "
30078	30082	30062	30062	he	44	" Come in . "
30109	30119	30083	30083	Slughorn	99	" Is there anything else you want , son ? "
30137	30158	30120	30120	Jon	44	" Professor , when I went out of your office , this suddenly appeared in my hand for some reason . "
30403	30409	30394	30394	he	99	" Give me the ring . "
30513	30518	30504	30504	Slughorn	99	" Professor , this ... "
30519	30530	30531	30531	Slughorn	99	" You 'll just have to wear it for now . "
30544	30625	30531	30531	Slughorn	99	" Do n't worry about anything else , it wo n't do you any harm , but you wo n't be able to get rid of it for a while either . Go back for now Jon , I 'll see you again tomorrow when I 've sorted some things out , and I 'll explain to you about the ring then , also do n't say anything about the ring to anyone in the meantime , remember ! Anyone ! "
30661	30673	30676	30676	he	44	" When should I come to see you tomorrow , Professor ? "
30691	30705	30684	30684	Slughorn	99	" Tomorrow after lunch , we should both be free at that time . "
30751	30780	30740	30740	he	80	" Where have you been ? I did n't see you at lunch either , and I almost went to Professor McGonagall just now to report your disappearance . "
30781	30807	30740	30740	he	80	" I went to do Professor Slughorn a little favour , do n't worry , I 've already eaten lunch and brought back some dessert . "
30928	30932	30925	30925	she	50	" Come in . "
30958	30968	30944	30944	Lily	50	" How come Professor had time to visit me ? "
30969	30988	30989	30989	He	99	" Just happened to get some from the storeroom , so I brought some over for you too . "
31024	31047	31015	31015	Lily	50	" Eat fewer sweets , you 're already very old , so too much sugar intake is not good for your health . "
31048	31118	30944	30944	Lily	50	" Okay , okay , do n't start teaching me , without this my life would become at least 50 % less enjoyable . Well , your cauldron of calming potion is almost ready , but I suggest you put in a tiny pinch of fairy wing powder , it will give you another 0.3 to 0.5 pints of the final finished potion , it 's my unique recipe . "
31153	31206	31141	31141	she	50	" Thank you for your generosity in sharing the recipe , Professor , but I always felt you definitely came to me with more in mind besides bringing me this box of crystallized pineapple ; surely there should be no need to beat around the bush so much between us , right ? "
31253	31264	31247	31247	he	99	" The boy named Jon Green was brought by you ? "
31287	31301	31309	31309	he	99	" Yes , what 's the matter ? What 's wrong with him ? "
31317	31342	31309	31309	he	99	" There 's nothing wrong with him , but I wanted to find out more from you , what 's your impression of him ? "
31362	31377	31378	31378	She	50	" He 's smart , much smarter even than the boy from the Longbottoms . "
31405	31432	31378	31378	She	50	" I 've never seen an 11 - year - old actually capable of thinking so much in such a short time , amidst the danger . "
31450	31456	31443	31443	he	99	" Is there anything else ? "
31457	31561	31443	31443	he	99	" He 's very concerned about relationships , I looked into his information when I went to find him , he did n't have a good life at that orphanage , he was bullied until he showed his magic talent , and after he showed it , he became isolated . But after escaping the danger following me , he first asked me about the safety of the people in that orphanage , and I could tell that if I had said that the people in the orphanage would be in danger , he would have pleaded for my help to save them . "
31602	31614	31615	31615	Lily	50	" So , why are you asking all this , Professor ? "
31653	31666	31623	31623	his	99	" I was thinking that perhaps , I could teach him something . "
31724	31762	31763	31763	Jon	44	" Actually , we can eat dinner a little later today , after all , we ca n't go to bed before we finish our astronomy class , so we 'll definitely be hungry again by then . "
31782	31817	31769	31769	he	44	" The great hall wo n't specifically keep food for us until dark , and besides , did n't you bring back some snacks , you can eat those if you 're hungry tonight . "
31953	31973	31943	31943	himself	98	" Follow me and be careful to keep your voices down to avoid disturbing the rest of the people . "
32015	32018	31974	31974	Flitwick	98	" Astronomy Classroom "
32195	32233	32179	32179	his	98	" I know the view around us is spectacular , children , but tonight our real goal is the wide open sky rather than the land , so it 's time for you to find your seats . "
32309	32353	32300	32300	Flitwick	98	" In the last lesson in the classroom within the wagon , I only gave you a brief introduction to the basics of astronomy , whereas from this lesson onwards we are going to really start to understand this starry sky above us . "
32354	32424	32300	32300	Flitwick	98	" ... With Jupiter being our main object of study this term , and as well as studying the planet itself , we will also be working on the knowledge of its moons , and I will have each of you draw an astrological chart of Jupiter when the time comes , so I hope that during class you will be able to draw a chart of its moons .... "
32841	32850	32828	32828	he	44	" Professor ! Look up at the sky ! "
32926	32938	32940	32940	he	98	" Get back ! Go back to the wagon ! Quickly ! "
32963	32966	32948	32948	he	98	" wheeeeee ! "
33123	33128	33107	33107	Flitwick	98	" Accio Flying Broomstick ! "
33234	33240	33241	33241	Hagrid	101	" Protect Thestrals ! Hagrid ! "
33280	33284	33274	33274	he	98	" Be careful ! "
33348	33362	33345	33345	their	1168	" All students ! All gather in the great hall ! All students ! "
33440	33452	33453	33453	Dumbledore	56	" Is Kingsley and the men over in the square tonight ? "
33460	33493	33499	33499	him	56	" No , they 're in Finland as of late , taking care of the business you gave them earlier , there 's only Molly and Tonks over there in the square . "
33547	33554	33541	33541	McGonagall	71	" How come , they can find- "
33555	33566	33573	33573	his	56	" Now is not the time for that , Minerva . "
33585	33614	33620	33620	he	56	" Horace , stay in the wagon and guard the students , Hagrid protect Thestrals , and the rest come with me , we need to help Filius . "
33690	33719	33674	33674	Hagrid	101	" John ! Randy ! Ort ! Do n't mess around ! Take a lesson from the Smith ! Stay calm ! Speed up and run ! Run ! "
33861	33872	33846	33846	Slughorn	99	" Do n't worry , Dumbledore has already gone over . "
34062	34077	34098	34098	his	1210	" This is the first time we 've been in this situation , too . "
34101	34159	34098	34098	his	1210	" Even Percy has never experienced this before , only Bill and Charlie had experienced the danger of being chased by the Aurors a few times during their last few school years . I heard that ever since Dumbledore cast a powerful spell on the wagon , the Aurors have never been able to locate New Hogwarts . "
34229	34241	34242	34246	Another one of the twins	1213	" Actually , there is no need to worry at all . "
34249	34278	34242	34246	Another one of the twins	1213	" As long as we have Professor Dumbledore on board , our safety will certainly never be an issue , unless . That man personally comes over here ! "
34308	34339	34279	34279	Ron	79	" Do n't say things like that ! He , he 's highly authoritative now , there 's no way he would still focus exclusively on the likes of us . "
34366	34372	34358	34358	Lavender	82	" Who is that man ? "
34391	34401	34382	34382	they	1208	" The ' great sir ' , of course ! "
34429	34451	34414	34414	he	97	" Well , George , Fred , I know you 're not afraid of him , but at least be mindful . "
34457	34478	34452	34453	The twins	1208	" That 's not a problem , we 've all heard Professor Dumbledore address him directly by that previous name . "
34479	34493	34452	34453	The twins	1208	" Professor Dumbledore is Professor Dumbledore , and we are who we are . "
34506	34513	34501	34501	Jon	44	" Where did Professor Slughorn go ? "
34546	34581	34541	34541	Neville	80	" I just heard someone report to Professor Slughorn that Filch was missing , and Professor Slughorn told the Head boy and Head girl to stand guard while he went to look for Filch . "
34582	34595	34596	34596	Lavender	82	" Filch never seemed to have visited the hall from the beginning ? "
34616	34668	34541	34541	Neville	80	" He 's probably still in his room planning some sort of punishment for the students , we 've heard more than once how he often suggests to Professor Dumbledore to reinstate the corporal punishment system that used to be practised at Hogwarts for better discipline in the current special times . "
35293	35311	35283	35283	he	99	" I have some Dittany essence left with me , which will do wonders on your injury . "
35312	35350	35367	35367	he	56	" I did n't have a problem , those scumbags used the Exploding Charm together , which merged into a super wide range exploding charm , otherwise they would n't have had a chance to hurt me . "
35462	35500	35501	35501	McGonagall	71	" It 's been so many years , this is the first time the Ministry of Magic has found us in the last five years , yet why did they only send a few Aurors after us ? "
35519	35609	35511	35511	Lily	50	" The Ministry of Magic Auror Office has long become a department without any real power when the Dark Lord became lifetime Minister of Magic , the only force that truly holds the greatest strength in the Ministry of Magic is Death Eaters , they are the central force in the hands of the Dark Lord , and these Aurors , basically made up of half - bloods and purebloods with no connections , they are not equal to even a single Death Eater squad in any sense whatsoever . "
35614	35716	35610	35610	Dumbledore	56	" Do n't think that way Lily , although most of the power of the Auror office was gathered away by him before he threw it to Lucius , all those who have managed to join it to become Aurors are the best of the half - bloods nonetheless . Lucius is very skilled in recruiting people now , and the majority of half - bloods were recruited by him , since a number of Voldemort 's men still maintain that extreme mindset , at least the half - blood wizards have the right to own wands and to learn magic . "
35732	35839	35727	35727	she	50	" But at least the ones we dealt with today were incompetent people who could n't give us much trouble , except for that exploding charm that they cast against the Filius at the beginning in a group . It is impossible for the Dark Lord not to know that with you on board , these people have absolutely no possibility of posing a threat to us at all , so why did he let them come ? It 's been nearly five years since we got located , and now that he has found us , why did he just send a bunch of flies ? "
35847	35863	35840	35841	Professor McGonagall	71	" Besides , how did they find us ? The charm on the carriage failed ? "
35870	35879	35866	35866	his	56	" No , the charm did n't fail . "
35880	35888	35840	35841	Professor McGonagall	71	" Then how did they locate us . "
35889	35925	35926	35926	Dumbledore	56	" Perhaps they have all been looking for us everywhere all this time , and it was this group of Aurors that found us by accident , it 's not beyond the realm of possibility . "
35933	35979	35926	35926	Dumbledore	56	" Do n't think too much about it , for now , it 's been a tiring night , so you should both go and get some rest , let 's suspend classes for the day and let the students take a break as well . "
36360	36363	36345	36345	his	99	" Professor . "
36387	36432	36373	36376	the fat old man	753	" I would come here when I happened to be bored , Jon . Why did n't you bring some Crystallised Pineapple with you ? My former students always bring me little surprises like that when they want to butter me up for something . "
36451	36480	36439	36441	the old man	557	" I 'm sorry Professor , but even if I had the money to buy you sweets like that , I do n't know where to buy them . "
36505	36538	36481	36481	Slughorn	99	" I was just making a little joke , stop being so humourless , and sit down , I figured you might not be able to wait until noon to visit me . "
36567	36587	36549	36549	he	44	" So , Professor , can you tell me what it is now ? Can you take it back ? "
36588	36603	36604	36604	Slughorn	99	" It 's no longer possible for me to take it back , Jon . "
36620	36662	36604	36604	Slughorn	99	" Because it did n't belong to me in the first place , it was in my possession only because an old friend of mine once asked me to keep it for him and now , it has found its owner . "
36668	36676	36663	36663	Jon	44	" Then why did it pick me ? "
36677	36715	36728	36728	he	99	" Because it was created to wait for someone who would actualise the value of its existence , and that someone is not the one who created it , nor me the temporary custodian , but you . "
36734	36745	36728	36728	he	99	" Professor , can you speak a little more plainly ? "
36754	36821	36746	36746	Slughorn	99	" I 've actually always envied Dumbledore 's way of speaking with people , like some kind of sage , but it does n't look like I 'm cut out for that . Might as well make it a little more blunt then , Jon , this ring , it will help you to learn a form of spell casting that other folks ca n't learn . "
36865	36875	36860	36860	he	44	" Will it allow me to discard my wand ? "
36876	36898	36899	36899	Slughorn	99	" No , no , no , Jon , in fact when you have such a thought , you are misinformed . "
36906	37023	36899	36899	Slughorn	99	" Wands have never been a constraint on wizards , it is a means of enhancing a wizard 's magic , besides there are many parts of this world where wizards do not use wands as a means to cast spells , for example , some tribal wizards in Africa , they have always adhered to the tradition of hand gestures to cast spells . It is not difficult to learn such techniques , although they are complicated , so why do n't European wizards learn from them ? In fact , this question is like asking why we have to use a knife and fork when we can just simply use our hands to eat . "
37024	37117	37178	37178	Slughorn	99	" It 's not that wizards ca n't do it , it 's just that casting spells with a wand is what we think is the most effective and efficient way of casting spells , as well as the most logical one . It 's not as if no one has tried to replace the wand with some other magical tools , such as rings , crystal balls , books and so on , but the reason none of these has become popular is that what we are using is the best . "
37134	37162	37178	37178	Slughorn	99	" Well , Professor you said it would allow me to learn a way of casting spells that no one else was able to learn , right ? "
37163	37177	37178	37178	Slughorn	99	" According to your understanding , what is the magic that wizards use ? "
37210	37229	37201	37201	he	44	" A wizard with magic can use his or her will to cause a change in the world . "
37230	37238	37244	37244	his	99	" A very simple yet straightforward understanding . "
37251	37347	37244	37244	his	99	" It means you 've figured out two of the most fundamental things about magic by thinking that way , Jon . Magic and will , that 's the basis of what makes a wizard a wizard . Only will without magic , makes you a muggle ; only magic without a will , makes you an Obscurial , a person whose magic has become Obscurus ; and someone who has both magic and will , but has no way of linking the two together , is known as a Squib in the wizarding world . "
37348	37421	37244	37244	his	99	" All spells , whether in the form of transfiguration , charms , potions or prophecies , the necessary elements to perform them are magic and will , the rest , whether wands or incantations or hand gestures are all aids to spellcasting , they help the wizard to perform magic better and more easily , but their lack does not mean that the wizard will lose the ability to cast spells . "
37459	37569	37244	37244	his	99	" The will to cast spells depends solely on the individual wizard , and the wizards who have a strong will are generally considered to be geniuses who have a great talent for learning magic , whose strength grows with age . The wands and incantations are created to assist the wizards , and the study of magic has always been the focus of the vast majority of wizards from ancient times to the present . But like you said earlier , a wizard with magic can use his or her will to cause a change in the world , so what is more important besides magic and will ? "
37585	37592	37582	37582	his	44	" Do you mean the change ? "
37602	37725	37598	37598	Slughorn	99	" I 'm glad to hear the right answer from you , Jon . Yes , even if Filius has n't taught you a single spell yet , you should have seen this line written by Miranda Goshawk in ' The Standard Book of Spells , Grade 1 ' - ' Charms differ from Transfiguring Spells in the following manner : a charm adds certain properties to an object or creature , whereas a transfiguring spell will change it into something utterly different . ' Her intention in leaving this sentence in the book was so that beginners to magic could clearly distinguish the difference between charms and transfiguration , and it could , equally , explain the utility of magic itself . "
37726	37796	37862	37862	he	99	" Change , that is the ultimate objective for which all magic is created . A levitation charm can make an object lighter , a transfiguration spell can turn a match into a needle , and a potion can change otherwise ordinary porcupine quills or Dried nettles into a potion that can cure a boil . These are all changes , and this is how magic affects the world . "
37797	37856	37598	37598	Slughorn	99	" But there is a unified rule to all such changes , Jon , and perhaps you have been exposed to magic for a too short period of time to have discovered this rule - the wizard uses magic out of himself , but all that magic can change is the world , but not the wizard himself . "
37932	38008	37920	37920	He	99	" I did n't mean to contradict you , Professor , it 's just that I 've been spending my time in the library whenever I 've had a spare moment since I arrived at Hogwarts , and in one of the books on Transfiguration , I learned about an advanced human transfiguration spell called ' Animagus ' , is n't that the magic that wizards use in order to transform themselves into something else ? "
38038	38130	38032	38032	he	99	" I 'm really glad Jon , I was actually hesitant to talk to you about this before I made up my mind about whether or not to tell you this , but now it seems you 're excellent ! Magic like Animagus is something that even Ron and Neville , two kids who grew up in wizarding families , might not have heard of , and you 've only truly been exposed to magic for less than two weeks , yet you 've actually managed to know about it already ! "
38131	38173	38032	38032	he	99	" You 're not wrong with that example , Animagus , a high - end transfiguration spell , is indeed an ancient wizard 's attempt to change himself with magic , but it 's actually a product of a failed attempt . "
38174	38179	38180	38180	Jon	44	" A failed attempt ? "
38185	38192	38193	38193	Slughorn	99	" Yes , a failed attempt . "
38200	38226	38193	38193	Slughorn	99	" Since you have seen Animagus in the book on Transfiguration , surely you should also be aware of the greatest limitation of this transfiguration spell- "
38241	38255	38230	38230	he	44	" Transfiguration can not transform you into any magical creatures with magical powers . "
38256	38350	38193	38193	Slughorn	99	" Right ! The change that Animagus brings to a wizard is merely a transformation into different ordinary species , but essentially , what is the fundamental thing that magic does in producing changes in the outside world ? A change in magic ! But an Animagus ca n't do that , so it 's just a failed transfiguration spell ! In that respect , perhaps even the existence of werewolves is far more successful , but you should also be able to guess what the werewolves lose when they transform , right ? "
38351	38373	38230	38230	he	44	" They will lose their will , they have no ability to mobilize their magic to cast spells after they transform ! "
38390	38467	38374	38374	Slughorn	99	" Excellent point ! Even with the existence of the Wolfsbane Potion , which allows werewolves to suppress their beastly nature during the full moon , they still have no way to use any magic , their will and magic are isolated , and although this is slightly more successful than Animagus , it is still imperfect , and because of this imperfection in terms of functionality it does n't perform even as well as Animagus . "
38500	38506	38484	38484	He	99	" So , this ring . "
38521	38555	38516	38516	he	99	" It will allow you to change your own magic for the better . Not the kind of change that is superficial and just formal , but the most essential change about magic ! "
38556	38582	38617	38617	his	99	" So that different way of casting spells from the norm means that the magic is not affecting the outside world , but rather ourselves ? "
38622	38698	38617	38617	his	99	" I have lived a long time , but I devoted most of my life to potions and to socialising , without engaging in the study of the nature of magic . This ring and all the points I have mentioned earlier is the legacy of a friend of mine , Adrian Fawkes , who spent his life searching for a way for wizards to change themselves , and the end result was this ring . "
38812	38856	39181	39181	his	1286	" But if we follow what you said Professor , why did it choose me , when that Mr Fawkes you mentioned created it , even if he had passed away and could n't use it personally , you could use it no ? "
38857	38869	39179	39179	He	1286	" It 's not as simple as you think , Jon . "
38889	38980	38883	38883	his	99	" There has never been a shortage of brilliant people throughout the ages , and my old friend is certainly not the only one who could think of conducting magical research in this direction , a direction in which basically no one has succeeded . The only thing that seemed to have succeeded was in fact very evil , more unforgivable than the Unforgivable Curse . The ring you are holding is nigh the most perfect result that has ever been achieved , but not everyone can use it now . "
38981	39110	39181	39181	his	1286	" For a wizard 's magic to produce a change in the outside world , it takes ' will ' to grasp it , and the stronger the ' will ' , the more tremendous and complete the change produced . The ' will ' required to cause an essential change to the wizard himself with magic is even stronger to the point of incalculable proportions . This ring is only a medium like a wand ; it is the wizard 's own magic and ' will ' that really counts . Of course , the medium is important , but like I keep saying , if either the magic or the ' will ' is absent , then the magic simply is n't even possible to perform . "
39111	39178	38883	38883	his	99	" Ever since I got this ring from Adrian , I 've been meaning to help him find someone qualified to use his creation , but it 's been almost twenty years now , the wizarding world has undergone a great change , and I 've met thousands of wizards carrying this ring , but not even one of them is qualified to be its master . "
39188	39373	39181	39181	his	1286	" I was all prepared to give up , Jon , I have more important things to do , but your presence has taken me somewhat by surprise . I learned a few things about you from Lily yesterday after you left , you are very clever and have an excellent talent for magic , which I was able to verify even more today . The fact that you 've only been exposed to magic for less than two weeks , and you know so much about it is also a testament to your hard work , and most crucially you 're also someone who values feelings , and generally people like that do n't end up being all that bad even when they become villains . I would prefer this masterpiece not to be recorded in the history of magic than to make another mistake , and only after confirming all this , I have made up my mind to give you a chance to choose . Will you learn from me this method of casting spells that can produce changes to yourself ? "
39475	39479	39471	39471	his	55	" making another mistake "
39663	39671	39658	39658	his	99	" I want to learn , Professor . "
39705	39715	39724	39724	teacher	3143	" I actually prefer the title Teacher to Professor . "
39733	39749	39750	39750	Jon	44	" So , teacher , what should I do to proceed with our studies next ? "
39796	39838	39785	39790	an eleven - year - old	2573	" Do n't be impatient , first of all , you have n't learnt a single spell yet , I need to teach you a few more things to prepare you before the actual teaching takes place and the learning begins . "
39845	39854	39855	39855	He	44	" What do I need to learn first ? "
39859	39862	39855	39855	He	44	" Occlumency . "
39953	39965	39930	39930	Neville	80	" What 's going on ? Why is Filch so angry . "
40017	40027	40038	40038	he	102	" You should know we are in special circumstances ! "
40046	40110	40038	40038	he	102	" Anyone who has done this better come to me right away and confess , and I might even cut them some slack and punish them according to normal school rules ! But if no one admits it and I end up catching them out , I 'll make them regret not finding me and admitting their mistake at this point in time ! "
40179	40191	40192	40192	Ron	79	" You guys could n't have done that , could you ? "
40201	40251	40195	40195	his	79	" How is that possible , I have n't messed with that door since the last time I was punished , ask Neville if you do n't believe me , he 's been with us all morning , he would have stopped us for sure if we had tried . "
40255	40280	40252	40252	Neville	80	" We did stay in the common room the whole morning , you on the other hand , what were you doing this morning ? "
40321	40351	40363	40363	his	79	" Professor Slughorn wants to teach me something privately , and he asked me to make a trip to his office every evening over the next number of days . "
40366	40383	40359	40359	Justin	77	" Then are n't you going to have a lot less time to spare after class . "
40393	40406	40386	40386	her	82	" Well , do you think everyone would think like you guys . "
40426	40480	40407	40407	Neville	80	" It 's a good thing for you , Professor Slughorn is well respected in the wizarding community , both before and even now , and he 's the only one on this wagon who is n't wanted by the Ministry of Magic , so you 'll certainly learn a lot from him . "
40491	40504	40407	40407	Neville	80	" Why is Professor Slughorn the only one who is n't wanted ? "
40520	40672	40510	40510	Ron	79	" Because he was the head of Slytherin House before and has held that position even longer than Dumbledore served as Headmaster of Hogwarts , and almost all the Pureblood officials in the Ministry of Magic now were once his students and were under his care during their school years . There are rumours going around that even that man himself was a former - favoured pupil of Professor Slughorn , so if the Professor had n't been with us and had gone to the other side he would surely have gained a higher level of authority and fame , and now that he has become our Professor , the Ministry of Magic has not been vocal about it , as if they did n't know about it at all , and I have heard from the adults that this must have been done under that man 's will as well . "
41223	41242	41211	41211	Slughorn	99	" The study of Occlumency has nothing to do with what I 'm going to teach you later . "
41263	41343	41248	41248	Slughorn	99	" The main point of learning this magic is for you to protect what I will teach you afterwards , along with the existence of this ring . There are many things in the wizarding world that can allow one to read people 's memories , like potions , spells , and there are even some people who are born with the ability to read minds , and Occlumency is certainly the best protection against all of these things . "
41479	41554	41684	41684	he	99	" The very essence of Occlumency is actually the combination of ' Will ' linking with magic to build a wall in one 's mind . This wall can block entry and prying through magic , and those who excel can even construct false memories on the outside of the wall as a way to confuse the memory stealer , with no way to tell if the memories they see are real or not . "
41582	41682	41688	41688	he	99	" The Occlumency magic has mostly been learned in two ways , one is a simple and brutal method of forcing one 's way into the learner 's mind and making him constantly remember the feeling of being broken into , and his body will subconsciously resist and his ' will ' will actively mobilise his magic , this is the most primitive way of learning the Occlumency . But I do n't like this , it 's just too crude , and it 's not exactly healthy for a wizard to snoop into another 's memory too often . "
41700	41797	41688	41688	he	99	" So I will be teaching using the second method , which is less crude and much more flexible in comparison . I borrowed this magical item from Dumbledore , I actually owned one before , I just forgot where I left it later on during a relocation . Foolishly , I actually kept the memories of where I hid things , in that same magical item of mine , for safekeeping , but without finding the Pensieve I could n't get the memories , and without getting the memories I could n't find the Pensieve . "
41807	41870	41798	41798	Slughorn	99	" I would never be able to find that Pensieve again , good thing Dumbledore 's Pensieve was taken out from that castle with him , or I would n't know how to start teaching you . Pensieve is a magical item that is used to store thoughts and memories , and to recreate memories so that they become re - liveable . "
41887	41896	41876	41876	he	44	" So how would we begin ? Teacher . "
41917	41948	41897	41897	Slughorn	99	" Now you are going to recall a memory in your own mind , any memory will do , and I will extract the memory that you are thinking about . "
41976	41981	41982	41982	Slughorn	99	" Are you ready ? "
41985	41990	41991	41991	He	99	" Ready , teacher . "
42229	42243	42203	42203	he	99	" Did you not like that feeling and instinctively wanted to resist it ? "
42250	42273	42247	42247	he	44	" My mind wants to disrupt that sensation uncontrollably and ... It 's almost as if it was acting on its own ? "
42274	42279	42280	42280	Slughorn	99	" Not as if . "
42284	42314	42280	42280	Slughorn	99	" Your body 's instinct to defend itself was very strong , it made a spontaneous resistance of its own volition indeed , and that resistance had some effect . "
42315	42391	42422	42422	he	99	" That 's a very good start , Jon , the Occlumency was created in the beginning after someone registered the feeling of constantly having their memories forcibly read , which reinforced their natural instincts and eventually evolved into magic . Some people are naturally not exactly sensitive to this act of reading memories , and such people would have an exceptionally difficult time learning Occlumency , and you clearly fall into the opposite category . "
42397	42418	42422	42422	he	99	" This is a perfectly good thing , and it shows that we would probably make good progress after this . "
42442	42454	42422	42422	he	99	" Is this memory something that can be viewed by others ? "
42613	42623	42582	42582	Slughorn	99	" What do you remember most about this night ? "
42673	42687	42662	42663	the students	2538	" This is perhaps the most memorable day of my life , teacher . "
42720	42793	42707	42707	he	99	" I 'm with you on this one Jon , I 'll never forget the night when Dumbledore first brought me to this Hogwarts before I even agreed to become a professor here , that sly old man begged me to come without having to give him any exact answers , he said all I had to do was follow him around to see and attend the orientation dinner that year once . "
42794	42923	43019	43019	His	1351	" That day was just like the night you experienced , a night filled with despair and the last bit of hope that one could n't even bear to look at , and that 's how I was pulled by him to sit down at the table , surrounded by students happily asking me if I am the new professor , and they said that they have way too few professors in the school and were really grateful that I was actually willing to come and teach them . I was actually thinking in my mind at that moment that this was probably scripted by Dumbledore to keep me in the company on purpose , but I just could n't help but feel a sourness in my nose . "
42924	43018	42707	42707	he	99	" When that dinner was over , Dumbledore took me by the arm and stood up without any prior notice and announced to the dozens of children that I am the new professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts and the History of Magic , I was pissed off , thinking that I must scold him loudly on the spot , ruin his image , and then turn around and walk away . But in the end , all I could say was ' Hello children , I am your Professor Slughorn . ' "
43033	43072	43019	43019	His	1351	" After those words were said , I thought I would regret it , but what my mind actually thought at the time was that it would be nice to just agree to stay and be a professor . "
43216	43249	43206	43206	he	79	" Show me your finished homework for reference , Jon , I 'll just glance at it , without copying it as it is , it 's simply to get some ideas . "
43260	43327	43185	43185	he	79	" Do n't even think about it , do n't forget what Professor Flitwick told you and me last time in private , you only used it as a model for the last homework too , but the professor still found out about it , if you get caught once more , both you and I will have to write the homework you copied ten times . "
43328	43367	43368	43368	Neville	80	" You should better write it yourself , Ron , even if Jon could give you the homework to copy now , can you expect him to write it for you when you take the charms class exam ? "
43376	43391	43185	43185	he	79	" Okay , okay , stop your lecturing , I 'll write it myself . "
43835	43899	43906	43906	he	102	" Here 's some stuff your family sent you , Professor McGonagall asked me to bring it over to you . Remember which things are not allowed to be carried around according to the school rules and if there 's anything prohibited inside this box , hand it over to me immediately ! Or I 'll show you what you 're made of ! "
43962	43976	43977	43977	He	79	" ' Or I 'll show you what you 're made of ! ' "
43989	43999	43977	43977	He	79	" He 's so annoying , is n't he ? "
44024	44046	44047	44047	Neville	80	" He never failed to act according to the rules , despite the fact that he was indeed strict and vicious . "
44070	44085	44050	44050	Lavender	82	" Come on , open it and see what your family has sent you ! "
44086	44127	44131	44131	he	79	" It must just be some food Mum personally made along with letters telling me to do well in my studies at school , without fooling around like Fred and George , and to use Percy as a role model . "
44191	44223	44165	44165	He	79	" Come on , try them all , my mum actually has always been a pretty good cook , although she does n't get the chance to cook any extravagant feasts . "
44343	44355	44361	44361	Neville	80	" Both look good , so it ought to taste great . "
44370	44394	44361	44361	Neville	80	" I 've been to Ron 's house before and Mrs Weasley and Mr Weasley were both very nice people to be around . "
44395	44431	44432	44432	Ron	79	" They just act all nice and easy around the other kids , just ask George and Fred , I do n't know how many times both of them have been taught lessons by mum . "
44441	44463	44432	44432	Ron	79	" Sure enough it 's just as I guessed , Mum 's once again telling me to learn from Percy properly . "
44581	44687	44691	44691	his	79	" Oh yeah , in the letter Mum also mentioned that Dad had stuffed some newspapers from the previous months in there for me , he wanted me to learn more about current events in the wizarding world . But if you ask me , it 's impossible to get any real news from reading the Daily Prophet , and it 's clear to everyone that after three reporters in a row who dared to dig up big scoops disappeared , this newspaper is now on its knees on all aspects of the Magic Government and is afraid to say even a word of truth . "
44764	44849	44758	44758	he	80	" I 've long heard from my dad that the Order of Merlin award lost its former glory completely once that man started his rule , by awarding almost every one of his core most loyal men a badge , this Barty Crouch fellow supposedly received a third - class badge before , and now he got a second class as well , but what 's funny is that he is in fact most famous for executing his own father with his own hands . "
44866	44872	44863	44863	his	44	" Executing his own father ? "
44876	45008	44873	44873	Neville	80	" Yes . Barty Crouch 's father was also called Barty Crouch , and the Crouches were a long - standing pure - blood family , but his father was very firmly against Pure - blood supremacy , and resisted that man 's rule over the wizarding community ; back in the days he was the Head of the Ministry of Magic 's Department of Magical Law Enforcement , and the Aurors of the entire wizarding community were all part of the department under him . Then after the man succeeded in overrunning the Ministry of Magic , Crouch Sr . was captured , and he did not grovel and surrender like the other Ministry officials , even though his only son was in a high position among the Death Eaters . "
45009	45074	44873	44873	Neville	80	" I heard that man at the time simply wanted to keep him in prison for the rest of his life , but Crouch Sr 's son , this now - awarded Barty Crouch , actually offered to execute his own father . In the end , that man agreed , and the man who executed him as the executioner was his own son . "
45112	45128	45098	45098	Ron	79	" My mum and dad have always told me that this guy is n't human ! "

45738	45746	45716	45716	he	44	" Nicolas Flamel died of old age ? "
45757	45833	45750	45750	he	80	" Yes , the alchemist who lived for many centuries ultimately died of old age , along with his wife . He went to the Ministry of Magic three months before he died to report the theft of his Philosopher 's stone in England ; he is a French wizard , but also used to live over in Devonshire from time to time , and it was at that time that the stone was lost . "
45834	45920	45750	45750	he	80	" It was rumoured that when he went to report the theft , that man had a private meeting with him , and it was unknown exactly what they had discussed , but after that , the Ministry of Magic 's Aurors did all they could to help him track down the Philosopher 's stone , but there were no clues until the last of Nicolas Flamel 's Elixir of Life was used up and both he and his wife eventually passed away in Devon . "
45930	45995	45921	45921	Ron	79	" George and Fred were talking about it at home last year , they both suspected that it was actually the Ministry of Magic who had stolen Nicolas Flamel 's stone ; they were supposed to be the ones who stole it , so he went there to report it just to get his stone back , but it turned out as you saw . "
46563	46567	46584	46584	her	82	" Two circles . "
46642	46651	46624	46624	his	79	" Haha ! I 've got a deal ! "
46762	46802	46746	46746	Jon	44	" You 're all still just winning by luck right now , but you ca n't play all the games based on luck like this , you have to guess someone 's operational mentality by the hands they play . "
46905	46910	46913	46913	Ron	79	" Shuffle ! Shuffle ! "
46966	46977	46955	46955	his	102	" Everyone come out and assemble in the great hall ! "
47034	47049	47050	47050	Jon	44	" Let 's go , let 's head over to the great hall first . "
47340	47391	47329	47329	McGonagall	71	" I believe this may have been an innocent action on the part of someone who was not trying to steal anything , but just broke in by accident . Now , as long as this individual comes forward and admits guilt , I will not punish them too severely . "
47451	47466	47445	47446	Professor McGonagall	71	" Filch , please make one more trip and invite Filius over for me . "
47859	47873	47874	47874	Her	71	" Everyone , stay in the great hall ! Do n't go anywhere ! "
47957	47970	47938	47938	her	71	" Albus ! You have to be aware of this ! Albus ! "
48024	48053	48010	48010	his	56	" Do n't worry , Minerva , the wagon is still running , and I 'm still here , so there is no need to be so flustered . "
48077	48171	48073	48073	she	71	" Someone trespassed the restricted rooms on the wagon , all the rooms were previously subjected to Filius 's spell , which can leave traces on the person who opened the door , but when we checked all the students on the wagon , none of them had the trace . Somebody should have intruded ! Most likely it was during the last Auror attack , that incident was too strange , if their intention was to distract us with the attack and then let someone sneak in , that would make sense ! "
48211	48213	48191	48191	he	56	" Well~ "
48237	48240	48231	48231	she	71	" Albus ! "
48264	48269	48255	48255	he	56	" What 's wrong ? "
48270	48280	48251	48251	her	71	" Did you even hear what I just said ! "
48300	48359	48291	48291	he	56	" Of course , of course , I was listening to you , you speculated that the last attack was actually a conspiracy by the Ministry of Magic and that they deliberately tried to sneak someone into the wagon . But I do n't think you have to worry at all if that 's the case , Minerva . "
48385	48435	48360	48360	He	56	" Why we should n't worry ! No one has ever been able to intrude into this wagon for seven years , and now if someone did sneak in , especially if that someone was from the Dark Lord 's side , how could we keep the students safe ? "
48447	48611	48369	48369	he	56	" First of all , someone intruded on the wagon is just a guess of yours , although we left at that time , Horace was left to guard the wagon , I trust his ability more than anyone else , if someone really intruded , then he would n't have failed to notice it . Besides , if someone did sneak in and had the ability to remain dormant on the wagon for three months without harming the students or being discovered by us , then we would have even less to worry about . If he was really targeting students , he would have acted long ago and would not have waited until now , which means he has other intentions , we just have to wait for him to reveal his traces . On the bright side , it 's better to have an enemy infiltrated from the outside than to have a traitor within ourselves , is n't it ? "
48655	48665	48612	48612	His	1504	" So what are we supposed to do now ? "
48691	48722	48675	48675	his	56	" Nothing , have Hagrid found a place where we can celebrate the holiday , it is time for us to prepare to take the children for Christmas this year . "
48723	48728	48731	48731	her	71	" That 's it ? "
48755	48781	48752	48752	Dumbledore	56	" That 's it , please help me call Horace to come here later , I have some things I would like his help with . "
48819	48857	48811	48811	Dumbledore	56	" Perhaps you can give me a little advice , after all , you wrote all the Hogwarts admissions letters in the castle , you should know more than me when it comes to wording and grammar . "
48881	48889	48866	48866	she	71	" What kind of wording is it ? "
48890	48938	48866	48866	she	71	" ' Honourable Mr Grindelwald ' , do you think such wording is too formal ? Although we have n't seen each other for four or five years , after all , we are old friends , so would it be better to use ' Dear ' ? "
48941	48943	48939	48939	McGonagall	71	" ... "
49019	49034	49035	49035	Neville	80	" I thought the Professors would do a full search through the whole wagon . "
49041	49050	49035	49035	Neville	80	" Is n't this a little too relaxed . "
49095	49125	49091	49091	he	44	" Do n't worry about it , Professor McGonagall and the others certainly wo n't joke about our safety , there may be something we do n't know about . "
49377	49383	49346	49346	He	44	" Who sent this gift . "

50748	50759	50760	50760	Neville	80	" If only flying lessons were still offered at school . "
50772	50812	50760	50760	Neville	80	" Previously at Hogwarts there was a flying class to teach students how to use flying brooms to fly , but now because we are in the wagon , there is no way to access this kind of activity . "
50813	50863	50760	50760	Neville	80	" Because of the limitation of space , we can not fly in the wagon , but the professors could make the wagon stop frequently for a lesson , did they not do it due to possible risk Or perhaps it is not possible to buy a flying broom ? "
50890	50931	50883	50883	he	80	" Not being able to buy a broom should be less likely , the flying broom is not particularly high - tech , there are many magical transportation companies that can build it , although the price is not cheap . "
50962	51026	50932	50932	Jon	44	" The quantity of food and clothing that we need to eat , drink and wear all day , for fifty or sixty people is not small , and the quality of life at wagon is not bad either , so how do we get all these things ? It ca n't be stolen from the hands of muggles using magic , right ? "
51035	51064	51030	51030	his	80	" Of course not ! The Professors would n't do that kind of thing , all the things we live with now must have been bought with money . "
51065	51102	51103	51103	Jon	44	" Well , the professors are usually teaching us classes every day , and we do n't have to pay tuition to attend school , so where do they get the money to buy all these ? "
51255	51309	51236	51236	he	80	" We must not be the only ones resisting the Dark Lord 's rule , there are other wizard organizations like the Order of the Phoenix which has Headmaster Dumbledore as its core , and there must be a couple of other Pureblood wizard families who probably fund all our expenses at school . "

52422	52447	52413	52413	Lavender	82	" It 's probably not because the drink is n't good , is it ? It 's because you easily got drunk , right ? "
52457	52493	52494	52494	His	79	" I just do n't like the taste of booze , if I really like it , I would still be able to catch the golden snitch on my flying broom after drinking ten bottles ! "

55812	55820	55924	55924	Moody	145	" What 's the situation , McGonagall ? "
55859	55923	55847	55847	McGonagall	71	" We encountered Death Eaters , Dumbledore and the others are holding them back , Slughorn was seriously injured and lying in the hospital room , but now there is someone from enemies side lurking inside the wagon , and I have no extra energy to search the wagon since I have to look after the students , so I need your help ! "
55959	56001	55950	55950	their	1788	" Of course , when something happened last time we were not able to come over due to being occupied in Finland because of that task given by Dumbledore , so this time we certainly wo n't miss out on anything . "
56002	56019	56020	56029	The sassy witch with pink bubblegum - like curly hair	1790	" It 's been a long time since I returned , I really miss this place . "
56059	56091	56045	56053	The male wizard with gold earrings and dark skin	1792	" Do n't think of this as a return visit to the school ; you 've been through a few things too , Tonks , so stay alert and be vigilant . "
56092	56127	56137	56137	his	145	" Of course , I know that , it 's a shame Bill and the guys all stayed in Finland and did n't come back , otherwise they 'd be clamouring to come along . "
56141	56158	56137	56137	his	145	" Scatter ! Stop this chitchat and check out all the rooms on the wagon immediately ! "
56275	56284	56255	56255	she	71	" Green , tell me everything you saw . "
56306	56352	56358	56358	she	71	" I saw someone walk through the gap at the end of the door , Professor , and he did n't seem like an adult wizard , as he wore small , worn boots unless he was someone with the same build as Professor Flitwick . "
56368	56382	56358	56358	she	71	" Did those boots match the size of the shoes you are wearing ? "
56388	56405	56358	56358	she	71	" Almost as big as my shoes , but they seem to be a little smaller . "
56460	56493	56448	56448	Jon	44	" Professor , I think that person may not be a student , moreover , a person with such a size in the wizarding world may not need to be a wizard . "
56506	56517	56496	56496	her	71	" Tell me what you have in mind , Green . "
56518	56548	56549	56549	Jon	44	" From what I 've read in the library , I know that there have been many rebellions of humanoid magical creatures in the Wizarding World before , Professor . "
56553	56623	56549	56549	Jon	44	" Like the goblin rebellion , the books said they are generally small and thin and will use a different type of magic than wizards . There are also house elves , a group of creatures that have always acted as servants of pureblood wizards , they are loyal to their lords and also know magic , but more importantly , they are also small in stature like goblins ! "
56892	56937	56941	56941	Jon	44	" I also read in the book that the magic system of both goblins and house elves are different from that of wizards , so if they are really the one in the wagon , will they be able to bring in more people ? "
56952	57011	56946	56946	she	71	" There will be no such possibility , in the beginning when we laid down the enchantment on this wagon , Dumbledore has taken the magic of house elves and goblins into account , he blocked this loophole , the only one who can enter and exit the whole wagon using magic at will is Dumbledore 's phoenix . "
57020	57033	57034	57034	McGonagall	71	" Then the purpose of this infiltrator coming to the wagon is ... "
57047	57067	57034	57034	McGonagall	71	" You 've done enough for today , son , leave the rest over to the grown - ups . "
57261	57267	57271	57271	him	99	" What 's going on ? "
57301	57324	57325	57325	His	99	" I did hear the sound of a door opening and closing while I was lying in the sick bed as well . "
57333	57346	57325	57325	His	99	" At that time I thought it was Minerva who was outside . "
57354	57393	57351	57351	Moody	145	" McGonagall said she saw the door closing , and you heard the sound of movement , and a student even saw the boots that person wearing , but why was this person not present in the wagon ? "
57771	57824	57832	57832	she	71	" This matter must have to be investigated , Albus , we have once again found that this is absolutely not a coincidence , the person who infiltrated the wagon constantly looking for opportunities to reveal information about the wagon 's whereabouts , we will always be in danger due to this ! "
57913	57952	57898	57898	his	61	" His ultimate goal is not to destroy us , and he certainly will not bother to do so before I die . What he really wants , you should be able to figure it out , Minerva . "
57965	57995	57960	57960	her	71	" Even so , we should n't leave anything to chance ! We have to find the person who infiltrated the wagon ! We must find him / her ! "
58550	58557	58558	58558	Slughorn	99	" You are spot on time . "
58590	58598	58587	58587	his	99	" Are you feeling better , teacher ? "
58669	58713	58662	58662	his	99	" I am not that delicate , Filius can teach charms class even with a missing arm , and Moody can swing his wand on the battlefield even with a missing leg and an eye , so what is this injury to me . "
58731	58823	58714	58714	Slughorn	99	" According to our previously established schedule , today is the day that I officially will start to teach you about the way to cast spells with this ring , but you can not relax your learning on Occlumency either , at the moment you are still in the stage of building a wall around your mind , if someone really wants to invade your memory , it is easy to spot issues in it , and in this case , your situation may become more perilous due to your resistance . "
58863	58878	58832	58832	Slughorn	99	" That 's all I have to offer now , give me that ring . "
58965	58999	58939	58939	Slughorn	99	" As I told you before , you can use this ring as another type of wand altogether . See this blue stone ? It equals to the wand core of the wand . "
59000	59057	59058	59058	He	99	" Just like the legendary Philosopher 's stone of Nicolas Flamel , this sapphire is also a man - made alchemical stone , and its exact method of production is only known to my dead friend , but I can be sure that , unlike the wand , this ring has more than one wand core . "
59090	59148	59058	59058	He	99	" When I got this ring from him , this was the only stone left on it , and he did n't tell me the whereabouts of the four remaining stones in the last remaining hours of his life , but I learned in his magic notes that one of them was hidden by him at Hogwarts . "
59152	59155	59149	59149	Jon	44	" Hogwarts ? "
59156	59242	59058	59058	He	99	" Yes , but not this wagon we are in now , but the Hogwarts castle that has been taken over by them . Before the Dark Lord completely seized hold of the wizarding community , Adrien used to be a professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts for a year in the past , but he had an accident at the end of the semester and did n't continue teaching after that , however , he left part of his research in that castle . "
59250	59292	59243	59243	Slughorn	99	" In the future , if you have the opportunity , you must try your best to get that stone back , and the same goes for the remaining three unknown stones , all of them are very important to you . "
59306	59320	59149	59149	Jon	44	" And what exactly is the use of these stones on the ring ? "
59321	59333	59149	59149	Jon	44	" You can think of each stone as a spellcasting device . "
59338	59475	59334	59334	Slughorn	99	" Wizards require a very high level of ' will ' to cast spells on their own , even if you meet the conditions to learn this way of casting spells , it does not mean that you can cast any magic without care . Because magic is active in you , the ' will ' that is needed will also constantly have an effect on yourself , so it will interfere with the release of other spells , because of this one can only cast one spell at a time . The gem on the ring was designed to help you share this kind of pressure by keeping the ' will ' of casting spells on itself so that you can cast spells without being held back by any of the magic used on yourself . "
59476	59514	59622	59622	Slughorn	99	" Simply put , for each stone , you can learn a type of magic that will change your inner magic . And in theory , the number of magic one can handle with this is five . "
59515	59534	59334	59334	Slughorn	99	" First , you need to determine the first spell you are planning to use on your body . "
59546	59582	59535	59535	Slughorn	99	" In this first half of the school year , Filius should have taught you two or three spells already , which one do you feel that you are most comfortable and proficient in using ? "
59592	59613	59583	59583	Jon	44	" Well , the first spell I learned was Levitation Charm , so I am most proficient in using it . "
59614	59621	59622	59622	Slughorn	99	" Then choose the Levitation Charm . "
59632	59688	59622	59622	Slughorn	99	" You just started to learn , you should not choose a too complicated spell to cast using the ring , levitation charm is just right , it is the first spell that almost all wizards learn when they began to control their magic , simple to learn , and the effect is very practical . "
59988	60043	59965	59965	Slughorn	99	" Do not treat this so simply , the ring can only help you change the way you cast spells , it can not change the power of your magic spell , if your levitation charm itself is not mastered in depth , then you will not be able to accomplish what you anticipated . "
60077	60097	60051	60051	he	44	" First , cast the levitation charm once , let me see how well you have learned this spell . "
60125	60129	60106	60106	his	44	" Wingardium Leviosa . "
60173	60200	60161	60161	Slughorn	99	" Very good , even in the fourth year , you ca n't find a student who can use and control levitation charm to your level . "
60210	60217	60201	60201	Jon	44	" Then is this level enough ? "
60237	60261	60224	60224	Slughorn	99	" Put the ring on your body , whether it 's around your neck or on your hand , then try it out . "
60262	60308	60309	60309	Jon	44	" No need to wield the wand , just recite the incantation as usual , but in your head think of making yourself fly instead of some kind of object , which is only a target replacement , you should be able to do it . "
60315	60321	60224	60224	Slughorn	99	" Is it that simple ? "
60322	60325	60326	60326	Slughorn	99	" Simple ? "
60329	60338	60326	60326	Slughorn	99	" Just try it once before you ask . "
60382	60386	60375	60375	he	44	" Wingardium Leviosa . "
60491	60497	60498	60498	Slughorn	99	" Do you feel anything ? "
60527	60559	60509	60509	he	44	" I have a feeling that my body seems to have become a little lighter ? But the change is too minimal to quite feel the difference between before and after . "
60585	60594	60568	60568	he	99	" Are you sure you sensed it accurately ? "
60680	60708	60640	60640	he	99	" It 's subtle , not easy to notice , but there is indeed a change , it 's incredible , Jon , it 's really incredible ! "
60717	60726	60709	60709	Jon	44	" What 's wrong with that ? Professor . "
60745	60843	60739	60739	he	99	" I once explained to you , for any magic , magic power and ' will ' are the fundamentals , the incantation and wand are only auxiliary , but if there is no auxiliary , then even if the necessary conditions are met , casting spells will become extremely difficult . You should have been taught by Filius in the class in which you learned the levitation charm about the mistake of a wizard who once summoned a cow because he mispronounced a syllable of the levitation charm , and this is just a typical example . "
60844	60974	60981	60981	he	44	" You are now changing the way you cast spells , it would be equivalent to overturning the magic spell system with the wand , although the magic spell itself still would not change , the previous incantation of the levitation charm will not be applicable to you ; normally speaking , if you use the same set of incantation pronunciation as wand casting system , it should not have produced any effect at all . Magic change on yourself will not be the same as the outside world change , because of syllable errors the effect of the entire spell will be changed . The incantation to cast the spell on yourself will need to be altered , the usual incantation should n't have an effect on you . "
61060	61067	61068	61068	Jon	44	" Then why did this happen ? "
61075	61106	61107	61107	Slughorn	99	" The auxiliary means was wrong , but the magic that should have failed succeeded , then the reason for that could only be magic power and ' will ' . "
61113	61148	61107	61107	Slughorn	99	" Your magic power is normal , no different from other 11 - year - olds , so the only explanation would be the strong ' will ' fuelling the success of the magic . "
61892	61940	61889	61890	a madman	1918	" What 's wrong with you ? Were n't you the first of us to learn the levitation charm ? Why can not you even recite the incantation now ? And even if it 's just a practice , you should be holding a wand , no ? "
62049	62070	62016	62016	he	44	" Two kilograms , this is the most weight loss so far , but it is certainly still not much . "
62142	62169	62133	62133	he	44	" I think the reason why you got that result is that you just went to the lavatory , there is actually no difference at all . "
62216	62227	62228	62228	Neville	80	" But can you really succeed in such an attempt ? "
62235	62284	62228	62228	Neville	80	" Do n't you remember what Professor Flitwick said when we started to learn the levitation charm , this charm ca n't possibly affect the wizard due to the resistance from magic in our body , otherwise , there would be no such thing as a flying broom . "
62301	62309	62296	62296	his	44	" I 'll give it a try . "
62329	62382	62313	62313	he	44	" Well , this time let 's shorten the first three notes ' wing ' , ' gar ' and ' dee ' ; then lengthen the remaining five notes ' um ' , ' leh ' , ' vee ' , ' oh ' , and ' sa ' to try . "
62414	62473	62395	62395	Jon	44	" Good , the pronunciation of levitation charm incantation is correct this time , even though it is exactly the other way around ( in the original Hermione taught Ron the correct pronunciation : wing - GAR - dee - um Leh - vee - OH - so ) , it would be strange if it would work . "
62493	62510	62481	62481	Jon	44	" wing -- gar -- dee -- um -- leh -- vee -- oh -- sa ! "
62640	62649	62620	62620	he	80	" You 're not faking it , right ? "
62693	62696	62681	62681	he	44	" Boom ! "
62875	62882	62866	62866	he	44	" How did you do that ? "
63311	63328	63295	63295	Jon	44	" Just like what you saw earlier , reciting the incantation , and then a jump . "
63451	63460	63413	63413	he	80	" How the hell did you do that ? "
63488	63537	63477	63477	Jon	44	" I told you before , Professor Slughorn taught me something quite different , something that has a high learning threshold , it 's not that I do n't want to tell you Neville , but I promised my teacher that I wo n't tell anyone about this . "
63839	63856	63831	63831	Neville	80	" Have n't you already managed to figure it out ? What else do you want ? "
63869	63923	63859	63859	his	44	" I think , this syllable combination has only demonstrated its most significant effect so far , before I can try out all the other possible combinations , I ca n't definitely say that it is the most suitable one , and just this level is not enough to meet my initial expectation . "
63924	63931	63862	63862	he	44	" What was your initial expectation ? "
63950	63964	63862	63862	he	44	" The normal effect of the levitation charm is what I am expecting . "
63986	63993	63965	63965	Neville	80	" You still want to float ! "
63994	64010	63965	63965	Neville	80	" The point of the levitation charm is to levitate from the ground , right ? "
64050	64052	64023	64023	he	80	" fantasy "
64235	64275	64283	64283	his	79	" We are here because you have been in your dorm room for almost two weeks now , and we have something important to tell you , Jon ! It 's a matter of life and death for Hogwarts ! "
64357	64387	64333	64333	he	44	" If such a huge issue is going on , you guys should go to the professor , what 's the point of coming to me in a panic ? "
64412	64452	64388	64388	Ron	79	" Because the Professors should all know about this already , and I only found out what actually happened at school when I overheard Dad talking to the guests who came to the house while I was at home ! "
64495	64506	64507	64507	Ron	79	" Why did n't you knock when you came in ! "
64519	64536	64515	64515	Neville	80	" This is my own dormitory , do I have to knock when I come in ? "
64632	64717	64613	64613	he	80	" The person who came to my house as a guest over the holidays was Kingsley Shacklebolt , who used to be an elite Auror in the Ministry of Magic before that man took power , and who is now one of the top fighters in the Order of the Phoenix . He and my father were chatting in the study about some top - secret information on the two attacks at Hogwarts last semester , which I managed to overhear at the door ... "
64724	64763	64718	64718	Neville	80	" Any discussion about what goes on in the Order of the Phoenix is meant to be strictly confidential , and you should n't have gone to eavesdrop or come back to school to tell us about it . "
64771	64802	64766	64766	his	79	" The thing is , they were talking about something related to the school , do n't you want to know why the school was attacked twice in a row ? "
64803	64817	64766	64766	his	79	" Professor McGonagall told us last time that someone had infiltrated the wagon ... "
64818	64828	64766	64766	his	79	" And do you know who that someone is ? "
64867	64872	64766	64766	his	79	" Who is it ? "
64873	64880	64881	64881	Ron	79	" A goblin or house elf ! "
64885	64929	64881	64881	Ron	79	" Kingsley said that a student saw the shoes of the infiltrator the night we were attacked on Christmas Day . I ca n't believe this ! Why did n't the professors tell us about this or mention who that student might be ? "
64949	64952	64953	64953	Ron	79	" shocking secret "
64995	65043	64985	64985	Ron	79	" But that night Kingsley and others from the Order of the Phoenix did not find the infiltrator in the wagon , and even now it is unknown whether the creature is a goblin or a house elf , and it is still hiding in the school ! "
65089	65123	65124	65124	Ron	79	" Do n't you think this whole matter is dangerous , Jon ? A magical creature that has defected to the Ministry of Magic , is hiding near us at this very moment ! "
65140	65190	65191	65191	Jon	44	" If there is danger , we still have the Professors . They must know about it , yet they still have n't gathered us together , which means things have n't reached the point where the life and death of Hogwarts might be at stake as you said . "
65230	65284	65218	65218	He	79	" The professors did not realize the danger , it is likely that they have subconsciously decided to trust everyone in the wagon , even if that infiltrator can hide , but the whole wagon is only so big , where can he hide enough to ensure that he will not be noticed ? "
65289	65297	65285	65285	Jon	44	" What are you trying to say ? "
65319	65351	65412	65412	his	79	" Someone at the school must be aiding him to hide ! Only this can explain why even with so many Aurors searching at that time , he was not found ! "
65383	65395	65412	65412	his	79	" You know the person who aided him at the school ? "
65396	65408	65412	65412	his	79	" Of course , I can guess who this person is . "
65432	65453	65420	65420	he	79	" It 's just that the Professors have always believed that the adults on the wagon are reliable and trustworthy . "
65454	65468	65469	65469	Justin	77	" Come on , Ron , tell us , who is this guy ? "
65479	65486	65473	65473	Ron	79	" That person MUST be Filch ! "
65489	65491	65487	65487	Jon	44	" ... "
65558	65577	65549	65549	Ron	79	" Do n't you believe it , have n't you noticed that Filch has been acting very odd ? "
65588	65593	65578	65578	Jon	44	" What 's odd ? "
65594	65641	65578	65578	Jon	44	" It 's been two attacks , and we have n't seen him fighting alongside the professors even once ! I 've also heard from Fred and George that they both have n't even seen Filch pull out his wand in all their time at Hogwarts ! "
65642	65650	65578	65578	Jon	44	" So what 's wrong with that ? "
65651	65748	65578	65578	Jon	44	" It shows that he simply does n't want to go against the Ministry of Magic or against that man 's men ! He must have always wanted to wash himself clean off the wanted list and get back to being the castle 's caretaker of that castle again , instead of scraping the bottom of the barrel under Dumbledore . Now by helping the infiltrator in the wagon , there is no doubt that he will be able to get an opportunity to wash off his name on the Ministry of Magic 's wanted list ! "
65839	65849	65813	65813	he	79	" This conclusion of yours is n't too arbitrary . "
65882	65926	65936	65936	his	79	" There are many reasons for not being able to use magic , I would say that the possibility of Filch being undercover is very small , while the possibility of him actually not being able to use magic at all is greater . "
65927	65933	65934	65934	Ron	79	" How is that possible ! "
65939	65970	65936	65936	his	79	" How could there be someone who could n't use magic in a magic school , the muggles ca n't even see our wagon , let alone come up here . "
65976	65986	65971	65971	Jon	44	" Who said only muggles could n't use magic ? "
66003	66030	65971	65971	Jon	44	" In addition to muggles , there are only wizards , and as long as they are wizards , how can they fail to learn magic ? "
66042	66054	66036	66036	Neville	80	" Jon implies that Filch is likely to be a Squib . "
66060	66066	66055	66055	Ron	79	" He 's a Squib ? "
66074	66079	66067	66067	Justin	77	" What 's Squib ? "
66085	66138	66080	66080	Neville	80	" Squib is a person who has magic present in his / her body but has no way to learn and use magic , these people usually lived in the magic community before , they know about the existence of magic and wizards , but they are not much accepted by wizards . "
66139	66218	66067	66067	Justin	77	" If Filch is a Squib , then he can never be a spy of the Ministry of Magic because according to the current magical laws of the Ministry of Magic , Squibs are not qualified to live in the magical community . Once discovered , regardless of whether they are purebloods or half - bloods , they will be wiped of all memories about the magical world and thrown into muggle society left to fend for themselves . "
66219	66293	66080	66080	Neville	80	" And I heard that most of these people become homeless in the muggle society ; they do not have the knowledge and skills of muggles , they also lost the memory of the magic world nor can they use magic , and many even forget who they really are , where they come from , for what purpose they live in this world , and live every day as the walking dead . "
66294	66343	66384	66384	Ron	79	" With all the current policies and discrimination that the Ministry of Magic imposes on Squibs , if Filch is really a Squib , then there is absolutely no possibility for him to become a Ministry of Magic 's spy unless he has been under the Imperius Curse . "
66461	66495	66453	66453	Jon	44	" Speculation is speculation , if you really think Filch is a spy , you should tell Professor McGonagall and the others about this suspicion , but do n't mess around by yourself . "
66501	66517	66496	66496	Ron	79	" Professors would n't believe me , they all think Filch is a competent caretaker . "
66652	66728	66647	66647	his	44	" In fact , the issue now is very simple , you suspect that Filch is a spy of the Ministry of Magic , but if he is a squib , then the reason why he has not been using magic can be explained , and ' spy ' will simply become pure nonsense . So if we can just verify whether he 's a squib or not , then the problem will be solved . "
66732	66746	66729	66729	Ron	79	" The point is how can we prove that Filch is a Squib ? "
66747	66756	66647	66647	his	44	" That 's very simple , follow me . "
66803	66842	66790	66790	he	79	" Are you going to duel with Filch ? Yes ! If you force him to fight now , we can find out whether he does n't know magic or does n't want to use it at all ! "
66908	66917	66892	66899	the caretaker with the fish - like eyes	1975	" What do you all want from me ? "
67008	67018	66997	66997	Jon	44	" You are a Squib , right ? Filch . "
67163	67167	67158	67158	his	102	" ho ho ho "
67188	67270	67180	67180	he	102	" What are you talking about ! Who is Squib ! Are you attempting to defame me and make me lose my authority as a caretaker so that you can fulfil your fantasy of lawlessness in school ! I tell you ! Dream on ! I 'll punish you ! I 'm going to put you in detention ! For one semester ! For defaming the faculty ! Let the whole school see what will happen to those who do that ! "
67285	67362	67363	67363	Filch	102	" You would n't be able to do that , because Professor McGonagall wo n't even approve this penalty of yours . There is indeed a rule in the school rules that forbids defaming faculty members , but I 'm telling the truth , and Professor McGonagall absolutely wo n't do something against the school rules . And if it comes to that , then the whole school will know that you are truly a Squib . "
67411	67419	67363	67363	Filch	102	" They all look down on Squibs ! "
67433	67499	67420	67420	Filch	102	" They all think people like me do n't deserve to live in the wizarding world at all ... Yeah ! How can someone who ca n't even use a single spell and is not even qualified to hold a wand worthy of being called a wizard ! Squib ! Squib ! Squibs are useless ! Rubbish ! That 's what everyone thinks ! Everyone ! "
67516	67527	67512	67512	Neville	80	" But the Professors at Hogwarts do n't think so . "
67528	67540	67541	67541	He	102	" That 's just for the sake of Dumbledore 's presence ! "
67544	67615	67541	67541	He	102	" I know they all actually despise me ! Lily Potter never initiated a conversation with me ! McGonagall has n't treated me well for twenty years ! Slughorn even tried to degrade me the night Hogwarts was attacked for the first time this year , I was locked up all alone in my office and scared to death ! And he did not take me out until very late ! "
67620	67622	67619	67619	his	102	" accusations "
67693	67713	67690	67690	he	44	" You were locked up that night ? Who did that ? The man who sneaked into the wagon ? "
67714	67787	67792	67792	he	102	" Does anyone know that I ca n't use magic and ca n't cast an unlocking charm ? If that person really thought I was in the way , he would not just lock the door secretly ! It must be Slughorn ! He knew I am a Squib , and have no way to open the locked room without keys , so he locked me in the office to embarrass me ! "
67817	67872	67792	67792	he	102	" Do n't be upset , Filch , we 're not looking down on you for being a squib , and we 're not going to tell anyone about this , we only came over to ask you because we suspected there is something wrong with you for not using magic all this time . "
67873	67879	67880	67880	Filch	102	" There is something wrong ? "
67901	67925	67926	67926	Ron	79	" You guys thought that I would harm Hogwarts ? Am I crazy ? No , it 's you guys who are crazy ! "
67970	67999	68000	68000	Jon	44	" Now that we 're sure you 're really a squib , there 's certainly no such suspicion , and I 'm sorry to have bothered you today . "
68033	68042	68043	68043	Filch	102	" Do you mean what you just said ? "
68065	68072	68048	68048	he	102	" Do n't tell anyone else . "
68076	68094	68073	68073	Jon	44	" It 's your privacy , we 'll keep it a secret if you feel we should . "
68095	68104	68105	68105	He	102	" Ah , thanks . Thanks , boys . "
68142	68153	68135	68135	Ron	79	" I never expected him to actually be a squib ... "
68173	68197	68164	68164	he	79	" but these are his own words , maybe he actually tried to use the whole squib thing to cover up the suspicion ? "
68238	68243	68244	68244	Jon	44	" Hey , Hagrid . "
68271	68277	68263	68263	Hagrid	101	" Good morning , Jon . "
68278	68286	68263	68263	Hagrid	101	" You 're looking for Beech again ? "
68287	68326	68327	68327	Hagrid	101	" Yes , he 's not very obedient these days and likes to run around the wagon all the time , I 'm afraid he 'll steal something indiscriminately , so I came in to look for him . "
68334	68340	68327	68327	Hagrid	101	" Have you seen him ? "
68346	68380	68341	68341	Jon	44	" No , if I had seen him , I would have caught him and sent him to you . By the way , we happen to have one thing to ask you . "
68396	68414	68391	68391	his	44	" Do you know why Filch has not been using magic ? We 're curious about that . "
68476	68537	68464	68464	Hagrid	101	" You guys actually noticed this . Of course , I know the reason , but I ca n't tell you guys , after all , this is his personal matter , and he kinda cares about it very much , so even if all the professors in the school know about it , no one will mention it much . "
68620	68652	68596	68596	they	2003	" Do n't think blindly , leave this matter to the professors to solve it , it is already the greatest help to them if we can take care of ourselves . "
68786	68791	68778	68778	his	80	" What 's wrong ? "
68801	68813	68794	68794	his	44	" Nothing , just thinking about something , something less desirable . "
68970	69044	69045	69045	Slughorn	99	" Yes , it is true what you are learning now is a completely new way of casting spells , but the basis of the spell itself is still based on the same system of casting spells using a wand . So if you want to strengthen the ability of levitation charm used on yourself , the most fundamental aspect that you need is to understand the spell of levitation charm deep enough . "
69081	69130	69077	69077	he	44	" In other words , as long as I have a better grasp of the normal levitation charm , then the effect of the levitation charm used on myself will be equally good . To improve it all I have to do is keep practising the spell itself . "
69134	69181	69187	69187	he	99	" You got it right , the essence of wand casting and ring casting is quite similar , except that there is a difference in the target of the change , which is why only the incantation syllables change while the spell itself remains the same . "
69205	69327	69187	69187	he	99	" And these , when you leave later , take it with you , Adrien left behind some insights about this way of casting spells that you have learned , it should help you a lot . Of course , the part left in Hogwarts Castle must be more than what I have in my possession now , his last wish at the time was to donate all his research to the Hogwarts library , but , unfortunately , something like this happened later . He also asked me to bring out the materials and stones from the castle before he died , and now since you have inherited his possession , I will pass that task to you , Jon . "
69334	69368	69187	69187	he	99	" I hope that one day you can really be able to accomplish this , but do n't put too much pressure on yourself , you are only 11 years old after all . "
69393	69420	69328	69328	Slughorn	99	" Teacher ... What you mean by this is that you are no longer going to continue to teach me about things related to the ring ? "
69421	69433	69438	69438	his	1323	" It 's not that I do n't want to teach . "
69441	69553	69438	69438	his	1323	" but what I know is only so much Jon , after all , I have never really learned the use of that ring , what I taught you before all came from these notes too , now you have initially mastered the spell , it is better for you to learn it yourself instead of letting me relay it to you in a half - baked way . Besides , if you have any questions later , of course , you can continue to ask me , but I am afraid that I ca n't give you the answer outright , we have to discuss it to solve the problem . "
69769	69780	69726	69726	he	99	" Professor , how come Beech is in your place ? "
69794	69800	69946	69946	he	99	" You know this Niffler ? "
69801	69822	69946	69946	he	99	" This is Hagrid 's pet , I got familiar with Hagrid back then because he stole something from me . "
69823	69866	69867	69867	Slughorn	99	" Yes , Hagrid talked to me about this being the only creature he had brought out of that forest other than Thestrals , this little fellow indeed has loose hands and feet , but it 's just the nature of Niffler . "
69873	69939	69867	69867	Slughorn	99	" a while ago when I came back to the office I found him stealing my crystallised pineapple , this magical creature seems quite interesting , so I took the initiative to give him some small snacks , then from that day onwards he started to haunt me , every once in a while he would come to my place for a short afternoon tea . "
70472	70476	70482	70482	Jon	44	" Wingardium Leviosa . "
70540	70643	70515	70515	Neville	80	" It 's been a month , a whole month ! On average , every day you practice this spell more than a hundred times ! The sound of the levitation incantation keeps ringing in my ears every night in my dreams , you 've already mastered it enough , Jon ! As Professor Flitwick said last time , you have already reached the standard of most adult wizards in the levitation charm , and all you lack now is the magic power that has not yet grown due to your age , so you really do n't need to practice anymore ! "
70660	70714	70644	70644	Jon	44	" Yes , Professor Flitwick did mention that my expertise in the levitation charm is high enough , the rest can only rely on our own magic power and experience that can only be accumulated over time , but why is the maximum effect that I can achieve now is still only this ? "
70715	70719	70720	70720	Neville	80	" Only this ? "
70727	70770	70720	70720	Neville	80	" what you used the magic spell to levitate is not a feather , not a parchment , not a textbook , but a DESK ! How many people on this wagon right now besides the ' Professors ' can do that ? "
70771	70797	70798	70798	Jon	44	" It 's not a question of whether anyone else can do it , it 's about how flawed the levitation magic spell itself is . "
70844	70855	70824	70824	he	80	" What fault could there be in the levitation charm ? "
70856	70866	70824	70824	he	80	" It can play a bit too little role . "
70904	70948	70954	70954	Jon	44	" Even the levitation charm which Professor Flitwick cast could n't make too heavy objects float , it 's not only due to the limitation of magic power and ' will ' , but the charm itself ca n't exert such an effect . "
70971	70979	70968	70968	his	80	" yes , yes , that 's right "
70984	71039	70968	70968	his	80	" But the levitation charm was created a long time ago , and there were many wizards who throughout history tried to improve and innovate it , and what we have been taught now is the limit of what it can achieve , the limit of magic used to control the flight of objects . "
71040	71119	70968	70968	his	80	" It is one limit of the levitation charm , and the other one is the lack of a possibility to use the charm on the wizard , together , the lack of a solution to these two problems has led to the fact that the wizard 's way of conquering the sky now still relies on the flying broom and the magic carpet , an ancient magic tool that has been in use since the Middle Ages . "
71120	71143	70968	70968	his	80	" But since flying broomsticks and magic carpets can fly so high , why is there a limit to the levitation charm ? "
71144	71159	71160	71160	Neville	80	" I have a limit for eating apples , I 'm full in two . "
71168	71184	71160	71160	Neville	80	" Do n't think about those for now , try it , it 's sweet . "
71217	71220	71289	71289	Neville	80	" Thud ! "
71221	71239	71289	71289	Neville	80	" Ah ! Sorry , I did n't mean to , I thought you would catch it . "
71270	71288	71247	71247	Jon	44	" Neville , why do you think the apple fell to the ground after it hit me ? "
71312	71330	71302	71302	he	80	" Are you okay ? Are you dizzy ? Shall I take you to see Professor Slughorn ? "
71331	71340	71302	71302	he	80	" The apple will fall down because of .... "
71364	71383	71354	71354	he	44	" My thoughts were limited ! This world does n't just have magic , it also has science ! "
71384	71413	71417	71417	his	80	" When you threw it out , you were giving it an upward force , but there was actually a downward force pulling it back to the ground ! "
71425	71454	71417	71417	his	80	" Come on , hurry up , before you do something stupid , let 's hurry up and let the professor see if you can still be saved ! "
71465	71513	71417	71417	his	80	" I did n't get smashed silly by an apple ! And I do n't need to let the professor fix me up , I 'm just thinking seriously . Did you ever think about what went through your mind when you were casting the levitation charm ? "
71541	71576	71537	71537	Neville	80	" What Professor Flitwick taught us in class , firm and unwavering belief that the target that the wand is aimed at can float , and then chant the incantation while swinging the wand . "
71577	71598	71599	71599	Jon	44	" Knowing what 's going to happen without knowing what 's happening has always been a characteristic exhibited by magic . "
71614	71651	71609	71609	he	44	" Just like when turning matches into needles , our professors wo n't bother to teach us exactly how the molecular structure of an object changes within the object as it transforms from wood to metal . "
71652	71735	71537	71537	Neville	80	" Same thing with the levitation charm ! Professor Flitwick just told us to think firmly that we could make the feather float but did not tell us what kind of principle is needed to do so , and then the levitation charm we are using presents the simplest and most direct manifestation - an upward force is formed on the object itself , what we call floating is actually just the magic power that carries it up making it almost weightless ! "
71736	71771	71609	71609	he	44	" Magic intervenes with the rules and laws of the world , the wizard initiates the concept of change , and the way to make that change happen is determined by the magic itself ! "
71772	71794	71537	71537	Neville	80	" But what if we actively choose to specify how the magic intervenes with the rules when we cast the spell ? "
71836	71850	71851	71851	Jon	44	" Do you know why the apple fell down after hitting my head ? "
71868	71878	71859	71859	Neville	80	" Because I just threw it at your head . "
71879	71912	71917	71917	Jon	44	" Three hundred years ago a muggle who was also hit in the head by an apple , also pondered this question , and somehow he came up with his own answer . "
71954	71993	71859	71859	Neville	80	" There is a force in this earth where we live , a force that pulls all objects in the land , sea and even sky , and that muggle named Isaac Newton calls this force - gravity ! "
71994	72070	72071	72071	Neville	80	" Hogwarts was founded over nine hundred years ago , and during that time , almost all children with the potential to become wizards were selected for admission to the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry by the age of eleven . Even If a student came from a complete Muggle family , at the age of eleven , how much knowledge of natural science could a student who just graduated from elementary school could learn ? "
72098	72170	72233	72233	he	80	" No matter how smart , these students were basically not exposed to too advanced scientific knowledge , and when they were accepted into Hogwarts and become young wizards studying magic later , it would be even less likely for them to want to understand the science of the Muggles because it would be more worthwhile for them to spend their energy and time to study a few more magic spells . "
72171	72220	72233	72233	he	80	" Coupled with the constraints of the statute of secrecy and the discrimination of traditional wizards against muggles , the magic community has never properly looked at the muggle 's own understanding of the world . Never thought about the deeper changes that magic brought to this world ! "
72239	72248	72233	72233	he	80	" What exactly are you trying to say ? "
72263	72339	72233	72233	he	80	" When we use the levitation charm , what we have in mind is the belief that the object can float , but in fact , there are many ways to make the object float , and the magic itself chooses the simplest and most direct one , forming a force to lift the object up , but what if I can specify a certain way for it to float when I use the spell ? "
72340	72348	72349	72349	Neville	80	" What other way could there be ? "
72451	72455	72411	72411	he	44	" Wingardium Leviosa ! "
72650	72652	72665	72665	Jon	44	" bang "
72799	72806	72779	72780	another person	2050	" How did you do that ? "
72831	72869	72819	72819	he	80	" Just like I told you , devising a way for the levitation charm to make objects float , instead of using the power of magic to hold them up , I just willed to use gravity . "
73028	73031	73020	73020	Jon	44	" levitation charm "
73226	73234	73191	73191	He	99	" What are you brewing , teacher ? "
73235	73284	73285	73285	He	99	" Uh huh , a kind of potion that is very beneficial to the health of the elderly , do n't look at all my sugar consumption , I am quite mindful of my health , after all , no one wants to die in a hospital bed . "
73299	73387	73285	73285	He	99	" Powder of unicorn horn , a small piece of dragon 's liver and a tear of Dumbledore 's pet bird , these three are the core ingredients , along with secondary auxiliary ingredients such as runespoor snakeskin , for example . Do you want some ? Even if you are still young right now , it will still be very beneficial to your growing body , but this cauldron of potion will take a longer time to brew , so you have to wait for it . "
73388	73399	73424	73424	Slughorn	99	" Then I 'll thank you in advance , teacher . "
73400	73423	73285	73285	He	99	" Oh , by the way , why did you come to see me ? Do you have any questions about magic ? "
73443	73460	73433	73433	his	99	" Of course not , but I 've finally made a breakthrough in my levitation charm ! "
73627	73642	73643	73643	He	44	" You sneaked in again ? Are you stealing food from the storage room ? "
73746	73756	73734	73734	he	101	" Are you looking for him again , Hagrid ? "
73822	73832	73787	73787	he	101	" Did you find him in the storage room ? "
73833	73843	73787	73787	he	101	" Yes , he stole a cherry from there . "
73844	73878	73787	73787	he	101	" He always goes there to steal food lately , I have obviously prepared a plate of rock cakes , especially for him , but this little thing still runs into the wagon . "
74302	74337	74278	74278	Neville	80	" It 's time for you to prepare for the exams , Jon , you are always practising the levitation charm , what will you do if you fail the exams of other subjects ? "
74348	74429	74338	74338	Jon	44	" Although I 've indeed been practising the levitation charm , I have n't missed any of my other classes . And Professor Slughorn exempted me from the History of Magic exam because of my excellent evaluations on every single assignment this semester , so I could simply get an Outstanding . Professor Flitwick was also pleased with my Jupiter chart in the last class and similarly exempted me from the astronomy class exam , and Professor Potter , who ... "
74430	74437	74438	74438	Ron	79	" Okay , okay , Jon . "
74441	74443	74438	74438	Ron	79	" bragging "
74449	74507	74438	74438	Ron	79	" we actually just want you to rest , Neville told us that you are practising magic like a demon these days , we are worried that your body and spirit ca n't handle it , let 's take a break today , how about we go to the common room together and play that square tiles ? "
74649	74658	74636	74636	Slughorn	99	" I always thought you would look forward . "
74679	74703	74659	74659	Lily	50	" I 've always looked forward , Teacher , not only for me but also for this James ' wand I 'm holding . "
74704	74716	74659	74659	Lily	50	" But hatred has been pent - up in your heart . "
74717	74752	74659	74659	Lily	50	" Looking forward and carrying hatred in my heart do not conflict with each other ; I have never been blinded by hatred , it has rather made me more sober than ever before . "
74779	74789	74764	74764	Lily	50	" How is that new student of yours doing ? "
74819	74832	74816	74816	his	99	" Excellent , better than any kid I 've ever seen before ! "
74875	74901	74847	74847	she	50	" If he were to hear what you have said about this boy , he would probably be so angry that he would go mad . "
74907	74930	74902	74902	Slughorn	99	" So you should take better care of him in the future , perhaps he 's the moon Dumbledore was talking about . "
74931	74968	74969	74969	Lily	50	" I will treat all students equally , regardless of whether they come from a respectable family or possess talents . Instead of waiting for a moon , why not let a few more stars shine . "
75017	75019	74902	74902	Slughorn	99	" rumble "
75035	75068	75023	75025	The old man	557	" Whether it is the moon or stars , if they need to shine in the world , they always need the wind to help them to disperse the dark clouds . ... "
75117	75133	75134	75134	Lavender	82	" It 's your turn to draw , Jon , what 's wrong with you ? "
75143	75166	75134	75134	Lavender	82	" Is it true that you are practising spells too hard , I can see that you have been having trouble concentrating . "
75198	75212	75179	75179	he	44	" Can it get this dark even if it 's going to rain ? "
75295	75307	75308	75308	Neville	80	" I guess it 's going to rain a lot later . "
75458	75463	75427	75427	Neville	80	" Boom ! ! ! "
75640	75663	75669	75669	her	71	" Do n't panic ! Do n't panic ! Everyone head to the great hall ! Everyone head to the great hall ! "
75935	75948	75949	75949	Dumbledore	61	" This time is different from the previous two instances , gentlemen . "
75966	75985	75949	75949	Dumbledore	61	" They 're practically flooding the area , the Aurors , the Death Eaters , are encircling us . "
76028	76039	76008	76008	he	98	" So they are all set to kill us now . "
76102	76124	76067	76067	McGonagall	71	" We have not found the infiltrator , Albus , if we all leave , then who will protect the children ? "
76146	76162	76141	76141	his	128	" Make a trip to the square and get Kingsley and the men over here . "
76277	76283	76235	76235	He	2134	" Severus Snape ! ! ! "
76360	76367	76368	76368	His	130	" Remember what our Lord said . "
76386	76393	76368	76368	His	130	" Now , let 's begin . "
76527	76529	76500	76500	she	50	" Ah~ "
76567	76578	76538	76538	he	130	" It 's been a long time , Lily Potter ! "
76579	76596	76538	76538	he	130	" How do you still have the face to say this family name from your mouth ! "
76650	76709	76644	76644	he	130	" Why should not I have the face to say this family name , Lily , just because the man who has been bullying me since my student days is dead ? Whose family now has a stinky reputation in the magical world ? Well , that 's something that would make me happy , and as for you-- "
76715	76765	76710	76710	His	130	" Do n't forget , I begged for your life , without me , you would have died that night with that damned pest and that little bastard ! So , you are the one that supposed to be ashamed of how you spoke to your saviour like that ! "
76802	76808	76786	76786	her	50	" Avada Kedavra ! ! ! "
76913	76930	76931	76931	His	130	" After all these years , all you have learned is to retaliate against your saviour ? "
77014	77017	76992	76992	Snape	130	" Sectumsempra ! "
77196	77211	77171	77171	she	71	" Did you leave someone to watch over inside the wagon , Alastor ? ! "
77241	77269	77212	77212	Moody	145	" We are all just guarding the wagon outside right now ! If anyone could get in , it would be only after we are all dead ! "
77270	77302	77303	77303	McGonagall	71	" But there were already their people supposed to be in the wagon ! If you all came out , then how would the children in the wagon be kept safe ! "
77318	77347	77348	77348	His	2163	" Do n't worry , Professor McGonagall , it was Dumbledore 's decision to provide reinforcements outside the wagon , so he would have arranged something for that . "
77440	77445	77426	77426	Slughorn	99	" Horace ! ! ! "
77539	77557	77558	77558	Neville	80	" Do n't worry , with the professor and the others , the school will be fine . "
77699	77725	77680	77680	Ron	79	" How come you become this depressed , Jon , cheer up a bit , you are not behaving like the Jon we knew before . "
77760	77769	77736	77736	he	44	" Can you guys do me a favour ? "
77788	77796	77781	77781	Lavender	159	" Help me attract Filch 's attention . "
77815	77821	77804	77806	the other four	606	" What are you thinking ? "
77842	77872	77822	77822	Neville	80	" I want to go out , but if I just go out like this , Filch will definitely try to stop me , so I need your help . "
77920	77945	77906	77906	Ron	79	" Did you notice something ? Is it up to us to save the school now that the professors are n't on the wagon ? "
77951	77997	77946	77946	Jon	44	" Sorry , it 's not about saving the school , I ca n't tell you what I 'm going to do yet for some reason , but I 'm not going to risk my life or endanger the school , can you help me ? "
78031	78041	78024	78024	his	80	" Are you physically ill right now , Justin ? "
78058	78077	78042	78042	Justin	159	" Ah , yes ! I 'm so sick , that I need someone to look after me . "
78365	78367	78334	78335	the boy	291	" Jon "
78383	78385	78380	78380	Jon	44	" Jon "

78549	78602	78509	78509	he	111	" If you did n't call out my identity , I would have used your face to take this magic stone away , then Horace Slughorn would have died in the battle that is happening outside , and the infiltrator who concealed his identity would have disappeared from this wagon as well . "
78720	78785	78710	78710	he	2204	" This matter has nothing to do with you from the beginning to the end , Jon . Even if someone found out about me pretending to be you , no suspicion would fall on you , everyone knows it 's just a mask used for disguise , even if you 're talented , a first - year kid could n't have done this . "
78831	78846	78813	78813	he	44	" Can you tell me why ? Why did you betray Hogwarts ? Teacher . "
78875	78907	78851	78851	he	99	" How about we make an exchange , how about it ? You tell me exactly how you found me , and I 'll tell you what you want to know . "
79045	79058	79015	79015	he	44	" I never even considered you in the first place , teacher . "
79112	79204	79311	79311	he	99	" On Christmas night , I saw you walking through the corridor , at that time I really thought that the intruder lurking in the wagon might be a goblin or house elf . It was n't until the Christmas holiday passed that , by chance , I learned from Filch about the night of the first attack in the second week of school , he was locked in his office by who knows who and waited until late to be brought back to the great hall by you from inside . "
79205	79301	79311	79311	he	99	" He suspected that the person who locked the door with magic was you , but he just assumed that you did that because of his squib identity and deliberately tried to embarrass him by scaring him . But I remember very clearly that you went out that night from the great hall for a long time , regardless of whether it was you who locked up Filch ; where did you go and what did you do during the time that you left the great hall just lingered in my mind without going away . "
79314	79324	79311	79311	he	99	" And just because of that you suspect me ? "
79325	79338	79339	79339	Jon	44	" I did n't suspect you because of this matter , teacher . "
79345	79407	79339	79339	Jon	44	" You are my teacher and I have a lot of trust in you , even if you acted suspiciously that night , it still ca n't shake my trust in you . But when I went to your office to tell you that I had made significant progress on the levitation charm , I spotted what potion you have made . "
79408	79460	79462	79462	he	99	" You put a dried shredded snake skin into it , and later told me that the ingredients used in the potion had Runespoor skin as an auxiliary , but I knew that snake skin , it was not Runespoor snake at all , but the skin of the Boomslang snake ! "
79475	79501	79472	79472	his	44	" I have read many books in the library , especially after Professor McGonagall gave me permission to borrow forbidden books , in a book called "
79504	79551	79462	79462	he	99	" in the restricted book section , I have seen the introduction of the use of Boomslang skin ! It has only one discovered pharmaceutical use so far , and that is to make a polyjuice potion ! A kind of potion used for human transfiguration ! "
79552	79606	79462	79462	he	99	" I 've caught you lying to me , teacher . If you had just told me you were making a polyjuice potion , I would n't have bothered to doubt your purpose for making such a potion , but you told me it was a cauldron of nourishing elixir for your body ! "
79607	79625	79462	79462	he	99	" After noticing your problem , some other things that you did in the past became clear . "
79655	79825	79644	79644	he	99	" Before the second attack happened , I guessed from the information in the newspaper that the man hiding in the wagon is trying to get the Philosopher 's stone . Nicolas Flamel and Dumbledore 's relationship has always been very good , Hogwarts does not have any source of income but never suffered a bit of financial distress until now , there is a high probability of acquiring Nicolas Flamel 's gift , the Philosopher 's stone can not only make Elixir of Life , it can also turn stone into gold . The second attack later also confirmed my suspicions , both before and after attack against this wagon was in fact just a cover for the man on the wagon , the Ministry of Magic knows very well that with Dumbledore in the picture , no one can destroy this Hogwarts unless the Dark Lord himself comes . They are only providing you with the convenience to succeed in finding what they want you to find . "
79826	79873	79992	79992	Slughorn	99	" What else could there be in this school besides Dumbledore that would be worthy of the attention of that man who has gained great influence over the entire wizarding world ? It can only be that one and only philosopher 's stone in the world ! "
79874	79918	79644	79644	he	99	" But the first two times when the entire wagon was completely unguarded in every room except the great hall , that man still did n't find what he wanted . Then you started to approach that Hagrid 's pet Niffler , teacher . "
79919	79987	79992	79992	Slughorn	99	" After realizing that you could n't find the philosopher 's stone by yourself , you wanted Niffler 's help . I also caught him a few times in front of the door of the storage room , and from that time I roughly deduced that Beech had probably found the location of the philosopher 's stone , which might be inside one of the storage rooms . "
79988	79991	79644	79644	he	99	" Clap ... "
80014	80091	79644	79644	he	99	" Brilliant to the core , Jon . I never thought that a freshman who is only 11 years old and has just been exposed to magic for less than a year has already learned so much . The philosopher stone , the uses of Boomslang snake skin , the effect of polyjuice potion , even if you find an adult wizard , he / she may not be able to fully understand all these things . "
80092	80126	79644	79644	he	99	" I already regarded you high enough , but I did n't expect to actually underestimate you , to have a student like you is indeed a dream come true for countless teachers . "
80136	80184	80127	80127	Jon	44	" In that case , teacher , why are you still doing this ? Is n't it good to stay at Hogwarts ? You said to me when you first taught me the occlumency magic , you think staying here as a professor is actually not bad . "
80202	80254	80193	80193	he	99	" When I said that , I was n't lying to you . The time I was first tricked into boarding on this wagon by Dumbledore , I did think it would be okay to just stay here and teach , but it is impossible for people to remain the same . "
80270	80281	80255	80255	His	99	" Do you think this Hogwarts really has a future ? "
80305	80414	80255	80255	His	99	" There is not even a tiny glimmer of a future ! Yes , it is warm and harmonious here , but how long can such an illusion of peace and harmony last under the general trend ? Do you know what that student of mine has been doing now ? He is uniting the pureblood forces of other magical societies throughout Europe , intending to completely integrate the entire power of the European magical community ! His authority is getting stronger and stronger , and this Hogwarts led by Dumbledore ? After seven years of being a fugitive , he did n't even dare to leave England ! "
80423	80443	80255	80255	His	99	" So just because you ca n't see any hope , you 're going to join the wrong side ? "
80444	80455	80456	80456	Slughorn	99	" There is no such thing as right and wrong . "
80466	80538	80456	80456	Slughorn	99	" Now it 's just that the resistance forces led by Dumbledore are still present , that 's why you think that man 's philosophy is wrong , but if you think about it in another way , he can actually bring more benefits to wizards . In the adult world , as long as the vast majority of this society gains the benefits , then the whole thing is right . "
80539	80554	80555	80555	Jon	44	" The Dark Lord can bring greater benefits to the vast majority of wizards ? "
80563	80581	80555	80555	Jon	44	" I do n't understand , teacher , who exactly does oppression and inequality bring benefits to ! "
80582	80708	80456	80456	Slughorn	99	" The redistribution of benefits in society always involves a period of pain , and muggle wizards will inevitably suffer a little now , but the philosophy of that student of mine has changed a lot , he used to think that only dead muggles are good muggles , and now he can tolerate muggle wizards becoming slaves , is n't this good progress ? When he gets what he wants , he will try to attract more people in order to consolidate his authority . By then , the resources of the entire magical world will become more integrated and the status of muggle wizards will be further improved , and the magical world will definitely become much better than its previous scattered existence . "
80732	80783	80724	80724	Jon	44	" Although I 'm young , I 've only heard of snakes eating their food till their stomachs burst , but I never knew of a snake that would spit out the food it had stuffed into its stomach again even if it becomes too much for its body size ! "
80784	80792	80793	80793	Slughorn	99	" Aha , excellent analogy , Jon . "
80796	80827	80793	80793	Slughorn	99	" But what if that student of mine is not a snake ? The talent and heart he is showing right now can definitely be described as a great leader . "
80828	80843	80724	80724	Jon	44	" Praising in such a manner will only make others feel ridiculed and ridiculous . "
80868	80898	80846	80846	his	99	" I 've talked to you long enough , if I want to leave , are you sure you can stop me and hold on until Dumbledore come back ? "
81327	81346	81309	81309	he	44	" How can we know the result if we do n't give it a try ? Slughorn teacher . "
81347	81363	81367	81367	he	99	" To attempt to be brave is certainly a choice that one will never regret . "
81391	81425	81375	81375	he	99	" If Hogwarts is still the same Hogwarts , I 'm still the same Slytherin Head , then regardless of what , I would have taught you especially when you entered Slytherin House . "
81426	81441	81442	81442	Jon	44	" Would such a pureblood house accept a student with a mudblood like me ? "
81455	81498	81367	81367	he	99	" A true Slytherin is never judged by bloodline as an absolute standard , as long as the heart is noble , visionary , and willing to take absolutely daring action for their goals and ambitions , that is a perfect Slytherin . "
81499	81530	81449	81449	Slughorn	99	" And then ? Now in that Hogwarts castle with the snake as the school crest , is there a person who can be called a perfect Slytherin like this ? "
81531	81567	81568	81568	Slughorn	99	" I 'm sorry , actually , after leaving my position as Head of Slytherin , I never went back to that castle , but after I leave from here , I might visit there . "
81604	81656	81595	81595	his	99	" That 's all for today , Jon . Do n't worry , I 'm looking forward to what you can grow into when we next meet , so no matter what choice you make , whether you stop me in the end or not , I wo n't hurt you . "
81673	81676	81667	81667	his	99	" Stupefy . "
81688	81693	81677	81677	Jon	44	" Wingardium - Leviosa ! "
82126	82180	82119	82119	his	44	" Wake up ! Teacher ! If the dark lord really respects you and wants to welcome you , then why did he corner you like that during the second attack ! If your reaction had been half a second slower , then you would have really let his men blow you up ! "
82181	82184	82185	82185	His	44	" Bang ! "
82231	82302	82228	82228	his	99	" I 'm more sober than anyone else in the world , Jon , and it 's because he has that kind of character that he can actually do what he wants to do . This is similarly your biggest drawback , if you can refrain from putting so much weight on your feelings in your future , then I am sure that your future achievements will not be low . "
82439	82444	82418	82418	He	44	" Petrificus - Totalus ! "
82573	82622	82626	82626	he	44	" A very satisfactory full body - bind curse , first - year students should not be taught about this in their classes at all , you have already surpassed the vast majority of your peers by being able to reach this level just by self - study . "
82682	82715	82660	82660	his	44	" I originally intended to give you a surprise the day I saw you brewing the polyjuice potion , teacher . But now it 's not too late to let you know . "
82758	82769	82741	82741	his	44	" Win - Gardi - Um - Le - Viosa- ! "
82775	82778	82741	82741	his	44	" Levitation Charm "
83341	83344	83369	83369	he	99	" levitation charm "
83419	83430	83369	83369	he	99	" You 've really surprised me enough today , Jon . "
83455	83499	83448	83448	his	1323	" How long has it been , less than half a year , less than half a year since you actually started to learn this way of casting spells , and you have already accomplished the most perfect mastery of one magic spell . "
83500	83527	83448	83448	his	1323	" But even if you perform shockingly well , and you can truly fly with this spell , will it make any difference to the outcome ? "
83842	83846	83856	83856	he	44	" Wingardium Leviosa ! "
84126	84129	84178	84178	Slughorn	99	" levitation charm "
84247	84266	84206	84206	he	99	" This outcome is a foregone conclusion , Jon , but you have certainly opened my eyes today . "
84328	84383	84428	84429	the caster	2276	" I will wait by the side of that student of mine until the day this wagon really comes to the end of the road , and for the sake of having taught here for two years , I will try to persuade him to leave a way out for you and other students . "
84559	84563	84549	84549	Jon	44	" Professor Dumbledore ? "
84653	84655	84638	84638	Dumbledore	56	" ... "
84775	84820	84764	84764	Dumbledore	56	" That was a beautiful levitation charm at the end , Jon , and I 've never seen a student use such a basic spell in such an exceptional way . If it were n't for me , Horace would have been disgraced tonight . "
84900	84902	84886	84886	he	56	" Professor- "
84929	85010	84914	84914	his	56	" I know you have a lot to ask me , but this may not be the right place for a long conversation . Kingsley and the men should have just brought the injured Lily into the wagon by now , and Filius and Minerva are still searching for Horace 's ' body ' in the pouring rain . If you do n't mind , you can come with me to my office where we can have a nice chat . "
85254	85326	85331	85331	Dumbledore	56	" When I first received this letter , I was wondering who exactly might have such keen observation and in - depth magical world general knowledge reserves , at first I thought it might be either Minerva or Filius , but if it was really them , there would be no need for this letter to appear , they would simply come to me and clear it up face to face . "
85339	85381	85331	85331	Dumbledore	56	" I could n't have guessed that the person who delivered this letter to me was actually just a new student who had only been at Hogwarts for less than a year or a student that Horace had just got himself . "
85426	85477	85389	85389	his	56	" So , professor , you knew from the beginning about the teacher and his intention to steal the philosopher 's stone ? Or rather , from the beginning you worked with him to plan for him to steal the philosopher 's stone and send it to the Dark Lord ? "
85495	85648	85480	85480	his	56	" The owner of the philosopher 's stone - Nicolas Flamel is my dear friend who I spend a great deal of time with , we once worked together to discover the twelve uses of dragon 's blood , and because of that , we developed a deep friendship . At the beginning of this journey of exile , he was the one who gave us financial support by using the philosopher 's stone to turn gold , which enabled the daily operation of this school , but three years ago , after he witnessed the dark reign of the Dark Lord in Britain and reaching a certain secret pact with the French magical government , he no longer wanted to stay in this filthy magical world . So he gifted me his most precious possession , the philosopher 's stone , and then accepted his own death openly with his wife . "
85649	85779	85480	85480	his	56	" Before he died , he made a trip to the British Ministry of Magic under the guise of his philosopher 's stone being stolen and met with the most powerful Dark Lord , where he ridiculed his policies and ambitions , laughed at his self - righteous pureblood pride , and vented all his dissatisfaction with the way he had turned the world into . The Dark Lord had indeed changed a lot compared to before , he was not even slightly annoyed by Nick 's mockery , but accepted his criticism calmly and finally sent someone to escort him safely back home . It was just , after that day , he began to send his men to search for the whereabouts of the philosopher 's stone . "
85780	85838	85480	85480	his	56	" He actually must have known very well that there could only be one place the philosopher 's stone could possibly end up , and that would be my hand . Well , given that , I of course found a suitable reason and way to deliver this stone that he wanted to get into his hands . "
85870	85875	85480	85480	his	56	" Then the teacher he- "
85876	86003	85480	85480	his	56	" He is the most suitable person , he has been the head of Slytherin for nearly fifty years , and almost all the pureblood wizards who now occupy important positions in the Ministry of Magic are his students . The people who think they are familiar with him also know about his timid and fearful character , and the Slughorn family is also one of the most prominent pureblood families in the magical world , and all of these together wo n't let anyone have any doubts about his status and bloodline nature . Even if he had taught in this wagon for a year , it would only make people think that he was actually duped into this by me in the first place . "
86004	86054	85480	85480	his	56	" Taking the philosopher 's stone back will gain him the welcome of all Death Eaters and pureblood families , and then he will enter the inner circle of the dark lord , and provide us some vital intelligence and information without anyone knowing during the most critical period . "
86607	86611	86591	86591	someone	1060	" House Head ! "
86824	86830	86807	86807	he	99	" Welcome back , Professor . "
86903	86936	86956	86956	he	56	" Professor , I do n't understand , why would the Dark Lord want the philosopher 's stone so badly ? Also , would he really believe that teacher has betrayed us ? "
86969	87089	86956	86956	he	56	" The philosopher 's stone is indeed basically not that attractive to him , the entire British magical world is his , even if that stone can create more wealth , can it be more than that ? As for the elixir of life , he has always been disdainful of such means that rely on foreign objects to obtain immortality , he will never place his trust about life in other things , even if it is a dead thing . The only thing that is somewhat attractive to him is the alchemical significance of the philosopher 's stone itself , but this is certainly not attractive enough for him to go to such lengths to get it . "
87090	87115	87143	87143	his	61	" The philosopher 's stone is not what matters to him , whether the stone is in my hands or not is the point . "
87120	87140	87116	87116	Jon	44	" He does not want Hogwarts to rely on this stone to continue to survive in the wizarding world ? "
87161	87175	87143	87143	his	61	" He just did n't want me to drink the elixir of life . "
87295	87302	87303	87303	Dumbledore	61	" But he obviously underestimated me . "
87307	87327	87303	87303	Dumbledore	61	" When even he did n't regard that false immortality highly , how will I bother to use it ? "
87328	87358	87451	87451	Jon	44	" As for , how can I be sure that he would believe that Horace really betrayed me to join him , it really does n't matter at all . "
87359	87450	87303	87303	Dumbledore	61	" He has never given his trust to anyone , for him , it does not matter whether the people who pledged their allegiance to him are loyal or not , what matters is whether the people under him can create the value for him as they should , of course , there are times when absolute loyalty is also a value . And until it is certain that Horace really has absolute loyalty to him , the matter of Horace 's betrayal itself is already a very valuable thing . "
87459	87469	87451	87451	Jon	44	" To help him gather the hearts of people ? "
87476	87540	87470	87470	Dumbledore	61	" We have been wanted for seven years , during which time he has barely gained any significant results against us , even if his absolute authority in the magical community has not wavered in the slightest , but after all , there are numerous people under him , and he needs to give those who are wavering some confidence to rely on . "
87725	87776	87706	87707	The sir	2364	" I actually always miss Professor Dumbledore , when I was in school , in addition to you , only he took good care of me , but unfortunately there was not much opportunity to see him again over the years , I wonder if he is living well recently ? "
87795	87861	87781	87781	his	99	" Albus is getting old after all , and he has spent all day in the wagon travelling without much free time , I heard that he has been suffering from serious insomnia lately , he ca n't even eat much ; for a good piece of steak , he can only move his fork at most twice before he ca n't eat it anymore . "
87953	87961	87962	87962	He	1406	" Ah , that 's really unfortunate . "
87966	87998	87962	87962	He	1406	" I just ate a plate of beef ribs with Cornelius , Professor Dumbledore should be like me and eat a little more normally , health is the most important thing . "
88009	88044	87999	88002	Minister of Magic Fudge	164	" Or sir 's appetite is excellent , I have been suffering from stomach problems in the past two days , just now I have not eaten more than a few pieces at all . "
88059	88105	88045	88047	The great sir	1406	" Professor Dumbledore has suffered , I will pick him up later so that he can enjoy his old age , otherwise he has to run around like a child at such an old age , what is the point of torturing himself like this ? "
88126	88139	88045	88047	The great sir	1406	" But there 's one thing I do n't understand , Professor . "
88152	88205	88140	88140	Jon	44	" If the Dark Lord could let Teacher steal the philosopher 's stone from the wagon , why not let him do something more worthwhile ? For instance , the teacher has revealed our exact location to him three times in a row , so why did n't he come over himself ? "
88220	88250	88214	88214	his	56	" So what you 're really trying to ask is why he did n't just wipe us out when he obviously had the opportunity to do so , right ? "
88313	88370	88376	88376	Dumbledore	56	" Jon , as I told you before , he 's not worried about the philosopher 's stone creating wealth for Hogwarts or anyone else around me , he 's afraid that I 'll be able to rely on that stone to continue to live , and the answer to your question is actually the same . "
88838	88891	88824	88824	Dumbledore	56	" No need to feel bad for me , Jon , I 'm not doing this for anyone , it 's just something I want to do . Just like your teacher , if it was in the past , who would have believed he actually had the guts to go undercover ? "
88929	88960	88892	88892	Jon	44	" Professor , I want to know , how did you lose to the Dark Lord at that time ? Is he really so powerful that no one can defeat him ?
89073	89118	89067	89068	the gentleman	2408	" If you join me , you can be a minister of magic for a while , professor . It just so happens that Cornelius talked to me just now , saying that he feels overwhelmed with the management of the Ministry of Magic . "
89192	89231	89181	89181	his	162	" Ah , it would be great if Professor Slughorn could take over my position , his ability is obvious to all , and I believe the Ministry of Magic will definitely become much better under his leadership . "
89253	89310	89249	89249	he	99	" I 'm getting older , and it 's not easy to manage the Ministry of Magic for you , you should help me find an easy job to enjoy my life , but of course , the pay should not be less , I heard that the crystallised pineapples in Diagon Alley are not cheap . "
89344	89396	89399	89399	he	99	" What professor said does seem reasonable , and it is time for you to enjoy your life , but it is also true that crystallised pineapples are not all that cheap , and the salary of a normal job will not be enough for you to eat them every day . "
89413	89438	89404	89404	he	99	" I remember you mentioning that the one who manages the Department of International Magical Co - operation does n't want to work there ? "
89445	89507	89439	89439	Fudge	162	" He has been complaining that those Frenchmen simply do n't want to communicate at all , and the first few times they met , they even got to the point of raising their wands , and he talked to you about it before , saying that he actually wanted to go back to the Death Eaters more than anything else . "
89508	89533	89534	89534	He	99	" Then let him return , after this night the guards are estimated to have a few spots vacant , give him a place . "
89558	89639	89534	89534	He	99	" Professor , you should be the head of the Department of International Magic Cooperation , it 's much more reassuring for me to leave it to you than to those baboons who can only wave their wands . The position of deputy Minister of Magic will also be added to you , you are my professor , after all , even if you become head of the department , you ca n't just be the head of the department . "
89774	89780	89755	89755	he	99	" For the Purest Blood ! "
89807	89813	89783	89787	the male and female wizards	2422	" For the Purest Blood ! "
89854	89947	89846	89846	he	56	" The Dark Lord 's gift of magic , especially dark magic , is unprecedented . But previously , his will had always been very chaotic , and he could even be described as crazy , which made his dark magic more powerful and uncontrollable , yet also made him influenced by the ' will ' of magic , rather than controlling magic with his ' Will ' ; he and his organization brought unspeakable terror to the magical world , a terror which only made countless people oppose his rule spontaneously . "
89948	90009	89846	89846	he	56	" But after a certain day , he changed beyond everyone 's recognition . He became more like his former self , adept at disguise , knowing how to refine his desires with nobler goals , knowing how to unite those around him with something other than just violence , and knowing even better how to truly master his power . "
90010	90088	89846	89846	he	56	" After that , the winds of the magical world began to change , and he eroded the Ministry of Magic almost completely without a sound ; when Hogwarts Castle became the only place that could stand against him . It was at that time he proposed a fair duel with me on his own initiative , and on the very day of the duel - that same night - he led his men into Hogwarts Castle . "
90089	90152	89846	89846	he	56	" The students were all hidden in the kitchens ' underground cellar , the faculty and others who opposed his rule were constantly fighting in the corridors , the lawns , and all over the classrooms of the castle , and he was engaged in a final showdown with me on the very highest place in the castle , the Astronomy Tower . "
90218	90229	90230	90230	Dumbledore	56	" In the end , it was me who lost . "
90234	90330	90230	90230	Dumbledore	56	" His spell knocked me to the ground , his wand was lit up with a killing curse , and I still remember very clearly what he said to me : ' Professor Dumbledore , I proved to you that the most powerful magic in the world is not that bullshit love , but something greater , something more fascinating ! ' , and then it was Fawkes who saved me just before his Killing Curse could even be released , and that was the night he managed to rule the entire British magical community . "
90356	90382	90331	90331	He	56	" And from that day on , this wand became ordinary in my hands , because I am no longer worthy of being its master . "
90383	90465	90331	90331	He	56	" As for the second question you asked , Jon ; is he really invincible or not , as a loser , I ca n't give you a definite answer , but what I can tell you is that even if he had defeated me once , he ca n't guarantee that he can still beat me the second and third time like the first time , even if the wand in my hand can no longer exert its full power . "
90473	90534	90466	90466	Dumbledore	56	" The power that makes him immensely powerful came from an unknown source , but this power must be unstable , otherwise he would n't have tried to keep dragging things out with me like this and let time wear down my magic . Since he has something to be wary of , this means he is far from invincible . "
90737	90750	90732	90732	his	56	" I heard from Horace that you are very talented in Occlumency ? "
90761	90774	90751	90751	Jon	44	" My teacher did mention that I learned this magic quite well . "
90785	90802	90781	90781	he	56	" So Jon , I wonder if you would be willing to help me with something ? "
91219	91221	91223	91223	he	44	" death "
91383	91446	91447	91447	Neville	80	" I can understand your feelings , Jon ; when my mother left me back then I also thought I would probably never be happy again , but actually , no matter what , living people always have to look forward , after all , we 're not living only for ourselves , but also for those who have died for us . "
91480	91504	91506	91506	he	44	" Do n't worry , there is nothing wrong with me , I wo n't be sullen like this simply because of this . "
91849	91851	91841	91842	The professors	2537	" body "
