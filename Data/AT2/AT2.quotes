962	965	972	973	Mrs. Griffiths	180	" fast set "
1057	1065	1066	1066	she	180	" Now , where have you been ? "
1092	1098	1100	1100	Bella	183	" Just think , Mamma , "
1107	1348	1100	1100	Bella	183	" The Finchleys are going to give up their place out at Greenwood Lake this coming summer and go up to Twelfth Lake near Pine Point . They 're going to build a new bungalow up there . And Sondra says that this time it 's going to be right down at the water 's edge — not away from it , as it is out here . And they 're going to have a great big verandah with a hardwood floor . And a boathouse big enough for a thirty - foot electric launch that Mr. Finchley is going to buy for Stuart . Wo n't that be wonderful ? And she says that if you will let me , that I can come up there for all summer long , or for as long as I like . And Gil , too , if he will . It 's just across the lake from the Emery Lodge , you know , and the East Gate Hotel . And the Phants ' place , you know , the Phants of Utica , is just below theirs near Sharon . Is n't that just wonderful ? Wo n't that be great ? I wish you and Dad would make up your minds to build up there now sometime , Mamma . It looks to me now as though nearly everybody that 's worth anything down here is moving up there . "
1421	1447	1416	1416	she	490	" Yes ? Well , what about the Anthonys and the Nicholsons and the Taylors ? I have n't heard of their leaving Greenwood yet . "
1448	1550	1416	1416	she	490	" Oh , I know , not the Anthonys or the Nicholsons or the Taylors . Who expects them to move ? They 're too old fashioned . They 're not the kind that would move anywhere , are they ? No one thinks they are . Just the same Greenwood is n't like Twelfth Lake . You know that yourself . And all the people that are anybody down on the South Shore are going up there for sure . The Cranstons next year , Sondra says . And after that , I bet the Harriets will go , too . "
1551	1563	1565	1566	her mother	447	" The Cranstons and the Harriets and the Finchleys and Sondra , "
1574	1592	1565	1566	her mother	447	" The Cranstons and you and Bertine and Sondra — that 's all I hear these days . "
1790	1936	1939	1940	Mrs. Griffiths	180	" How often have I told you that I do n't want you to have so much to do with Bertine or that Letta Harriet or her brother either ? They 're too forward . They run around and talk and show off too much . And your father feels the same as I do in regard to them . As for Sondra Finchley , if she expects to go with Bertine and you , too , then you 're not going to go with her either much longer . Besides I 'm not sure that your father approves of your going anywhere without some one to accompany you . You 're not old enough yet . And as for your going to Twelfth Lake to the Finchleys , well , unless we all go together , there 'll be no going there , either . "
2041	2050	2052	2052	Bella	183	" Not old enough , not old enough , "
2055	2116	2052	2052	Bella	183	" Will you listen ? I 'll be eighteen in July . I 'd like to know when you and Papa are going to think I 'm old enough to go anywhere without you both . Wherever you two go , I have to go , and wherever I want to go , you two have to go , too . "
2117	2120	2140	2140	she	447	" Bella , "
2143	2200	2140	2140	she	447	" Of course , what else would you have us do ? When you are twenty - one or two , if you are not married by then , it will be time enough to think of going off by yourself . But at your age , you should n't be thinking of any such thing . "
2548	2558	2531	2531	Bella	183	" Oh , Gil , can I come in ? "
2559	2562	2563	2563	He	200	" Sure . "
2584	2590	2531	2531	Bella	183	" Where are you going ? "
2591	2602	2531	2531	Bella	183	" Nowhere , for dinner . To the Wynants afterwards . "
2603	2611	2531	2531	Bella	183	" Oh , Constance to be sure . "
2612	2629	2531	2531	Bella	183	" No , not Constance , to be sure . Where do you get that stuff ? "
2630	2638	2531	2531	Bella	183	" As though I did n't know . "
2639	2652	2531	2531	Bella	183	" Lay off . Is that what you came in here for ? "
2653	2734	2531	2531	Bella	183	" No , that is n't what I came in here for . What do you think ? The Finchleys are going to build a place up at Twelfth Lake next summer , right on the lake , next to the Phants , and Mr. Finchley 's going to buy Stuart a thirty - foot launch and build a boathouse with a sun - parlor right over the water to hold it . Wo n't that be swell , huh ? "
2735	2779	2531	2531	Bella	183	" Do n't say ' swell . ' And do n't say ' huh . ' Ca n't you learn to cut out the slang ? You talk like a factory girl . Is that all they teach you over at that school ? "
2780	2806	2531	2531	Bella	183	" Listen to who 's talking about cutting out slang . How about yourself ? You set a fine example around here , I notice . "
2807	2836	2531	2531	Bella	183	" Well , I 'm five years older than you are . Besides I 'm a man . You do n't notice Myra using any of that stuff . "
2837	2904	2531	2531	Bella	183	" Oh , Myra . But do n't let 's talk about that . Only think of that new house they 're going to build and the fine time they 're going to have up there next summer . Do n't you wish we could move up there , too ? We could if we wanted to — if Papa and Mamma would agree to it . "
2905	2919	2531	2531	Bella	183	" Oh , I do n't know that it would be so wonderful , "
2934	2943	2531	2531	Bella	183	" There are other places besides Twelfth Lake . "
2944	3029	3030	3030	Bella	183	" Who said there were n't ? But not for the people that we know around here . Where else do the best people from Albany and Utica go but there now , I 'd like to know . It 's going to become a regular center , Sondra says , with all the finest houses along the west shore . Just the same , the Cranstons , the Lamberts , and the Harriets are going to move up there pretty soon , too , "
3037	3067	3030	3030	Bella	183	" That wo n't leave so many out at Greenwood Lake , nor the very best people , either , even if the Anthonys and Nicholsons do stay here . "
3068	3078	3080	3080	Gilbert	200	" Who says the Cranstons are going up there ? "
3087	3092	3030	3030	Bella	183	" Why , Sondra ! "
3093	3098	3030	3030	Bella	183	" Who told her ? "
3099	3102	3030	3030	Bella	183	" Bertine . "
3103	3113	3115	3116	her brother	4719	" Gee , they 're getting gayer and gayer , "
3123	3134	3135	3135	He	200	" Pretty soon Lycurgus'll be too small to hold 'em . "
3318	3321	3322	3322	he	539	" Well , "
3329	3356	3322	3322	he	539	" they 're spreading out faster than I would if I had their business . They 're not the richest people in the world , either . "
3389	3395	3397	3397	Bella	183	" And what 's more , "
3400	3435	3397	3397	Bella	183	" the Finchleys are to have a dance floor over the boathouse . And Sondra says that Stuart was hoping that you would come up there and spend a lot of time this summer . "
3436	3442	3444	3444	Gilbert	200	" Oh , did he ? "
3452	3478	3444	3444	Gilbert	200	" You mean he said he was hoping you would come up and spend a lot of time . I 'll be working this summer . "
3479	3526	3397	3397	Bella	183	" He did n't say anything of the kind , smarty . Besides it would n't hurt us any if we did go up there . There 's nothing much out at Greenwood any more that I can see . A lot of old hen parties . "
3527	3539	3444	3444	Gilbert	200	" Is that so ? Mother would like to hear that . "
3540	3549	3397	3397	Bella	183	" And you 'll tell her , of course "
3550	3598	3444	3444	Gilbert	200	" Oh , no , I wo n't either . But I do n't think we 're going to follow the Finchleys or the Cranstons up to Twelfth Lake just yet , either . You can go up there if you want , if Dad'll let you . "
4110	4115	4116	4116	she	183	" Oh , Daddy , "
4128	4133	4116	4116	she	183	" Is that you ? "
4134	4156	4123	4123	she	183	" Yes . At least it feels a little like me at the present moment . How 's my baby girl ? "
4172	4187	4188	4188	he	510	" There 's a good , strong , healthy girl , I 'll say , "
4199	4218	4188	4188	he	510	" And how 's the bad girl been behaving herself since I left ? No fibbing this time . "
4219	4239	4123	4123	she	183	" Oh , just fine , Daddy . You can ask any one . I could n't be better . "
4240	4245	4188	4188	he	510	" And your mother ? "
4246	4271	4123	4123	she	183	" She 's all right , Daddy . She 's up in her room . I do n't think she heard you come in . "
4272	4283	4188	4188	he	510	" And Myra ? Is she back from Albany yet ? "
4284	4310	4123	4123	she	183	" Yes . She 's in her room . I heard her playing just now . I just got in myself a little while ago . "
4311	4324	4325	4325	He	573	" Ay , hai . Gadding about again . I know you . "
4355	4367	4368	4368	she	183	" Oh , no , I was n't either , now , "
4374	4469	4368	4368	she	183	" Just see how you pick on me , Daddy . I was only over with Sondra for a little while . And what do you think , Daddy ? They 're going to give up the place at Greenwood and build a big handsome bungalow up on Twelfth Lake right away . And Mr. Finchley 's going to buy a big electric launch for Stuart and they 're going to live up there next summer , maybe all the time , from May until October . And so are the Cranstons , maybe . "
4656	4662	4663	4663	he	200	" I say , Dad , "
4666	4685	4663	4663	he	200	" I have an interesting thing I want to see you about in the morning . Can I ? "
4686	4700	4730	4730	Griffiths	180	" All right , I 'll be there . Come in about noon . "
4701	4714	4716	4717	Mrs. Griffiths	180	" Come on all , or the dinner will be getting cold , "
4814	4937	4982	4983	Griffiths senior	588	" What do you think , Mamma ? Rosetta Nicholson , that niece of Mrs. Disston Nicholson , who was over here last summer from Albany — you know , she came over the night of the Alumnae Garden Party on our lawn — you remember — the young girl with the yellow hair and squinty blue eyes — her father owns that big wholesale grocery over there — well , she 's engaged to that Herbert Tickham of Utica , who was visiting Mrs. Lambert last summer . You do n't remember him , but I do . He was tall and dark and sorta awkward , and awfully pale , but very handsome — oh , a regular movie hero . "
4938	4946	4948	4948	Gilbert	215	" There you go , Mrs. Griffiths , "
4956	4981	4948	4948	Gilbert	215	" A delegation from the Misses Snedeker 's Select School sneaks off to the movies to brush up on heroes from time to time . "
4987	5010	5011	5011	He	588	" I had a curious experience in Chicago this time , something I think the rest of you will be interested in . "
5055	5064	5066	5066	Bella	183	" Oh , what is it , Daddy ? "
5070	5077	5066	5066	Bella	183	" Do tell me about it . "
5078	5086	5088	5088	Gilbert	215	" Spin the big news , Dad , "
5109	5175	5176	5176	He	539	" Well , while I was in Chicago at the Union League Club , I met a young man who is related to us , a cousin of you three children , by the way , the eldest son of my brother Asa , who is out in Denver now , I understand . I have n't seen or heard from him in thirty years . "
5182	5194	5196	5196	Bella	183	" Not the one who is a preacher somewhere , Daddy ? "
5201	5247	5291	5294	a western hotel proprietor	595	" Yes , the preacher . At least I understand he was for a while after he left home . But his son tells me he has given that up now . He 's connected with something in Denver — a hotel , I think . "
5248	5256	5258	5258	Bella	183	" But what 's his son like ? "
5296	5305	5307	5307	Gilbert	215	" A cousin ? How old is he ? "
5320	5334	5336	5336	Griffiths	183	" Well , he 's a very interesting young man , I think , "
5358	5401	5402	5402	He	596	" He 's quite good - looking and well - mannered , too — about your own age , I should say , Gil , and looks a lot like you — very much so — same eyes and mouth and chin . "
5409	5435	5402	5402	He	596	" He 's a little bit taller , if anything , and looks a little thinner , though I do n't believe he really is . "
5587	5594	5595	5595	he	594	" What 's he doing now ? "
5617	5632	5634	5635	Samuel Griffiths	179	" Well , he has n't much of a job , I must say , "
5639	5760	5634	5635	Samuel Griffiths	179	" He 's only a bell - hop in the Union League Club in Chicago , at present , but a very pleasant and gentlemanly sort of a boy , I will say . I was quite taken with him . In fact , because he told me there was n't much opportunity for advancement where he was , and that he would like to get into something where there was more chance to do something and be somebody , I told him that if he wanted to come on here and try his luck with us , we might do a little something for him — give him a chance to show what he could do , at least . "
5979	5996	5997	5997	she	180	" Oh , you 're going to give him a place , are you , Dad ? "
6000	6019	5997	5997	she	180	" That 's interesting . I hope he 's better - looking than the rest of our cousins . "
6020	6023	6025	6026	Mrs. Griffiths	180	" Bella , "
6080	6106	6107	6107	he	614	" Of course we 're not turning away applicants who want to come in and learn the business right along now , as it is , "
6111	6117	6119	6120	his father	539	" Oh , I know , "
6122	6180	6107	6107	he	614	" but not cousins and nephews exactly . Besides he looks very intelligent and ambitious to me . It would n't do any great harm if we let at least one of our relatives come here and show what he can do . I ca n't see why we should n't employ him as well as another . "
6181	6205	6207	6207	Bella	183	" I do n't believe Gil likes the idea of any other fellow in Lycurgus having the same name and looking like him , "
6230	6236	6237	6237	Gilbert	215	" Oh , what rot ! "
6241	6275	6237	6237	Gilbert	215	" Why do n't you make a sensible remark once in a while ? What do I care whether he has the same name or not — or looks like me , either ? "
6285	6288	6290	6291	his mother	587	" Gilbert ! "
6295	6309	6290	6291	his mother	587	" How can you talk so ? And to your sister , too ? "
6310	6337	6340	6340	Griffiths	180	" Well , I do n't want to do anything in connection with this young man if it 's going to cause any hard feelings here , "
6343	6367	6340	6340	Griffiths	180	" All I know is that his father was never very practical and I doubt if Clyde has ever had a real chance . "
6386	6429	6430	6430	He	588	" My only idea in bringing him on here was to give him a start . I have n't the faintest idea whether he would make good or not . He might and again he might not . If he did n't — "
6441	6458	6430	6430	He	588	" If he does n't , we will have to toss him aside , of course . "
6459	6473	6475	6476	Mrs. Griffiths	180	" Well , I think that 's very kind of you , father , "
6482	6489	6475	6476	Mrs. Griffiths	180	" I hope he proves satisfactory . "
6490	6497	6499	6499	Griffiths	180	" And there 's another thing , "
6504	6693	6499	6499	Griffiths	180	" I do n't expect this young man , so long as he is in my employ and just because he 's a nephew of mine , to be treated differently to any other employee in the factory . He 's coming here to work — not play . And while he is here , trying , I do n't expect any of you to pay him any social attention — not the slightest . He 's not the sort of boy anyhow , that would want to put himself on us — at least he did n't impress me that way , and he would n't be coming down here with any notion that he was to be placed on an equal footing with any of us . That would be silly . Later on , if he proves that he is really worth while , able to take care of himself , knows his place and keeps it , and any of you wanted to show him any little attention , well , then it will be time enough to see , but not before then . "
6784	6799	6800	6800	Myra	182	" I would like to see what he 's like , would n't you ? "
6805	6833	6802	6803	her mother	447	" Yes . And I do hope he measures up to all of your father 's expectations . He will not feel right if he does n't . "
6834	6841	6843	6843	Gilbert	215	" I ca n't get this , "
6845	6889	6843	6843	Gilbert	215	" bringing people on now when we can hardly take care of those we have . And besides , imagine what the bunch around here will say if they find out that our cousin was only a bell - hop before coming here ! "
6890	6906	6908	6908	Myra	182	" Oh , well , they wo n't have to know that , will they ? "
6910	6947	6948	6948	His	631	" Oh , wo n't they ? Well , what 's to prevent him from speaking about it — unless we tell him not to — or some one coming along who has seen him there . "
6953	6975	6948	6948	His	631	" At any rate , I hope he does n't . It certainly would n't do us any good around here . "
6980	7005	6977	6977	Bella	183	" I hope he 's not dull as Uncle Allen 's two boys . They 're the most uninteresting boys I ever did see . "
7006	7009	7011	7012	her mother	447	" Bella , "
8478	8481	8474	8474	Ratterer	224	" Clyde ! "
8502	8527	8490	8490	he	672	" Well , of all things ! The devil ! Whaddya know ? Put ' er there . Where do you come from anyhow ? "
8536	8555	8529	8529	Clyde	201	" Well , by jing , if it ai n't Tom . Whaddya know ? You working here ? "
8579	8598	8556	8556	Ratterer	224	" That 's right . Surest thing you know . Been here for nearly a year , now . "
8615	8618	8619	8619	he	672	" Silence ! "
8647	8683	8640	8640	Clyde	201	" Ssh ! I 'm working here under my own name , but I 'd rather not let 'em know I 'm from K. C. , see . I 'm supposed to be from Cleveland . "
8708	8738	8701	8701	Clyde	201	" Sure . That 's all right . I 'm glad you were able to connect . My name 's Tenet , Harry Tenet . Do n't forget that . "
8762	8795	8752	8752	Ratterer	224	" Driving a delivery , eh ? Gee , that 's funny . You driving a delivery . Imagine . That kills me . What do you want to do that for ? "
8826	8838	8839	8839	he	201	" Well , I 've been up against it , sorta , "
8842	8857	8839	8839	he	201	" But say , I want to see you . Where are you living ? "
8864	8936	8839	8839	he	201	" That 's all right . I get off here at six . Why not drop around after you 're through work . Or , I 'll tell you — suppose we meet at — well , how about Henrici 's on Randolph Street ? Is that all right ? At seven , say . I get off at six and I can be over there by then if you can . "
9046	9062	9063	9063	he	201	" Gee , it 's good to have a look at you , old socks ! "
9066	9174	9176	9176	his	710	" Do you know you 're the only one of that bunch that I 've seen since I left K. C. ? That 's right . My sister wrote me after we left home that no one seemed to know what became of either Higby or Heggie , or you , either . They sent that fellow Sparser up for a year — did you hear that ? Tough , eh ? But not so much for killing the little girl , but for taking the car and running it without a license and not stopping when signaled . That 's what they got him for . But say,"—he
9184	9205	9176	9176	his	710	" we'da got that if they 'd got us . Oh , gee , I was scared . And run ? "
9220	9307	9209	9209	he	710	" What a wallop , eh ? An ' us leavin ' him and that girl in the car . Oh , say . Tough , what ? Just what else could a fellow do , though ? No need of all of us going up , eh ? What was her name ? Laura Sipe . An ' you cut out before I saw you , even . And that little Briggs girl of yours did , too . Did you go home with her ? "
9314	9322	9323	9323	he	201	" I should say I did n't , "
9326	9335	9336	9336	he	201	" Well , where did you go then ? "
9361	9420	9357	9357	Ratterer	224	" Gee , you did n't know that that little Briggs girl left with a guy from out there for New York right after that , did you ? Some fellow who worked in a cigar store , so Louise told me . She saw her afterwards just before she left with a new fur coat and all . "
9427	9464	9466	9466	he	711	" Gee , but you were a sucker to fool around with her . She did n't care for you or nobody . But you was pretty much gone on her , I guess , eh ? "
9541	9544	9491	9491	he	711	" caught on "
9555	9564	9539	9539	he	711	" you can always get something in Chi . "
9571	9577	9567	9567	he	711	since—"very quiet , of course , "
9666	9673	9674	9674	he	711	" But can that worry stuff , "
9685	9693	9674	9674	he	711	" It do n't get you nothing . "
9754	9791	9741	9750	one of the bell - boys of the Union League	717	" See Mr. Lightall at the Great Northern before noon to - morrow . There 's a vacancy over there . It ai n't the very best , but it 'll get you something better later . "
11063	11089	11057	11057	Clyde	201	" Did n't you say you had an uncle or something by the name of Griffiths in the collar business somewhere in New York State ? "
11090	11093	11095	11095	Clyde	201	" Sure , "
11097	11132	11095	11095	Clyde	201	" Samuel Griffiths . He has a big collar factory in Lycurgus . That 's his ad you see in all the papers and that 's his fire sign over there on Michigan Avenue . "
11133	11143	11057	11057	Clyde	201	" Would you know him if you saw him ? "
11144	11147	11149	11149	Clyde	201	" No , "
11151	11161	11149	11149	Clyde	201	" I never saw him in all my life . "
11162	11173	11175	11175	Ratterer	224	" I 'll bet anything it 's the same fellow , "
11188	11208	11175	11175	Ratterer	224	" Looka here — Samuel Griffiths , Lycurgus , N. Y. That 's probably the same guy , eh ? "
11209	11215	11217	11217	Clyde	201	" Surest thing you know , "
11241	11252	11255	11255	Ratterer	224	" He just went through here a few minutes ago , "
11257	11357	11358	11358	he	789	" Devoy took his bags up to K. Swell - looking man , too . You better keep your eye open and take a look at him when he comes down again . Maybe it 's your uncle . He 's only medium tall and kinda thin . Wears a small gray mustache and a pearl gray hat . Good - lookin ' . I 'll point him out to you . If it is your uncle you better shine up to him . Maybe he 'll do somepin ' for you — give you a collar or two , "
11767	11783	11784	11784	he	201	" See that a boy takes that right away and keep the money for yourself , "
11853	11884	11845	11845	Ratterer	224	" If you want to run in on him again , here 's your chance . Take those up to him . He 's in his room , I think . "
11918	11921	11907	11908	His uncle	692	" Come ! "
11933	11944	11923	11923	Clyde	201	" Here 's some mail for you , Mr. Griffiths . "
11945	11954	11956	11957	his uncle	692	" Thank you very much , my son , "
11977	11990	11969	11969	Clyde	201	" Oh , no , I do n't want anything for that . "
12015	12044	12012	12012	he	692	" I believe I 'm related to you , Mr. Griffiths . You 're Mr. Samuel Griffiths of the Griffiths Collar Company of Lycurgus , are n't you ? "
12045	12065	12067	12068	his uncle	692	" Yes , I have a little something to do with it , I believe . Who are you ? "
12075	12095	12067	12068	his uncle	692	" My name 's Clyde Griffiths . My father , Asa Griffiths , is your brother , I believe . "
12597	12604	12605	12605	he	179	" You do n't tell me ! "
12609	12690	12605	12605	he	179	" So you 're Asa 's son . I do declare ! Well , now , this is a surprise . You see I have n't seen or heard from your father in at least — well , say , twenty - five or six years , anyhow . The last time I did hear from him he was living in Grand Rapids , Michigan , I think , or here . He is n't here now , I presume . "
12691	12698	12700	12700	Clyde	201	" Oh , no , sir , "
12712	12725	12700	12700	Clyde	201	" The family live in Denver . I 'm here all alone . "
12726	12737	12605	12605	he	179	" Your father and mother are living , I presume . "
12738	12748	12700	12700	Clyde	201	" Yes , sir . They 're both alive . "
12749	12762	12605	12605	he	179	" Still connected with religious work , is he — your father ? "
12763	12770	12772	12772	Clyde	201	" Well , yes , sir , "
12803	12811	12812	12812	he	201	" Only the church he has now , "
12816	12843	12812	12812	he	201	" has a lodging house connected with it . About forty rooms , I believe . He and my mother run that and the mission too . "
12844	12850	12851	12851	He	201	" Oh , I see . "
12879	12891	12893	12894	Samuel Griffiths	179	" Well , I 'm glad they 're doing so well , "
12907	12918	12893	12894	Samuel Griffiths	179	" You like this kind of work , I suppose ? "
12919	12934	12936	12936	Clyde	201	" Well , not exactly . No , Mr. Griffiths , I do n't , "
12949	13066	12936	12936	Clyde	201	" It pays well enough . But I do n't like the way you have to make the money you get here . It is n't my idea of a salary at all . But I got in this because I did n't have a chance to study any particular work or get in with some company where there was a real chance to work up and make something of myself . My mother wanted me to write you once and ask whether there was any chance in your company for me to begin and work up , but I was afraid maybe that you might not like that exactly , and so I never did . "
13110	13128	13139	13139	he	201	" Well , that is very interesting . You should have written , if you wanted to — "
13153	13171	13172	13172	he	201	" I do n't suppose there is anything in your company that you would let me do ? "
13304	13307	13308	13308	he	201	" Well , "
13315	13362	13363	13363	he	201	" that is something I would have to think over a little . I would n't be able to say , offhand , whether there is or not . We would n't be able to pay you as much as you make here to begin with , "
13366	13374	13376	13376	Clyde	201	" Oh , that 's all right , "
13396	13414	13376	13376	Clyde	201	" I would n't expect very much until I was able to earn it , of course . "
13415	13461	13376	13376	Clyde	201	" Besides , it might be that you would find that you did n't like the collar business once you got into it , or we might find we did n't like you . Not every one is suited to it by a long way . "
13462	13478	13480	13480	Clyde	201	" Well , all you 'd have to do then would be to discharge me , "
13482	13504	13480	13480	Clyde	201	" I 've always thought I would be , though , ever since I heard of you and your big company . "
13529	13533	13534	13534	he	179	" Very well , "
13537	13593	13595	13595	he	179	" I wo n't be able to give any more time to this now . But I 'll be here for a day or two more , anyhow , and I 'll think it over . It may be that I will be able to do something for you . I ca n't say now . "

15545	15554	15555	15555	Clyde	201	" I want to see Mr. Gilbert Griffiths , "
15561	15565	15555	15555	Clyde	201	" What about ? "
15566	15604	15539	15539	she	967	" Well , you see , I 'm his cousin . Clyde Griffiths is my name . I have a letter here from my uncle , Mr. Samuel Griffiths . He 'll see me , I think . "
15658	15667	15668	15668	she	967	" I 'll see if he 's in , "
15717	15738	15713	15713	she	967	" It 's Mr. Gilbert 's cousin , Mr. Clyde Griffiths . He has a letter from Mr. Samuel Griffiths . "

15993	16029	15984	15985	the woman	980	" You can go in now . Mr. Gilbert Griffiths ' office is at the extreme rear of this floor , over toward the river . Any one of the clerks inside will show you . "
16053	16061	16062	16062	he	201	" That 's all right . Thanks , "
16239	16246	16247	16247	He	201	" Mr. Gilbert Griffiths , Sec'y . "
16273	16276	16278	16278	he	201	" Come , "
16467	16476	16477	16477	he	201	" You 're my cousin , I believe , "
16503	16509	16511	16511	Clyde	201	" Yes , I am , "
16733	16756	16730	16730	he	200	" We thought you would be showing up to - day or to - morrow . Did you have a pleasant trip ? "
16757	16764	16766	16766	Clyde	201	" Oh , yes , very , "
16775	16794	16719	16719	he	200	" So you think you 'd like to learn something about the manufacture of collars , do you ? "
16805	16829	16831	16831	Clyde	201	" I would certainly like to learn something that would give me a chance to work up , have some future in it , "
16848	16895	16954	16955	Gilbert Griffiths	200	" Well , my father was telling me of his talk with you in Chicago . From what he told me I gather that you have n't had much practical experience of any kind . You do n't know how to keep books , do you ? "
16896	16903	16905	16905	Clyde	201	" No , I do n't , "
16910	16922	16954	16955	Gilbert Griffiths	200	" And you 're not a stenographer or anything like that ? "
16923	16932	16954	16955	Gilbert Griffiths	200	" No , sir , I 'm not . "
16975	16989	16990	16990	he	200	" Well , the best thing to do with you , I think , "
17015	17088	16990	16990	he	200	" is to start you in the shrinking room . That 's where the manufacturing end of this business begins , and you might as well be learning that from the ground up . Afterwards , when we see how you do down there , we can tell a little better what to do with you . If you had any office training it might be possible to use you up here . "
17106	17126	17127	17127	he	200	" But it 's just as well to learn the practical side of the business , whatever you do , "
17160	17196	17157	17157	he	200	" The best thing , I presume , before you try to do anything around here is for you to get settled somewhere . You have n't taken a room anywhere yet , have you ? "
17197	17209	17211	17211	Clyde	201	" No , I just came in on the noon train , "
17213	17244	17211	17211	Clyde	201	" I was a little dirty and so I just went up to the hotel to brush up a little . I thought I 'd look for a place afterwards . "
17245	17286	17287	17287	His	201	" Well , that 's right . Only do n't look for any place . I 'll have our superintendent see that you 're directed to a good boarding house . He knows more about the town than you do . "
17423	17431	17432	17432	She	1016	" Ask Mr. Whiggam to come here . "
17522	17525	17527	17528	young Griffiths	201	" Whiggam , "
17531	17551	17527	17528	young Griffiths	201	" this is Clyde Griffiths , a cousin of ours . You remember I spoke to you about him . "
17552	17557	17621	17621	he	201	" Yes , sir . "
17558	17600	17527	17528	young Griffiths	201	" Well , he 's to be put in the shrinking department for the present . You can show him what he 's to do . Afterwards you had better have Mrs. Braley show him where he can get a room . "
17632	17653	17621	17621	he	201	" And you 'd better give his name in to the timekeeper as beginning to - morrow morning , see ? "
17654	17659	17661	17661	Whiggam	245	" Yes , sir , "
17664	17669	17661	17661	Whiggam	245	" Is that all ? "
17670	17677	17679	17679	Gilbert	200	" Yes , that 's all , "
17682	17699	17679	17679	Gilbert	200	" You go with Whiggam , Mr. Griffiths . He 'll tell you what to do . "
17703	17715	17716	17716	he	245	" If you 'll just come with me , Mr. Griffiths , "
17800	17813	17814	17814	he	200	" I wonder what he thinks he 's going to do here , "
17819	17829	17814	17814	he	200	" where he thinks he 's going to get ? "
18077	18092	18094	18095	Mr. Whiggam	245	" Never worked in a collar factory before , Mr. Griffiths , I presume ? "
18120	18125	18126	18126	he	201	" Oh , no , "
18130	18140	18126	18126	he	201	" I never worked at anything like this before . "
18141	18164	18165	18165	He	200	" Expect to learn all about the manufacturing end of the game in the course of time , though , I suppose . "
18191	18197	18198	18198	he	200	" I 'd like to , "
18201	18228	18229	18229	He	200	" Well , there 's a little more to it than some people think , although you often hear there is n't very much to learn . "
18265	18364	18365	18365	He	200	" You might as well know a little about this as long as you re going to begin in the shrinking room . This is the stuff from which the collars are cut , the collars and the lining . They are called webs . Each of these bolts is a web . We take these down in the basement and shrink them because they ca n't be used this way . If they are , the collars would shrink after they were cut . But you 'll see . We tub them and then dry them afterwards . "

19019	19026	19028	19029	Mr. Whiggam	245	" This is the shrinking room , "
19035	19058	19059	19059	he	245	" It is n't as nice as some of the others , but it 's where the manufacturing process begins . Kemerer ! "
19125	19149	19112	19112	he	1066	" This is Clyde Griffiths , the cousin of Gilbert Griffiths . I spoke to you about him last week , you remember ? "
19150	19155	19112	19112	he	1066	" Yes , sir . "
19156	19172	19112	19112	he	1066	" He 's to begin down here . He 'll show up in the morning . "
19173	19178	19112	19112	he	1066	" Yes , sir . "
19179	19198	19112	19112	he	1066	" Better put his name down on your check list . He 'll begin at the usual hour . "
19199	19204	19112	19112	he	1066	" Yes , sir . "
19240	19257	19260	19261	Mr. Whiggam	245	" Seven - thirty is the time every one goes to work here in the morning , "
19266	19297	19260	19261	Mr. Whiggam	245	" but they all ring in a little earlier — about seven - twenty or so , so as to have time to change their clothes and get to the machines .
19298	19306	19307	19307	he	245	" Now , if you want to , "
19310	19420	19421	19421	He	1069	" Mr. Kemerer can show you what you 'll have to do to - morrow before you leave today . It might save a little time . Or , you can leave it until then if you want to . It do n't make any difference to me . Only , if you 'll come back to the telephone girl at the main entrance about five - thirty I 'll have Mrs. Braley there for you . She 's to show you about your room , I believe . I wo n't be there myself , but you just ask the telephone girl for her . She 'll know . "
19426	19435	19421	19421	He	1069	" Well , I 'll leave you now . "
19450	19464	19469	19469	he	1069	" Well , I 'm very much obliged to you , Mr. Whiggam . "
19503	19565	19566	19566	He	248	" Oh , that 's all right about what you have to do , Mr. Griffiths . I 'll just let you bring down webs on the floor above to begin with to - morrow . But if you 've got any old clothes , you 'd better put 'em on . A suit like that would n't last long here . "
20532	20540	20542	20543	the man	1113	" Whose house is that , mister ? "
20546	20570	20542	20543	the man	1113	" Why , that 's Samuel Griffiths ' residence . He 's the man who owns the big collar factory over the river . "
20823	20825	20865	20866	the Griffiths	201	" who "
21852	21866	21847	21847	he	201	" Well , that Chicago cousin of ours blew in to - day . "
21867	21870	21872	21872	Myra	182	" Yes ! "
21874	21880	21872	21872	Myra	182	" What 's he like ? "
21933	21946	21948	21948	Gilbert	200	" Well , I ca n't see that he 's so much , "
21950	22214	21948	21948	Gilbert	200	" He 's fairly intelligent and not bad - looking , but he admits that he 's never had any business training of any kind . He 's like all those young fellows who work for hotels . He thinks clothes are the whole thing , I guess . He had on a light brown suit and a brown tie and hat to match and brown shoes . His tie was too bright and he had on one of those bright pink striped shirts like they used to wear three or four years ago . Besides his clothes are n't cut right . I did n't want to say anything because he 's just come on , and we do n't know whether he 'll hold out or not . But if he does , and he 's going to pose around as a relative of ours , he 'd better tone down , or I 'd advise the governor to have a few words with him . Outside of that I guess he 'll do well enough in one of the departments after a while , as foreman or something . He might even be made into a salesman later on , I suppose . But what he sees in all that to make it worth while to come here is more than I can guess . As a matter of fact , I do n't think the governor made it clear to him just how few the chances are here for any one who is n't really a wizard or something . "
22226	22300	22215	22215	He	1208	" Oh , well , you know what Mother was saying the other day about his father . She thinks Daddy feels that he 's never had a chance in some way . He 'll probably do something for him whether he wants to keep him in the mill or not . She told me that she thought that Dad felt that his father had n't been treated just right by their father . "
22327	22338	22339	22339	he	200	" Oh , well , it 's not my funeral , "
22343	22392	22339	22339	he	200	" If the governor wants to keep him on here whether he 's fitted for anything special or not , that 's his look - out . Only he 's the one that 's always talking about efficiency in every department and cutting and keeping out dead timber . "
22548	22553	22554	22554	she	180	" Oh , well , "
22571	22591	22554	22554	she	180	" if Daddy wants him , I presume he 'll keep him , or do something with him eventually . "
22704	22713	22714	22714	he	1221	" Oh , you 're Mr. Clyde Griffiths ? "
22717	22742	22744	22744	he	1221	" You 're goin' to work under Mr. Kemerer ? Yes , I know . Well , that man there will have your key , "
22760	22764	22744	22744	he	1221	" Old Jeff , "
22803	22819	22820	22820	he	201	" My name 's Clyde Griffiths and I 'm to work downstairs with Mr. Kemerer , "
22827	22873	22820	22820	he	201	" Sure , that 's right . Yes , sir . Here you are , Mr. Griffiths . Mr. Kemerer spoke to me about you yesterday . Number seventy - one is to be yours . I 'm giving you Mr. Duveny 's old key . "
22898	22941	22886	22886	he	201	" Do n't it beat all how much that fellow looks like Mr. Gilbert Griffiths ? Why , he 's almost his spittin ' image . What is he , do you suppose , a brother or a cousin , or what ? "
22942	22948	22950	22951	the doorman	1226	" Do n't ask me , "
22953	23001	22950	22951	the doorman	1226	" I never saw him before . But he 's certainly related to the family all right . When I seen him first , I thought it was Mr. Gilbert . I was just about to tip my hat to him when I saw it was n't . "
23107	23127	23102	23103	Mr. Gilbert	200	" He 's to be treated like all the other employees as to time and work . No different . "
23136	23153	23132	23132	he	200	" This is my cousin , and he 's going to try to learn this business , "
23226	23231	23223	23223	they	1234	" watch their step , "
23359	23375	23376	23376	he	248	" Just hang up your hat and coat over there in one of those lockers , "
23383	23417	23376	23376	he	248	" Then you can take one of those crate trucks back there and go up to the next floor and bring down some webs . They 'll show you where to get them . "
24872	24874	24862	24862	his	201	" class "
24876	24879	24862	24862	his	201	" connection . "
24945	24965	24966	24966	he	201	" I suppose you 'll be spending a good deal of your time with your relatives and friends here , "
25082	25169	25170	25170	He	1312	" Say your uncle must be worth over a million , is n't he ? They say he is . Those houses in Wykeagy Avenue are certainly the cats ' . You wo n't see anything finer in Albany or Utica or Rochester either . Are you Samuel Griffiths ' own nephew ? You do n't say ! Well , that 'll certainly mean a lot to you here . I wish I had a connection like that . You bet I 'd make it count . "
25204	25212	25214	25214	Clyde	201	" Oh , I do n't know , "
25228	25260	25214	25214	Clyde	201	" I came on to learn the collar business , you know . Not to play about very much . My uncle wants me to stick to that , pretty much . "
25261	25272	25274	25274	Dillard	257	" Sure , sure . I know how that is , "
25276	25340	25274	25274	Dillard	257	" that 's the way my uncle feels about me , too . He wants me to stick close to the work here and not play about very much . He 's the buyer for Stark and Company , you know . But still a man ca n't work all the time , either . He 's got to have a little fun . "
25341	25348	25350	25350	Clyde	201	" Yes , that 's right , "
25375	25380	25274	25274	Dillard	257	" Do you dance ? "
25381	25384	25386	25386	Clyde	201	" Yes , "
25388	25562	25568	25568	him	1315	" Well , so do I. There are a lot of cheap dance halls around here , but I never go to any of those . You ca n't do it and keep in with the nice people . This is an awfully close town that way , they say . The best people wo n't have anything to do with you unless you go with the right crowd . It 's the same way up at Fonda . You have to ' belong ' or you ca n't go out anywhere at all . And that 's right , I guess . But still there are a lot of nice girls here that a fellow can go with — girls of right nice families — not in society , of course — but still , they 're not talked about , see . And they 're not so slow , either . Pretty hot stuff , some of them . And you do n't have to marry any of 'em , either . "
25592	25597	25600	25600	Dillard	257	" By the way , "
25602	25611	25600	25600	Dillard	257	" what are you doing next Sunday afternoon ? "
25612	25626	25628	25628	Clyde	201	" Well , nothing in particular , that I know of just now , "
25636	25660	25628	25628	Clyde	201	" I do n't know just what I may have to do by then , but I do n't know of anything now . "
25661	25837	25600	25600	Dillard	257	" Well , how 'd you like to come with me , if you 're not too busy . I 've come to know quite a few girls since I 've been here . Nice ones . I can take you out and introduce you to my uncle 's family , if you like . They 're nice people . And afterwards — I know two girls we can go and see — peaches . One of 'em did work in the store , but she do n't now — she 's not doing anything now . The other is her pal . They have a Victrola and they can dance . I know it is n't the thing to dance here on Sundays but no one need know anything about that . The girls ' parents do n't mind . Afterwards we might take 'em to a movie or something — if you want to — not any of those things down near the mill district but one of the better ones — see ? "
26115	26125	26112	26112	he	201	" Yes,—well — I think that 's all right . "
26133	26140	26127	26127	he	201	" Of course my relatives here — "
26141	26151	26153	26153	Dillard	257	" Oh , sure , that 's all right , "
26156	26171	26153	26153	Dillard	257	" You have to be careful , of course . Well , so do I. "
26339	26347	26348	26348	he	245	" Here you are , Mr. Griffiths , "
26584	26592	26596	26596	he	257	" We can just go out there , "
26609	26700	26701	26701	he	1344	" I want you to meet my uncle and aunt . They 're nice people all right . And so are the girls . They 're no slouches . Then we can edge out afterwards , about ten , see , and go around to either Zella or Rita 's place . Rita has more good records over at her place , but Zella has the nicest place to dance . By the way , you did n't chance to bring along your dress suit with you , did you ? "
26848	26855	26857	26857	Clyde	201	" No , I did n't , "
26883	26891	26892	26892	He	201	" but I intend to get one . "
27040	27049	27050	27050	he	201	" Zella 's dark and Rita 's light , "
27676	27759	27669	27669	he	257	" Walter has been telling us that you have just come on here to work for your uncle . You 're at Mrs. Cuppy 's now , I understand . I do n't know her but I 've always heard she keeps such a nice , refined place . Mr. Parsley , who lives here with her , used to go to school with me . But I do n't see much of him any more . Did you meet him yet ? "
27760	27767	27769	27769	Clyde	201	" No , I did n't , "
27773	27812	27813	27813	She	1382	" Well , you know , we expected you last Sunday to dinner , only Walter had to go home . But you must come soon . Any time at all . I would love to have you . "
28044	28082	28029	28029	Dillard	257	" This is Clyde Griffiths , the nephew of Samuel Griffiths , Mr. Gilbert Griffiths ' cousin , you know . He 's just come on here to study the collar business in his uncle 's factory . "
28211	28239	28269	28269	he	201	" She do n't amount to anything . Her father only keeps a small garage here . I would n't bother with her if I were you . "
28242	28257	28269	28269	he	201	" He is n't much around here . Just a clerk in our store . "
28480	28490	28492	28493	Zella Shuman	259	" Oh , so you 're Mr. Clyde Griffiths , "
28495	28535	28492	28493	Zella Shuman	259	" My , you look a lot like your cousin , do n't you ? I see him driving down Central Avenue ever so often . Walter has been telling us all about you . Do you like Lycurgus ? "
28540	28543	28538	28538	she	259	" Walter , "
28884	28897	28899	28899	Dillard	257	" Now we 'll just have a little ice cream and cake , "
28909	28962	28899	28899	Dillard	257	" and then we can get out of here . You two had better go around together and hand out a few hellos . Then we can meet at the ice cream booth . After that , if you say so , we 'll leave , eh ? What do you say ? "
28974	28985	28963	28963	He	201	" You know what is the best thing to do , "
28992	29040	28987	28987	she	259	" That 's right . We ca n't leave right away . I see my cousin Mary over there . And Mother . And Fred Bruckner . Rita and I 'll just go around by ourselves for a while and then we 'll meet you , see . "
29135	29153	29132	29132	Dillard	257	" Let 's beat it . We can go over to your place , ca n't we ? "
29154	29159	29161	29161	Zella	259	" Sure , sure , "
29532	29550	29551	29551	he	257	" There 's one thing about this house and these trees and these soft - toned needles , "
29587	29654	29562	29562	he	257	" You ca n't hear a note of this Victrola out in the street , can you , Zell ? Nor upstairs , either , really , not with the soft needles . We 've played it down here and danced to it several times , until three and four in the morning and they did n't even know it upstairs , did they , Zell ? "
29655	29699	29562	29562	he	257	" That 's right . But then Father 's a little hard of hearing . And Mother do n't hear anything , either , when she gets in her room and gets to reading . But it is hard to hear at that . "
29700	29710	29712	29712	Clyde	201	" Why do people object so to dancing here ? "
29714	29729	29732	29732	Dillard	257	" Oh , they don't — not the factory people — not at all , "
29734	29767	29768	29768	He	257	" but most of the church people do . My uncle and aunt do . And nearly everyone else we met at the church to - night , except Zell and Rita . "
29778	29801	29768	29768	He	257	" And they 're too broadminded to let a little thing like that bother them . Ai n't that right , Zell ? "
29818	29835	29802	29812	This young girl , who was very much fascinated by him	1434	" You bet , that 's right . I ca n't see any harm in it . "
29836	29842	29845	29845	Rita	260	" Nor me , either , "
29847	29879	29845	29845	Rita	260	" nor my father and mother . Only they do n't like to say anything about it or make me feel that they want me to do too much of it . "
29888	29891	29880	29880	Dillard	257	" Brown Eyes "
29989	29994	29996	29996	Clyde	201	" She is delicious , "
29998	30028	29996	29996	Clyde	201	" even if she is a little soft . Any fellow would do almost as well as me , but she likes me because she thinks I 'm somebody . "
30038	30057	30035	30035	she	1435	" Is n't it just too gorgeous ? And you 're such a good dancer , Mr. Griffiths . "
30058	30063	30064	30064	he	201	" Oh , no , "
30072	30092	30064	30064	he	201	" you 're the one that 's the dancer . I can dance because you 're dancing with me . "
30127	30139	30141	30141	Dillard	257	" Now we 'll put on ' The Love Boat , ' "
30144	30147	30117	30117	she	1435	" Brown Eyes "
30151	30172	30141	30141	Dillard	257	" and you and Zella can dance together and Rita and I will have a spin , eh , Rita ? "
30259	30264	30252	30252	he	257	" The Love Boat . "
30900	30981	30896	30896	he	201	" But this is not what I should be doing either , is it ? This is Lycurgus . I am a Griffiths , here . I know how these people feel toward me — their parents even . Do I really care for her ? Is there not something about her quick and easy availability which , if not exactly dangerous in so far as my future here is concerned , is not quite satisfactory — too quickly intimate ? "
31528	31543	31521	31523	the elder Griffiths	200	" Well , what about your cousin ? How 's he doing by now ? "
31560	31582	31545	31545	Gilbert	200	" Oh , he 's all right . I started him off in the shrinking room . Is that all right ? "
31583	31616	31521	31523	the elder Griffiths	200	" Yes , I think so . That 's as good a place as any for him to begin , I believe . But what do you think of him by now ? "
31617	31620	31622	31622	Gilbert	200	" Oh , "
31640	31780	31622	31622	Gilbert	200	" Not so much . He 's all right , I guess . He may work out . But he does not strike me as a fellow who would ever make much of a stir in this game . He has n't had much of an education of any kind , you know . Any one can see that . Besides , he 's not so very aggressive or energetic - looking . Too soft , I think . Still I do n't want to knock him . He may be all right . You like him and I may be wrong . But I ca n't help but think that his real idea in coming here is that you 'll do more for him than you would for someone else , just because he is related to you . "
31781	31799	31806	31806	he	1459	" Oh , you think he does . Well , if he does , he 's wrong . "
31816	31973	31806	31806	he	1459	" He may not be as impractical as you think , though . He has n't been here long enough for us to really tell , has he ? He did n't strike me that way in Chicago . Besides there are a lot of little corners into which he might fit , are n't there , without any great waste , even if he is n't the most talented fellow in the world ? If he 's content to take a small job in life , that 's his business . I ca n't prevent that . But at any rate , I do n't want him sent away yet , anyhow , and I do n't want him put on piece work . It would n't look right . After all , he is related to us . Just let him drift along for a little while and see what he does for himself . "
31974	31980	31982	31983	his son	4794	" All right , governor , "
32030	32088	32024	32025	Samuel Griffiths	179	" We 'll have to have him out to the house for dinner pretty soon , wo n't we ? I have thought of that but I have n't been able to attend to it before . I should have spoken to Mother about it before this . He has n't been out yet , has he ? "
32089	32100	32102	32102	Gilbert	200	" No , sir , not that I know of , "
32124	32140	32119	32119	his	200	" We 've been waiting for you to say something about it , I suppose . "
32141	32145	32148	32148	Samuel	179	" Very well , "
32150	32182	32148	32148	Samuel	179	" you 'd better find out where he 's stopping and have him out . Next Sunday would n't be a bad time , if we have n't anything else on . "
32199	32253	32196	32196	he	179	" After all , Gil , he 's my nephew and your cousin , and we ca n't afford to ignore him entirely . That would n't be right , you know , either . You 'd better speak to your mother to - night , or I will , and arrange it . "
32683	32714	32716	32716	he	201	" You know she likes you . Zell was telling me the other day that she said she thought you were the candy . Some ladies ' man , eh ? "
33287	33290	33291	33291	He	201	" E. G. "
33393	33400	33411	33411	they	1495	" very happy to see you , "
34438	34445	34446	34446	she	180	" My nephew , I believe , "
34449	34452	34454	34454	Clyde	201	" Yes , "
34467	34473	34454	34454	Clyde	201	" I am Clyde Griffiths . "
34474	34490	34492	34493	Mrs. Griffiths	180	" I 'm very glad to see you and to welcome you to our home , "
34515	34576	34577	34577	She	180	" And my children will be , too , of course . Bella is not here just now or Gilbert , either , but then they will be soon , I believe . My husband is resting , but I heard him stirring just now , and he 'll be down in a moment . Wo n't you sit here ? "
34586	34622	34577	34577	She	180	" We dine nearly always alone here together on Sunday evening , so I thought it would be nice if you came just to be alone with us . How do you like Lycurgus now ? "
34648	34657	34658	34658	he	201	" Oh , I like it very much , "
34670	34704	34705	34705	he	201	" Of course I have n't seen so very much of it yet , but what I have I like . This street is one of the nicest I have ever seen anywhere , "
34709	34721	34705	34705	he	201	" The houses are so large and the grounds so beautiful . "
34722	34735	34737	34738	Mrs. Griffiths	180	" Yes , we here in Lycurgus pride ourselves on Wykeagy Avenue , "
34772	34821	34759	34759	She	180	" Every one who sees it seems to feel the same way about it . It was laid out many years ago when Lycurgus was just a village . It is only within the last fifteen years that it has come to be as handsome as it is now .
34822	34869	34870	34870	she	1532	" But you must tell me something about your mother and father . I never met either of them , you know , though , of course , I have heard my husband speak of them often — that is , of his brother , anyhow , "
34873	34889	34870	34870	she	1532	" I do n't believe he ever met your mother . How is your father ? "
34890	34898	34900	34900	Clyde	201	" Oh , he 's quite well , "
34904	34957	34900	34900	Clyde	201	" And Mother , too . They 're living in Denver now . We did live for a while in Kansas City , but for the last three years they 've been out there . I had a letter from Mother only the other day . She says everything is all right . "
34958	34975	34976	34976	She	1533	" Then you keep up a correspondence with her , do you ? That 's nice . "
35216	35240	35213	35213	he	278	" Well , so here you are , eh ? They 've placed you , I believe , without my ever seeing you . "
35241	35246	35248	35248	Clyde	278	" Yes , sir , "
35264	35326	35327	35327	He	278	" Well , that 's all right . Sit down ! Sit down ! I 'm very glad they did . I hear you 're working down in the shrinking room at present . Not exactly a pleasant place , but not such a bad place to begin , either — at the bottom . The best people start there sometimes . "
35332	35350	35327	35327	He	278	" I was out of the city when you came on or I would have seen you . "
35351	35356	35358	35358	Clyde	278	" Yes , sir , "
35505	35513	35514	35514	he	179	" Like it where you are now ? "
35518	35538	35540	35540	Clyde	278	" Well , yes , sir , that is , I would n't say that I like it exactly , "
35544	35566	35540	35540	Clyde	278	" But I do n't mind it . It 's as good as any other way to begin , I suppose . "
35615	35624	35626	35627	Samuel Griffiths	179	" Well , that 's the proper spirit , "
35631	35682	35626	35627	Samuel Griffiths	179	" It is n't the most pleasant part of the process , I will admit , but it 's one of the most essential things to know , to begin with . And it takes a little time , of course , to get anywhere in any business these days . "
35789	35798	35800	35800	Samuel	179	" Your cousin , Clyde Griffiths , Myra , "
35808	35813	35814	35814	he	179	" My daughter Myra , "
35820	35833	35814	35814	he	179	" This is the young man I 've been telling you about . "
35871	35887	35888	35888	she	182	" Well , I hope you 'll like it , now that you 're here , "
35893	35914	35888	35888	she	182	" We all like Lycurgus , only after Chicago I suppose it will not mean so very much to you . "
35939	35943	35918	35918	Clyde	201	" thank you , "
35983	35990	35991	35991	he	200	" Just a minute , Dolge , "
35998	36005	36012	36012	he	200	" I wo n't be long . "
36015	36029	36012	36012	he	200	" Excuse me , folks , I 'll be back in a minute . "
36110	36116	36117	36117	he	200	" How do you do , "
36130	36202	36203	36203	he	200	" Hi , Dad . Hello , Mother . Sorry I ca n't be with you to - night . But I just came over from Amsterdam with Dolge and Eustis to get Constance and Jacqueline . There 's some doings over at the Bridgemans ' . But I 'll be back again before morning . Or at the office , anyhow . Everything all right with you , Mr. Griffiths ? "
36209	36219	36221	36222	his father	539	" Yes , I have nothing to complain of , "
36224	36244	36221	36222	his father	539	" But it seems to me you 're making a pretty long night of it , are n't you ? "
36245	36254	36256	36257	his son	4794	" Oh , I do n't mean that , "
36263	36288	36289	36289	He	539	" I just mean that if I ca n't get back by two , I 'll stay over , that 's all , see . "
36299	36313	36315	36316	his mother	587	" I hope you 're not driving that car as fast as usual , "
36318	36326	36315	36316	his mother	587	" It 's not safe at all . "
36327	36345	36346	36346	He	539	" Fifteen miles an hour , Mother . Fifteen miles an hour . I know the rules . "
36521	36527	36515	36516	Mrs. Griffiths	180	" Has Bella telephoned yet ? "
36528	36533	36535	36536	the servant	1579	" No , ma'am , "
36538	36542	36535	36536	the servant	1579	" not yet . "
36543	36574	36515	36516	Mrs. Griffiths	180	" Well , have Mrs. Truesdale call up the Finchleys and see if she 's there . You tell her I said that she is to come home at once . "
36894	36915	36916	36916	Clyde	201	" I suppose you began your hotel work in Kansas City , did n't you , after you left school ? "
37293	37339	37281	37281	she	183	" Now , Bissell , if you 're not going to behave , I 'm going to take you out and tie you out there . Oh , I do n't believe I can stay a moment if he wo n't behave better than this . "
37452	37542	37543	37543	she	183	" Oh , how are you , Mrs. Griffiths ? I 'm so glad to see you again . It 's been some time since I 've been over here , has n't it ? But then Mother and I have been away . She and Grant are over at Albany to - day . And I just picked up Bella and Sondra here at the Lamberts ' . You 're just having a quiet little supper by yourselves , are n't you ? How are you , Myra ? "
37597	37617	37577	37577	Bella	183	" Oh , I 'm late . Sorry , Mamma and Daddy . Wo n't that do this time ? "
37740	37743	37745	37746	Samuel Griffiths	179	" Bella , "
37755	37761	37745	37746	Samuel Griffiths	179	" your cousin , Clyde . "
37762	37767	37769	37769	Bella	183	" Oh , yes , "
37779	37799	37800	37800	She	183	" How are you ? Mother has been saying that you were coming to call one of these days . "
37813	37826	37800	37800	She	183	" My friends , Miss Finchley and Miss Cranston , Mr. Griffiths . "
37853	37868	37870	37870	Sondra	186	" Well , he does look like Gil a lot , does n't he ? "
37885	37907	37882	37882	Bertine	197	" I never saw anything like it . He 's really better - looking , is n't he — a lot ? "
38044	38080	38005	38006	Mrs. Griffiths	180	" Had n't you two better lay off your coats and sit down ? I 'll just have Nadine lay extra plates at this end . Bella , you can sit next to your father . "
38081	38090	38138	38138	they	1624	" Oh , no , not at all , "
38092	38113	38005	38006	Mrs. Griffiths	180	" No , indeed , we 're just on our way home ourselves . I ca n't stay a minute , "
38294	38353	38282	38283	Mrs. Griffiths	180	" Mr. Griffiths is a nephew of ours from the West who has come on to see if he can make a place for himself in my husband 's factory . He 's a young man who has to make his own way in the world and my husband has been kind enough to give him an opportunity . "
38519	38556	38557	38557	He	179	" Here , Sondra , tie up your dog to one of the dining - room chairs and come and sit by me . Throw your coat over that chair . Here 's room for you . "
38564	38573	38575	38575	Sondra	186	" But I ca n't , Uncle Samuel ! "
38594	38618	38588	38588	herself	186	" We 're late now . Besides Bissell wo n't behave . Bertine and I are just on our way home , truly . "
38619	38626	38629	38629	Bella	183	" Oh , yes , Papa , "
38633	38675	38629	38629	Bella	183	" Bertine 's horse ran a nail in his foot yesterday and is going lame to - day . And neither Grant nor his father is home . She wants to know if you know anything that 's good for it . "
38676	38682	38684	38684	Griffiths	180	" Which foot is it ? "
38725	38768	38704	38704	he	201	" It 's the left fore . I was riding out on the East Kingston road yesterday afternoon . Jerry threw a shoe and must have picked up a splinter , but John does n't seem to be able to find it . "
38769	38783	38704	38704	he	201	" Did you ride him much with the nail , do you think ? "
38784	38794	38704	38704	he	201	" About eight miles — all the way back . "
38795	38826	38704	38704	he	201	" Well , you had better have John put on some liniment and a bandage and call a veterinary . He 'll come around all right , I 'm sure . "
39249	39332	39240	39240	Myra	182	" I think after you 've been here a little while you 'll probably like Lycurgus better than you do now , even . There are quite a number of interesting places to go and see around here — lakes and the Adirondacks are just north of here , about seventy miles . And when the summer comes and we get settled at Greenwood , I 'm sure Father and Mother will like you to come up there once in a while . "
39509	39546	39548	39548	he	201	" It 's rather nice out , is n't it ? Wykeagy Avenue has n't begun to show what it can do yet because the spring is n't quite here . But in a few weeks , "
39563	39593	39548	39548	he	201	" we must have you out . All the trees and flowers will be in bloom then and you can see how really nice it is . Good night . "
39997	39999	39958	39958	he	179	" feed "
40003	40006	39958	39958	he	179	" take . "
40236	40256	40227	40227	he	179	" I made a tour of the factory Saturday and found young Clyde still down in the shrinking room . "
40257	40264	40266	40267	his son	4794	" What of it , Dad ? "
40289	40305	40266	40267	his son	4794	" Other people before him have worked down there and it has n't hurt them . "
40306	40330	40231	40231	his	179	" All true enough , but they were n't nephews of mine . And they did n't look as much like you as he does"—a
40337	40450	40231	40231	his	179	" It wo n't do , I tell you . It does n't look quite right to me , and I 'm afraid it wo n't look right to other people here who see how much he looks like you and know that he is your cousin and my nephew . I did n't realize that at first , because I have n't been down there , but I do n't think it wise to keep him down there any longer doing that kind of thing . It wo n't do . We 'll have to make a change , switch him around somewhere else where he wo n't look like that . "
40483	40495	40496	40496	Gilbert	200	" But I 'll tell you how it is , Dad , "
40516	40575	40496	40496	Gilbert	200	" I 'm not so sure that I can find just the right place for him now anywhere else — at least not without moving someone else who has been here a long time and worked hard to get there . He has n't had any training in anything so far , but just what he 's doing . "
40576	40588	40590	40590	Griffiths	200	" Do n't know or do n't care anything about that , "
40611	40696	40590	40591	Griffiths senior	588	" That 's no place for him and I wo n't have him there any longer . He 's been there long enough . And I ca n't afford to have the name of any of this family come to mean anything but just what it does around here now — reserve and ability and energy and good judgment . It 's not good for the business . And anything less than that is a liability . You get me , do n't you ? "
40697	40708	40590	40590	Griffiths	200	" Yes , I get you all right , governor . "
40709	40843	40590	40591	Griffiths senior	588	" Well , then , do as I say . Get hold of Whiggam and figure out some other place for him around here , and not as piece worker or a hand either . It was a mistake to put him down there in the first place . There must be some little place in one of the departments where he can be fitted in as the head of something , first or second or third assistant to some one , and where he can wear a decent suit of clothes and look like somebody . And , if necessary , let him go home on full pay until you find something for him . But I want him changed . By the way , how much is he being paid now ? "
40844	40851	40853	40853	Gilbert	200	" About fifteen , I think , "
40856	40935	40590	40591	Griffiths senior	588	" Not enough , if he 's to make the right sort of an appearance here . Better make it twenty - five . It 's more than he 's worth , I know , but it ca n't be helped now . He has to have enough to live on while he 's here , and from now on , I 'd rather pay him that than have any one think we were not treating him right . "
40936	40956	40958	40958	Gilbert	200	" All right , all right , governor . Please do n't be cross about it , will you ? "
40966	41015	41019	41019	he	200	" I 'm not entirely to blame . You agreed to it in the first place when I suggested it , did n't you ? But I guess you 're right at that . Just leave it to me . I 'll find a decent place for him , "
41711	41725	41727	41727	Gilbert	200	" Well , how are you getting along down where you are now ? "
41756	41788	41733	41733	Clyde	201	" Oh , just about the same , Mr. Griffiths . I ca n't complain . I like it well enough . I 'm learning a little something , I guess . "
41789	41793	41829	41829	he	201	" You guess ? "
41794	41809	41811	41811	Clyde	201	" Well , I know I 've learned a few things , of course , "
41841	41874	41886	41886	he	201	" Well , that 's a little better . A man could hardly be down there as long as you 've been and not know whether he had learned anything or not . "
41895	41943	41886	41886	he	201	" But that 's not why I sent for you . There 's another matter I want to talk to you about . Tell me , did you ever have charge of any people or any other person than yourself , at any time in your life ? "
41944	41953	41955	41955	Clyde	201	" I do n't believe I quite understand , "
41976	42013	41955	41955	Clyde	201	" I mean have you ever had any people work under you — been given a few people to direct in some department somewhere ? Been a foreman or an assistant foreman in charge of anything ? "
42014	42023	42025	42025	Clyde	201	" No , sir , I never have , "
42129	42143	42144	42144	he	200	" But I 've seen how it 's done in clubs and hotels , "
42149	42163	42144	42144	he	200	" And I think I might manage if I were given a trial . "
42176	42187	42189	42189	Gilbert	200	" Not the same thing . Not the same thing , "
42192	42237	42189	42189	Gilbert	200	" Seeing and doing are two entirely different things . A person without any experience can think a lot , but when it comes to doing , he 's not there . Anyhow , this is one business that requires people who do know . "
42286	42299	42300	42300	he	201	" Yes , sir , I guess that 's true , too , "
42303	42315	42317	42317	Gilbert	200	" But you do n't need to guess in this case , "
42319	42339	42317	42317	Gilbert	200	" You know . That 's the trouble with people who do n't know . They 're always guessing . "
42387	42395	42397	42397	Clyde	201	" You 're right , I know , "
42412	42419	42422	42422	Gilbert	200	" Well , the fact is , "
42424	42450	42422	42422	Gilbert	200	" I might have placed you in the accounting end of the business when you first came if you had been technically equipped for it . "
42454	42457	42422	42422	Gilbert	200	" technically equipped "
42472	42477	42480	42480	Gilbert	200	" As it was , "
42484	42519	42520	42520	He	200	" we had to do the best we could for you . We knew it was not very pleasant down there , but we could n't do anything more for you at the time . "
42529	42581	42520	42520	He	200	" But the reason I called you up here to - day is this . I want to discuss with you a temporary vacancy that has occurred in one of our departments upstairs and which we are wondering — my father and I — whether you might be able to fill . "
42588	42595	42596	42596	he	200	" Both my father and I , "
42600	42664	42596	42596	he	200	" have been thinking for some little time that we would like to do a little something for you , but as I say , your lack of practical training of any kind makes it very difficult for both of us . You have n't had either a commercial or a trade education of any kind , and that makes it doubly hard . "
42687	42690	42691	42691	he	200	" Still , "
42697	42755	42757	42757	he	200	" so long as we have seen fit to bring you on here , we have decided to give you a tryout at something better than you are doing . It wo n't do to let you stay down there indefinitely . Now , let me tell you a little something about what I have in mind , "
42792	42860	42789	42789	he	291	" Whiggam , I 've just been telling my cousin here about our conversation this morning and what I told you about our plan to try him out as the head of that department . So if you 'll just take him up to Mr. Liggett and have him or some one explain the nature of the work up there , I 'll be obliged to you . "
42867	42878	42879	42879	he	291	" After that you can send him back to me , "
42882	42891	42879	42879	he	291	" I want to talk to him again . "
43068	43074	43076	43076	Whiggain	294	" This is Miss Todd , "
43078	43175	43076	43076	Whiggain	294	" She 's been in charge for about ten days now in the absence of Mrs. Angier . And what I want you to do now , Miss Todd , is to explain to Mr. Griffiths here just as quickly and clearly as you can what it is you do here . And then later in the day when he comes up here , I want you to help him to keep track of things until he sees just what is wanted and can do it himself . You 'll do that , wo n't you ? "
43176	43192	43194	43195	Miss Todd	293	" Why , certainly , Mr. Whiggam . I 'll be only too glad to , "
43386	43391	43393	43393	Whiggam	245	" The important thing , "
43398	43468	43393	43393	Whiggam	245	" is to see that there is no mistake as to the number of thousands of dozens of collars that come down here and are stamped , and also that there 's no delay in stamping them and getting them out to the stitchers . Also that the records of these girls ' work is kept accurately so that there wo n't be any mistakes as to their time . "
43566	43593	43554	43554	Gilbert	200	" Well , what 's the answer ? Yes or no . Do you think you can do it or do you think you ca n't ? "
43594	43605	43607	43607	Clyde	201	" Well , I know that I can do it , "
43665	43678	43681	43681	Gilbert	200	" Very good , then . Just be seated for a moment , "
43683	43709	43681	43681	Gilbert	200	" I want to talk to you some more in connection with that work up there . It looks easy to you , does it ? "
43710	43723	43725	43725	Clyde	201	" No , I ca n't say that it looks exactly easy , "
43760	43784	43738	43738	he	201	" Just the same I think I can do it . In fact I know I can and I 'd like to try . "
43785	43796	43798	43798	Gilbert	200	" Well , now , that sounds a little better , "
43804	43838	43798	43798	Gilbert	200	" And now I want to tell you something more about it . I do n't suppose you ever thought there was a floor with that many women on it , did you ? "
43839	43848	43850	43850	Clyde	201	" No , sir , I did n't , "
43852	43870	43850	43850	Clyde	201	" I knew they were somewhere in the building , but I did n't know just where . "
43871	43874	43877	43877	Gilbert	200	" Exactly , "
43879	44046	43877	43877	Gilbert	200	" This plant is practically operated by women from cellar to roof . In the manufacturing department , I venture to say there are ten women to every man . On that account every one in whom we entrust any responsibility around here must be known to us as to their moral and religious character . If you were n't related to us , and if we did n't feel that because of that we knew a little something about you , we would n't think of putting you up there or anywhere in this factory over anybody until we did know . But do n't think because you 're related to us that we wo n't hold you strictly to account for everything that goes on up there and for your conduct . We will , and all the more so because you are related to us . You understand that , do you ? And why — the meaning of the Griffiths name here ? "
44047	44052	44054	44054	Clyde	201	" Yes , sir , "
44056	44062	44065	44065	Gilbert	200	" Very well , then , "
44067	44259	44065	44065	Gilbert	200	" Before we place any one here in any position of authority , we have to be absolutely sure that they 're going to behave themselves as gentlemen always — that the women who are working here are going to receive civil treatment always . If a young man , or an old one for that matter , comes in here at any time and imagines that because there are women here he 's going to be allowed to play about and neglect his work and flirt or cut up , that fellow is doomed to a short stay here . The men and women who work for us have got to feel that they are employees first , last and all the time — and they have to carry that attitude out into the street with them . And unless they do it , and we hear anything about it , that man or woman is done for so far as we are concerned . We do n't want 'em and we wo n't have 'em . And once we 're through with 'em , we 're through with 'em . "
44272	44298	44260	44260	He	1755	" Now I hope I have made myself clear . Also that we will never have any trouble in so far as you are concerned . "
44303	44328	44300	44300	Clyde	201	" Yes , I understand . I think that 's right . In fact I know that 's the way it has to be . "
44329	44335	44337	44337	Gilbert	200	" And ought to be , "
44339	44345	44347	44347	Clyde	201	" And ought to be , "
44485	44492	44495	44495	Gilbert	200	" Well , now , then , "
44507	44571	44495	44495	Gilbert	200	" what I want to know of you is , if I trouble to put you in that department , even temporarily , can I trust you to keep a level head on your shoulders and go about your work conscientiously and not have your head turned or disturbed by the fact that you 're working among a lot of women and girls ? "
44572	44582	44584	44584	Clyde	201	" Yes , sir , I know you can , "
44604	44618	44620	44620	Gilbert	200	" If I ca n't , now is the time to say so , "
44622	44716	44620	44620	Gilbert	200	" By blood you 're a member of this family . And to our help here , and especially in a position of this kind , you represent us . We ca n't have anything come up in connection with you at any time around here that wo n't be just right . So I want you to be on your guard and watch your step from now on . Not the least thing must occur in connection with you that any one can comment on unfavorably . You understand , do you ? "
44717	44722	44724	44724	Clyde	201	" Yes , sir , "
44728	44744	44724	44724	Clyde	201	" I understand that . I 'll conduct myself properly or I 'll get out . "
44777	44875	44876	44876	He	201	" Very good . Now , I 'll tell you what else I want you to do . I want you to knock off for the day and go home and sleep on this and think it over well . Then come back in the morning and go to work up there , if you still feel the same . Your salary from now on will be twenty - five dollars , and I want you to dress neat and clean so that you will be an example to the other men who have charge of departments . "
47322	47333	47316	47316	Ruza	298	" That French cat ! He should look at her ! "
47431	47441	47414	47414	he	201	say—"What ! You do n't think I 'm attractive ? "
47449	47477	47414	47414	he	201	" How can you continue to ignore me ? There are lots of fellows who would be delighted to have your chance , I can tell you . "
47843	47847	47834	47834	Liggett	292	" try - out "
47916	47921	47962	47962	Liggett	292	" No Help Wanted . "
48204	48230	48194	48194	Liggett	292	" Here 's a girl who might do for you . Miss Tyndal is her name . You might give her a try - out . "
48233	48248	48250	48250	Clyde	201	" You might see if this girl will be of any use to you . "
48512	48515	48505	48505	they	1917	" feller , "
49050	49068	49069	49069	he	292	" You 're going to live in Lycurgus , then , if you can get work here ? "
49082	49085	49086	49086	she	1932	" Yes , "
49097	49103	49104	49104	He	292	" And the name again ? "
49111	49115	49104	49104	He	292	" Roberta Alden . "
49116	49122	49104	49104	He	292	" And your address here ? "
49123	49128	49104	49104	He	292	" 228 Taylor Street . "
49129	49140	49141	49141	he	292	" I do n't even know where that is myself , "
49151	49164	49141	49141	he	292	" I have n't been here so very long , you see . "
49187	49228	49184	49184	he	292	" I do n't know whether Mr. Liggett has told you all about the work here . But it 's piece work , you know , stamping collars . I 'll show you if you 'll just step over here , "
49541	49553	49554	49554	he	292	" Well , I guess you 'll make out all right , "
49862	49870	49856	49856	she	302	" He says she 'll do already . "
49895	49915	49893	49893	her	302	" Pretty quick , eh ? And he did n't seem to see any one else at all before . "
50173	50184	51592	51592	she	302	" Well , things are none too satisfactory with me . "
51605	51609	53948	53959	a certain " feller " whom she had met the night before	2162	" Girls Wanted . "
53950	53952	53984	53984	she	302	" feller "
53972	53983	54022	54022	she	302	" I should go with heem to be his sweetheart , "
54001	54021	54038	54038	she	302	" And I say , I tack heem an ' think on heem . Pretty nice bag , eh ? "
54033	54037	54038	54038	she	302	" Tell me , "
54056	54092	54145	54145	she	302	" what shall I do with heem ? Keep heem an ' go with heem to be his sweetheart or give heem back ? I like heem pretty much , that bag , you bet . "
54152	54195	54206	54206	Mary	271	" Well , it all depends on how handsome he is , Mary . If he 's very attractive , I think I 'd string him along for a while , anyhow , and keep the bag as long as I could . "
54196	54204	54258	54258	She	271	" Oh , but he no wait , "
54233	54257	54266	54266	her	271	" I got to give heem bag or be sweetheart to - night , and so swell bag I never can buy myself . "
54277	54283	54311	54311	Clyde	201	" What I do then ? "
54284	54309	54349	54349	she	302	" Gee , this is pretty strong stuff for a little country girl like Miss Alden . She wo n't like this , maybe , "
54339	54348	54364	54364	She	302	" Gee , you are in a fix , "
54352	54363	54436	54436	She	317	" I do n't know what you 'll do now . "
54407	54435	54517	54517	her	302	" I take it and him too , you bet , if you do n't want him . Where is he ? I got no feller now . "
54504	54514	54517	54517	her	302	" Well , maybe you 're right , Lena , "
54538	54550	55058	55058	she	317	" A good man is n't to be found every day . "
55025	55057	55058	55058	she	317	" Here comes Mr. Gilbert Griffiths . His father owns this whole factory and when he dies , he 'll get it , they say . And he 's his cousin , "
55065	55076	55085	55085	Roberta	302	" They look a lot alike , do n't they ? "
55077	55083	55093	55093	Gilbert	200	" Yes , they do , "
55095	55112	55113	55114	Hoda Petkanas	318	" only I think Mr. Clyde Griffiths is a little nicer looking , do n't you ? "
55131	55153	55163	55163	Roberta	302	" That 's what every one here thinks . He 's not stuck up like that Mr. Gilbert Griffiths , either . "
55154	55161	55180	55180	she	302	" Is he rich , too ? "
55169	55179	55180	55180	she	302	" I do n't know . They say not , "
55196	55246	57820	57820	he	2249	" He worked down in the shrinking room before he came up here . He was just working by the day , I guess . But he only came on here a little while ago to learn the business . Maybe he wo n't work in here much longer . "
57805	57819	57820	57820	he	2249	" My , Miss Alden ! It is you , is n't it ? "
57823	57840	57849	57849	she	2278	" I was wondering whether it was . I could n't be sure from out there . "
57841	57848	58038	58038	he	2249	" Why , yes it is , "
58030	58037	58080	58080	she	2278	" Just out for a walk ? "
58090	58107	58114	58114	she	2278	" You want some of these water lilies ? Is that what you 're looking for ? "
58108	58113	58302	58302	she	2278	" Uh , huh , "
58284	58301	58302	58302	she	2278	" I was seeing if there was any way to get out to any of them , "
58317	58330	58341	58341	he	2249	" I have n't seen any before just here on this side . "
58331	58340	58341	58341	he	2249	" I 'll get you all you want , "
58347	58360	58383	58383	he	2249	" You just stay where you are . I 'll bring them . "
58386	58448	58645	58645	Clyde	201	" But see here — why do n't you get in here with me ? There 's plenty of room and I can take you anywhere you want to go . There 's lots nicer lilies up the lake here a little way and on the other side too . I saw hundreds of them over there just beyond that island . "
58668	58725	58726	58726	She	302	" Oh , please do n't say no . Just get in , wo n't you ? You 'll like it . I want you to . Then we can find all the lilies you want . I can let you out anywhere you want to get out — in ten minutes if you want to . "
58729	58735	58768	58768	she	302	" I want you to . "
58757	58767	58830	58830	she	302	" But I have my friend with me here , "
58826	58829	58830	58830	she	302	" Besides , "
58844	58855	58868	58868	Clyde	201	" maybe I 'd better not . Is it safe ? "
58856	58866	58882	58882	he	201	" Oh , yes , maybe you better had , "
58875	58881	58914	58914	he	201	" It 's perfectly safe , "
58917	58963	58994	58994	she	302	" Of course you wo n't be in any danger . Call your friend then , if you want to , and I 'll row the two of you . There 's room for two and there are lots of water lilies everywhere over there . "
58999	59014	58994	58994	she	302	" Oh , Gray - ace ! Gray - ace ! Where are you ? "
59038	59048	58994	58994	she	302	" Hello - o ! What do you want ? "
59049	59066	58994	58994	she	302	" Come up here . Come on . I got something I want to tell you . "
59067	59084	59107	59107	She	302	" Oh , no , you come on down here . The daisies are just wonderful . "
59085	59106	59148	59148	she	302	" No , you come on up here . There 's some one here that wants to take us boating . "
59139	59147	59148	59148	she	302	" Oh , very well , then , "
59157	59170	59172	59172	Clyde	201	" We can row down to where she is , I guess . "
59178	59228	59268	59268	She	302	" Oh , that 's just fine . Sure . Do get in . We 'll pick these here first and then if she has n't come , I 'll paddle down nearer to where she is . Just step square in the center and that will balance it . "
59273	59280	59288	59288	Clyde	201	" Will it be perfectly safe ? "
59281	59286	59311	59311	He	201	" Sure , sure , "
59290	59310	59360	59360	he	201	" I 'll hold it safe . Just take hold of that branch there and steady yourself by that . "
59353	59359	59443	59443	He	201	" It 's all right , "
59364	59442	59475	59475	She	302	" Just sit in the center there . It wo n't tip over . Gee , but this is funny . I ca n't make it out quite . You know just as I was coming around that point I was thinking of you — how maybe you might like to come out to a place like this sometime . And now here you are and here I am , and it all happened just like that . "
59469	59474	59497	59497	Clyde	201	" Is that so ? "
59487	59495	59497	59497	Clyde	201	" Yes , and what 's more , "
59499	59532	59551	59551	Roberta	302	" I 've been thinking of you all day , really . That 's the truth . I was wishing I might see you somewhere this morning and bring you out here . "
59533	59549	59622	59622	Clyde	201	" Oh , now , Mr. Griffiths . You know you do n't mean that , "
59608	59620	59636	59636	Roberta	302	" That 's the truth , though , just the same , "
59624	59634	59656	59656	Clyde	201	" Well , I think it is beautiful myself , "
59638	59655	59678	59678	he	201	" I 've been out here , too , several times now . My friend and I. "
59671	59677	59678	59678	he	201	" Oh , have you ? "
59703	59757	59769	59769	Roberta	302	" And to think I turned in here and there you were on the bank , looking at those water lilies . Was n't that queer ? I almost fell out of the boat . I do n't think I ever saw you look as pretty as you did just now standing there . "
59758	59766	59769	59769	Roberta	302	" Oh , now , Mr. Griffiths , "
59772	59806	60406	60406	Roberta	302	" You must n't begin that way . I 'll be afraid you 're a dreadful flatterer . I 'll have to think you are if you say anything like that so quickly . "
60416	60429	60612	60612	he	316	" What do you think we had better do , excuse ourselves ? "
60604	60611	60612	60612	he	316	" Well , here 's luck , "
60615	60657	61014	61014	he	201	" How are you , Miss Alden ? How do you do , Miss Marr ? You two do n't happen to be going our way , do you ? If you are , we can take you in with us . "
61042	61078	62425	62425	Roberta	302	" I was awfully sorry to have to leave you last night . I wish we were out there again to - day instead of here , just you and me , do n't you ? "
62437	62440	62562	62563	some one	4723	" good morning "
62558	62560	63077	63077	she	302	" Sweethearts "
63069	63075	63092	63092	she	302	" There 's been a distake "
63083	63091	63092	63092	she	302	" in regard to this bundle upstairs , "
63095	63134	63319	63319	he	201	" I did n't notice it either until I 'd stamped nearly all of them . They 're fifteen - and - a - half and I 've stamped nearly all of them sixteen . I 'm sorry . "
63310	63318	63319	63319	he	201	" Oh , that 's all right , "
63340	63371	63411	63411	he	201	" I 'll just send them down to the wash room and then we 'll see if we ca n't restamp them . It 's not our mistake , really . "
63404	63410	63411	63411	he	201	" But do n't go , "
63415	63496	63498	63498	he	201	" I want to ask you something . I 've been trying to get a word with you ever since Sunday . I want you to meet me somewhere , will you ? There 's a rule here that says a head of a department ca n't have anything to do with a girl who works for him — outside I mean . But I want you to see me just the same , wo n't you ? You know , "
63507	63554	63572	63572	Roberta	302	" I 've been just nearly crazy over you ever since you came in here and Sunday made it worse . And now I 'm not going to let any old rule come between me and you , if I can help it . Will you ? "
63555	63570	63596	63596	She	302	" Oh , I do n't know whether I can do that or not , "
63614	63651	63652	63652	She	302	" I live with Mr. and Mrs. Newton , my friend 's sister and brother - in - law , you know , and they 're very strict . It is n't the same as if — "
63657	63662	63664	63664	Clyde	201	" I was home , "
63668	63723	63737	63737	Roberta	302	" Oh , now please do n't say no , will you ? Please do n't . I want to see you . I do n't want to cause you any trouble , that 's all . Otherwise I 'd be glad to come round to your house . You know how it is . "
63724	63735	63745	63745	She	302	" Oh , no , you must n't do that , "
63739	63744	63775	63775	Clyde	201	" Not yet anyhow . "
63770	63773	63775	63775	Clyde	201	" Well , "
63787	63864	63894	63894	She	2419	" We could just walk out near the end of some street here — that street you live in , if you wish . There are no houses out there . Or there 's a little park — Mohawk — just west of Dreamland on the Mohawk Street line . It 's right on the river . You might come out there . I could meet you where the car stops . Will you do that ? "
63865	63893	63919	63919	he	201	" Oh , I 'd be afraid to do that I think — go so far , I mean . I never did anything like that before . "
63928	63962	63994	63994	she	2419	" I 'm almost afraid to go anywhere here alone , you know . People talk so here , they say , and some one would be sure to see me . But — "
63963	63969	63990	63990	She	2419	" Yes , but what ? "
63970	63989	63999	63999	Clyde	201	" I 'm afraid I 'm staying too long at your desk here , do n't you think ? "
64022	64061	64101	64101	She	2419	" Well , then , how about the end of that street you live in ? Could n't you come down there for just a little while to - night — a half hour or so , maybe ? "
64062	64100	64114	64114	her	2419	" Oh , I could n't make it to - night , I think — not so soon . I 'll have to see first , you know . Arrange , that is . But another day . "
64142	64168	64232	64232	she	2419	" Well , then , how about Wednesday night at eight - thirty or nine ? Could n't you do that ? Please , now . "
64217	64231	64246	64246	Clyde	201	" I suppose I 'd better be going back to my work now , "
64239	64244	64246	64246	Clyde	201	" Wait a minute , "
64248	64298	64353	64353	She	2419	" We have n't fixed on the time for Wednesday . Are n't you going to meet me ? Make it nine or eight - thirty , or any time you want to . I 'll be there waiting for you after eight if you wish . Will you ? "
64299	64352	65454	65454	Clyde	201	" All right , then , say eight - thirty or between eight - thirty and nine , if I can . Is that all right ? I 'll come if I can , you know , and if anything does happen I 'll tell you the next morning , you see . "
65463	65483	65532	65532	she	302	" Hello . Gee , it 's nice to have you meet me . Did you have any trouble ? "
65514	65528	65691	65691	she	302	" Did I have any trouble ? Oh , did n't I though ? "
65678	65690	65703	65703	Clyde	201	" But I ca n't stay very long , you know , "
65726	65761	65860	65860	she	302	" The Baptist Church socials never last much beyond ten - thirty or eleven , and they 'll be back soon . So I 'll have to manage to be back before they are . "
65877	65903	66155	66155	he	201	" Now , now — that 's not nice , is it ? Ca n't you just hold my arm or let me hold yours ? "
66150	66154	66155	66155	he	201	" You know , "
66163	66233	66340	66340	he	201	" I 've been trying to talk to you ever since you came to work at the factory but you see how very watchful every one is . They 're the limit . They told me when I came up there that I must n't interest myself in any girl working there and so I tried not to . But I just could n't help this , could I ? "
66257	66338	66467	66467	she	302	" You know , Roberta , I 'm crazy about you . I really am . I think you 're the dearest , sweetest thing . Oh , say ! Do you mind my telling you ? Ever since you showed up there , I have n't been able to sleep , nearly . You 've got such nice eyes and hair . To - night you look just too cute — lovely , I think . Oh , Roberta , "
66456	66466	66467	66467	she	302	" Oh , you must n't , Mr. Griffiths , "
66470	66499	66535	66535	she	302	" You really must n't , you know . Please . Some one might see us . I think I hear some one coming . Please , now . "
66523	66534	66535	66535	she	302	" You know I never did anything like this before , "
66539	66555	66669	66669	He	201	" Honest , I did n't . Please . It 's only because you said — "
66618	66668	66731	66731	her	302	" Oh , Roberta , dearest , please , please , say that you love me . Please do ! I know that you do , Roberta . I can tell . Please , tell me now . I 'm crazy about you . We have so little time . "
66734	66756	66778	66778	He	201	" Yes , yes , yes . I do love you . Yes , yes . I do . I do . "
66795	66830	67333	67333	she	310	" It 's all right , Roberta . It 's all right . Please do n't cry . Oh , I think you 're so sweet . I do . I do , Roberta . "
67342	67359	67367	67367	Roberta	302	" He was so very friendly I was beginning to think he was struck on you . "
67360	67366	67367	67367	Roberta	302	" Oh , what nonsense ! "
67376	67409	67588	67588	she	302	" Why , he would n't look at me . Besides , there 's a rule of the company that does n't permit him to , as long as I work there . "
67578	67587	67599	67599	she	302	" You see , it 's this way , "
67640	67736	67745	67745	he	2470	" The Newtons never go any place much without inviting me . And even if they did n't , Grace'd never go unless I went along . It 's just because we were together so much in Trippetts Mills that she feels that way , as though I were a part of the family . But now it 's different , and yet I do n't see how I am going to get out of it so soon . I do n't know where to say I 'm going or whom I am going with . "
67737	67744	67745	67745	he	2470	" I know that , honey , "
67751	67790	67846	67846	She	2471	" That 's all true enough . But how is that going to help us now ? You ca n't expect me to get along with just looking at you in the factory , either , can you ? "
67818	67845	67878	67878	she	2471	" No , I do n't want you to do that , dear . You know I do n't . But what am I to do ? "
67868	67877	67878	67878	she	2471	" I 'll tell you what , though , "
67887	67953	67964	67964	Clyde	201	" I have a sister living in Homer , New York . That 's about thirty - five miles north of here . I might say I was going up there some Saturday afternoon or Sunday . She 's been writing me to come up , but I had n't thought of it before . But I might go — that is — I might — "
67954	67962	67964	67964	Clyde	201	" Oh , why not do that ? "
67967	67976	67983	67983	she	2471	" That 's fine ! A good idea ! "
67977	67982	67983	67983	she	2471	" Let me see , "
67990	68133	68148	68148	he	2472	" If I remember right you have to go to Fonda first , then change cars there . But I could leave here any time on the trolley and there are only two trains a day from Fonda , one at two , and one at seven on Saturday . So I might leave here any time before two , you see , and then if I did n't make the two o'clock train , it would be all right , would n't it ? I could go on the seven . And you could be over there , or meet me on the way , just so no one here saw us . Then I could go on and you could come back . I could arrange that with Agnes , I 'm sure . I would have to write her . "
68134	68147	68148	68148	he	2472	" How about all the time between then and now , though ? "
68152	68164	68208	68208	she	2473	" It 's a long time till then , you know . "
68165	68207	68245	68245	he	201	" Well , I 'll have to see what I can think of , but I 'm not sure , dear . I 'll have to see . And you think too . But I ought to be going back now , "
68238	68244	68245	68245	he	201	" But what about us ! "
68249	68279	68319	68319	she	302	" Why could n't you pretend next Sunday that you 're going to some other church than yours and meet me somewhere instead ? Would they have to know ? "
68313	68318	68319	68319	she	302	" Hump , uh , "
68324	68350	68366	68366	he	201	" I would n't want to do that . I would n't feel right about it . And it would n't be right , either . "
68379	68407	68416	68416	she	302	" Oh , well . Just as you say . I only thought since you do n't seem to be able to think of any other way . "
68408	68415	68421	68421	she	302	" No , no , dear , "
68432	68451	68813	68813	Clyde	201	" It 's all right , only I would n't want to do that . I could n't . "
68806	68811	68813	68813	Clyde	201	" Oh , look ! "
68818	68851	69086	69086	Clyde	201	" Let 's get off here , will you — shall we ? What do you say ? We 're almost to Fonda anyhow . And we can have more fun here . "
69089	69099	69110	69110	she	302	" You dance , do n't you , Roberta ? "
69100	69109	69268	69268	he	201	" Why , no , I do n't , "
69258	69267	69268	69268	he	201	" Oh , is n't that too bad ! "
69284	69309	69319	69319	she	302	" We could have such fun now if you could . I could teach you in a few minutes if you wanted me to . "
69310	69318	69319	69319	she	302	" I do n't know about that , "
69333	69381	69389	69389	Clyde	201	" I 'm not so clever that way . And you know dancing is n't considered so very nice in my part of the country . And my church does n't approve of it , either . And I know my parents would n't like me to . "
69382	69387	69389	69389	Clyde	201	" Oh , shucks , "
69394	69421	69430	69430	Roberta	302	" what nonsense , Roberta . Why , everybody dances these days or nearly everybody . How can you think there 's anything wrong with it ? "
69422	69428	69430	69430	Roberta	302	" Oh , I know , "
69435	69494	69506	69506	Clyde	201	" maybe they do in your set . I know most of those factory girls do , of course . And I suppose where you have money and position , everything 's right . But with a girl like me , it 's different . I do n't suppose your parents were as strict as mine , either . "
69495	69504	69430	69430	Roberta	302	" Oh , were n't they , though ? "
69514	69517	69506	69506	Clyde	201	" your set "
69521	69529	69542	69542	he	201	" where you have money and position . "
69530	69541	69542	69542	he	201	" Well , that 's all you know about it , "
69546	69598	69777	69777	Roberta	302	" They were as strict as yours and stricter , I 'll bet . But I danced just the same . Why , there 's no harm in it , Roberta . Come on , let me teach you . It 's wonderful , really . Wo n't you , dearest ? "
69767	69775	69780	69780	Clyde	201	" I do n't believe I can , "
69789	69807	69815	69815	he	201	" I 'm afraid I 'm too awkward , maybe . I never danced , you know . "
69808	69814	69815	69815	he	201	" You awkward , Roberta , "
69818	69848	69991	69991	he	201	" Oh , how crazy . Why , you 're as graceful and pretty as you can be . You 'll see . You 'll be a wonderful dancer . "
69984	69990	69991	69991	he	201	" Oh , you darling , "
69994	70025	70192	70193	the orchestrelle	2521	" Are n't you the dandy little dancer , though . You 've caught on already . If you are n't the wonderful kid . I can hardly believe it . "
70204	70208	70850	70851	Miss Feliss	332	" Next Concert 7.30 "
70802	70838	70850	70851	Miss Feliss	332	" Oh , there you are ! Look who 's back from Starlight Park . Howja like the dancing over there , Miss Alden ? We saw you , but you did n't see us . "
70855	70883	70971	70971	she	310	" We tried to get your eye , but you could n't see any one but him , I guess . I 'll say you dance swell . "
70975	70988	71032	71032	Roberta	302	" Well , of all things ! And dancing ! A man ! "
71035	71069	71070	71070	She	302	" Oh , yes , that 's so . I did go over there for a little while . Some friends of my sister 's were coming over and I went with them . "
71076	71084	71199	71200	Miss Pope	333	" We did n't stay very long , "
71204	71225	71237	71237	Roberta	302	" I do n't suppose he 's a Lycurgus boy . I do n't remember ever seeing him around here . "
71226	71235	71401	71401	Grace	310	" No , he is n't from here , "
71414	71433	71446	71446	Roberta	302	" I thought you said you stayed out at your sister 's all the time you were gone ? "
71434	71444	71614	71614	She	2568	" Well , what if I did say it ? "
71499	71613	71719	71719	she	310	" Well , you do n't have to lie to me in order to go anywhere or see anybody without me in the future . I do n't want to go with you . And what 's more I do n't want to know where you go or who you go with . But I do wish you would n't tell me one thing and then have George and Mary find out that it ai n't so , and that you 're just trying to slip away from me or that I 'm lying to them in order to protect myself . I do n't want you to put me in that position . "
71723	71754	71968	71969	Mrs. Newton	320	" Oh , well , have it that way if you want to . I do n't care . I do n't propose to tell anything unless I choose to . "
71987	71989	71999	71999	She	302	" brother "
71991	71993	73946	73946	Clyde	201	" sister "
73933	73943	73946	73946	Clyde	201	" It 's getting cold , is n't it ? "
73958	73977	73946	73946	Clyde	201	" Yes , I should say it is . I 'll soon have to get a heavier coat . "
73978	74061	73946	73946	Clyde	201	" I do n't see how we are to do from now on , do you ? There 's no place to go any more much , and it wo n't be very pleasant walking the streets this way every night . You do n't suppose we could fix it so I could call on you at the Gilpins ' once in a while , do you ? It is n't the same there now as it was at the Newtons ' . "
74062	74150	74165	74165	Clyde	201	" Oh , I know , but then they use their sitting room every night nearly until ten - thirty or eleven . And besides their two girls are in and out all hours up to twelve , anyhow , and they 're in there often . I do n't see how I can . Besides , I thought you said you did n't want to have any one see you with me that way , and if you came there I could n't help introducing you . "
74151	74163	74235	74235	He	201	" Oh , but I do n't mean just that way , "
74206	74234	74255	74255	He	201	" Why would n't it be all right for me to stop in for a little while ? They would n't need to know , would they ? "
74262	74274	74427	74427	his	201	" There would n't be anybody there now , would there ? "
74373	74409	74588	74588	Roberta	302	" No , no , I ca n't let you do that . It would n't be right . I do n't want to . Some one might see us . Somebody might know you . "
74470	74550	74658	74658	Clyde	201	" Oh , who would be likely to see us anyhow , at this time of night ? There is n't any one around . Why should n't we go there for a few moments if we want to ? No one would be likely to hear us . We need n't talk so loud . There is n't any one on the street , even . Let 's walk by the house and see if anybody is up . "
74647	74656	74658	74658	Clyde	201	" See , there 's no one up , "
74661	74727	74769	74769	she	2665	" Why should n't we go in for a little while if we want to ? Who will know ? We need n't make any noise . Besides , what is wrong with it ? Other people do it . It is n't such a terrible thing for a girl to take a fellow to her room if she wants to for a little while . "
74728	74764	75024	75024	his	201	" Oh , is n't it ? Well , maybe not in your set . But I know what 's right and I do n't think that 's right and I wo n't do it . "
75003	75022	75082	75082	His	201	" All right , then , if you do n't want to , you do n't have to , "
75035	75081	75354	75354	she	302	" There are others places I can go . I notice you never want to do anything I want to do , though . I 'd like to know how you think we 're to do . We ca n't walk the streets every night . "
75278	75349	75399	75399	she	302	" Oh , please , Clyde , do n't be mad with me now , will you ? You know that I would if I could . I ca n't do anything like that here . Ca n't you see ? You know that . Why , they 'd be sure to find out . And how would you feel if some one were to see us or recognize you ? "
75390	75398	75421	75421	he	201	" Please do n't ask me to , "
75406	75420	75399	75399	she	302	" Well , what did you want to leave the Newtons for then ? "
75425	75459	75510	75510	she	302	" I ca n't see where else we can go now if you wo n't let me come to see you once in a while . We ca n't go any place else . "
75502	75509	75510	75510	she	302	" I thought we took it , "
75516	75529	75547	75547	Roberta	302	" just so that we could go places on Saturday and Sunday . "
75530	75545	75559	75559	she	302	" But where can we go Saturday and Sunday now ? Everything 's closed . "
75563	75574	75559	75559	she	302	" Oh , I wish I knew what to do . "
75575	75605	75787	75787	She	302	" Oh , it would be easy enough if you wanted to do it , but that 's always the way with you , you do n't want to . "
75746	75786	75943	75943	he	2679	" I ca n't , Clyde , I ca n't . I would if I could but I ca n't . It would n't be right . I would if I could make myself , but I ca n't . "
75947	75965	75991	75991	she	302	" Oh , that 's all right , if that 's the way you feel about it . "
75975	75990	75991	75991	she	302	" Please do n't , go , Clyde . Please do n't leave me , "
76008	76033	76053	76053	his	2679	" I do n't want you to . I love you so , Clyde . I would if I could . You know that . "
76034	76049	76090	76090	Roberta	302	" Oh , yes , I know , but you need n't tell me that "
76106	76109	76384	76384	she	302	" Clyde ! "
76389	76408	76634	76634	she	302	" Oh , Clyde , please do n't go , Clyde . Oh , please do n't go . "
76663	76725	77189	77189	she	302	" No , I wo n't do that . I must n't . I ca n't . I will be a bad girl if I do . I should not do that for him even though he does want me to , and should threaten to leave me forever in case I refuse . He should be ashamed to ask me . "
77183	77188	77189	77189	she	302	" Clyde , Clyde , "
77194	77210	77344	77344	She	302	" you would n't do that to me , would you — you could n't . "
77324	77343	77790	77790	Ratterer	224	" No , no , no , he could n't do that to me , he would n't . "

79132	79245	79126	79126	she	302	" Please , Clyde , do n't be mad at me , will you ? Please do n't . Please look at me and speak to me , wo n't you ? I 'm so sorry about last night , really I am — terribly . And I must see you to - night at the end of Elm Street at 8:30 if you can , will you ? I have something to tell you . Please do come . And please do look at me and tell me you will , even though you are angry . You wo n't be sorry . I love you so . You know I do .

80125	80200	82106	82106	she	2813	words—"Behold I am no longer the inexperienced , neglected simpleton of but a few weeks ago , but an individual of import now — some one who knows something about life . What have any of these strutting young men , and gay , coaxing , flirting girls all about me , that I have not ? And if I chose — were less loyal than I am — what might I not do ? "
82012	82067	82106	82106	she	2813	" Go around to the side entrance , David , and tell Miriam that I ca n't wait for her because I 'm going over to the Trumbulls for dinner , but that I 'll be back by nine . If she 's not there , leave this note and hurry , will you ? "
82109	82150	82270	82270	He	200	" Oh , hello . Walking to - night ? If you want to wait a minute , you can ride out with me . I 've just sent David in with a note . He wo n't be long . "
82299	82305	82310	82310	she	2813	" Hmp ! That stick . "
82316	82398	82444	82444	Bella	183	" Who does he think he is anyhow ? He certainly does think he 's a lot around here . You 'd think he was a Rockefeller or a Morgan . And for my part I ca n't see where he 's a bit interesting — any more . I like Bella . I think she 's lovely . But that smarty . I guess he would like to have a girl wait on him . Well , not for me . "
82455	82480	82529	82529	she	2819	" What , that little snip ! Who does she think she is anyhow ? If ever there was a conceited little nut ! ... "
82508	82510	82529	82529	she	2819	" in "
82520	82523	82614	82614	he	200	" in . "
82607	82613	82614	82614	he	200	" Oh , good evening , "
82623	82628	82779	82779	She	2819	" How are you ? "
82740	82778	82855	82855	He	201	" Oh , pardon me , you 're Mr. Clyde Griffiths , I see now . It 's my mistake . I thought you were Gilbert . I could n't quite make you out in the light . "
82832	82854	82956	82956	Clyde	201	" Oh , pardon me . But that 's all right . I did n't mean to intrude . I thought ... "
82909	82950	83021	83021	he	201	" But that 's all right . Wo n't you get in , please , and let me take you where you are going . Oh , I wish you would . I will be so glad to take you . "
83012	83020	83021	83021	he	201	" Why , yes , of course , "
83025	83062	83084	83084	she	2819	" that is , if you want me to . I understand how it was . That 's all right . But you need n't mind , if you do n't wish to . I thought ... "
83087	83156	83349	83349	he	201	" Oh , do come , get in , Mr. Griffiths . I 'll be so glad if you will . It won t take David a moment to take you wherever you are going , I 'm sure . And I am sorry about the other , really I am . I did n't mean , you know , that just because you were n't Gilbert Griffiths — "
83334	83348	83349	83349	he	201	" It 's certainly nice of you to take me up this way , "
83359	83381	83406	83406	her	2819	" I did n't think it was my cousin you meant or I would n't have come up as I did . "
83382	83395	83448	83448	she	2819	" Oh , that 's all right . Do n't mention it , "
83427	83447	83497	83497	She	2819	" It 's my mistake , not yours . But I 'm glad I made it now , anyhow , "
83458	83496	83569	83569	he	201	" I think I 'd rather pick you up than I would Gil , anyhow . We do n't get along any too well , he and I. We quarrel a lot whenever we do meet anywhere . "
83560	83568	83569	83569	he	201	" Well , that 's too bad , "
83595	83620	83642	83642	she	2819	" Oh , it does n't amount to anything , really . We just quarrel , that 's all , once in a while . "
83652	83661	83669	83669	Clyde	201	" Are you still working for your uncle ? "
83662	83667	83669	83669	Clyde	201	" Oh , yes , "
83687	83698	83739	83739	She	2819	" I have charge of a department over there now . "
83699	83738	83739	83739	She	2819	" Oh , really , I did n't know . I have n't seen you at all , since that one time , you know . You do n't get time to go about much , I suppose . "
83751	83763	83770	83770	she	2819	" Your relatives are n't so very much interested in you , "
83774	83787	83795	83795	Clyde	201	" You have been in the city all summer , I suppose ? "
83788	83793	83795	83795	Clyde	201	" Oh , yes , "
83801	83863	84055	84055	She	2819	" I have to be , you know . It 's the work that keeps me here . But I 've seen your name in the papers often , and read about your riding and tennis contests and I saw you in that flower parade last June , too . I certainly thought you looked beautiful , like an angel almost . "
84037	84054	84066	84066	Clyde	201	" That 's awfully nice of you to say that . I wo n't forget that . "
84084	84102	84122	84122	he	201	" So this is where you live . Do you expect to be in Lycurgus all winter ? "
84103	84121	84122	84122	he	201	" Oh , yes . I 'm quite sure of it . I hope to be anyhow , "
84135	84157	84175	84175	he	201	" Well , perhaps , then I 'll see you again somewhere , some time . I hope so , anyhow . "
84186	84192	84201	84201	she	2819	" Oh , so do I. "
84193	84200	85131	85131	she	302	" Good night ! Good night ! "
85117	85129	85155	85155	she	302	" You know I had a funny experience to - day . "
85175	85180	85182	85183	Tracy Trumbull	352	" Oh , yes , "
85194	85249	85262	85263	Gertrude Trumbull	351	" I 've seen that fellow , I bet , three or four times on Central Avenue . He looks a lot like Gil , does n't he ? Only not so swagger . I 've nodded to him two or three times this summer because I thought he was Gil for the moment . "
85250	85260	85262	85263	Gertrude Trumbull	351	" Oh , I 've seen him , too , "
85265	85321	85335	85335	she	351	" He wears a cap and a belted coat like Gilbert Griffiths , sometimes , does n't he ? Arabella Stark pointed him out to me once and then Jill and I saw him passing Stark 's once on a Saturday afternoon . He is better looking than Gil , any day , I think . "
85338	85386	85396	85397	Jill Trumbull	349	" Bertine Cranston and I met him one evening last spring at the Griffiths ' . We thought he was too bashful , then . But I wish you could see him now — he 's positively handsome , with the softest eyes and the nicest smile . "
85387	85394	85421	85421	her	351	" Oh , now , Sondra , "
85428	85445	85468	85469	Tracy Trumbull	352	" I know some one who would be jealous if he could hear you say that . "
85446	85465	85468	85469	Tracy Trumbull	352	" And would n't Gil Griffiths like to hear that his cousin 's better looking than he is ? "
85471	85476	85484	85484	Sondra	186	" Oh , say — "
85477	85482	85671	85671	She	2883	" Oh , he , "
85487	85670	85704	85704	She	2883	" He thinks he 's so much . I 'll bet anything it 's because of him that the Griffiths wo n't have anything to do with their cousin . I 'm sure of it , now that I think of it . Bella would , of course , because I heard her say last spring that she thought he was good - looking . And Myra would n't do anything to hurt anybody . What a lark if some of us were to take him up some time and begin inviting him here and there — once in a while , you know — just for fun , to see how he would do . And how the Griffiths would take it . I know well enough it would be all right with Mr. Griffiths and Myra and Bella , but Gil I 'll bet would be as peeved as anything . I could n't do it myself very well , because I 'm so close to Bella , but I know who could and they could n't say a thing . "
85687	85703	85718	85719	Jill Trumbull	349	" I wonder if he dances or rides or plays tennis or anything like that ? "
85742	85765	85778	85778	Sondra	186	" It would be a prank , would n't it ? Do you suppose the Griffiths really would dislike it very much ? "
85766	85775	85778	85778	Sondra	186	" What 's the difference if they did ? "
85780	85814	85834	85835	Tracy Trumbull	352	" They could n't do anything more than ignore him , could they ? And who would care about that , I 'd like to know . Not the people who invited him . "
85815	85831	85834	85835	Tracy Trumbull	352	" Go on , you fellows , stir up a local scrap , will you ? "
85837	85904	86299	86299	officers	2894	" I 'll bet anything that 's what comes of it in the end . Gil Griffiths wo n't like it , you can gamble on that . I would n't if I were in his position . If you want to stir up a lot of feeling here , go to it , but I 'll lay a bet that 's what it comes to . "
86287	86292	86377	86377	her	203	" Now and Then . "
86398	86403	86771	86771	He	201	" Now and Thens , "
86803	86843	86988	86988	he	201	" Dear Mr. Griffiths : Thought you might like to come . It will be quite informal . And I 'm sure you 'll like it . If so , will you let Jill Trumbull know ? Sondra Finchley . "
86933	86939	88464	88464	she	349	" Now and Then Club , "
88454	88463	88464	88464	she	349	" No trouble to tell who you are , "
88475	88511	88534	88534	she	349	" I 'm Jill Trumbull . Miss Finchley has n't come yet . But I can do the honors just as well , I guess . Come right in where the rest of us are . "
88537	88552	88559	88559	Clyde	201	" You do look an awful lot like Gil Griffiths , do n't you ? "
88553	88557	88625	88625	she	349	" Do I ? "
88611	88624	88645	88645	she	349	" Here , Tracy , you do the announcing , will you ? "
88628	88644	88714	88714	he	201	" My brother , Tracy Trumbull , Mr. Griffiths . Mr. Clyde Griffiths , everybody , "
88703	88713	88742	88742	Tracy	352	" Do n't all stop talking on my account , "
88745	88785	88813	88813	her	2950	" I 'm not going to do any man - to - man introduction stuff . We 'll stand right here and point 'em out . That 's my sister , Gertrude , over there talking to Scott Nicholson . "
88828	88832	88910	88910	he	201	" Howja do . "
88886	88909	88954	88954	Clyde	201	" They 're arguing over a recent Cornell - Syracuse foot - ball game ... Burchard Taylor and Miss Phant of Utica , "
88924	88953	89031	89031	his	201	" Perley Haynes and Miss Vanda Steele ... well , I guess that 's all as yet . Oh , no , here come Grant and Nina Temple . "
89010	89023	89064	89065	young Cranston	207	" Hello , Jill . Hello , Vanda . Hello , Wynette . "
89052	89061	89064	89065	young Cranston	207	" Did n't think we 'd make it , "
89072	89124	89133	89134	Scott Nicholson	356	" Nina did n't want to come , but I promised Bertine and Jill or I would n't have , either . We were up at the Bagleys ' . Guess who 's up there , Scott . Van Peterson and Rhoda Hull . They 're just over for the day . "
89125	89131	89145	89145	Clyde	201	" You do n't say , "
89165	89186	89133	89134	Scott Nicholson	356	" Why did n't you bring 'em along ? I 'd like to see Rhoda again and Van , too . "
89187	89225	89242	89243	Frank Harriet	357	" Could n't . They have to go back early , they say . They may stop in later for a minute . Gee , is n't dinner served yet ? I expected to sit right down . "
89226	89240	89272	89272	Clyde	201	" These lawyers ! Do n't you know they do n't eat often ? "
89276	89308	89612	89612	Gertrude	351	" Well , whether they do or not , we do , or out I go . Did you hear who is being touted for stroke next year over at Cornell ? "
89619	89656	89664	89664	Clyde	201	" The crowd 's a little late in getting together . It always is . If we said eight , they 'd come at eight - thirty or nine . Is n't that always the way ? "
89657	89662	89687	89687	she	2974	" It certainly is , "
89680	89686	89687	89687	she	2974	" I 'm Gertrude Trumbull , "
89690	89700	89740	89740	She	2974	" The sister of the good - looking Jill , "
89714	89739	89740	89740	She	2974	" You nodded to me , but you do n't know me . Just the same we 've been hearing a lot about you . "
89754	89801	89815	89815	Clyde	201	" A mysterious Griffiths here in Lycurgus whom no one seems to have met . I saw you once in Central Avenue , though . You were going into Rich 's candy store . You did n't know that , though . Do you like candy ? "
89802	89813	89890	89890	she	1435	" Oh , yes , I like candy . Why ? "
89881	89889	89890	89890	she	1435	" You 're probably just saying that , "
89900	89920	89925	89925	Clyde	201	" More likely you were buying it for some girl . You have a girl , have n't you ? "
89921	89924	89938	89938	Roberta	302	" Why — "
89947	89957	89996	89996	he	201	" Had any one ever seen him with Roberta ? "
89999	90012	90041	90041	he	201	" No , I have n't . What makes you ask that ? "
90034	90040	90041	90041	he	201	" But what a question , "
90048	90058	90114	90114	She	302	" You like to tease , do n't you ? "
90059	90113	90114	90114	She	302	" Who , me ? Oh , no . I would n't do anything like that . But I 'm sure you have just the same . I like to ask questions sometimes , just to see what people will say when they do n't want you to know what they really think . "
90124	90143	90154	90154	he	201	" But I know you have a girl just the same . All good - looking fellows have . "
90144	90153	90154	90154	he	201	" Oh , am I good - looking ? "
90163	90168	90242	90242	She	2979	" Who said so ? "
90169	90241	90297	90297	she	2979	" As though you did n't know . Well , different people . I for one . And Sondra Finchley thinks you 're good - looking , too . She 's only interested in men who are . So does my sister Jill , for that matter . And she only likes men who are good - looking . I 'm different because I 'm not so good - looking myself . "
90282	90296	90297	90297	she	2979	" But do n't you think you 're better looking than your cousin , "
90305	90312	90414	90414	he	201	" Some people think you are . "
90401	90413	90414	90414	he	201	" Why , I do n't think anything of the kind , "
90417	90430	90477	90477	She	1435	" Honest , I do n't . Of course I do n't . "
90431	90476	90477	90477	She	1435	" Oh , well , then maybe you do n't , but you are just the same . But that wo n't help you much either , unless you have money — that is , if you want to run with people who have . "
90487	90498	90582	90582	Gertrude	351	" People like money even more than they do looks . "
90574	90580	90609	90609	she	351	" Here she is now , "
90617	90638	90929	90929	she	351	" She 'll be looking to see if you notice how pretty she looks , so do n't disappoint her . "
90907	90912	90977	90977	She	351	" Oh , Hellos , "
90940	90976	91087	91087	his	2989	" Oh , here you are . You decided to come after all . I was n't sure whether you would think it worth while . You 've been introduced to everybody , of course ? "
91030	91041	91062	91062	she	351	" Yes , I met nearly everybody , I think . "
91042	91061	91124	91124	she	351	" Except Freddie Sells . He came in with me just now . Here you are , Freddie , "
91109	91123	91124	91124	she	351	" This is Clyde Griffiths , I was telling you about , Fred , "
91128	91138	91149	91165	this amiable person , who seemed to be slightly troubled with weak eyes since he bent close	2990	" Does n't he look a lot like Gilbert ? "
91139	91147	91163	91163	he	2990	" Why , you do at that , "
91167	91224	91233	91233	Clyde	201	" I hear you 're a cousin of Gil 's . I know him well . We went through Princeton together . I used to be over here before I joined the General Electric over at Schenectady . But I 'm around a good bit yet . You 're connected with the factory , I suppose . "
91225	91231	91331	91332	Mr. Sells	370	" Yes , I am , "
91299	91309	91318	91318	Clyde	201	" In charge of some department , I suppose ? "
91310	91316	91331	91332	Mr. Sells	370	" Yes , I am , "
91324	91328	91331	91332	Mr. Sells	370	" You know , "
91348	91439	91466	91466	he	201	" I 've always wondered just what , outside of money , there is to the collar business . Gil and I used to argue about that when we were down at college . He used to try to tell me that there was some social importance to making and distributing collars , giving polish and manner to people who would n't otherwise have them , if it were n't for cheap collars . I think he musta read that in a book somewhere . I always laughed at him . "
91458	91462	91495	91495	Sondra	186	" Social importance . "
91515	91555	91587	91587	Clyde	201	" Oh , no arguments , Freddie . That 's not interesting . Besides I want him to meet my brother and Bertine . You remember Miss Cranston . She was with me at your uncle 's last spring . "
91580	91586	91672	91672	she	2995	" Yes , of course , "
91655	91671	91695	91695	She	2995	" Oh , how do you do ? It 's nice to see you again , "
91716	91750	91759	91759	he	201	" You 've been terribly busy with your work , I suppose . But now that you 've come out once , I suppose we 'll see more of you here and there . "
91751	91758	91824	91824	Stuart	188	" Well , I hope so , "
91830	91879	91950	91950	He	201	" Oh , how do you do . Glad to know you . My sister has just been telling me about you . Going to stay in Lycurgus long ? Hope you do . We 'll run into one another once in a while then , I suppose . "
91935	91949	91993	91994	Jill Trumbull	349	" Wait a minute , Wyn . I want to ask you something . "
91998	92035	92056	92056	Sondra	186	" Come on , people . It 's not my fault . The cook 's mad about something and you 're all late anyhow . We 'll get it over with and then dance , eh ? "
92036	92054	92056	92056	Sondra	186	" You can sit between me and Miss Trumbull when she gets the rest of us seated , "
92058	92073	92548	92548	he	201	" Wo n't that be nice ? And now you may take me in . "
92528	92541	92586	92586	she	3018	" Are you going to let me dance with you after dinner ? "
92571	92585	92586	92586	she	3018	" Why , yes , of course , if you want me to , "
92603	92607	92586	92586	she	3018	" Just one ? "
92608	92635	92586	92586	she	3018	" How many do you want ? There are a dozen boys here , you know . Did you get a program when you came in ? "
92636	92643	92675	92675	She	3018	" I did n't see any . "
92644	92674	92675	92675	She	3018	" Never mind . After dinner you can get one . And you may put me down for three and eight . That will leave you room for others . "
92679	92691	92699	92699	He	201	" You have to be nice to everybody , you know . "
92692	92698	92699	92699	He	201	" Yes , I know . "
92706	92740	92810	92810	she	3018	" But ever since I saw you at my uncle 's last April , I 've been wishing I might see you again . I always look for your name in the papers . "
92803	92809	92810	92810	she	3018	" Oh , do you ? "
92813	92827	92913	92913	He	3019	" Is n't that nice ? But what do you read about me ? "
92828	92884	92904	92904	Her	3018	" That you were at Twelfth and Greenwood Lakes and up at Sharon for the swimming contests . I saw where you went up to Paul Smith 's , too . The papers here seemed to think you were interested in some one from Schroon Lake and that you might be going to marry him . "
92885	92903	92942	92942	she	3018	" Oh , did they ? How silly . The papers here always say such silly things . "
92934	92941	92904	92904	Her	3018	" Do you like to ride ? "
92948	92973	92996	92996	she	3018	" I never have . You know I never had much chance at that , but I always thought I could if I tried . "
92974	92995	92996	92996	she	3018	" Of course , it 's not hard . If you took a lesson or two you could , and , "
93004	93030	93072	93072	he	3019	" we might go for a canter sometime . There are lots of horses in our stable that you would like , I 'm sure . "
93063	93071	93072	93072	he	3019	" Oh , I would love that , "
93075	93081	93165	93165	Sondra	186	" That would be wonderful . "
93145	93163	93177	93177	Clyde	201	" You had better see about your program and your dance before all the others are gone , "
93167	93175	93177	93177	Clyde	201	" Yes , I will right away , "
93179	93189	93208	93208	She	3018	" but is two all I get with you ? "
93190	93207	93375	93376	Nina Temple	362	" Well , make it three , five and eight then , in the first half . "
93392	93401	93407	93407	Clyde	201	" She is graceful , is n't she ? "
93402	93405	93407	93407	Clyde	201	" Who ? "
93425	93434	93448	93448	He	201	" I do n't know who you mean . "
93435	93447	93543	93543	Sondra	186	" Do n't you ? Then what are you blushing for ? "
93550	93585	93618	93618	He	201	" You do dance well , do n't you ? I suppose you must have done a lot of dancing before you came here — in Chicago , was n't it , or where ? "
93592	93617	93773	93773	she	362	" I was in Chicago before I came here , but I did n't do so very much dancing . I had to work . "
93788	93794	93773	93773	she	362	" Having a good time ? "
93795	93802	93773	93773	she	362	" Yes — looking at you . "
93803	93816	93773	93773	she	362	" When there are so many other nice girls to look at ? "
93817	93830	93773	93773	she	362	" Oh , there are no other girls as nice as you . "
93831	93872	93906	93906	he	201	" And I dance better than any other girl , and I 'm much the best - looking of any other girl here . Now — I've said it all for you . Now what are you going to say ? "
93901	93905	93906	93906	he	201	" I see , "
93911	93926	93937	93937	Sondra	186	" Every fellow tells you that , so you do n't want me to . "
93927	93936	93937	93937	Sondra	186	" Oh , no , not every fellow . "
93951	93966	93977	93977	he	201	" There are lots of people who do n't think I 'm very pretty . "
93967	93976	94031	94031	he	201	" Oh , do n't they , though ? "
94035	94051	94060	94060	her	362	" You like everything out - of - doors and athletic , do n't you ? "
94052	94058	94060	94060	her	362	" Oh , do I ? "
94066	94104	94112	94112	Clyde	201	" There is n't anything I like as much , really . I 'm just crazy about riding , tennis , swimming , motor - boating , aqua - planing . You swim , do n't you ? "
94105	94110	94112	94112	Clyde	201	" Oh , sure , "
94116	94122	94134	94134	he	201	" Do you play tennis ? "
94123	94133	94163	94163	Clyde	201	" Well , I 've just taken it up , "
94148	94162	94188	94188	she	362	" Oh , I just love tennis . We might play sometime together . "
94193	94262	94588	94588	he	201	" Bella Griffiths and Stuart and Grant and I play fine doubles . We won nearly all the finals at Greenwood and Twelfth Lake last summer . And when it comes to aqua - planing and high diving you just ought to see me . We have the swiftest motor - boat up at Twelfth Lake now — Stuart has . It can do sixty miles an hour . "
94579	94587	94602	94602	she	362	" Oh , the dance is done , "
94592	94601	94723	94723	His	3033	" Let 's try to make them encore , "
94653	94679	94808	94810	the moving couples	3034	" Oh , I 'm so glad to be with you again — to be dancing with you . It 's so wonderful ... Sondra . "
94680	94700	94723	94723	His	3033	" But you must n't call me that , you know . You do n't know me well enough . "
94701	94722	94808	94810	the moving couples	3034	" I mean Miss Finchley . But you 're not going to be mad at me again , are you ? "
94736	94761	94808	94810	the moving couples	3034	" No . Was I mad at you ? I was n't really . I like you some ... when you 're not sentimental . "
94774	94791	94808	94810	the moving couples	3034	" I 'd like to see if it 's still snowing outside , would n't you ? "
94797	94806	95335	95335	she	349	" Oh , yes . Let 's go . "
95322	95334	95335	95335	she	349	" Tracy will be glad to stop for you in time , "
95339	95342	95335	95335	she	349	" or — "
95344	95383	95808	95808	he	201	hesitated—"perhaps you 'd like to come over for dinner with us before we go . It 'll be just the family , but we 'd be delighted to have you . The dancing does n't begin till eleven . "
95812	95918	95969	95969	her	302	" I have to break that engagement to - night , honey . Been invited to my uncle 's , and I have to go . And I 'm not sure that I can get around afterwards . I 'll try if I get through in time . But I 'll see you on the Fonda car to - morrow if I do n't . I 've got something I want to give you , so do n't feel too bad . Just got word this morning or I 'd have let you know . You 're not going to feel bad , are you ? "
95977	95982	96388	96388	She	3068	" Oh , no , "
96373	96387	96422	96422	he	201	" Oh , hello , I did n't expect to find you here . "
96431	96443	96467	96467	she	3068	" Are n't you going to dance with me at all ? "
96444	96466	96422	96422	he	201	" Why , of course , if you want me to . I thought maybe you had forgotten me by now , "
96471	96517	96597	96597	She	3068	" As though I 'd be likely to forget you . The only reason I 'm here to - night is because I thought I might see you again . I have n't thought of any one or anything else since I saw you last . "
96577	96596	96597	96597	She	3068	" My , but you can say the nicest things in the nicest way when you want to . "
96614	96626	96643	96643	he	201	" And you say them just as though you meant them . "
96627	96642	96700	96700	she	3068	" Do you mean to say that you do n't believe me , Sondra , "
96688	96699	96768	96768	she	3068	" Oh , yes , I do . Of course , "
96747	96766	96768	96768	she	3068	" But you must say now what dance you want . I see some one coming for me . "
96780	96794	96813	96813	she	3068	" You may have the eleventh . That 's the next after this . "
96795	96800	96813	96813	she	3068	" Is that all ? "
96801	96812	96998	96998	she	3068	" Well , and the fourteenth , then , greedy , "
97001	97018	97033	97033	he	201	" You 've been invited to the Harriets ' for Christmas Eve , have n't you ? "
97019	97032	97033	97033	he	201	" Yes , and I owe it all to you , too , "
97037	97045	96998	96998	she	3068	" Are you going to be there ? "
97046	97156	97157	97157	She	3074	" Oh , I 'm awfully sorry . I am invited and I wish now that I was going . But you know I arranged some time ago to go over to Albany and then up to Saratoga for the holidays . I 'm going to - morrow , but I 'll be back before New Year 's . Some friends of Freddie 's are giving a big affair over in Schenectady New Year 's Eve , though . And your cousin Bella and my brother Stuart and Grant and Bertine are going . If you 'd like to go , you might go along with us over there . "
97163	97166	97157	97157	She	3074	" me , "
97172	97175	97473	97473	she	3074	" us . "
97467	97472	97473	97473	she	3074	" But you know , "
97477	97584	97629	97629	he	3083	" you must n't pay so very much attention to me over there or here or anywhere or think anything of it , if I do n't to you . I may not be able to see so very much of you if you do . I 'll tell you about that sometime . You see my father and mother are funny people . And so are some of my friends here . But if you 'll just be nice and sort of indifferent — you know — I may be able to see quite a little of you this winter yet . Do you see ? "
97613	97628	97671	97671	Sondra	186	" But you care for me a little , then , do n't you ? "
97674	97741	97773	97773	He	3085	" Well , I 'll tell you . I do and I do n't . That is , I ca n't tell yet . I like you a lot . Sometimes I think I like you more than others . You see we do n't know each other very well yet . But you 'll come with me to Schenectady , though , wo n't you ? "
97742	97748	97671	97671	Sondra	186	" Oh , will I ? "
97749	97772	97815	97815	She	3086	" I 'll write you more about that , or call you up . You have a telephone , have n't you ? "
97779	97814	98060	98060	he	201	" And if by any chance there 's any change or I have to break the engagement , do n't think anything of it . I 'll see you later — somewhere , sure . "
98070	98155	98164	98164	she	3093	" HONEY : Awfully sorry , but just told that I have to be at a meeting of department heads downstairs at three . That means I ca n't go to Fonda with you , but will drop around to the room for a few minutes right after closing . Have something I want to give you , so be sure and wait . But do n't feel too bad . It ca n't be helped . See you sure when you come back Wednesday .
98156	98159	99060	99060	he	201	" CLYDE . "
99047	99059	99060	99060	he	201	" Gee , I 'm awfully sorry about this , Roberta , "
99076	99129	99173	99173	he	201	" I had n't an idea until about a couple of hours ago that they were going to have this meeting . But you know how it is . You just ca n't get out of a thing like this . You 're not going to feel too bad , are you ? "
99155	99172	99173	99173	he	201	" I 'm glad I got the chance to bring this around to you , though , "
99182	99213	99267	99267	she	302	" I meant to bring it around last night only that other business came up . Gee , I 'm sorry about the whole thing . Really , I am . "
99254	99266	99293	99293	Clyde	201	" Did you have a good time last night , dear ? "
99285	99291	99427	99427	He	3106	" Oh , pretty good , "
99322	99426	99427	99427	He	3106	" I thought I was just going over to my uncle 's for dinner like I told you . But after I got there I found that what they really wanted me for was to escort Bella and Myra over to some doings in Gloversvile . There 's a rich family over there , the Steeles — big glove people , you know . Well , anyhow , they were giving a dance and they wanted me to take them over because Gil could n't go . But it was n't so very interesting . I was glad when it was all over . "
99455	99472	99510	99510	he	3106	" You did n't get through in time then to come around here , did you ? "
99473	99509	99630	99630	she	3107	" No , I did n't , 'cause I had to wait for the bunch to come back . I just could n't get away . But are n't you going to open your present ? "
99619	99629	99594	99594	He	3106	" Who all were over there beside your cousins ? "
99634	99656	99667	99667	she	3107	" Oh , a lot of people that you do n't know . Twenty or thirty from different places around here . "
99657	99666	99705	99705	He	3111	" Any others from Lycurgus beside your cousins ? "
99670	99704	99843	99843	she	302	" Oh , a few . We picked up Jill Trumbull and her sister , because Bella wanted to . Arabella Stark and Perley Haynes were already over there when we got there . "
99825	99842	99912	99912	he	201	" I wanted so much to be with you last night to give you your present , "
99901	99911	99912	99912	he	201	" But you know how that was , Roberta , "
99922	99928	99934	99934	she	302	" I just told you . "
99929	99933	100003	100003	she	302	" I know , "
99991	100002	100003	100003	she	302	" Oh , this is beautiful , is n't it ? "
100015	100036	100095	100095	he	201	" I did n't expect anything like this . My two little presents wo n't seem like very much now . "
100086	100094	100117	100117	she	302	" You like it , do you ? "
100110	100116	100135	100135	she	302	" Of course , dear , "
100125	100134	100135	100135	she	302	" But mine wo n't seem so much , "
100153	100181	100336	100336	He	201	" But they 'll be useful to you and you 'll always have them near you , next your heart , where I want them to be . "
100296	100335	100592	100592	he	201	" Oh , gee , these are swell , honey , and just what I need . You certainly could n't have given me anything that would come in handier . I can use them all the time . "
100605	100650	100708	100708	She	302	" I guess I 'll have to be going now , honey . It 's twenty of three now and that meeting is for three . I wish I could ride over with you , but I 'll see you when you get back . "
100736	100799	100817	100817	Clyde	201	" Well , I do n't want you to be late , Clyde . You better hurry . But I do n't want to stay over there either later than Christmas night . Do you suppose if I come back early Christmas afternoon , you will come over here at all ? I do n't want to be late Wednesday for work . "
100800	100815	100832	100832	he	201	" Why , sure , of course , honey , I 'll be around , "
100854	100864	100887	100887	He	201	" What time do you expect to get in ? "
100896	100907	100927	100927	she	302	" I 'll have to be going now , though , "
100952	100980	101014	101014	he	201	" Now , this is sure for Christmas night , is it , Clyde ? You wo n't make any other engagement this time , will you ? "
100981	101013	102089	102089	she	447	" Oh , do n't worry . You know me . You know I could n't help that other , honey , but I 'll be on hand Tuesday , sure , "
102062	102088	102132	102132	she	447	" How does it feel , Bob , to come back to the country ? I suppose it all looks rather poor compared to Lycurgus , "
102148	102168	102197	102197	she	447	" Oh , Mamma , wherever you are is just the nicest place . Do n't you know that ? "
102191	102196	102197	102197	she	447	" Well , Bobbie , "
102202	102211	102392	102392	she	302	" you know how you are about me . "
102396	102417	102469	102470	her mother	447	" Oh , I wish you could have been with me all the time in Lycurgus , Mamma . Maybe — "
102458	102468	102469	102470	her mother	447	" Yes , I suppose you do miss me , "
102474	102511	102469	102470	her mother	447	" but it 's better for you , do n't you think ? You know how it is over here , and you like your work . You do like your work , do n't you ? "
102512	102552	102469	102470	her mother	447	" Oh , the work is nice enough . I like that part of it . It 's been so nice to be able to help here a little , but it 's not so nice living all alone . "
102553	102580	102591	102591	Roberta	302	" Why did you leave the Newtons , Bob ? Was Grace so disagreeable ? I should have thought she would have been company for you . "
102581	102589	102591	102591	Roberta	302	" Oh , she was at first , "
102593	102676	102689	102690	Her mother	447	" Only she did n't have any men friends of her own , and she was awfully jealous of anybody that paid the least attention to me . I could n't go anywhere but she had to go along , or if it was n't that then she always wanted me to be with her , so I could n't go anywhere by myself . You know how it is , Mamma . Two girls ca n't go with one young man . "
102677	102688	102689	102690	Her mother	447	" Yes , I know how it is , Bob . "
102698	102703	102713	102713	she	302	" Who is he ? "
102704	102712	102782	102782	she	302	" It 's Mr. Griffiths , Mother , "
102766	102781	102782	102782	she	302	" But I do n't want you to mention his name to anybody yet , "
102785	102915	103146	103146	she	379	" He does n't want me to . His relatives are so very rich , you know . They own the company — that is , his uncle does . But there 's a rule there about any one who works for the company — any one in charge of a department . I mean not having anything to do with any of the girls . And he would n't with any of the others . But he likes me — and I like him , and it 's different with us . Besides I 'm going to resign pretty soon and get a place somewhere else , I think , and then it wo n't make any difference . I can tell anybody , and so can he . "
103149	103167	103146	103146	she	379	" A relative of the owner , you say — the Mr. Samuel Griffiths you wrote about ? "
103168	103178	103188	103189	her mother	447	" Yes , Mamma . He 's his nephew . "
103179	103187	103310	103310	Roberta	302	" The young man at the factory ? "
103306	103309	103310	103310	Roberta	302	" Yes , "
103314	103322	103310	103310	Roberta	302	" What 's he like , Bob ? "
103323	103396	103310	103310	Roberta	302	" Oh , awfully nice . So good - looking , and he 's been so nice to me . I do n't think the place would be as nice as it is except that he is so refined , he keeps those factory girls in their place . He 's a nephew of the president of the company , you see , and the girls just naturally have to respect him . "
103397	103450	103460	103460	Roberta	302	" Well , that is nice , is n't it ? I think it 's so much better to work for refined people than just anybody . I know you did n't think so much of the work over at Trippetts Mills . Does he come to see you often , Bob ? "
103451	103459	103480	103481	Mrs. Alden	379	" Well , yes , pretty often , "
103502	103511	103521	103521	Roberta	302	" You like him , do n't you ? "
103512	103520	103480	103481	Mrs. Alden	379	" Yes , I do , Mother , "
103528	103538	103742	103742	She	302	" What about him ? Does he like you ? "
103752	103760	103772	103773	Mrs. Alden	379	" Well , he says he does . "
103761	103771	103772	103773	Mrs. Alden	379	" Do you think he intends to marry you ? "
103794	103804	103814	103814	Emily	336	" Well , I 'll tell you , Mamma ... "
103825	103855	103904	103905	his mother	587	" Oh , Gifs here . He came in an automobile . Somebody drove him over , I guess , and he 's got four or five big bundles . "
103898	103903	103904	103905	his mother	587	" Why , Gifford , "
103908	103927	103986	103986	he	3191	" We did n't expect you until the nine o'clock . How did you get here so soon ? "
103928	103985	103986	103986	he	3191	" Well , I did n't think I would be . I ran into Mr. Rearick down in Schenectady and he wanted to know if I did n't want to drive back with him . I see old Pop Myers over at Trippetts Mills has got the second story to his house at last , Bob , "
103993	104008	104016	104016	Roberta	302	" I suppose it 'll be another year before he gets the roof on . "
104009	104014	104064	104064	Gifford	380	" I suppose so , "
104056	104062	104064	104064	Gifford	380	" Hands off , Em ! "
104070	104094	104103	104104	his mother	587	" Nothing doing with those until Christmas morning . Has anybody cut a Christmas tree yet ? That was my job last year . "
104095	104102	104103	104104	his mother	587	" It still is , Gifford , "
104107	104126	104202	104202	her	302	" I told Tom to wait until you came , 'cause you always get such a good one . "
104207	104221	104320	104320	she	302	" I know something Santy has brought my Dad that he 'll like . "
104326	104353	104320	104320	she	302	" Yes , but you must n't ever say anything to anybody yet . I told him I would n't tell , and you must n't . "
104354	104396	104416	104416	she	3200	" No , I wo n't , dear . But I was just wondering . But I suppose you know what you 're doing . You 're old enough now to take care of yourself , Bob , are n't you ? "
104397	104415	104809	104809	he	387	" Yes , I am , Ma . And you must n't worry about me , dear , "
104792	104808	104809	104809	he	387	" Well , I see things are going full blast in your town , Bob , "
104812	104842	104860	104860	Roberta	302	" The Star here says the Griffiths Company have got an order for 120,000 collars from the Buffalo trade alone . They must be just coining money over there . "
104843	104858	104860	104860	Roberta	302	" There 's always plenty to do in my department , I know that , "
104864	104892	104809	104809	he	387	" We never seem to have any the less to do whether business is good or bad . I guess it must be good all the time . "
104893	104936	104860	104860	Roberta	302	" Pretty soft for those people . They do n't have to worry about anything . Some one was telling me they 're going to build a new factory in Ilion to manufacture shirts alone . Heard anything about that down there ? "
104937	104953	104985	104985	he	3219	" Why , no , I have n't . Maybe it 's some other company . "
104954	104984	104860	104860	Roberta	302	" By the way , what 's the name of that young man you said was the head of your department ? Was n't he a Griffiths , too ? "
105004	105017	105057	105057	He	3219	" Yes , his name is Griffiths — Clyde Griffiths . Why ? "
105018	105056	105064	105064	his	3219	" I think I saw his name in here a minute ago . I just wanted to see if it ai n't the same fellow . Sure , here you are . Ai n't this the one ? "
105072	105202	105215	105215	Gabel	387	" Miss Vanda Steele , of Gloversville , was hostess at an informal dance held at her home in that city Friday night , at which were present several prominent members of Lycurgus society , among them the Misses Sondra Finchiey , Bertine Cranston , Jill and Gertrude Trumbull and Perley Haynes , and Messrs. Clyde Griffiths , Frank Harriet , Tracy Trumbull , Grant Cranston and Scott Nicholson . The party , as is usual whenever the younger group assembles , did not break up until late , the Lycurgus members motoring back just before dawn . It is already rumored that most of this group will gather at the Ellerslies ' , in Schenectady , New Year 's Eve for another event of this same gay nature . "
105203	105214	105585	105585	Gabel	387	" He seems to be quite a fellow over there , "
105588	105598	105599	105599	she	3221	" That 's the fellow , is n't it ? "
105606	105625	106307	106307	he	200	" Excuse me , please , a moment . I want to get something out of my bag , "
106293	106306	106307	106307	he	200	" Look at who 's breaking into society now , will you ? "
106324	106334	106340	106341	Mrs. Griffiths	180	" We 'll be having him up here next ! "
106335	106338	106437	106438	Mrs. Griffiths	180	" Who ? "
106419	106435	106474	106474	Gilbert	200	" Now I wonder how it was that he came to be invited to that ? "
106454	106472	106474	106474	Gilbert	200	" Now , who would do it but that little Finchley snip , the little smart aleck ? "
106476	106715	106895	106895	he	3249	" She 's got the idea from somewhere — from Bella for all I know — that we do n't care to have anything to do with him , and she thinks this is a clever way to hit back at me for some of the things I 've done to her , or that she thinks I 've done . At any rate , she thinks I do n't like her , and that 's right , I do n't . And Bella knows it , too . And that goes for that little Cranston show - off , too . They 're both always running around with her . They 're a set of show - offs and wasters , the whole bunch , and that goes for their brothers , too — Grant Cranston and Stew Finchley — and if something do n't go wrong with one or another of that bunch one of these days , I miss my guess . You mark my word ! They do n't do a thing , the whole lot of them , from one year 's end to the other but play around and dance and run here and there , as though there was n't anything else in the world for them to do . And why you and Dad let Bella run with 'em as much as she does is more than I can see . "
106887	106894	106895	106895	he	3249	" He has n't any money , "
106905	107014	107184	107184	he	3260	" and he 's hanging on here by the skin of his teeth as it is . And what for ? If he is taken up by these people , what can he do ? He certainly has n't the money to do as they do , and he ca n't get it . And if he could , his job here would n't let him go anywhere much , unless some one troubled to pay his way . And how he is going to do his work and run with that crowd is more than I know . That bunch is on the go all the time . "
107178	107183	107184	107184	he	3260	" I must say , "
107196	107335	107353	107353	he	200	" I ca n't see what 's wrong with his going to a party now and then , or being invited here and there even if he has n't any money . It looks more like a compliment to him and to us than anything else . I know how Gil feels about him . But it rather looks to me as though Clyde 's just a little better than Gil thinks he is . At any rate , I ca n't and I would n't want to do anything about it . I 've asked him to come down here , and the least I can do is to give him an opportunity to better himself . He seems to be doing his work all right . Besides , how would it look if I did n't ? "
107356	107514	107527	107527	him	200	" I 'd certainly rather have him going with some of the better people than some of the worse ones — that 's one thing sure . He 's neat and polite and from all I hear at the factory does his work well enough . As a matter of fact , I think it would have been better if we had invited him up to the lake last summer for a few days anyhow , as I suggested . As it is now , if we do n't do something pretty soon , it will look as though we think he is n't good enough for us when the other people here seem to think he is . If you 'll take my advice , you 'll have him up here for Christmas or New Year 's , anyhow , just to show that we do n't think any less of him than our friends do . "
107531	107584	107776	107776	Gilbert	200	" Well , I 'll be hanged ! All right , only do n't think I 'm going to lay myself out to be civil to him . It 's a wonder , if Father thinks he 's so able , that he do n't make a real position for him somewhere . "
107795	107866	108367	108367	he	201	" Oh , all right . Invite him if you want to — if that 's the way you and Dad feel about it . I do n't see any real necessity for it even now . But you fix it to suit yourself . Constance and I are going over to Utica for the afternoon , anyhow , so I could n't be there even if I wanted to . "
108351	108366	108894	108894	he	201	" You 're coming with us , are n't you ? Sure you are , "
108900	109026	109043	109043	he	3300	" Gee , but this society business here is getting to be the dizzy thing , honey . I never saw such a town as this . Once you go with these people one place to do one thing , they always have something else they want you to do . They 're on the go all the time . When I went there Friday ( he was referring to his lie about having gone to the Griffiths ' ) , I thought that would be the last until after the holidays , but yesterday , and just when I was planning to go somewhere else , I got a note saying they expected me to come there again to - day for dinner sure . "
109027	109042	109043	109043	he	3300	" And to - day when I thought the dinner would begin at two , "
109048	109126	109135	109135	she	3301	" and end in time for me to be around here by eight like I said , it did n't start until three and only broke up a few minutes ago . Is n't that the limit ? And I just could n't get away for the last four hours . How 've you been , honey ? Did you have a good time ? I hope so . Did they like the present I gave you ? "
109155	109168	109510	109510	she	3301	" Oh , Clyde , how can you treat me like this ? "
109493	109509	109542	109542	she	3301	" So that was why you did n't come to - night , was it ? "
109527	109541	109558	109558	he	201	" I thought you told me sure you would n't let anything interfere , "
109550	109557	109542	109542	she	3301	" Well , so I did , "
109561	109634	109747	109747	she	302	" And I would n't have either , except for the letter I got . You know I would n't let any one but my uncle interfere , but I could n't turn them down when they asked me to come there on Christmas Day . It 's too important . It would n't look right , would it , especially when you were n't going to be here in the afternoon ? "
109741	109746	109747	109747	she	302	" Well , anyhow , "
109757	109783	109747	109747	she	302	" do n't you think you might have left a note here , Clyde , so I would have got it when I got in ? "
109797	109830	109747	109747	she	302	" But did n't I just tell you , honey , I did n't expect to be so late . I thought the thing would all be over by six , anyhow . "
109831	109844	109959	109959	Roberta	302	" Yes — well — anyhow — I know — but still — "
109965	109993	110051	110051	he	201	" I notice that The Star mentioned that Gloversville party Sunday , but it did n't say anything about your cousins being over there . Were they ? "
110044	110050	110051	110051	he	201	" Of course they were , "
110055	110073	110130	110130	Her	3304	" Why do you want to ask a thing like that when I told you they were ? "
110074	110129	110196	110196	his	201	" Well , dear , I do n't mean anything by it . I only wanted to know . But I did notice that it mentioned all those other people from Lycurgus that you are always talking about , Sondra Finchley , Bertine Cranston . You know you never mentioned anybody but the Trumbulls . "
110145	110180	110335	110335	She	3304	" Yes , I saw that , too , but it ai n't so . If they were there , I did n't see them . The papers do n't always get everything right . "
110351	110405	110418	110418	he	201	" Oh , Clyde , you do n't have to story to me . Do n't you know that ? I would n't care where you went if you would just tell me beforehand and not leave me like this all alone on Christmas night . It 's just that that hurts so . "
110406	110417	110418	110418	he	201	" But I 'm not storying to you , Roberta , "
110422	110530	110697	110697	she	302	" I ca n't help how things look even if the paper did say so . The Griffiths were over there , and I can prove it . I got around here as soon as I could to - day . What do you want to get so mad about all at once ? I 've told you how things are . I ca n't do just as I want to here . They call me up at the last minute and want me to go . And I just ca n't get out of it . What 's the use of being so mad about it ? "
110686	110696	110846	110846	him	201	" Do you like that Miss Finchley very much ? "
110850	110880	110900	110900	Roberta	302	" Oh , I like her some , sure . She 's very pretty , and a dandy dancer . And she has lots of money and dresses well . "
110930	110958	111101	111101	he	201	" Yes , and who would n't , with all the money she has ? If I had as much money as that , I could too . "
111109	111173	111184	111184	Roberta	302	" Oh , now , Roberta , as though I could n't tell you about her or any one else without your getting mad about it ! I did n't mean that I was especially interested in her . I was just telling you what I thought you wanted to know because you asked me if I liked her , that 's all . "
111174	111182	111193	111193	her	302	" Oh , yes , I know , "
111212	111259	111461	111461	she	302	" But they 've got everything . You know they have . And I have n't got anything , really . And it 's so hard for me to keep up my end and against all of them , too , and with all they have . "
111464	111520	111567	111567	he	201	" If I 'd ever had a chance like some girls — if I 'd ever been anywhere or seen anything ! But just to be brought up in the country and without any money or clothes or anything — and nobody to show you . Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh ! "
111559	111566	111567	111567	he	201	" Oh , Roberta , darling , "
111586	111829	112860	112861	Stuart Finchley	188	" You must n't cry like that , dearest . You must n't . I did n't mean to hurt you , honest I did n't . Truly , I did n't , dear . I know you 've had a hard time , honey . I know how you feel , and how you 've been up against things in one way and another . Sure I do , Roberta , and you must n't cry , dearest . I love you just the same . Truly I do , and I always will . I 'm sorry if I 've hurt you , honest I am . I could n't help it to - night if I did n't come , honest , or last Friday either . Why , it just was n't possible . But I wo n't be so mean like that any more , if I can help it . Honest I wo n't . You 're the sweetest , dearest girl . And you 've got such lovely hair and eyes , and such a pretty little figure . Honest you have , Roberta . And you can dance too , as pretty as anybody . And you look just as nice , honest you do , dear . Wo n't you stop now , honey ? Please do . I 'm so sorry , honey , if I 've hurt you in any way . "
112866	112876	112879	112879	Sondra	186	" Now we 'll take you home , Griffiths . "
112900	112927	112936	112936	Clyde	201	" If you want to come over to our place , I 'll make some hot chocolate before you go home . Would you like that ? "
112928	112935	112948	112948	Stuart	188	" Oh , sure I would , "
112941	112946	112948	112948	Stuart	188	" Here goes then , "
112958	112978	112995	112995	Sondra	186	" But as for me , I 'm going to turn in . It 's way after three now . "
112979	112993	113088	113088	he	201	" That 's a good brother . Your beauty sleep , you know , "
113074	113087	113088	113088	he	201	" My , this is a big kitchen , is n't it ? "
113091	113108	113110	113110	she	3351	" What a lot of things you have here to cook with , have n't you ? "
113143	113160	113383	113383	she	3351	" Oh , I do n't know . Are n't all kitchens as big as this ? "
113386	113432	113442	113442	Clyde	201	" Now , is n't this chummy ? I just love to get out in the kitchen like this , but I can only do it when the cook 's out . He wo n't let any one near the place when he 's here . "
113433	113440	113546	113546	she	3351	" Oh , is that so ? "
113513	113545	113546	113546	she	3351	" Is n't it wonderful to be together like this , Sondra ? Just think , I hardly got a chance to say a word to you all evening , alone , "
113559	113570	113787	113787	he	201	" You think so ? I 'm glad you do , "
113791	113840	113923	113923	she	3351	" Oh , if only I could say to her how beautiful I really think she is . If I could just put my arms around her and kiss her , and kiss her , and kiss her , and have her kiss me in the same way . "
113929	113940	113964	113964	he	201	" Was there anything very important you wanted to say ? "
113941	113963	113923	113923	she	3351	" I 'd like to say a lot of things to you , Sondra , if you would only let me , "
113968	113976	114007	114007	her	3351	" But you told me not to . "
113977	114000	114010	114010	she	3351	" Oh , so I did . Well , I meant that , too . I 'm glad you mind so well . "
114020	114036	114045	114045	Clyde	201	" But you do n't really believe I meant all of that , do you ? "
114065	114102	114133	114133	she	3351	" You did n't mean all of it , then , did you , Sondra ? Not all of it , anyhow . Oh , I wish I could tell you all that I am thinking . "
114141	114163	114203	114203	he	201	" Oh , yes , I 'm sure I did . You take almost everything too seriously , do n't you ? "
114185	114202	114203	114203	he	201	" I ca n't help it , Sondra . I ca n't ! I ca n't ! "
114211	114356	114651	114651	she	3368	" You do n't know what effect you have on me . You 're so beautiful . Oh , you are . You know you are . I think about you all the time . Really I do , Sondra . You 've made me just crazy about you , so much so that I can hardly sleep for thinking about you . Gee , I 'm wild ! I never go anywhere or see you any place but what I think of you all the time afterward . Even to - night when I saw you dancing with all those fellows I could hardly stand it . I just wanted you to be dancing with me — no one else . You 've got such beautiful eyes , Sondra , and such a lovely mouth and chin , and such a wonderful smile . "
114627	114650	114651	114651	she	3368	" I 'm sure I ought n't to let you say all these things to me . I know I should n't , "
114661	114677	114703	114703	His	3367	" It is n't the right thing to do , I know , but still — "
114678	114702	114711	114711	she	3368	" Why not ? Why is n't it right , Sondra ? Why may n't I when I care for you so much ? "
114718	114723	114733	114733	She	3368	" Oh , well , "
114727	114732	114711	114711	she	3368	" I — I — "
114739	114753	114756	114756	she	3368	" Do n't think they would ever let us go on with it , "
114760	114771	114812	114812	his	3367	" I guess I do n't know you well enough . "
114772	114803	114938	114938	she	3368	" Oh , Sondra , when I love you so much and I 'm so crazy about you ! Do n't you care at all like I care for you ? "
114928	114937	114938	114938	she	3368	" I think you 'd better go now , "
114946	114951	114953	114953	Clyde	201	" Do n't you ? "
114983	114986	115049	115049	she	3368	" Angry ? "
115040	115046	115163	115163	she	302	" It 's very late , "
115182	115185	115820	115820	Roberta	302	" blues , "
115780	115789	116671	116671	she	302	" Thy desire shall be to thy mate . "
116683	116750	116756	116756	he	201	" CLYDE — I must see you to - night , sure , sure . You must n't fail me . I have something to tell you . Please come as soon after work as possible , or meet me anywhere . I 'm not angry or mad about anything . But I must see you to - night , sure . Please say right away where .
116751	116754	116990	116990	She	302	" ROBERTA . "
116996	117017	117039	117039	she	302	" Why , what 's the matter , Roberta ? What are you so frightened about ? What 's happened ? "
117033	117038	117039	117039	she	302	" Oh , Clyde , "
117044	117064	117102	117102	he	201	" I hardly know how to tell you . It 's so terrible for me if it 's so . "
117085	117101	117102	117102	he	201	" Why , what is it , Bert ? Why do n't you tell me ? "
117126	117143	117294	117294	she	302	" What 's wrong ? What are you so excited about ? You 're all trembly . "
117287	117293	117294	117294	she	302	" You know , Clyde , "
117316	117328	117542	117542	he	201	" you said if anything went wrong you 'd help me . "
117545	117591	117645	117645	she	302	" Yes , but how do you know that there is anything wrong ? You ca n't be sure so soon as all this , can you ? How can you ? You 'll probably be all right to - morrow , wo n't you ? "
117608	117641	117684	117684	he	201	" Oh , no , I do n't think so , Clyde . I wish I did . It 's two whole days , and it 's never been that way before . "
117687	117711	117744	117744	she	302	" Oh , well , that might not mean anything , either . Girls go longer than two days , do n't they ? "
117747	117792	118382	118382	he	201	" Oh , no , I do n't think so . Anyhow , it would be terrible , would n't it , if something were wrong ? What do you suppose I ought to do ? Do n't you know something I can take ? "
118390	118463	119509	119509	he	201	" Well , I would n't worry about it any more to - night if I were you . You may be all right yet , you know . You ca n't be sure . Anyhow , I 'll have to have a little time until I can see what I can do . I think I can get something for you . But I wish you would n't get so excited . "
119488	119492	120209	120209	he	201	" past her time "
120223	120291	120404	120404	he	201	" I want to know something . I want to know if you know of anything — well , you see , it 's this way — I'm just married and my wife is past her time and I ca n't afford to have any children now if I can help it . Is there anything a person can get that will get her out of it ? "
120408	120485	120718	120719	the clerk	3509	" I 'm sorry , young man , but I 'm afraid I ca n't help you in this case . I have n't a thing of that kind in stock here — never handle anything of that kind because I do n't believe in 'em . It may be , though , that some of the other stores here in town carry something of the sort . I would n't be able to tell you . "
120730	120732	121393	121393	He	201	" effectual "
121281	121392	121612	121612	he	201	" Well , you 'll be all right now , eh ? Anyhow , let 's hope so , huh ? It says to take one every two hours for eight or ten hours . And if you 're just a little sick , it says it does n't make any difference . You may have to knock off a day or two at the factory , but you wo n't mind that , will you , if it gets you out of this ? I 'll come around to - morrow night and see how you are , if you do n't show up any time to - morrow . "
121623	121630	123269	123269	he	201	" Oh , Clyde ! Clyde ! "
123272	123362	123440	123440	he	201	" Of course , the fact that your wife has skipped a month does n't mean that there is anything seriously wrong , you know . Women do that sometimes . Anyhow , you ca n't ever be sure until the second month has passed . Any doctor will tell you that . If she 's nervous , let her try something like this . But even if it fails to work , you ca n't be positive . She might be all right next month just the same . "
123444	123495	123693	123693	he	201	" In case things do n't come right , you do n't happen to know of a doctor she could go to , do you ? This is rather a serious business for both of us , and I 'd like to get her out of it if I could . "
123608	123692	124059	124059	he	201	" Well , there may be a doctor around here , but if so I do n't know . And I would n't undertake to send any one to a doctor like that . It 's against the law . It would certainly go hard with any doctor around here who was caught doing that sort of thing . That 's not to say , though , that you are n't at liberty to look around for yourself , if you want to , "
124095	124098	124597	124597	he	201	" midwife , "
124600	124762	124814	124814	she	3565	" Well , I 've asked around and looked into most of the drug - stores and they tell me if this one wo n't work that none will . That leaves me sorta stumped now , unless you 're willing to go and see a doctor . But the trouble with that is they 're hard to find — the ones who 'll do anything and keep their mouths shut . I 've talked with several fellows without saying who it 's for , of course , but it ai n't so easy to get one around here , because they are all too much afraid . It 's against the law , you see . But what I want to know now is , supposing I find a doctor who would do it , will you have the nerve to go and see him and tell him what the trouble is ? That 's what I want to know . "
124818	124878	124914	124914	he	201	" Oh , dear , is n't it terrible to think of us having to go to a doctor in this way ? Then he 'll know all about us , wo n't he ? And besides it 's dangerous , is n't it , although I do n't suppose it could be much worse than those old pills . "
124901	124913	124970	124970	She	3565	" Oh , do n't be getting nervous over that now , "
124917	124969	124979	124979	he	201	" It is n't anything that 's going to hurt you , I know . Besides we 'll be lucky if we find some one to do it . What I want to know is if I do find a doctor , will you be willing to go to him alone ? "
124983	125050	125149	125149	Roberta	302	" As things stand with me here , I ca n't go with you , that 's sure . I 'm too well known around here , and besides I look too much like Gilbert and he 's known to everybody . If I should be mistaken for him , or be taken for his cousin or relative , well , then the jig 's up . "
125168	125286	125667	125667	His	3570	" Not alone , Clyde ! Oh , no , I could n't do that ! Oh , dear , no ! Why , I 'd be frightened to death . Oh , dear , no . Why , I 'd be so frightened I would n't know what to do . Just think how I 'd feel , trying to explain to him alone . I just could n't do that . Besides , how would I know what to say — how to begin ? You 'll just have to go with me at first , that 's all , and explain , or I never can go — I do n't care what happens . "
125325	125666	125745	125745	she	302	" You know how it is with me here , Roberta . I ca n't go , and that 's all there is to it . Why , supposing I were seen — supposing some one should recognize me ? What then ? You know how much I 've been going around here since I 've been here . Why , it 's crazy to think that I could go . Besides , it will be a lot easier for you than for me . No doctor 's going to think anything much of your coming to him , especially if you 're alone . He 'll just think you 're some one who 's got in trouble and with no one to help you . But if I go , and it should be any one who knows anything about the Griffiths , there 'd be the deuce to pay . Right off he 'd think I was stuffed with money . Besides , if I did n't do just what he wanted me to do afterwards , he could go to my uncle , or my cousin , and then , good night ! That would be the end of me . And if I lost my place here now , and with no money and that kind of scandal connected with me , where do you suppose I would be after that , or you either ? I certainly could n't look after you then . And then what would you do ? I should think you 'd wake up and see what a tough proposition this is . My name ca n't be pulled into this without trouble for both of us . It 's got to be kept out , that 's all , and the only way for me to keep it out is for me to stay away from any doctor . Besides , he 'd feel a lot sorrier for you than he would for me . You ca n't tell me ! "
125737	125744	125745	125745	she	302	" Oh , dear ! dear ! "
125765	125819	125877	125877	He	3570	" I do n't see how we are to do then . I really do n't . For I ca n't do that and that 's all there is to it . It 's all so hard — so terrible . I 'd feel too much ashamed and frightened to ever go alone . "
125893	125949	125877	125877	He	3570	" Besides , unless this thing is n't going to cost very much , I do n't see how I 'm going to get by with it anyhow , Roberta . I really do n't . I do n't make so very much , you know — only twenty - five dollars up to now . "
125964	126053	126192	126192	him	3570	" And I have n't saved anything — not a cent . And you know why as well as I do . We spent the most of it together . Besides if I go and he thought I had money , he might want to charge me more than I could possibly dig up . But if you go and just tell him how things are — and that you have n't got anything — if you 'd only say I 'd run away or something , see — "
126195	126249	126685	126686	Orrin Short	355	" You would n't have to give your right name , you know , or where you came from . I do n't intend to pick out any doctor right around here , see . Then , if you 'd tell him you did n't have much money — just your weekly salary — "
126695	126700	127461	127461	he	201	" gents ' furnishing store "
127464	127520	127626	127626	he	355	" Well , it 's good to see you again , Mr. Griffiths . How are you ? I was just thinking it 's about time you stopped in and let me show you some of the things I got in since you were here before . How are things with the Griffiths Company anyhow ? "
127598	127621	127714	127714	He	398	" Oh , pretty fair . Ca n't kick a bit . I always have all I can do , you know . "
127672	127713	127750	127750	He	355	" Never mind looking at those , Mr. Griffiths . Look at these . These are what I want to show you and they wo n't cost you any more . Just got 'em in from New York this morning . "
127731	127749	127831	127831	he	201	" See anything else like this anywhere around here yet ? I 'll say you have n't . "
127824	127830	127873	127873	He	201	" Very nice , sure , "
127854	127872	128103	128103	Short	398	" I think maybe I 'll take this one , anyhow , and this one , too . "
128135	128163	128253	128253	he	201	" Saw you last Tuesday evening about nine o'clock going into the Finchleys ' place , did n't I ? Beautiful house and grounds they have there . "
128256	128329	128377	128377	he	201	" Oh , by the way , before I forget it . There 's something I 've been wanting to ask you about . Maybe you can tell me what I want to know . One of the boys at the factory — a young fellow who has n't been married very long — about four months now , I guess — is in a little trouble on account of his wife . "
128384	128413	128377	128377	he	201	" I do n't know why they always come to me with their troubles , but I guess they think I ought to know all about these things . "
128420	128461	128564	128564	he	398	" Only I 'm about as new and green here as anybody and so I 'm kinda stumped . But you 've been here longer than I have , I guess , and so I thought I might ask you . "
128576	128609	128620	128620	Clyde	201	" Why , sure , if it 's anything I can help you with , Mr. Griffiths , I 'll be only too glad to . Go ahead , what is it ? "
128610	128618	128635	128635	his	201	" Well , it 's this way , "
128654	128700	128787	128787	he	398	" His wife 's already two months gone and he ca n't afford a kid yet and he does n't know how to get rid of it . I told him last month when he first came to me to try a certain medicine that usually works"—this
128726	128786	128787	128787	he	398	were—"But I guess he did n't handle it right . Anyhow he 's all worked up about it now and wants to see some doctor who could do something for her , you see . Only I do n't know anybody here myself . Have n't been here long enough . If it were Kansas City or Chicago now , "
128791	128808	128883	128883	He	398	" I 'd know what to do . I know three or four doctors out there . "
128820	128882	128883	128883	He	398	" But down here it 's different . And if I started asking around in my crowd and it ever got back to my relatives , they would n't understand . But I thought if you knew of any one you would n't mind telling me . I would n't really bother myself , only I 'm sorry for this fellow . "
128929	128939	129040	129040	He	398	" You say it 's been two months now . "
128940	128943	128883	128883	He	398	" Yes . "
128944	128956	129040	129040	He	398	" And the stuff you suggested did n't work , eh ? "
128957	128960	128883	128883	He	398	" No . "
128961	128973	129040	129040	He	398	" She 's tried it again this month , has she ? "
128974	128977	129040	129040	He	398	" Yes . "
128978	129039	129052	129052	he	398	" Well , that is bad , sure enough . I guess she 's in bad all right . The trouble with this place is that I have n't been here so very long either , Mr. Griffiths . I only bought this place about a year and a half ago . Now , if I were over in Gloversville — "
129074	129250	129252	129252	Clyde	201	" You see a thing like that 's not so easy , wherever you are . Doctors are always afraid of getting in trouble . I did hear once of a case over there , though , where a girl went to a doctor — a fellow who lived a couple miles out . But she was of pretty good family too , and the fellow who took her to him was pretty well - known about there . So I do n't know whether this doctor would do anything for a stranger , although he might at that . But I know that sort of thing is going on all the time , so you might try . If you wanta send this fellow to him , tell him not to mention me or let on who sent him , 'cause I 'm pretty well - known around there and I would n't want to be mixed up in it in case anything went wrong , you see . You know how it is . "
129260	129281	129961	129961	she	302	" Oh , sure , he 'll understand all right . I 'll tell him not to mention any names . "
129979	130011	130047	130047	she	302	" Do you know just where this is , Clyde ? Can we get there on the car without much trouble , or will we have to walk a long way ? "
130051	130094	130109	130109	she	302	" Is he home at night , or will we have to go in the daytime ? It would be so much better if we could go at night . There 'd be so much less danger of any one seeing us . "
130113	130166	130453	130453	she	302	" But do you know is he old or young ? I 'd feel so much easier and safer if he were old . I do n't like young doctors . We 've always had an old doctor up home and I feel so much easier talking to some one like him . "
130447	130450	130805	130805	Clyde	201	" back out "
130485	130804	131221	131221	he	201	" Well , Roberta , how about you ? All right ? You 're not going to get cold feet now , are you ? Gee , I hope not because this is going to be a good chance to get this thing done and over with . And it is n't like you were going to some one who had n't done anything like this before , you know , because this fellow has . I got that straight . All you have to do now , is to say , well , you know , that you 're in trouble , see , and that you do n't know how you 're going to get out of it unless he 'll help you in some way , because you have n't any friends here you can go to . And besides , as things are , you could n't go to 'em if you wanted to . They 'd tell on you , see . Then if he asks where I am or who I am , you just say that I was a fellow here — but that I 've gone — give any name you want to , but that I 've gone , and you do n't know where I 've gone to — run away , see . Then you 'd better say , too , that you would n't have come to him only that you heard of another case in which he helped some one else — that a girl told you , see . Only you do n't want to let on that you 're paid much , I mean,—because if you do he may want to make the bill more than I can pay , see , unless he 'll give us a few months in which to do it , or something like that , you see . "
131243	131347	131381	131381	herself	302	" Come on now , Roberta . Gee , you ca n't act like this , you know . You do n't want to lose your nerve now that we 're here , do you ? It wo n't be so hard once you get there . I know it wo n't . All you got to do is to go up and ring the bell , see , and when he comes , or whoever comes , just say you want to see the doctor alone , see . Then he 'll understand it 's something private and it 'll be easier . "
131392	131419	131613	131613	he	201	" Well , wait here , then , will you ? Do n't go very far away , will you ? I may be right back , "
131647	131649	131868	131868	he	201	" bangs "
131871	131889	131979	131979	she	302	" Well , now who is this , please ? And what can I do for you ? "
131972	131978	132046	132046	She	302	" You see , well , "
132000	132045	132064	132064	she	302	" I came ... I came ... that is ... I do n't know whether I can tell you about myself or not . I thought I could just before I came in , but now that I am here and I see you ... "
132067	132085	132095	132095	he	3665	" Oh , dear , how very dreadful it all is . I 'm so nervous and ... "
132086	132094	132152	132152	you	302	" Well , now , my dear , "
132138	132143	132152	132152	you	302	" now that I see you,"—"Just
132157	132163	132229	132229	I	0	" he repeated after her , "
132234	132234	132342	132342	she	302	"
132370	132398	132957	132957	he	3610	" But this is ... this is ... well , something different , you know , maybe not what you think ... I ... I ... well ... "
132974	132997	133007	133007	Roberta	302	" Now , let 's see if we ca n't find out what the trouble is here . What is your name ? "
132998	133005	133077	133077	he	3610	" Ruth Howard . Mrs. Howard , "
133068	133076	133103	133103	she	302	" And your husband 's first name ? "
133110	133113	133077	133077	he	3610	" Gifford , "
133120	133129	133077	133077	he	3610	" You live around her , I presume ? "
133130	133134	133077	133077	he	3610	" In Fonda . "
133135	133144	133077	133077	he	3610	" Yes . And how old are you ? "
133145	133150	133077	133077	he	3610	" Twenty - two . "
133151	133159	133172	133172	she	302	" How long have you been married ? "
133178	133186	133235	133235	he	402	" Let me see — three months . "
133239	133292	133298	133298	Roberta	302	" Well , now what seems to be the trouble , Mrs. Howard ? You need have no hesitancy in telling me — none whatsoever . I am used to such things year in and out , whatever they are . That is my business , listening to the troubles of people . "
133293	133296	133319	133319	she	302	" Well , "
133333	133368	133319	133319	she	302	" It 's like this ... You see ... my husband has n't much money ... and I have to work to help out with expenses and neither of us make so very much . "
133395	133426	133739	133739	he	434	" So ... of course ... we ca n't afford to ... to have ... well , any ... children , you see , so soon , anyhow , and ... "
133697	133738	133739	133739	he	434	" I think I understand what you want to say to me , Mrs. Howard . But I 'm also wondering if you have considered what a very serious and dangerous thing it is you have in mind . But , "
133775	133788	133913	133913	she	302	" just how did you happen to come to me , anyhow ? "
133916	133939	133944	133944	he	434	" I 've noticed your sign in passing several times and I 've heard different people say you were a good doctor . "
133948	134088	134096	134096	Roberta	302	" In the first place , the thing you want done is something my conscience would not permit me to advise . I understand , of course , that you consider it necessary . You and your husband are both young and you probably have n't very much money to go on , and you both feel that an interruption of this kind will be a great strain in every way . And no doubt it will be . Still , as I see it , marriage is a very sacred thing , and children are a blessing — not a curse . And when you went to the altar three months ago you were probably not unaware that you might have to face just such a situation as this . All young married people are , I think . "
134090	134094	133944	133944	he	434	" The altar , "
134106	134365	134371	134371	Roberta	302	" Now I know that the tendency of the day in some quarters is very much in this direction , I am sorry to say . There are those who feel it quite all right if they can shirk the normal responsibilities in such cases as to perform these operations , but it 's very dangerous , Mrs. Howard , very dangerous legally and ethically as well as medically very wrong . Many women who seek to escape childbirth die in this way . Besides it is a prison offense for any doctor to assist them , whether there are bad consequences or not . You know that , I suppose . At any rate , I , for one , am heartily opposed to this sort of thing from every point of view . The only excuse I have ever been able to see for it is when the life of the mother , for instance , depends upon such an operation . Not otherwise . And in such cases the medical profession is in accord . But in this instance I 'm sure the situation is n't one which warrants anything like that . You seem to me to be a strong , healthy girl . Motherhood should hold no serious consequences for you . And as for money reasons , do n't you really think now that if you just go ahead and have this baby , you and your husband would find means of getting along ? You say your husband is an electrician ? "
134366	134369	134396	134396	he	3700	" Yes , "
134386	134395	134461	134461	he	3700	" Well , now , there you are , "
134400	134460	134500	134500	he	3700	" That 's not such an unprofitable profession . At least all electricians charge enough . And when you consider , as you must , how serious a thing you are thinking of doing , that you are actually planning to destroy a young life that has as good a right to its existence as you have to yours ... "
134475	134499	134547	134547	he	3700	in—"well , then , I think you might feel called upon to stop and consider — both you and your husband . Besides , "
134516	134546	134581	134581	He	3700	" I think that once you have it it will more than make up to you both for whatever little hardship its coming will bring you . Tell me , "
134554	134580	134620	134620	she	302	" does your husband know of this ? Or is this just some plan of yours to save him and yourself from too much hardship ? "
134644	134648	134655	134655	he	3700	" He knows . "
134649	134654	134790	134790	He	3700	" Well , then , "
134683	134789	134997	134997	she	302	" I think you two should really consider very seriously before you go further in this matter . I know when young people first face a situation like this they always look on the darkest side of it , but it does n't always work out that way . I know my wife and I did with our first child . But we got along . And if you will only stop now and talk it over , you 'll see it in a different light , I 'm sure . And then you wo n't have your conscience to deal with afterwards , either . "
135000	135113	135189	135189	he	402	" But you do n't understand , doctor , you do n't understand ! I have to get out of this in some way ! I have to . It is n't like I told you at all . I 'm not married . I have n't any husband at all . But , oh , you do n't know what this means to me . My family ! My father ! My mother ! I ca n't tell you . But I must get out of it . I must ! I must ! Oh , you do n't know , you do n't know ! I must ! I must ! "
135203	135212	135272	135272	he	402	" You are not married , you say ? "
135275	135289	135299	135299	he	402	" Well , well , this is too bad . I 'm sorry . "
135311	135324	135354	135354	he	402	" You must n't cry . That wo n't help you any . "
135358	135379	135390	135390	Roberta	302	" Well , then where is the young man who is the cause of your trouble ? Is he here ? "
135397	135411	135417	135417	Roberta	302	" But he knows that you 're in trouble , does n't he ? "
135412	135415	135390	135390	Roberta	302	" Yes , "
135420	135428	135390	135390	Roberta	302	" And he wo n't marry you ? "
135429	135435	135390	135390	Roberta	302	" He 's gone away . "
135436	135456	135462	135462	Roberta	302	" Oh , I see . The young scamp ! And do n't you know where he 's gone ? "
135457	135460	135390	135390	Roberta	302	" No , "
135466	135477	135487	135487	she	302	" How long has it been since he left you ? "
135478	135484	135390	135390	Roberta	302	" About a week now . "
135490	135500	135390	135390	Roberta	302	" And you do n't know where he is ? "
135501	135504	135390	135390	Roberta	302	" No . "
135505	135516	135525	135525	Roberta	302	" How long has it been since you were sick ? "
135517	135523	135390	135390	Roberta	302	" Over two weeks now , "
135527	135537	135390	135390	Roberta	302	" And before that you have always been regular ? "
135538	135541	135551	135551	his	3704	" Yes . "
135542	135550	135561	135561	he	3704	" Well , in the first place , "
135585	135745	135763	135763	Roberta	302	" this may not be as serious as you think . I know you 're probably very much frightened , but it 's not unusual for women to miss a period . At any rate , without an examination it would n't be possible to be sure , and even if you were , the most advisable thing would be to wait another two weeks . You may find then that there is nothing wrong . I would n't be surprised if you did . You seem to be oversensitive and nervous and that sometimes brings about delays of this kind — mere nervousness . At any rate , if you 'll take my advice , whatever you do , you 'll not do anything now but just go home and wait until you 're really sure . For even if anything were to be done , it would n't be advisable for you to do anything before then . "
135746	135761	135772	135772	Glenn	402	" But I 've already taken some pills and they have n't helped me , "
135765	135770	135772	135772	Glenn	402	" What were they ? "
135785	135905	135920	135920	Roberta	302	" Oh , those . Well , they would n't be likely to be of any real service to you , if you were pregnant . But I still suggest that you wait , and if you find you pass your second period , then it will be time enough to act , although I earnestly advise you , even then , to do nothing if you can help it , because I consider it wrong to interfere with nature in this way . It would be much better , if you would arrange to have the child and take care of it . Then you would n't have the additional sin of destroying a life upon your conscience . "
135945	136003	136079	136079	he	402	" But I ca n't do that , doctor , I tell you ! I ca n't . I ca n't ! You do n't understand . Oh , I do n't know what I shall do unless I find some way out of this . I do n't ! I do n't ! I do n't ! "
136068	136077	136079	136079	he	402	" As I told you before , Miss — "
136082	136352	136460	136460	He	3705	" Howard , if that is your name , I am seriously opposed to operations of this kind , just as I am to the folly that brings girls and young men to the point where they seem to think they are necessary . A physician may not interfere in a case of this kind unless he is willing to spend ten years in prison , and I think that law is fair enough . Not that I do n't realize how painful your present situation appears to you . But there are always those who are willing to help a girl in your state , providing she does n't wish to do something which is morally and legally wrong . And so the very best advice I can give you now is that you do nothing at all now or at any time . Better go home and see your parents and confess . It will be much better — much better , I assure you . Not nearly as hard as you think or as wicked as this other way . Do n't forget there is a life there — a human — if it is really as you think . A human life which you are seeking to end and that I can not help you to do . I really can not . There may be doctors — I know there are — men here and there who take their professional ethics a little less seriously than I do ; but I can not let myself become one of them . I am sorry — very .
136353	136459	136855	136855	he	201	" So now the best I can say is — go home to your parents and tell them . It may look hard now but you are going to feel better about it in the long run . If it will make you or them feel any better about it , let them come and talk to me . I will try and make them see that this is not the worst thing in the world , either . But as for doing what you want — I am very , very sorry , but I can not . My conscience will not permit me . "
136848	136853	137436	137436	he	3722	" turned her down , "
137424	137428	137488	137488	she	2842	" gotten in trouble "
137492	137496	137549	137549	she	2842	" go through with it"—which
137551	137566	137567	137568	Whereupon Clyde	403	" never have sued that guy , you bet , unless she had to . "
137576	137602	137549	137549	she	2842	" But would n't you think that she could find some way of getting out of trouble without marrying a fellow she did n't like ? "
137603	137620	137549	137549	she	2842	" Well , that 's not so easy as you may think , particularly around here , "
137630	137671	139251	139251	she	302	" In the first place it 's agin ' the law . And next it takes a lotta money . An ' in case you ai n't got it , well , money makes the mare go , you know . "
139256	139276	139287	139287	he	201	" You have n't found out about another doctor , have you , Clyde , or thought of anything ? "
139277	139286	139287	139287	he	201	" No , I have n't , Roberta , "
139308	139390	139471	139471	he	201	" I 've been trying to , as you know , but it 's so darn hard to find any one who is n't afraid to monkey with a case like this . Honest , to tell the truth , Roberta , I 'm about stumped . I do n't know what we are going to do unless you can think of something . You have n't thought or heard of any one else you could go to , have you ? "
139473	139475	139540	139540	she	3749	" stumped "
139544	139604	139830	139830	he	201	" Well , I 'll tell you , Clyde . I 've been thinking about it and I do n't see any way out of it unless — unless you , well , marry me . It 's two months now , you know , and unless we get married right away , everybody'll know , wo n't they ? "
139834	139988	140019	140019	he	201	" Well , gee , that 's all right , too , Roberta , for you , because that fixes everything without any trouble at all . But what about me ? You do n't want to forget that that is n't going to be easy for me , the way things are now . You know I have n't any money . All I have is my job . And besides , the family do n't know anything about you yet — not a thing . And if it should suddenly come out now that we 've been going together all this time , and that this has happened , and that I was going to have to get married right away , well , gee , they 'll know I 've been fooling 'em and they 're sure to get sore . And then what ? They might even fire me . "
140038	140102	140019	140019	he	201	" Besides , I 'm not so sure that I ca n't find a doctor yet , either . I have n't had much luck so far , but that 's not saying that I wo n't . And there 's a little time yet , is n't there ? Sure there is . It 's all right up to three months anyway . "
140120	140157	140534	140534	Roberta	302	" And I did hear something the other day of a doctor over in Albany who might do it . Anyway , I thought I 'd go over and see before I said anything about him . "
140538	140637	140722	140722	she	3762	" Oh , I know , Clyde , but you yourself said just now that you were stumped , did n't you ? And every day that goes by just makes it so much the worse for me , if we 're not going to be able to get a doctor . You ca n't get married and have a child born within a few months — you know that . Every one in the world would know . Besides I have myself to consider as well as you , you know . And the baby , too . "
140663	140721	140765	140765	she	3762	" I just must do one of two things right away , Clyde — get married or get out of this and you do n't seem to be able to get me out of it , do you ? If you 're so afraid of what your uncle might think or do in case we get married , "
140729	140764	140875	140875	she	3762	" why could n't we get married right away and then keep it a secret for a while — as long as we could , or as long as you thought we ought to , "
140769	140874	140875	140875	she	3762	" Meanwhile I could go home and tell my parents about it — that I am married , but that it must be kept a secret for a while . Then when the time came , when things got so bad that we could n't stay here any longer without telling , why we could either go away somewhere , if we wanted to — that is , if you did n't want your uncle to know , or we could just announce that we were married some time ago . Lots of young couples do that nowadays . And as for getting along , "
140894	140917	141186	141186	he	3764	" why we could always find something to do — I know I could , anyhow , once the baby is born . "
141042	141170	141239	141239	her	302	" Oh , yes , that 's all right for you , Roberta . That fixes everything up for you , but how about me ? Why , gee whiz , I 've only got started here now as it is , and if I have to pack up and get out , and I would have to , if ever they found out about this , why I do n't know what I 'd do . I have n't any business or trade that I could turn my hand to . It might go hard with both of us . Besides my uncle gave me this chance because I begged him to , and if I walked off now he never would do anything for me . "
141243	141273	141539	141539	he	201	" Could n't we go out to Denver or something like that ? Would n't your father be willing to help you get something for a time , anyhow ? "
141547	141562	141601	141601	his	201	" But I ca n't do this , Roberta , not now , anyway , "
141604	141610	141619	141619	he	201	" not now , anyway . "
141625	141729	141799	141799	she	302	" Besides I do n't want to get married so soon . It means too much to me at this time . In the first place I 'm not old enough and I have n't got anything to get married on . And I ca n't leave here . I could n't do half as well anywhere else . You do n't realize what this chance means to me . My father 's all right , but he could n't do what my uncle could and he would n't . You do n't know or you would n't ask me to do this . "
141806	141912	141985	141985	She	302	" Oh , yes , I know well enough why you ca n't leave . It is n't your position here , though , half as much as it is those society people you are always running around with . I know . You do n't care for me any more , Clyde , that 's it , and you do n't want to give these other people up for me . I know that 's it and nothing else . But just the same it was n't so very long ago that you did , although you do n't seem to remember it now . "
141942	141984	141985	141985	She	302	" But you ca n't leave me to make out any way I can , just the same , because I wo n't be left this way , Clyde . I ca n't ! I ca n't ! I tell you . "
141991	142067	142117	142117	she	302	" It means too much to me . I do n't know how to do alone and I , besides , have no one to turn to but you and you must help me . I 've got to get out of this , that 's all , Clyde , I 've got to . I 'm not going to be left to face my people and everybody without any help or marriage or anything . "
142101	142116	142170	142170	she	302	" And if you ca n't help me out in the way you thought , "
142127	142169	142271	142271	she	302	" then you 've got to help me out in this other , that 's all . At least until I can do for myself I just wo n't be left . I do n't ask you to marry me forever , "
142214	142270	142271	142271	she	302	" You can leave me after a while if you want to . After I 'm out of this . I ca n't prevent you from doing that and I would n't want to if I could . But you ca n't leave me now . You ca n't . You ca n't ! Besides , "
142274	142343	142428	142428	she	302	" I did n't want to get myself in this position and I would n't have , but for you . But you made me and made me let you come in here . And now you want to leave me to shift for myself , just because you think you wo n't be able to go in society any more , if they find out about me . "
142431	142555	142759	142759	he	201	" Oh , what is it about me that 's so different to what I was a couple of months ago , Clyde ? Will you tell me that ? I 'd like to know . What is it that has caused you to change so ? Up to Christmas , almost , you were as nice to me as any human being could be . You were with me nearly all the time you had , and since then I 've scarcely had an evening that I did n't beg for . Who is it ? What is it ? Some other girl , or what , I 'd like to know — that Sondra Finchley or Bertine Cranston , or who ? "
142667	142758	142799	142799	he	201	" Oh , you 're all wrong , Roberta . You do n't see what the trouble is . It 's my future here — if I leave here I certainly will never find such an opportunity . And if I have to marry in this way or leave here it will all go flooey . I want to wait and get some place first before I marry , see — save some money and if I do this I wo n't have a chance and you wo n't either , "
142795	142798	142799	142799	he	201	" Besides , "
142802	142861	142950	142950	she	302	" if you could only find some one , or if you would go away by yourself somewhere for a while , Roberta , and go through with this alone , I could send you the money to do it on , I know . I could have it between now and the time you had to go . "
142944	142949	143179	143179	she	3782	" Oh , Clyde , "
142970	143178	143179	143179	she	3782	" how you have changed ! And how hard you can be . To want me to go off all by myself and just to save you — so you can stay here and get along and marry some one here when I am out of the way and you do n't have to bother about me any more . Well , I wo n't do it . It 's not fair . And I wo n't , that 's all . I wo n't . And that 's all there is to it . You can get some one to get me out of this or you can marry me and come away with me , at least long enough for me to have the baby and place myself right before my people and every one else that knows me . I do n't care if you leave me afterwards , because I see now that you really do n't care for me any more , and if that 's the way you feel , I do n't want you any more than you want me . But just the same , you must help me now — you must . But , oh , dear , "
143191	143250	146094	146094	she	302	" To think that all our love for each other should have come to this — that I am asked to go away by myself — all alone — with no one — while you stay here , oh , dear ! oh , dear ! And with a baby on my hands afterwards . And no husband . "
146078	146093	146094	146094	she	302	" The only trouble with me is that I 'm not of age yet , "
146101	146170	147391	147391	Sondra	186	" They 've got me there , of course . But I will be by next October and they ca n't do very much with me after that , I want to let you know . I can marry the person I want , I guess . And if I ca n't do it here , well , there are more ways than one to kill a cat . "
147409	147424	147633	147633	she	302	" What 's the matter , Clyde ? Afraid of the bow - wow ? "
147595	147598	147826	147826	he	201	" Gee ! "
147832	147834	148324	148324	her	1435	" yes "
148340	148348	148390	148390	he	201	" What come over de sweet phing ? "
148382	148389	148431	148431	She	1435	" His baby - talking girl , "
148396	148430	152588	152588	he	1113	" Facey all dark now . Little while ago facey all smiles . Come make facey all nice again . Smile at Sondra . Squeeze Sondra 's arm like good boy , Clyde . "
152613	152619	155392	155392	Grant	207	" could it but occur . "
155396	155409	155424	155424	he	4079	" Oh , Clyde , what are you thinking of , anyhow ? "
155427	155430	155654	155654	She	4117	" Roberta . "
155501	155653	155674	155674	her	4117	" You up here ? That 's great . Over at the Cranstons ' ? Oh , is n't that dandy ? Right next door to us . Well , we 'll see a lot of each other , what ? How about a canter to - morrow before seven ? Bertine and I go nearly every day . And we 'll have a picnic tomorrow , if nothing interferes , canoeing and motoring . Do n't worry about not riding well . I 'll get Bertine to let you have Jerry — he 's just a sheep . And you do n't need to worry about togs , either . Grant has scads of things . I 'll dance the next two dances with others , but you sit out the third one with me , will you ? I know a peach of a place outside on the balcony . "
155663	155671	155746	155746	She	4117	" we - understand - each - other "
155733	155745	155785	155785	he	4118	" Sondra so glad Clydie here . Misses him so much . "
155776	155784	155785	155785	he	4118	" Oh , my darling baby girl , "
155788	155823	155948	155948	she	4117	" My beautiful , beautiful Sondra ! If you only knew how much I love you ! If you only knew ! I wish I could tell you all . I wish I could . "
155956	155975	156053	156053	she	4117	" Does he love Sondra so much ? Oh , sweetie boy ! Sondra loves him , too . "
155997	156039	156053	156053	she	4117	" And Sondra wo n't give her Clydie up either . She wo n't . You just wait and see ! It does n't matter what happens now . It may not be so very easy , but she wo n't . "
156056	156089	156426	156426	she	4117	" But we must go now , right away . No , not another kiss now . No , no , Sondra says no , now . They 'll be missing us . "
156378	156414	156426	156426	she	4117	" Come on down . Jerry knows the way . He wo n't slip . Come and get a drink . If you do , you 'll come back again soon — so they say . "
156429	156751	156926	156926	he	201	" I 've been wanting to tell you something . You should have seen Mamma 's face last night when she heard you were up here . She ca n't be sure that I had anything to do with it , of course , because she thinks that Bertine likes you , too . I made her think that . But just the same she suspects that I had a hand in it , I guess , and she does n't quite like it . But she ca n't say anything more than she has before . And I had a talk with Bertine just now and she 's agreed to stick by me and help me all she can . But we 'll have to be even more careful than ever now , because I think if Mamma got too suspicious I do n't know what she might do — want us to leave here , even now maybe , just so I could n't see you . You know she feels that I should n't be interested in any one yet except some one she likes . You know how it is . She 's that way with Stuart , too . But if you 'll take care not to show that you care for me so much whenever we 're around any one of our crowd , I do n't think she 'll do anything — not now , anyhow . Later on , in the fall , when we 're back in Lycurgus , things will be different . I 'll be of age then , and I 'm going to see what I can do . I never loved any one before , but I do love you , and , well , I wo n't give you up , that 's all . I wo n't . And they ca n't make me , either ! "
156929	157022	157602	157602	she	4131	" Why could n't you run away with me now , Sondra , darling ? It 's so long until fall and I want you so much . Why could n't we ? Your mother 's not likely to want to let you marry me then , anyhow . But if we went away now , she could n't help herself , could she ? And afterwards , in a few months or so , you could write her and then she would n't mind . Why could n't we , Sondra ? "
157605	157716	157717	157717	She	4131	" I would , honey , if I did not think it best not to , now . It 's too soon . Mamma is n't going to do anything right now . I know she is n't . Besides she has made all her plans to do a lot of entertaining here this summer , and for my particular benefit . She wants me to be nice to — well , you know who I mean . And I can be , without doing anything to interfere with us in any way , I 'm sure — so long as I do n't do anything to really frighten her . "
157725	157858	157904	157904	she	4145	" But you can come up here as often as you choose , do n't you see , and she and these others wo n't think anything of it , because you wo n't be our guest , do n't you see ? I 've fixed all that with Bertine . And that means that we can see each other all summer long up here , just about as much as we want to , do n't you see ? Then in the fall , when I come back , and if I find that I ca n't make her be nice to you at all , or consider our being engaged , why , I will run away with you . Yes , I will , darling — really and truly . "
157921	157986	158181	158181	she	4145	" Ca n't you see , dearie ? Please do n't look so sad , darling . Sondra loves her Clyde so much . And she 'll do anything and everything to make things come out right . Yes , she will . And they will , too . Now you wait and see . She wo n't give him up ever — ever ! "
158184	158277	158306	158306	He	4149	" Why , what is it , Clyde , dearie — you look so — oh , I ca n't say just how — forlorn or — Does he love me so much ? And ca n't he wait just three or four months ? But , oh , yes he can , too . It is n't as bad as he thinks . He 'll be with me most of the time — the lovekins will . And when he is n't , Sondra'll write him every day — every day . "
158278	158305	158469	158469	he	4149	" But , Sondra ! Sondra ! If I could just tell you . If you knew how much it were going to mean to me — "
158475	158531	158989	158989	her	302	" It 's because I need you so much now , dear — all of the time . That 's it , just that . It seems at times as though I could never be away from you another minute any more . Oh , I 'm so hungry for you all of the time . "
159015	159224	159642	159642	he	201	" Hello , Clyde , hello . Oh , I 'm so glad you called . I 've been terribly nervous . Did you get my two letters ? I was just about to leave here in the morning if I did n't hear from you by then . I just could n't stand not to hear anything . Where have you been , dear ? Did you read what I said about my parents going away ? That 's true . Why do n't you write , Clyde , or call me up anyhow ? What about what I said in my letter about the third ? Will you be sure and come then ? Or shall I meet you somewhere ? I 've been so nervous the last three or four days , but now that I hear you again , maybe I 'll be able to quiet down some . But I do wish you would write me a note every few days anyhow . Why wo n't you , Clyde ? You have n't even written me one since I 've been here . I ca n't tell you what a state I 'm in and how hard it is to keep calm now . "
159650	159899	159961	159961	she	302	" But listen , Roberta . Please do n't be angry with me . You talk as though I did n't have any troubles in connection with all this , either . You do n't know what this may be going to cost me before I 'm through with it , and you do n't seem to care much . I know you 're worried and all that , but what about me ? I 'm doing the very best I can now , Roberta , with all I have to think about . And wo n't you just be patient now until the third , anyhow ? Please do . I promise to write you and if I do n't , I 'll call you up every other day . Will that be all right ? But I certainly do n't want you to be using my name like you did a while ago . That will lead to trouble , sure . Please do n't . And when I call again , I 'll just say it 's Mr. Baker asking , see , and you can say it 's any one you like afterwards . And then , if by any chance anything should come up that would stop our starting exactly on the third , why you can come back here if you want to , see , or somewhere near here , and then we can start as soon as possible after that . "
159971	160063	160637	160637	he	201	" Oh , no , dear . I do n't want to do anything like that . You know I do n't . It 's just because things are so bad as they are with me and I ca n't help myself now . You know that , Clyde , do n't you ? I ca n't help loving you . I always will , I suppose . And I do n't want to do anything to hurt you , dear , really I do n't if I can help it . "
160631	160636	160640	160641	Harley Baggott	415	" What was that ? "
160648	160651	160637	160637	he	201	" What ? "
160652	160668	160640	160641	Harley Baggott	415	" Why , that bird or something that just flew away back there just now ? "
160669	160677	160637	160637	he	201	" I did n't hear any bird . "
160678	160693	161102	161114	a guide who was lounging upon the low veranda of the small inn	4207	" Gee ! That was a queer sound . It makes me feel creepy . "
161120	161135	161354	161354	he	4215	deep—"all of seventy feet not more than a hundred feet out from that boathouse . "
161190	161199	161354	161354	he	4215	" How long is this lake , anyhow ? "
161200	161207	161354	161354	he	4215	" Oh , about seven miles . "
161208	161214	161354	161354	he	4215	" Any fish in it ? "
161215	161323	161354	161354	he	4215	" Throw a line in and see . The best place for black bass and the like of that almost anywhere around here . Off the island down yonder , or just to the south of it round on the other side there , there 's a little bay that 's said to be one of the best fishin ' holes in any of the lakes up this way . I 've seen a coupla men bring back as many as seventy - five fish in two hours . That oughta satisfy anybody that ai n't tryin ' to ruin the place for the rest of us . "
161359	161372	161354	161354	he	4215	" Not thinkin ' of tryin ' your luck to - day ? "
161373	161399	161433	161433	He	4215	" No , just inquiring for my dad . He 's coming up here next week , maybe . I want to see about accommodations . "
161400	161432	161541	161542	Stuart Finchley	188	" Well , they ai n't what they are down to Racquette , of course , but then the fish down there ai n't what they are up here , either . "
161531	161539	161541	161542	Stuart Finchley	188	" The country up here kills me , "
161547	161573	161614	161615	the guide	4215	" It 's so near the Chain and yet it 's so different , scarcely any one living up here at all , it seems . "
161574	161612	161614	161615	the guide	4215	" Well , except for the camps in summer and the fellows that come up to hunt moose and deer in the fall , there ai n't much of anybody or anything around here after September first , "
161617	161901	162178	162178	him	201	" I 've been guidin ' and trappin ' for nigh onto seventeen years now around here and ' cept for more and more people around some of the lakes below here — the Chain principally in summer — I ai n't seen much change . You need to know this country purty well if yer goin't strike out anywhere away from the main roads , though o ' course about five miles to the west o ' here is the railroad . Gun Lodge is the station . We bring 'em by bus from there in the summer . And from the south end down there is a sorta road leadin ' down to Greys Lake and Three Mile Bay . You musta come along a part of it , since it 's the only road up into this country as yet . They 're talkin ' of cuttin ' one through to Long Lake sometime , but so far it 's mostly talk . But from most of these other lakes around here , there 's no road at all , not that an automobile could make . Just trails and there 's not even a decent camp on some o ' 'em . You have to bring your own outfit . But Ellis and me was over to Gun Lake last summer — that 's thirty miles west o ' here and we had to walk every inch of the way and carry our packs . But , oh , say , the fishin ' and moose and deer come right down to the shore in places to drink . See 'em as plain as that stump across the lake . "
162174	162177	163820	163827	the genie of his darkest and weakest side	4276	" getting into "
163835	164125	164140	164140	Clyde	201	" And would you escape from the demands of Roberta that but now and unto this hour have appeared unescapable to you ? Behold ! I bring you a way . It is the way of the lake — Pass Lake . This item that you have read — do you think it was placed in your hands for nothing ? Remember Big Bittern , the deep , blue - black water , the island to the south , the lone road to Three Mile Bay ? How suitable to your needs ! A row - boat or a canoe upset in such a lake and Roberta would pass forever from your life . She can not swim ! The lake — the lake — that you have seen — that I have shown you — is it not ideal for the purpose ? So removed and so little frequented and yet comparatively near — but a hundred miles from here . And how easy for you and Roberta to go there — not directly but indirectly — on this purely imaginative marriage - trip that you have already agreed to . And all that you need do now is to change your name — and hers — or let her keep her own and you use yours . You have never permitted her to speak of you and this relationship , and she never has . You have written her but formal notes . And now if you should meet her somewhere as you have already agreed to , and without any one seeing you , you might travel with her , as in the past to Fonda , to Big Bittern — or some point near there . "
164126	164136	164140	164140	Clyde	201	" But there is no hotel at Big Bittern , "
164142	164157	163820	163827	the genie of his darkest and weakest side	4276	" A mere shack that entertains but few people and that not very well . "
164158	164172	164140	164140	Clyde	201	" All the better . The less people are likely to be there . "
164173	164196	163820	163827	the genie of his darkest and weakest side	4276	" But we might be seen on the train going up together . I would be identified as having been with her . "
164197	164244	164140	164140	Clyde	201	" Were you seen at Fonda , Gloversville , Little Falls ? Have you not ridden in separate cars or seats before and could you not do so now ? Is it not presumably to be a secret marriage ? Then why not a secret honeymoon ? "
164245	164252	163820	163827	the genie of his darkest and weakest side	4276	" True enough — true enough . "
164253	164458	164140	164140	Clyde	201	" And once you have arranged for that and arrive at Big Bittern or some lake like it — there are so many there — how easy to row out on such a lake ? No questions . No registry under your own name or hers . A boat rented for an hour or half - day or day . You saw the island far to the south on that lone lake . Is it not beautiful ? It is well worth seeing . Why should you not go there on such a pleasure trip before marriage ? Would she not be happy so to do — as weary and distressed as she is now — an outing — a rest before the ordeal of the new life ? Is not that sensible — plausible ? And neither of you will ever return presumably . You will both be drowned , will you not ? Who is to see ? A guide or two — the man who rents you the boat — the innkeeper once , as you go . But how are they to know who you are ? Or who she is ? And you heard the depth of the water . "
164459	164516	163820	163827	the genie of his darkest and weakest side	4276	" But I do not want to kill her . I do not want to kill her . I do not want to injure her in any way . If she will but let me go and she go her own way , I will be so glad and so happy never to see her more . "
164517	164619	164140	164140	Clyde	201	" But she will not let you go or go her way unless you accompany her . And if you go yours , it will be without Sondra and all that she represents , as well as all this pleasant life here — your standing with your uncle , his friends , their cars , the dances , visits to the lodges on the lakes . And what then ? A small job ! Small pay ! Another such period of wandering as followed that accident at Kansas City . Never another chance like this anywhere . Do you prefer that ? "
164620	164645	163820	163827	the genie of his darkest and weakest side	4276	" But might there not be some accident here , destroying all my dreams — my future — as there was in Kansas City ? "
164646	164824	164140	164140	Clyde	201	" An accident , to be sure — but not the same . In this instance the plan is in your hands . You can arrange it all as you will . And how easy ! So many boats upsetting every summer — the occupants of them drowning , because in most cases they can not swim . And will it ever be known whether the man who was with Roberta Alden on Big Bittern could swim ? And of all deaths , drowning is the easiest — no noise — no outcry — perhaps the accidental blow of an oar — the side of a boat . And then silence ! Freedom — a body that no one may ever find . Or if found and identified , will it not be easy , if you but trouble to plan , to make it appear that you were elsewhere , visiting at one of the other lakes before you decided to go to Twelfth Lake . What is wrong with it ? Where is the flaw ? "
164825	164888	163820	163827	the genie of his darkest and weakest side	4276	" But assuming that I should upset the boat and that she should not drown , then what ? Should cling to it , cry out , be saved and relate afterward that ... But no , I can not do that — will not do it . I will not hit her . That would be too terrible ... too vile . "
164889	165007	165288	165288	Clyde	201	" But a little blow — any little blow under such circumstances would be sufficient to confuse and complete her undoing . Sad , yes , but she has an opportunity to go her own way , has she not ? And she will not , nor let you go yours . Well , then , is this so terribly unfair ? And do not forget that afterwards there is Sondra — the beautiful — a home with her in Lycurgus — wealth , a high position such as elsewhere you may never obtain again — never — never . Love and happiness — the equal of any one here — superior even to your cousin Gilbert . "
165082	165248	165288	165288	Clyde	201	" Ah , still thinking on the matter . And you have not found a way out and you will not . I have truly pointed out to you and in all helpfulness the only way — the only way — It is a long lake . And would it not be easy in rowing about to eventually find some secluded spot — some invisible nook near that south shore where the water is deep ? And from there how easy to walk through the woods to Three Mile Bay and Upper Greys Lake ? And from there to the Cranstons ' ? There is a boat from there , as you know . Pah — how cowardly — how lacking in courage to win the thing that above all things you desire — beauty — wealth — position — the solution of your every material and spiritual desire . And with poverty , commonplace , hard and poor work as the alternative to all this .
165249	165270	168406	168406	he	201	" But you must choose — choose ! And then act . You must ! You must ! You must ! "
168437	168444	171833	171833	Roberta	302	" You see I am here . "
171838	171863	171898	171898	his	201	" Now , there , is n't that cute ? Why could n't we be married over there by the minister of that church ? "
171882	171896	172748	172748	he	4215	" Why , sure — I'll go over after a bit and see , "
172760	172775	172777	172777	Clyde	201	" Goin' over to the lodge at Big Bittern ? First time up here ? "
172788	172791	172795	172795	his	201	" Yes , "
172800	172809	172864	172865	the guide	4215	" Many people over there to - day ? "
172885	172916	173008	173008	Roberta	302	" Not so many . About seven or eight , I guess . We did have about thirty over the Fourth , but most o ' them went down yesterday . "
173041	173068	173408	173408	He	4516	" Is n't that wonderful in there ? Do you hear the tinkling of that water , Clyde ? Oh , the freshness of this air ! "
173382	173407	173408	173408	He	4516	" You 're not mindin ' to stay over , I suppose . I see you left the young lady 's bag over there . "
173417	173440	173462	173462	he	4516	" No , we 're going on down to - night — on that 8:10 . You take people over to that ? "
173441	173446	173408	173408	He	4516	" Oh , sure . "
173447	173457	173489	173489	his	4516	" They said you did — at Grass Lake . "
173492	173498	173639	173639	Roberta	302	" the young lady 's bag "
173588	173591	173639	173639	Roberta	302	found—"married or unmarried "
173642	173661	173639	173639	Roberta	302	" Are there any hotels or boarding houses on the lake besides this one we 're going to ? "
173662	173731	174045	174045	Roberta	302	" Not a one , miss , outside o ' the inn that we 're goin' to . There was a crowd of young fellers and girls campin ' over on the east shore , yisterday , I believe , about a mile from the inn — but whether they 're there now or not , I dunno . Ai n't seen none of 'em to - day . "
174050	174064	174112	174112	he	201	" Oh , it is pretty , is n't it — just beautiful . "
174097	174106	174128	174140	a medium - sized , red - faced , broad - shouldered man	4549	" Yes , it is , you bet . "
174147	174155	174123	174123	himself	4530	" Staying over for a few days ? "
174177	174198	174157	174157	Clyde	201	" No , no — just came over for the afternoon . We 're going on down to - night . "
174199	174222	174123	174123	himself	4530	" You 'll be staying over for dinner then , I suppose ? The train does n't leave till eight - fifteen . "
174223	174245	174315	174315	He	4530	" Oh , yes — that 's so . Sure . Yes , well , in that case , we will . "
174286	174314	174381	174381	Boniface	428	" Well , then , I 'll just take your bag and you can register . Your wife'll probably be wanting to freshen up a bit anyway . "
174372	174379	174883	174883	Roberta	302	" for the register 's sake , "
174872	174880	174883	174883	Roberta	302	" Is n't it still and peaceful ? "
174886	174949	174883	174883	Roberta	302	" It seems to be so restful here . I think it 's beautiful , truly , so much more beautiful than that other lake . These trees are so tall , are n't they ? And those mountains . I was thinking all the way over how cool and silent that road was , even if it was a little rough . "
174950	174964	174883	174883	Roberta	302	" Did you talk to any one in the inn there just now ? "
174965	174975	174883	174883	Roberta	302	" Why , no ; what makes you ask ? "
174976	175009	175058	175058	She	4571	" Oh , I thought you might have run into some one . There do n't seem to be very many people up here to - day , though , does there ? "
175010	175057	175061	175061	her	4571	" No , I do n't see any one on the lake . I saw two men in that billiard room at the back there , and there was a girl in the ladies ' room , that was all . Is n't this water cold ? "
175081	175092	175254	175254	she	4571	" Is it ? I have n't felt it yet . "
175257	175285	176409	176409	Roberta	302	" Have you any spot in mind , dear , where we could stop and eat ? I 'm getting a little hungry , are n't you ? "
176393	176406	176409	176409	Roberta	302	" Oh , the sun shines bright in my old Kentucky home . "
176425	176433	178380	178380	Clyde	201	later—"I'll be there Sunday if you will , "
178286	178331	178744	178744	she	302	" Why , Clyde ! Clyde ! What is it ? Whatever is the matter with you anyhow ? You look so — so strange — so — so — Why , I never saw you look like this before . What is it ? "
178778	178782	179151	179151	Kit	321	" Help ! Help !
178783	178803	178744	178744	she	302	" Oh , my God , I 'm drowning , I 'm drowning . Help ! Oh , my God !
178804	178809	179151	179151	Kit	321	" Clyde , Clyde ! "
178818	179113	None	None	None	None	" But this — this — is not this that which you have been thinking and wishing for this while — you in your great need ? And behold ! For despite your fear , your cowardice , this — this — has been done for you . An accident — an accident — an unintentional blow on your part is now saving you the labor of what you sought , and yet did not have the courage to do ! But will you now , and when you need not , since it is an accident , by going to her rescue , once more plunge yourself in the horror of that defeat and failure which has so tortured you and from which this now releases you ? You might save her . But again you might not ! For see how she strikes about . She is stunned . She herself is unable to save herself and by her erratic terror , if you draw near her now , may bring about your own death also . But you desire to live ! And her living will make your life not worth while from now on . Rest but a moment — a fraction of a minute ! Wait — wait — ignore the pity of that appeal . And then — then — But there ! Behold . It is over . She is sinking now . You will never , never see her alive any more — ever . And there is your own hat upon the water — as you wished . And upon the boat , clinging to that rowlock a veil belonging to her . Leave it . Will it not show that this was an accident ? "
