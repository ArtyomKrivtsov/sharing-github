57	60	62	66	the taller of the two	678	“ News ? ”
68	72	74	75	Severus Snape	172	“ The best , ”
116	123	125	125	Yaxley	173	“ Thought I might be late , ”
146	174	127	127	his	173	“ It was a little trickier than I expected . But I hope he will be satisfied . You sound confident that your reception will be good ? ”
316	327	328	328	Yaxley	173	“ He always did himself well , Lucius . Peacocks , ”
641	646	668	669	The speaker	707	“ Yaxley . Snape , ”
660	667	668	669	The speaker	707	“ You are very nearly late . ”
744	749	751	751	Voldemort	175	“ Severus , here , ”
761	767	751	751	Voldemort	175	“ Yaxley — beside Dolohov . ”
796	799	792	792	Voldemort	175	“ So ? ”
800	827	836	836	Some	710	“ My Lord , the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current place of safety on Saturday next , at nightfall . ”
849	855	857	857	Voldemort	175	“ Saturday … at nightfall , ”
924	935	913	913	Voldemort	175	“ Good . Very good . And this information comes — ”
936	944	946	946	Snape	172	“ — from the source we discussed , ”
948	952	946	946	Snape	172	“ My Lord . ”
974	983	968	969	All faces	714	“ My Lord , I have heard differently . ”
998	1024	994	994	he	175	“ Dawlish , the Auror , let slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth , the night before the boy turns seventeen . ”
1029	1075	1025	1025	Snape	172	“ My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail ; this must be it . No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish . It would not be the first time ; he is known to be susceptible . ”
1076	1089	1091	1091	Yaxley	173	“ I assure you , my Lord , Dawlish seemed quite certain , ”
1093	1105	1107	1107	Snape	172	“ If he has been Confunded , naturally he is certain , ”
1109	1141	1107	1107	Snape	172	“ I assure you , Yaxley , the Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of Harry Potter . The Order believes that we have infiltrated the Ministry . ”
1142	1155	1167	1167	he	715	“ The Order ’s got one thing right , then , eh ? ”
1208	1212	1213	1213	Yaxley	173	“ My Lord , ”
1217	1233	1213	1213	Yaxley	173	“ Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be used to transfer the boy — ”
1257	1268	1251	1251	Voldemort	175	“ Where are they going to hide the boy next ? ”
1269	1279	1281	1281	Snape	172	“ At the home of one of the Order , ”
1283	1357	1281	1281	Snape	172	“ The place , according to the source , has been given every protection that the Order and Ministry together could provide . I think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there , my Lord , unless , of course , the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday , which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest . ”
1358	1363	1364	1364	Voldemort	175	“ Well , Yaxley ? ”
1379	1389	1364	1364	Voldemort	175	“ Will the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday ? ”
1402	1435	1397	1397	Yaxley	173	“ My Lord , I have good news on that score . I have — with difficulty , and after great effort — succeeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse . ”
1465	1471	1473	1473	Voldemort	175	“ It is a start , ”
1475	1510	1473	1473	Voldemort	175	“ But Thicknesse is only one man . Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act . One failed attempt on the Minister ’s life will set me back a long way . ”
1511	1597	1448	1448	Dolohov	176	“ Yes — my Lord , that is true — but you know , as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement , Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the Minister himself , but also with the Heads of all the other Ministry departments . It will , I think , be easy now that we have such a high - ranking official under our control , to subjugate the others , and then they can all work together to bring Scrimgeour down . ”
1598	1615	1617	1617	Voldemort	175	“ As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest , ”
1619	1657	1617	1617	Voldemort	175	“ At any rate , it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday . If we can not touch the boy at his destination , then it must be done while he travels . ”
1658	1669	1671	1671	Yaxley	173	“ We are at an advantage there , my Lord , ”
1683	1711	1671	1671	Yaxley	173	“ We now have several people planted within the Department of Magical Transport . If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network , we shall know immediately . ”
1712	1719	1721	1721	Snape	172	“ He will not do either , ”
1723	1750	1721	1721	Snape	172	“ The Order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry ; they mistrust everything to do with the place . ”
1751	1756	1758	1758	Voldemort	175	“ All the better , ”
1760	1777	1758	1758	Voldemort	175	“ He will have to move in the open . Easier to take , by far . ”
1793	1837	1780	1780	Voldemort	175	“ I shall attend to the boy in person . There have been too many mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned . Some of them have been my own . That Potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs . ”
1895	1954	1880	1880	himself	175	“ I have been careless , and so have been thwarted by luck and chance , those wreckers of all but the best - laid plans . But I know better now . I understand those things that I did not understand before . I must be the one to kill Harry Potter , and I shall be . ”
2005	2008	2016	2016	his	175	“ Wormtail , ”
2033	2046	2025	2025	his	175	“ have I not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner quiet ? ”
2047	2055	2057	2063	a small man halfway down the table	726	“ Yes , m - my Lord , ”
2109	2115	2117	2117	Voldemort	175	“ As I was saying , ”
2129	2157	2117	2117	Voldemort	175	“ I understand better now . I shall need , for instance , to borrow a wand from one of you before I go to kill Potter . ”
2181	2185	2187	2187	Voldemort	175	“ No volunteers ? ”
2189	2208	2187	2187	Voldemort	175	“ Let ’s see … Lucius , I see no reason for you to have a wand anymore . ”
2241	2245	2233	2233	he	183	“ My Lord ? ”
2246	2257	2233	2233	he	183	“ Your wand , Lucius . I require your wand . ”
2258	2261	2233	2233	he	183	“ I … ”
2342	2347	2325	2325	Voldemort	175	“ What is it ? ”
2348	2354	2356	2356	Malfoy	183	“ Elm , my Lord , ”
2358	2363	2325	2325	Voldemort	175	“ And the core ? ”
2364	2370	2325	2325	Voldemort	175	“ Dragon — dragon heartstring . ”
2371	2374	2376	2376	Voldemort	175	“ Good , ”
2430	2441	2381	2381	his	175	“ Give you my wand , Lucius ? My wand ? ”
2448	2496	2442	2445	Some of the throng	730	“ I have given you your liberty , Lucius , is that not enough for you ? But I have noticed that you and your family seem less than happy of late … What is it about my presence in your home that displaces you , Lucius ? ”
2497	2505	2444	2445	the throng	731	“ Nothing — nothing , my Lord ! ”
2506	2512	2442	2445	Some of the throng	730	“ Such lies , Lucius … ”
2623	2657	2607	2607	Voldemort	175	“ Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot ? Is my return , my rise to power , not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years ? ”
2658	2665	2667	2668	Lucius Malfoy	183	“ Of course , my Lord , ”
2682	2691	2674	2674	he	183	“ We did desire it — we do . ”
2749	2753	2763	2763	her	738	“ My Lord , ”
2769	2792	2763	2763	her	738	“ it is an honor to have you here , in our family ’s house . There can be no higher pleasure . ”
2845	2850	2854	2854	his	175	“ No higher pleasure , ”
2867	2879	2863	2863	he	175	“ That means a great deal , Bellatrix , from you . ”
2894	2905	2880	2880	Her	188	“ My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth ! ”
2906	2931	2932	2932	She	188	“ No higher pleasure … even compared with the happy event that , I hear , has taken place in your family this week ? ”
2944	2956	2932	2932	She	188	“ I do n’t know what you mean , my Lord . ”
2957	2990	2932	2932	She	188	“ I ’m talking about your niece , Bellatrix . And yours , Lucius and Narcissa . She has just married the werewolf , Remus Lupin . You must be so proud . ”
3075	3086	3087	3087	she	188	“ She is no niece of ours , my Lord , ”
3095	3132	3087	3087	she	188	“ We — Narcissa and I — have never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood . This brat has nothing to do with either of us , nor any beast she marries . ”
3133	3140	3146	3146	his	175	“ What say you , Draco ? ”
3160	3167	3146	3146	his	175	“ Will you babysit the cubs ? ”
3215	3218	3220	3220	Voldemort	175	“ Enough , ”
3227	3230	3220	3220	Voldemort	175	“ Enough . ”
3238	3252	3253	3253	he	175	“ Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time , ”
3265	3292	3253	3253	he	175	“ You must prune yours , must you not , to keep it healthy ? Cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest . ”
3293	3299	3301	3301	Bellatrix	188	“ Yes , my Lord , ”
3313	3319	3301	3301	Bellatrix	188	“ At the first chance ! ”
3320	3326	3328	3328	Voldemort	175	“ You shall have it , ”
3330	3359	3328	3328	Voldemort	175	“ And in your family , so in the world … we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only those of the true blood remain … ”
3403	3412	3414	3414	Voldemort	175	“ Do you recognize our guest , Severus ? ”
3468	3474	3458	3459	the woman	749	“ Severus ! Help me ! ”
3475	3480	3482	3482	Snape	172	“ Ah , yes , ”
3491	3497	3499	3499	Voldemort	175	“ And you , Draco ? ”
3535	3545	3547	3547	Voldemort	175	“ But you would not have taken her classes , ”
3549	3581	3547	3547	Voldemort	175	“ For those of you who do not know , we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who , until recently , taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . ”
3602	3627	3592	3599	A broad , hunched woman with pointed teeth	752	“ Yes … Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about Muggles … how they are not so different from us … ”
3646	3653	3638	3639	Charity Burbage	191	“ Severus … please … please … ”
3654	3657	3659	3659	Voldemort	175	“ Silence , ”
3735	3739	3727	3727	she	191	“ Avada Kedavra . ”
3790	3795	3797	3797	Voldemort	175	“ Dinner , Nagini , ”
3868	3873	3847	3847	He	175	“ What the — ? ”
5084	5096	5078	5078	Dumbledore	207	“ What do you see when you look in the mirror ? ”
5097	5112	5152	5152	he	177	“ I ? I see myself holding a pair of thick , woolen socks . ”
5535	5538	5539	5539	Harry	177	“ Lies ! ”
5759	5764	5777	5778	his uncle	782	“ Oh ! You ! ”
5822	5825	5818	5819	his uncle	782	“ BOY ! ”
5861	5867	5869	5870	Vernon Dursley	208	“ You took you time ! ”
5881	5891	5872	5872	Harry	177	“ Get down here . I want a word ! ”
5959	5962	5964	5964	Harry	177	“ Yes ? ”
5966	5970	5972	5973	Uncle Vernon	210	“ Sit down ! ”
5980	5983	5985	5986	Uncle Vernon	210	“ Please ! ”
6051	6058	6059	6059	he	210	“ I ’ve changed my mind , ”
6062	6067	6069	6069	Harry	177	“ What a surprise , ”
6071	6079	6081	6082	Aunt Petunia	206	“ Do n’t you take that tone — ”
6095	6104	6106	6107	Uncle Vernon	210	“ It ’s all a lot of claptrap , ”
6117	6141	6106	6107	Uncle Vernon	210	“ I ’ve decided I do n’t believe a word of it . We ’re staying put , we ’re not going anywhere . ”
6237	6242	6243	6244	Vernon Dursley	208	“ According to you , ”
6258	6276	6249	6249	his	208	“ we — Petunia , Dudley , and I — are in danger . From — from — ”
6277	6287	6289	6289	Harry	177	“ Some of ‘ my lot ’ , right , ”
6291	6299	6301	6302	Uncle Vernon	210	“ Well I do n’t believe it , ”
6314	6338	6301	6302	Uncle Vernon	210	“ I was awake half the night thinking it all over , and I believe it ’s a plot to get the house . ”
6339	6343	6345	6345	Harry	177	“ The house ? ”
6347	6351	6345	6345	Harry	177	“ What house ? ”
6352	6356	6358	6359	Uncle Vernon	210	“ This house ! ”
6369	6413	6358	6359	Uncle Vernon	210	“ Our house ! House prices are skyrocketing around here ! You want us out of the way and then you ’re going to do a bit of hocus pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and — ”
6414	6422	6424	6424	Harry	177	“ Are you out of your mind ? ”
6426	6443	6424	6424	Harry	177	“ A plot to get this house ? Are you actually as stupid as you look ? ”
6444	6451	6453	6454	Aunt Petunia	206	“ Do n’t you dare — ! ”
6481	6489	6491	6491	Harry	177	“ Just in case you ’ve forgotten , ”
6493	6520	6491	6491	Harry	177	“ I ’ve already got a house , my godfather left me one . So why would I want this one ? All the happy memories ? ”
6537	6541	6543	6544	Uncle Vernon	210	“ You claim , ”
6552	6558	6543	6544	Uncle Vernon	210	“ that this Lord Thing — ”
6559	6563	6565	6565	Harry	177	“ — Voldemort , ”
6568	6603	6565	6565	Harry	177	“ and we ’ve been through this about a hundred times already . This is n’t a claim , it ’s fact . Dumbledore told you last year , and Kingsley and Mr. Weasley — ”
6696	6708	6709	6709	Harry	177	“ — Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well , ”
6714	6778	6709	6709	Harry	177	“ Once I ’m seventeen , the protective charm that keeps me safe will break , and that exposes you as well as me . The Order is sure Voldemort will target you , whether to torture you to try and find out where I am , or because he thinks by holding you hostage I ’d come and try to rescue you . ”
6812	6839	6809	6809	Harry	177	“ You ’ve got to go into hiding and the Order wants to help . You ’re being offered serious protection , the best there is . ”
6872	6882	6884	6885	Vernon Dursley	208	“ I thought there was a Ministry of Magic ? ”
6888	6892	6894	6894	Harry	177	“ There is , ”
6898	6938	6939	6939	Harry	177	“ Well , then , why ca n’t they protect us ? It seems to me that , as innocent victims , guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man , we ought to qualify for government protection ! ”
6974	6984	6985	6985	Harry	177	“ You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said , ”
6988	6997	6985	6985	Harry	177	“ We think the Ministry has been infiltrated . ”
7023	7027	7028	7028	he	210	“ All right , ”
7039	7070	7028	7028	he	210	“ All right , let ’s say for the sake of argument we accept this protection . I still do n’t see why we ca n’t have that Kingsley bloke . ”
7094	7101	7102	7102	he	782	“ As I ’ve told you , ”
7108	7122	7102	7102	he	782	“ Kingsley is protecting the Mug — I mean , your Prime Minister . ”
7123	7131	7133	7134	Uncle Vernon	210	“ Exactly — he ’s the best ! ”
7231	7238	7240	7240	Harry	177	“ Well , he ’s taken , ”
7242	7257	7240	7240	Harry	177	“ But Hestia Jones and Dedalus Diggle are more than up to the job — ”
7258	7266	7268	7269	Uncle Vernon	210	“ If we ’d even seen CVs … ”
7295	7372	7281	7281	he	177	“ These accidents are n’t accidents — the crashed and explosions and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news . People are disappearing and dying and he ’s behind it — Voldemort . I ’ve told you this over and over again , he kills Muggles for fun . Even the fogs — they’re caused by Dementors , and if you ca n’t remember what they are , ask your son ! ”
7402	7410	7394	7394	he	196	“ There are … more of them ? ”
7411	7414	7416	7416	Harry	177	“ More ? ”
7418	7451	7416	7416	Harry	177	“ More than the two that attacked us , you mean ? Of course there are hundreds , maybe thousands by this time , seeing as they feed off fear and despair — ”
7452	7459	7461	7462	Vernon Dursley	208	“ All right , all right , ”
7464	7471	7461	7462	Vernon Dursley	208	“ You ’ve made your point — ”
7472	7477	7479	7479	Harry	177	“ I hope so , ”
7481	7545	7479	7479	Harry	177	“ because once I ’m seventeen , all of them — Death Eaters , Dementors , maybe even Inferi — which means dead bodies enchanted by a Dark wizard — will be able to find you and will certainly attack you . And if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards , I think you ’ll agree you need help . ”
7592	7619	7587	7588	Uncle Vernon	210	“ But what about my work ? What about Dudley ’s school ? I do n’t suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards — ”
7620	7626	7628	7628	Harry	177	“ Do n’t you understand ? ”
7630	7643	7628	7628	Harry	177	“ They will torture and kill you like they did my parents ! ”
7644	7647	7649	7649	Dudley	196	“ Dad , ”
7655	7665	7649	7649	Dudley	196	“ Dad — I’m going with these Order people . ”
7666	7669	7671	7671	Harry	177	“ Dudley , ”
7673	7687	7671	7671	Harry	177	“ for the first time in your life , you ’re talking sense . ”
7735	7745	7746	7746	he	177	“ They ’ll be here in about five minutes , ”
7856	7865	7866	7866	Harry	177	“ We ’re leaving soon , really soon , ”
7870	7881	7866	7866	Harry	177	“ And then you ’ll be able to fly again . ”
7917	7921	7935	7949	a small man in a mauve top hat that was sweeping him a deep bow	821	“ Harry Potter ! ”
7951	7958	7935	7949	a small man in a mauve top hat that was sweeping him a deep bow	821	“ An honor , as ever ! ”
7959	7964	7966	7966	Harry	177	“ Thanks , Dedalus , ”
7980	8003	7975	7978	the dark haired Hestia	822	“ It ’s really good of you to do this … They ’re through here , my aunt and uncle and cousin … ”
8004	8015	8017	8017	Dedalus	215	“ Good day to you , Harry Potter ’s relatives ! ”
8061	8086	8088	8088	Dedalus	215	“ I see you are packed and ready . Excellent ! The plan , as Harry has told you , is a simple one , ”
8103	8173	8174	8174	he	215	“ We shall be leaving before Harry does . Due to the danger of using magic in your house — Harry being still underage it could provide the Ministry with an excuse to arrest him — we shall be driving , say , ten miles or so before Disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you . You know how to drive , I take it ? ”
8180	8196	8198	8199	Uncle Vernon	210	“ Know how to — ? Of course I ruddy well know how to drive ! ”
8201	8225	8227	8227	Dedalus	215	“ Very clever of you , sir , very clever . I personally would be utterly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs , ”
8256	8262	8263	8263	he	215	“ Ca n’t even drive , ”
8285	8290	8291	8291	Dedalus	215	“ You , Harry , ”
8294	8312	8291	8291	Dedalus	215	“ will wait here for your guard . There has been a little change in the arrangements — ”
8313	8318	8320	8320	Harry	177	“ What d’you mean ? ”
8324	8344	8320	8320	Harry	177	“ I thought Mad - Eye was going to come and take me by Side - Along - Apparition ? ”
8345	8351	8353	8353	Hestia	214	“ Ca n’t do it , ”
8356	8363	8353	8353	Hestia	214	“ Mad - Eye will explain . ”
8390	8394	8395	8395	Harry	177	“ Hurry up ! ”
8413	8426	8428	8428	Dedalus	215	“ Quite right , we ’re operating to a very tight schedule , ”
8442	8473	8474	8474	He	177	“ We are attempting to time your departure from the house with your family ’s Disapparition , Harry : thus the charm breaks the moment you all head for safety . ”
8480	8492	8474	8474	He	177	“ Well , are we all packed and ready to go ? ”
8514	8526	8528	8528	Hestia	214	“ Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall , Dedalus , ”
8556	8562	8563	8563	Harry	177	“ There ’s no need , ”
8578	8591	8592	8592	He	210	“ Well , this is good - bye , then , boy . ”
8631	8636	8638	8638	Petunia	206	“ Ready , Diddy ? ”
8680	8686	8688	8689	Uncle Vernon	210	“ Come along , then , ”
8703	8709	8700	8700	Dudley	196	“ I do n’t understand . ”
8710	8719	8721	8721	Petunia	206	“ What do n’t you understand , popkin ? ”
8740	8749	8728	8728	Dudley	196	“ Why is n’t he coming with us ? ”
8775	8778	8780	8781	Uncle Vernon	210	“ What ? ”
8784	8792	8794	8794	Dudley	196	“ Why is n’t he coming too ? ”
8796	8805	8807	8808	Uncle Vernon	210	“ Well , he — doesn’t want to , ”
8818	8828	8807	8808	Uncle Vernon	210	“ You do n’t want to , do you ? ”
8829	8835	8837	8837	Harry	177	“ Not in the slightest , ”
8839	8844	8845	8846	Uncle Vernon	210	“ There you are , ”
8850	8859	8845	8846	Uncle Vernon	210	“ Now come on , we ’re off . ”
8890	8894	8896	8897	Uncle Vernon	210	“ What now ? ”
8930	8939	8927	8927	he	196	“ But where ’s he going to go ? ”
8965	8977	8978	8978	she	214	“ But … surely you know where your nephew is going ? ”
8983	8988	8990	8991	Vernon Dursley	208	“ Certainly we know , ”
8993	9029	8990	8991	Vernon Dursley	208	“ He ’s off with some of your lot , is n’t he ? Right , Dudley , let ’s get in the car , you heard the man , we ’re in a hurry . ”
9048	9056	9032	9033	Vernon Dursley	208	“ Off with some of our lot ? ”
9087	9092	9093	9093	Harry	177	“ It ’s fine , ”
9097	9105	9093	9093	Harry	177	“ It does n’t matter , honestly . ”
9106	9111	9115	9115	her	214	“ Does n’t matter ? ”
9120	9153	9115	9115	her	214	“ Do n’t these people realize what you ’ve been through ? What danger you are in ? The unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti - Voldemort movement ? ”
9154	9163	9165	9165	Harry	177	“ Er — no , they do n’t , ”
9167	9184	9165	9165	Harry	177	“ They think I ’m a waste of space actually , but I ’m used to — ”
9185	9197	9115	9115	her	214	“ I do n’t think you ’re a waste of space . ”
9255	9264	9253	9253	himself	177	“ Well … er … thanks , Dudley . ”
9280	9286	9267	9267	Dudley	196	“ You saved my life . ”
9287	9291	9293	9293	Harry	177	“ Not really , ”
9295	9306	9293	9293	Harry	177	“ It was your soul the Dementor would have taken … ”
9443	9451	9452	9452	she	206	“ S - so sweet , Dudders … ”
9459	9475	9452	9452	she	206	“ S - such a lovely b - boy … s - saying thank you … ”
9476	9487	9489	9489	Hestia	214	“ But he has n’t said thank you at all ! ”
9492	9507	9489	9489	Hestia	214	“ He only said he did n’t think Harry was a waste of space ! ”
9508	9523	9525	9525	Harry	177	“ Yea but coming from Dudley that ’s like ‘ I love you , ’ ”
9555	9562	9564	9565	Uncle Vernon	210	“ Are we going or not ? ”
9576	9586	9564	9565	Uncle Vernon	210	“ I thought we were on a tight schedule ! ”
9587	9595	9597	9598	Dedalus Diggle	215	“ Yes — yes , we are , ”
9619	9628	9616	9616	himself	215	“ We really must be off . Harry — ”
9643	9665	9640	9640	his	215	“ — good luck . I hope we meet again . The hopes of the Wizarding world rest upon your shoulders . ”
9666	9669	9671	9671	Harry	177	“ Oh , ”
9673	9678	9671	9671	Harry	177	“ right . Thanks . ”
9679	9684	9686	9686	Hestia	214	“ Farwell , Harry , ”
9692	9699	9686	9686	Hestia	214	“ Our thoughts go with you . ”
9700	9707	9709	9709	Harry	177	“ I hope everything ’s okay , ”
9719	9733	9735	9735	Diggle	215	“ Oh I ’m sure we shall end up the best of chums , ”
9787	9792	9794	9794	Harry	177	“ Blimey , Dudley , ”
9802	9813	9794	9794	Harry	177	“ did the Dementors blow a different personality into you ? ”
9814	9817	9819	9819	Dudley	196	“ Dunno , ”
9821	9827	9819	9819	Dudley	196	“ See you , Harry . ”
9828	9831	9833	9833	Harry	177	“ Yea … ”
9843	9851	9833	9833	Harry	177	“ Maybe . Take care , Big D. ”
9923	9930	9920	9920	she	206	“ Well — good - bye , ”
9941	9946	9948	9948	Harry	177	“ Good - bye , ”
10272	10286	10287	10287	he	177	“ Do n’t you want to take a last look at the place ? ”
10302	10369	10287	10287	he	177	“ We ’ll never be here again . Do n’t you want to remember all the good times ? I mean , look at this doormat . What memories … Dudley sobbed on it after I saved him from the Dementors … Turns out he was grateful after all , can you believe it ? … And last summer , Dumbledore walked through that front door … ”
10410	10415	10381	10381	Hedwig	201	“ And under here , Hedwig”—Harry
10422	10445	10381	10381	Hedwig	201	stairs—“is where I used to sleep ! You never knew me then — Blimey , it ’s small , I ’d forgotten … ”
10742	10754	10739	10739	Hagrid	199	“ All righ ’ , Harry ? Ready fer the off ? ”
10755	10758	10760	10760	Harry	177	“ Definitely , ”
10768	10779	10760	10760	Harry	177	“ But I was n’t expecting this many of you ! ”
10780	10785	10787	10789	Mad - Eye	219	“ Change of plan , ”
10817	10829	10787	10789	Mad - Eye	219	“ Let ’s get undercover before we talk you through it . ”
11056	11070	11071	11071	he	177	“ Kingsley , I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime Minister ? ”
11077	11088	11090	11090	Kingsley	211	“ He can get along without me for one night , ”
11092	11098	11090	11090	Kingsley	211	“ You ’re more important . ”
11099	11105	11109	11109	her	231	“ Harry , guess what ? ”
11132	11137	11138	11138	Harry	177	“ You got married ? ”
11147	11164	11119	11119	she	231	“ I ’m sorry you could n’t be there , Harry , it was very quiet . ”
11165	11172	11206	11206	Moody	219	“ That ’s brilliant , congrat — ”
11173	11192	11194	11194	Moody	219	“ All right , all right , we ’ll have time for a cozy catch - up later , ”
11218	11237	11206	11206	Moody	219	“ Second problem : You ’re underage , which means you ’ve still got the Trace on you . ”
11238	11243	11206	11206	Moody	219	“ I do n’t — ”
11244	11251	11253	11255	Mad - Eye	219	“ The trace , the trace ! ”
11258	11301	11253	11255	Mad - Eye	219	“ We ca n’t wait for the Trace to break , because the moment you turn seventeen you ’ll lose all the protection your mother gave you . In short , Pius Thicknesse thinks he ’s got you cornered good and proper . ”
11313	11322	11325	11325	Harry	177	“ So what are we going to do ? ”
11327	11372	11389	11391	Mad - Eye	219	“ We ’re going to use the only means of transport left to us , the only ones the Trace ca n’t detect , because we do n’t need to cast spells to use them : brooms , thestrals , and Hagrid ’s motorbike . ”
11398	11418	11389	11391	Mad - Eye	219	“ Now , your mother ’s charm will only break under two conditions : when you come of age , or”—Moody
11423	11460	11389	11391	Mad - Eye	219	kitchen—“you no longer call this place home . You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight , in the full understanding that you ’re never going to live together again , correct ? ”
11464	11485	11461	11461	Harry	177	“ So this time , when you leave , there ’ll be no going back — you get the idea . ”
11486	11489	11491	11491	Harry	177	“ Yeah , ”
11509	11550	11461	11461	Harry	177	“ You ’ll be going to Tonks ’s parents . Once you ’re within the boundaries of the protective enchantments we ’ve put on their house you ’ll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow . Any questions ? ”
11551	11556	11558	11558	Harry	177	“ Er — yes , ”
11560	11587	11558	11558	Harry	177	“ Maybe they wo n’t know which of the twelve secure houses I ’m heading for at first , but wo n’t it be sort of obvious once”—he
11591	11601	11461	11461	Harry	177	headcount—“fourteen of us fly off toward Tonks ’s parents ? ”
11602	11605	11607	11607	Moody	219	“ Ah , ”
11609	11658	11607	11607	Moody	219	“ I forgot to mention the key point . Fourteen of us wo n’t be flying to Tonks ’s parents . There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the skies tonight , each of them with a companion , each pair heading for a different safe house . ”
11694	11697	11698	11698	he	219	“ No ! ”
11709	11713	11698	11698	he	219	“ No way ! ”
11714	11725	11727	11727	Hermione	197	“ I told them you ’d take it like this , ”
11734	11750	11702	11702	his	219	“ If you think I ’m going to let six people risk their lives — ! ”
11751	11764	11766	11766	Ron	227	“ — because it ’s the first time for all of us , ”
11768	11778	11702	11702	his	219	“ This is different , pretending to be me — ”
11779	11791	11793	11793	Fred	228	“ Well , none of us really fancy it , Harry , ”
11796	11813	11793	11793	Fred	228	“ Imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky , scrawny gits forever . ”
11819	11840	11814	11814	Harry	177	“ You ca n’t do it if I do n’t cooperate , you need me to give you some hair . ”
11841	11850	11852	11852	George	229	“ Well , that ’s the plan scuppered , ”
11854	11874	11852	11852	George	229	“ Obviously there ’s no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate . ”
11875	11898	11900	11900	Fred	228	“ Yeah , thirteen of us against one bloke who ’s not allowed to use magic ; we ’ve got no chance , ”
11902	11905	11907	11907	Harry	177	“ Funny , ”
11909	11913	11907	11907	Harry	177	“ really amusing . ”
11914	11927	11929	11929	Moody	219	“ If it has to come to force , then it will , ”
11947	11965	11942	11942	he	219	“ Everyone here ’s overage , Potter , and they ’re all prepared to take the risk . ”
11989	12014	11985	11985	Moody	219	“ Let ’s have no more arguments . Time ’s wearing on . I want a few of your hairs , boy , now . ”
12015	12026	12064	12064	Ron	227	“ But this is mad , there ’s no need — ”
12027	12031	12033	12033	Moody	219	“ No need ! ”
12046	12060	12035	12035	Harry	177	“ So , Potter — some of your hair , if you please . ”
12081	12084	12086	12086	Moody	219	“ Now ! ”
12115	12118	12120	12120	Moody	219	“ Good , ”
12136	12145	12125	12125	he	219	“ Straight in here , if you please . ”
12186	12200	12202	12202	Hermione	197	“ Ooh , you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle , Harry , ”
12219	12235	12208	12208	Ron	227	“ Oh , you know what I mean — Goyle ’s potion tasted like bogies . ”
12236	12249	12251	12251	Moody	219	“ Right then , fake Potters line up over here , please , ”
12274	12280	12282	12282	Lupin	189	“ We ’re one short , ”
12284	12287	12293	12293	he	199	“ Here , ”
12325	12338	12340	12340	Mundungus	233	“ I ’m a soldier , I ’d sooner be a protector , ”
12342	12346	12348	12348	Moody	219	“ Shut it , ”
12350	12417	12348	12348	Moody	219	“ As I ’ve already told you , you spineless worm , any Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Potter , not kill him . Dumbledore always said You - Know - Who would want to finish Potter in person . It ’ll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about , the Death Eaters’ll want to kill them . ”
12457	12462	12463	12463	Ron	227	“ Altogether , then … ”
12588	12594	12579	12579	George	229	“ Wow — we’re identical ! ”
12595	12610	12612	12612	Fred	228	“ I dunno , though , I think I ’m still better - looking , ”
12621	12624	12626	12626	Fleur	232	“ Bah , ”
12635	12648	12626	12626	Fleur	232	“ Bill , do n’t look at me — I’m ’ ideous . ”
12649	12664	12666	12666	Moody	219	“ Those whose clothes are a bit roomy , I ’ve got smaller here , ”
12673	12707	12666	12666	Moody	219	“ and vice versa . Do n’t forget the glasses , there ’s six pairs in the side pocket . And when you ’re dressed , there ’s luggage in the other sack . ”
12801	12811	12813	12813	Ron	227	“ I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo , ”
12822	12831	12836	12836	she	197	“ Harry , your eyesight really is awful , ”
12865	12868	12870	12870	Moody	219	“ Good , ”
12888	12906	12875	12884	seven dressed , bespectacled , and luggage - laden Harrys	891	“ The pairs will be as follows : Mundungus will be traveling with me , by broom — ”
12907	12913	12915	12920	the Harry nearest the back door	892	“ Why’m I with you ? ”
12922	12932	12934	12934	Moody	219	“ Because you ’re the one that needs watching , ”
12952	12957	12949	12949	he	219	“ Arthur and Fred — ”
12958	12963	12965	12969	the twin at whom Moody	893	“ I ’m George , ”
12973	12986	12965	12969	the twin at whom Moody	893	“ Ca n’t you even tell us apart when we ’re Harry ? ”
12987	12992	12949	12949	he	219	“ Sorry , George — ”
12993	13006	12965	12969	the twin at whom Moody	893	“ I ’m only yanking your wand , I ’m Fred really — ”
13007	13013	13015	13015	Moody	219	“ Enough messing around ! ! ”
13017	13037	13015	13015	Moody	219	“ The other one — George or Fred or whoever you are — you’re with Remus . Miss Delacour — ”
13038	13047	13049	13049	Bill	230	“ I ’m taking Fleur on a thestral , ”
13051	13060	13049	13049	Bill	230	“ She ’s not that fond of brooms . ”
13091	13101	13102	13102	Hermione	197	“ Miss Granger with Kingsley , again by thestral — ”
13123	13132	13134	13134	Tonks	231	“ Which leaves you and me , Ron ! ”
13158	13173	13175	13175	Hagrid	199	“ An ’ you ’re with me , Harry . That all righ ’ ? ”
13182	13226	13175	13175	Hagrid	199	“ We ’ll be on the bike , brooms an ’ thestrals ca n’t take me weight , see . Not a lot o ’ room on the seat with me on it , though , so you ’ll be in the sidecar . ”
13227	13232	13234	13234	Harry	177	“ That ’s great , ”
13240	13255	13257	13257	Moody	219	“ We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom , ”
13332	13343	13321	13321	Hagrid	199	“ Is this it ? Is this Sirius ’s bike ? ”
13344	13349	13351	13351	Hagrid	199	“ The very same , ”
13358	13379	13351	13351	Hagrid	199	“ An ’ the last time yeh was on it , Harry , I could fit yeh in one hand ! ”
13446	13457	13459	13459	Hagrid	199	“ Arthur ’s done a bit o ’ tinkerin ’ , ”
13485	13504	13468	13468	He	199	“ It ’s got a few tricks up its hindquarters now . Tha ’ one was my idea . ”
13518	13525	13527	13528	Mr. Weasley	212	“ Please be careful , Hagrid , ”
13540	13560	13527	13528	Mr. Weasley	212	“ I ’m still not sure that was advisable and it ’s certainly only to be used in emergencies . ”
13561	13567	13569	13569	Moody	219	“ All right , then , ”
13571	13598	13569	13569	Moody	219	“ Everyone ready , please . I want us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the diversion ’s lost . ”
13604	13611	13613	13613	Tonks	231	“ Hold tight now , Ron , ”
13658	13664	13666	13666	Moody	219	“ Good luck , everyone , ”
13668	13692	13666	13666	Moody	219	“ See you all in about an hour at the Burrow . On the count of three . One … two … THREE . ”
13921	13926	13913	13913	his	177	“ No — Hedwig ! ”
13984	13989	13995	13995	Harry	177	“ No — NO ! ”

16629	16641	16618	16618	Harry	177	“ Death Eaters , loads of them — we were chased — ”

16651	16674	16648	16648	Ted	245	“ What d’you mean , Death Eaters ? I thought they did n’t know you were being moved tonight , I thought — ”

16701	16735	16691	16691	he	245	“ Well , we know our protective charms hold , then , do n’t we ? They should n’t be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction . ”
16858	16861	16871	16871	he	177	“ Harry ! ”

17431	17434	17436	17436	Harry	177	“ Thanks , ”
17451	17456	17458	17458	Hagrid	199	“ Wait a moment , ”

17471	17478	17480	17480	Harry	177	“ She … she got hit , ”

17549	17560	17545	17545	he	199	“ Never mind . She had a great old life — ”
17561	17564	17566	17566	Ted	245	“ Hagrid ! ”
17704	17721	17723	17724	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Harry ? You are the real Harry ? What happened ? Where are the others ? ”
17726	17737	17738	17738	Harry	177	“ What d’you mean ? Is n’t anyone else back ? ”
17753	17762	17765	17765	her	253	“ The Death Eaters were waiting for us , ”
17767	17817	17763	17763	Harry	177	“ We were surrounded the moment we took off — they knew it was tonight — I do n’t know what happened to anyone else , four of them chased us , it was all we could do to get away , and then Voldemort caught up with us — ”
17850	17858	17859	17859	she	253	“ Thank goodness you ’re all right , ”
17874	17887	17889	17889	Hagrid	199	“ Have n’t go ’ any brandy , have yeh , Molly ? ”
17894	17899	17889	17889	Hagrid	199	“ Fer medicinal purposes ? ”
17943	17965	17966	17966	she	238	“ Ron and Tonks should have been back first , but they missed their Portkey , it came back without them , ”
17981	17986	17987	17987	she	238	“ And that one , ”
17994	18017	18018	18018	she	238	“ should have been Dad and Fred ’s , they were supposed to be second . You and Hagrid were third and , ”
18023	18041	18018	18018	she	238	“ if they made it , George and Lupin ought to be back in about a minute . ”
18068	18071	18073	18073	Ginny	238	“ Mum ! ”
18254	18257	18259	18259	Hagrid	199	“ Oi ! ”
18262	18275	18259	18259	Hagrid	199	“ Le ’ go of him ! Le ’ go of Harry ! ”
18280	18299	18300	18300	he	189	“ What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts ? ”
18309	18313	18300	18300	he	189	“ Answer me ! ”
18314	18327	18278	18278	him	199	“ A — a Grindylow in a tank , was n’t it ? ”
18339	18347	18349	18349	Hagrid	199	“ Wha ’ was tha ’ about ? ”
18351	18364	18366	18366	Lupin	189	“ I ’m sorry , Harry , but I had to check , ”
18369	18406	18366	18366	Lupin	189	“ We ’ve been betrayed . Voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have told him were directly involved in the plan . You might have been an impostor . ”
18407	18417	18419	18419	Hagrid	199	“ So why aren ’ you checkin ’ me ? ”
18427	18434	18436	18436	Lupin	189	“ You ’re half - giant , ”
18443	18454	18436	18436	Lupin	189	“ The Polyjuice Potion is designed for human use only . ”
18455	18469	18471	18471	Harry	177	“ None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight , ”
18490	18535	18488	18488	them	1004	“ Voldemort only caught up with me toward the end , he did n’t know which one I was in the beginning . If he ’d been in on the plan he ’d have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid . ”
18536	18543	18545	18545	Lupin	189	“ Voldemort caught up with you ? ”
18548	18557	18545	18545	Lupin	189	“ What happened ? How did you escape ? ”
18607	18620	18584	18584	they	1005	“ They recognized you ? But how ? What had you done ? ”
18621	18624	18625	18625	Harry	177	“ I … ”
18642	18690	18625	18625	Harry	177	“ I saw Stan Shunpike … You know , the bloke who was the conductor on the Knight Bus ? And I tried to Disarm him instead of — well , he does n’t know what he ’s doing , does he ? He must be Imperiused ! ”
18695	18726	18691	18691	Lupin	189	“ Harry , the time for Disarming is past ! These people are trying to capture and kill you ! At least Stun if you are n’t prepared to kill ! ”
18727	18773	18774	18774	Harry	177	“ We were hundreds of feet up ! Stan ’s not himself , and if I Stunned him and he ’d fallen , he ’d have died the same as if I ’d used Avada Kedavra ! Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago , ”
18805	18810	18812	18812	Lupin	189	“ Yes , Harry , ”
18817	18870	18812	18812	Lupin	189	“ and a great number of Death Eaters witnessed that happening ! Forgive me , but it was a very unusual move then , under the imminent threat of death . Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal ! ”
18871	18882	18884	18884	Harry	177	“ So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike ? ”
18887	18892	18894	18894	Lupin	189	“ Of course not , ”
18896	18945	18894	18894	Lupin	189	“ but the Death Eaters — frankly , most people!—would have expected you to attack back ! Expelliarmus is a useful spell , Harry , but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move , and I urge you not to let it become so ! ”
18965	18981	18983	18983	Harry	177	“ I wo n’t blast people out of my way just because they ’re there , ”
18985	18992	18983	18983	Harry	177	“ That ’s Voldemort ’s job . ”
19033	19039	19028	19028	Harry	177	“ Will George be okay ? ”
19054	19077	19104	19105	Two figures	1011	“ I think so , although there ’s no chance of replacing his ear , not when it ’s been cursed off — ”
19180	19193	19168	19168	him	177	“ The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us ! ”
19194	19208	19210	19210	Lupin	189	“ ‘ Harry is the best hope we have . Trust him , ’ ”
19224	19233	19221	19221	Lupin	189	“ It ’s him , I ’ve checked ! ”
19234	19241	19243	19243	Kingsley	211	“ All right , all right ! ”
19253	19268	19243	19243	Kingsley	211	“ But somebody betrayed us ! They knew , they knew it was tonight ! ”
19269	19274	19276	19276	Lupin	189	“ So it seems , ”
19278	19292	19276	19276	Lupin	189	“ but apparently they did not realize that there would be seven Harrys . ”
19293	19297	19299	19299	Kingsley	211	“ Small comfort ! ”
19301	19307	19299	19299	Kingsley	211	“ Who else is back ? ”
19308	19319	19276	19276	Lupin	189	“ Only Harry , Hagrid , George , and me . ”
19329	19335	19336	19336	Lupin	189	“ What happened to you ? ”
19340	19353	19354	19354	Kingsley	211	“ Followed by five , injured two , might ’ve killed one , ”
19358	19386	19354	19354	Kingsley	211	“ and we saw You - Know - Who as well , he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty quickly . Remus , he can — ”
19387	19390	19392	19392	Harry	177	“ Fly , ”
19394	19407	19392	19392	Harry	177	“ I saw him too , he came after Hagrid and me . ”
19408	19420	19422	19422	Kingsley	211	“ So that ’s why he left , to follow you ! ”
19424	19441	19422	19422	Kingsley	211	“ I could n’t understand why he ’d vanished . But what made him change targets ? ”
19442	19453	19455	19455	Lupin	189	“ Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike , ”
19457	19460	19462	19462	Hermione	197	“ Stan ? ”
19464	19473	19462	19462	Hermione	197	“ But I thought he was in Azkaban ? ”
19481	19528	19474	19474	Kingsley	211	“ Hermione , there ’s obviously been a mass breakout which the Ministry has hushed up . Travers ’s hood fell off when I cursed him , he ’s supposed to be inside too . But what happened to you , Remus ? Where ’s George ? ”
19529	19535	19537	19537	Lupin	189	“ He lost an ear , ”
19539	19544	19546	19546	Hermione	197	“ Lost an — ? ”
19552	19557	19559	19559	Lupin	189	“ Snape ’s work , ”
19561	19564	19566	19566	Harry	177	“ Snape ? ”
19568	19574	19566	19566	Harry	177	“ You did n’t say — ”
19575	19631	19566	19566	Harry	177	“ He lost his hood during the chase . Sectumsempra was always a specialty of Snape ’s . I wish I could say I ’d paid him back in kind , but it was all I could do to keep George on the broom after he was injured , he was losing so much blood . ”
19694	19702	19704	19704	Hagrid	199	“ Harry , give us a hand ! ”
19777	19782	19752	19753	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ How is he ? ”
19790	19822	19783	19784	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ I ca n’t make it grow back , not when it ’s been removed by Dark Magic . But it could ’ve been so much worse … He ’s alive . ”
19823	19826	19828	19828	Harry	177	“ Yeah , ”
19830	19834	19828	19828	Harry	177	“ Thank God . ”
19835	19845	19846	19846	Ginny	238	“ Did I hear someone else in the yard ? ”
19849	19854	19856	19856	Harry	177	“ Hermione and Kingsley , ”
19858	19862	19863	19863	Ginny	238	“ Thank goodness , ”
19913	19942	19954	19954	He	212	“ I ’ll prove who I am , Kingsley , after I ’ve seen my son , now back off if you know what ’s good for you ! ”
19982	19985	19987	19988	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Arthur ! ”
19990	19995	19987	19988	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Oh thank goodness ! ”
19996	20001	20002	20003	Mr. Weasley	212	“ How is he ? ”
20069	20077	20079	20080	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ How do you feel , Georgie ? ”
20093	20096	20097	20097	he	229	“ Saintlike , ”
20100	20107	20109	20109	Fred	228	“ What ’s wrong with him ? ”
20114	20120	20109	20109	Fred	228	“ Is his mind affected ? ”
20121	20124	20126	20126	George	229	“ Saintlike , ”
20138	20152	20126	20126	George	229	“ You see … I ’m holy . Holey , Fred , geddit ? ”
20167	20170	20171	20171	he	229	“ Pathetic , ”
20175	20196	20171	20171	he	229	“ Pathetic ! With the whole wide world of ear - related humor before you , you go for holey ? ”
20197	20201	20203	20203	George	229	“ Ah well , ”
20213	20228	20203	20203	George	229	“ You ’ll be able to tell us apart now , anyway , Mum . ”
20233	20244	20229	20229	He	229	“ Hi , Harry — you are Harry , right ? ”
20245	20251	20253	20253	Harry	177	“ Yeah , I am , ”
20261	20272	20274	20274	George	229	“ Well , at least we got you back okay , ”
20276	20288	20274	20274	George	229	“ Why are n’t Ron and Bill huddled round my sickbed ? ”
20289	20298	20300	20301	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ They ’re not back yet , George , ”
20335	20362	20328	20328	she	238	“ Ron and Tonks should be back by now . They did n’t have a long journey ; Auntie Muriel ’s not that far from here . ”
20543	20548	20550	20550	Hermione	197	“ It ’s them ! ”
20565	20568	20572	20572	she	231	“ Remus ! ”
20603	20608	20609	20609	he	189	“ You ’re okay , ”
20622	20629	20613	20613	Hermione	197	“ I thought — I thought — ”
20630	20636	20638	20638	Ron	227	“ ’ M all right , ”
20646	20651	20638	20638	Ron	227	“ ’ M fine . ”
20652	20657	20659	20659	Tonks	231	“ Ron was great , ”
20668	20697	20663	20663	her	231	“ Wonderful . Stunned one of the Death Eaters , straight to the head , and when you ’re aiming at a moving target from a flying broom — ”
20698	20702	20704	20704	Hermione	197	“ You did ? ”
20718	20725	20726	20726	he	227	“ Always the tone of surprise , ”
20735	20742	20726	20726	he	227	“ Are we the last back ? ”
20743	20746	20748	20748	Ginny	238	“ No , ”
20750	20780	20748	20748	Ginny	238	“ we ’re still waiting for Bill and Fleur and Mad - Eye and Mundungus . I ’m going to tell Mum and Dad you ’re okay , Ron — ”
20786	20795	20796	20796	Lupin	189	“ So what kept you ? What happened ? ”
20803	20806	20808	20808	Tonks	231	“ Bellatrix , ”
20810	20871	20808	20808	Tonks	231	“ She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry , Remus , she tried very hard to kill me . I just wish I ’d got her , I owe Bellatrix . But we definitely injured Rodolphus … Then we got to Ron ’s Auntie Muriel ’s and we missed our Portkey and she was fussing over us — ”
20892	20900	20901	20901	Tonks	231	“ So what happened to you lot ? ”
20958	20980	20982	20982	Kingsley	211	“ I ’m going to have to get back to Downing Street , I should have been there an hour ago , ”
20994	21003	20982	20982	Kingsley	211	“ Let me know when they ’re back . ”
21067	21071	21073	21074	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Thank you , ”
21076	21081	21073	21074	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ for our sons . ”
21082	21090	21092	21092	Tonks	231	“ Do n’t be silly , Molly , ”
21096	21101	21103	21103	Lupin	189	“ How ’s George ? ”
21105	21112	21115	21115	Ron	227	“ What ’s wrong with him ? ”
21117	21122	21115	21115	Ron	227	“ He ’s lost — ”
21165	21174	21196	21196	he	230	“ Bill ! Thank God , thank God — ”
21199	21206	21196	21196	he	230	“ Mad - Eye ’s dead . ”
21232	21237	21239	21239	Bill	230	“ We saw it , ”
21263	21273	21275	21275	Lupin	189	“ Of course you could n’t have done anything , ”
21370	21375	21377	21377	Fred	228	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
21386	21395	21377	21377	Fred	228	“ What ’s happened ? Who ’s — ? ”
21396	21401	21403	21404	Mr. Weasley	212	“ Mad - Eye , ”
21406	21409	21403	21404	Mr. Weasley	212	“ Dead . ”
21509	21512	21513	21513	he	230	“ Here , ”
21543	21548	21524	21524	he	230	“ Mad - Eye . ”
21549	21554	21555	21555	they	1051	“ Mad - Eye , ”
21562	21567	21569	21569	Hagrid	199	“ Mad - Eye , ”
21611	21616	21618	21618	Lupin	189	“ So Mundungus disappeared ? ”
21663	21671	21673	21673	Bill	230	“ I know what you ’re thinking , ”
21675	21691	21693	21693	Tonks	231	“ You - Know - Who acted exactly as Mad - Eye expected him to , ”
21695	21734	21693	21693	Tonks	231	“ Mad - Eye said he ’d expect the real Harry to be with the toughest , most skilled Aurors . He chased Mad - Eye first , and when Mundungus gave them away he switched to Kingsley … ”
21735	21745	21747	21747	Fleur	232	“ Yes , and zat eez all very good , ”
21749	21803	21747	21747	Fleur	232	“ but still eet does not explain ’ ow zey know we were moving ’ Arry tonight , does eet ? Somebody must ’ ave been careless . Somebody let slip ze date to an outsider . It is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze ’ ole plan . ”
21893	21896	21897	21897	Harry	177	“ No , ”
21919	21929	21930	21930	Harry	177	“ I mean … if somebody made a mistake , ”
21934	21956	21957	21957	he	177	“ and let something slip , I know they did n’t mean to do it . It ’s not their fault , ”
21971	22001	21957	21957	he	177	“ We ’ve got to trust each other . I trust all of you , I do n’t think anyone in this room would ever sell me to Voldemort . ”
22058	22064	22066	22066	Fred	228	“ Well said , Harry , ”
22069	22078	22080	22080	George	229	“ Year , ’ ear , ’ ear , ”
22114	22122	22124	22124	Harry	177	“ You think I ’m a fool ? ”
22126	22136	22138	22138	Lupin	189	“ No , I think you ’re like James , ”
22140	22156	22138	22138	Lupin	189	“ who would have regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends . ”
22208	22221	22188	22188	Lupin	189	“ There ’s work to do . I can ask Kingsley whether — ”
22222	22225	22227	22227	Bill	230	“ No , ”
22231	22241	22227	22227	Bill	230	“ I ’ll do it , I ’ll come . ”
22242	22248	22250	22250	Tonks	231	“ Where are you going ? ”
22255	22262	22264	22264	Lupin	189	“ Mad - Eye ’s body , ”
22266	22273	22264	22264	Lupin	189	“ We need to recover it . ”
22274	22280	22282	22283	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Ca n’t it — ? ”
22291	22294	22296	22296	Bill	230	“ Wait ? ”
22298	22310	22296	22296	Bill	230	“ Not unless you ’d rather the Death Eaters took it ? ”
22355	22363	22365	22365	Harry	177	“ I ’ve got to go too , ”
22376	22384	22386	22387	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Do n’t be silly , Harry , ”
22389	22396	22386	22387	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ What are you talking about ? ”
22397	22404	22405	22405	He	177	“ I ca n’t stay here . ”
22427	22443	22386	22387	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ You ’re all in danger while I ’m here . I do n’t want — ”
22444	22452	22454	22455	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ But do n’t be so silly ! ”
22457	22505	22454	22455	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ The whole point of tonight was to get you here safely , and thank goodness it worked . And Fleur ’s agreed to get married here rather than in France , we ’ve arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after you — ”
22521	22530	22511	22511	she	253	“ If Voldemort finds out I ’m here — ”
22531	22537	22539	22540	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ But why should he ? ”
22542	22555	22557	22558	Mr. Weasley	212	“ There are a dozen places you might be now , Harry , ”
22560	22575	22557	22558	Mr. Weasley	212	“ He ’s got no way of knowing which safe house you ’re in . ”
22576	22586	22588	22588	Harry	177	“ It ’s not me I ’m worried for ! ”
22590	22595	22597	22598	Mr. Weasley	212	“ We know that , ”
22601	22616	22597	22598	Mr. Weasley	212	“ but it would make our efforts tonight seem rather pointless if you left . ”
22617	22623	22625	22625	Hagrid	199	“ Yer not goin’ anywhere , ”
22627	22643	22625	22625	Hagrid	199	“ Blimey , Harry , after all we wen ’ through ter get you here ? ”
22644	22653	22655	22655	George	229	“ Yeah , what about my bleeding ear ? ”
22664	22669	22625	22625	Hagrid	199	“ I know that — ”
22670	22678	22694	22694	they	1066	“ Mad - Eye would n’t want — ”
22679	22683	22684	22684	Harry	177	“ I KNOW ! ”
22763	22770	22771	22771	she	253	“ Where ’s Hedwig , Harry ? ”
22775	22790	22771	22771	she	253	“ We can put her up with Pidwidgeon and give her something to eat . ”
22817	22830	22832	22832	Hagrid	199	“ Wait till it gets out yeh did it again , Harry , ”
22834	22850	22832	22832	Hagrid	199	“ Escaped him , fought him off when he was right on top of yeh ! ”
22851	22857	22859	22859	Harry	177	“ It was n’t me , ”
22862	22876	22859	22859	Harry	177	“ It was my wand . My wand acted of its own accord . ”
22886	22908	22882	22882	Hermione	197	“ But that ’s impossible , Harry . You mean that you did magic without meaning to ; you reacted instinctively . ”
22909	22912	22914	22914	Harry	177	“ No , ”
22916	22968	22914	22914	Harry	177	“ The bike was falling , I could n’t have told you where Voldemort was , but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him , and it was n’t even a spell I recognized . I ’ve never made gold flames appear before . ”
22969	22972	22974	22975	Mr. Weasley	212	“ Often , ”
22977	23004	22974	22975	Mr. Weasley	212	“ when you ’re in a pressured situation you can produce magic you never dreamed of . Small children often find , before they ’re trained — ”
23005	23012	23014	23014	Harry	177	“ It was n’t like that , ”
23297	23312	23321	23340	an emaciated old man lying in rags upon a stone floor , screaming , a horrible drawn - out scream	1073	“ You told me the problem would be solved by using another ’s wand ! ”
23348	23361	23460	23460	Harry	177	“ No ! No ! I beg you , I beg you … ”
23362	23371	23460	23460	Harry	177	“ You lied to Lord Voldemort , Ollivander ! ”
23372	23383	23460	23460	Harry	177	“ I did not … I swear I did not … ”
23384	23397	23460	23460	Harry	177	“ You sought to help Potter , to help him escape me ! ”
23398	23413	23460	23460	Harry	177	“ I swear I did not … I believed a different wand would work … ”
23414	23428	23460	23460	Harry	177	“ Explain , then , what happened . Lucius ’s wand is destroyed ! ”
23429	23446	23460	23460	Harry	177	“ I can not understand … The connection … exists only … between your two wands … ”
23447	23450	23460	23460	Harry	177	“ Lies ! ”
23451	23458	23460	23460	Harry	177	“ Please … I beg you … ”
23489	23492	23478	23484	the frail old main on the floor	1075	“ Harry ? ”
23542	23551	23552	23552	Hermione	197	“ Harry , come back in the house , ”
23555	23564	23552	23552	Hermione	197	“ You are n’t still thinking of leaving ? ”
23565	23576	23578	23578	Ron	227	“ Yeah , you ’ve got to stay , mate , ”
23586	23592	23593	23593	Hermione	197	“ Are you all right ? ”
23606	23611	23593	23593	Hermione	197	“ You look awful ! ”
23612	23615	23617	23617	Harry	177	“ Well , ”
23620	23628	23617	23617	Harry	177	“ I probably look better than Ollivander … ”
23649	23688	23630	23630	he	177	“ But it was supposed to have stopped ! Your scar — it was n’t supposed to do this anymore ! You must n’t let that connection open up again — Dumbledore wanted you to close your mind ! ”
23700	23727	23695	23695	she	197	“ Harry , he ’s taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and half the Wizarding world ! Do n’t let him inside your head too ! ”
23806	23815	23852	23852	his	177	“ Well , you ca n’t do anything about the”—Ron
23819	23849	23850	23850	he	177	Horcruxes—“till you ’re seventeen . You ’ve still got the Trace on you . And we can plan here as well as anywhere , ca n’t we ? Or , ”
23858	23873	23850	23850	he	177	“ d’you reckon you already know where the You - Know - Whats are ? ”
23874	23877	23878	23878	Harry	177	“ No , ”
23881	23893	23895	23895	Ron	227	“ I think Hermione ’s been doing a bit of research , ”
23897	23910	23895	23895	Ron	227	“ She said she was saving it for when you got here . ”
23950	23960	23962	23962	Harry	177	“ The Trace’ll break on the thirty - first , ”
23964	23980	23962	23962	Harry	177	“ That means I only need to stay here four days . Then I can — ”
23981	23985	23986	23986	Ron	227	“ Five days , ”
23991	24010	23986	23986	Ron	227	“ We ’ve got to stay for the wedding . They ’ll kill us if we miss it . ”
24013	24015	24011	24011	Harry	177	“ they ”
24023	24030	24032	24032	Ron	227	“ It ’s one extra day , ”
24039	24048	24011	24011	Harry	177	“ Do n’t they realize how important — ? ”
24049	24056	24058	24058	Ron	227	“ ’ Course they do n’t , ”
24060	24083	24058	24058	Ron	227	“ They have n’t got a clue . And now you mention it , I wanted to talk to you about that . ”
24109	24175	24084	24084	Ron	227	“ Mum ’s been trying to get it out of Hermione and me . What we ’re off to do . She ’ll try you next , so brace yourself . Dad and Lupin’ve both asked as well , but when we said Dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us , they dropped it . Not Mum , though . She ’s determined . ”
24233	24251	24252	24252	she	253	“ Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of Hogwarts , ”
24261	24264	24266	24266	Harry	177	“ Oh , ”
24268	24276	24266	24266	Harry	177	“ Well , yeah . We are . ”
24300	24311	24313	24314	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ May I ask why you are abandoning your education ? ”
24316	24327	24329	24329	Harry	177	“ Well , Dumbledore left me … stuff to do , ”
24331	24346	24329	24329	Harry	177	“ Ron and Hermione know about it , and they want to come too . ”
24347	24355	24395	24396	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ What sort of ‘ stuff ’ ? ”
24356	24365	24329	24329	Harry	177	“ I ’m sorry , I ca n’t — ”
24366	24393	24395	24396	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Well , frankly , I think Arthur and I have a right to know , and I ’m sure Mr. and Mrs. Granger would agree ! ”
24404	24407	24329	24329	Harry	177	“ concerned parent ”
24443	24474	24395	24396	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Dumbledore did n’t want anyone else to know , Mrs. Weasley . I ’m sorry . Ron and Hermione do n’t have to come , it ’s their choice — ”
24475	24487	24488	24488	she	253	“ I do n’t see that you have to go either ! ”
24496	24556	24488	24488	she	253	“ You ’re barely of age , any of you ! It ’s utter nonsense , if Dumbledore needed work doing , he had the whole Order at his command ! Harry , you must have misunderstood him . Probably he was telling you something he wanted done , and you took it to mean that he wanted you — ”
24557	24563	24565	24565	Harry	177	“ I did n’t misunderstand , ”
24568	24576	24565	24565	Harry	177	“ It ’s got to be me . ”
24598	24612	24577	24577	He	177	“ And that ’s not mine . I do n’t support Puddlemere United . ”
24613	24620	24622	24623	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Oh , of course not , ”
24636	24645	24647	24647	Harry	177	“ No — I — of course not , ”
24657	24662	24663	24663	she	253	“ Sweet of you , ”
24831	24859	24860	24860	Ginny	238	“ I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning , she ’ll be able to delay you leaving , ”
24882	24894	24895	24895	Harry	177	“ And then what does she think ’s going to happen ? ”
24898	24918	24895	24895	Harry	177	“ Someone else might kill off Voldemort while she ’s holding us here making vol - au - vents ? ”
24932	24938	24939	24939	she	238	“ So it ’s true ? ”
24942	24952	24939	24939	she	238	“ That ’s what you ’re trying to do ? ”
24953	24962	24964	24964	Harry	177	“ I — not — I was joking , ”
25107	25154	25100	25103	a Secret - Keeper	1104	“ And as there are around twenty of us , that greatly dilutes the power of the Fidelius Charm . Twenty times as many opportunities for the Death Eaters to get the secret out of somebody . We ca n’t expect it to hold much longer . ”
25155	25170	25172	25172	Harry	177	“ But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by now ? ”
25174	25250	25100	25103	a Secret - Keeper	1104	“ Well , Mad - Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he turns up there again . We hope they ’ll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place , but we ca n’t be sure . It would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky . ”
25313	25321	25322	25322	Harry	177	“ No news about Mad - Eye ? ”
25326	25329	25331	25331	Bill	230	“ Nothing , ”
25378	25396	25397	25397	Bill	230	“ The Daily Prophet has n’t said a word about him dying or about finding the body , ”
25401	25418	25397	25397	Bill	230	“ But that does n’t mean much . It ’s keeping a lot quiet these days . ”
25419	25440	25441	25441	Harry	177	“ And they still have n’t called a hearing about all the underage magic I used escaping the Death Eaters ? ”
25455	25478	25441	25441	Harry	177	“ Because they know I had no choice or because they do n’t want me to tell the world Voldemort attacked me ? ”
25479	25514	25441	25441	Harry	177	“ The latter , I think . Scrimgeour does n’t want to admit that You - Know - Who is as powerful as he is , nor that Azkaban ’s seen a mass breakout . ”
25515	25525	25527	25527	Harry	177	“ Yeah , why tell the public the truth ? ”
25559	25573	25575	25575	Ron	227	“ Is n’t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him ? ”
25578	25589	25590	25591	Mr. Weasley	212	“ Of course , Ron , but people are terrified , ”
25594	25663	25590	25591	Mr. Weasley	212	“ terrified that they will be next to disappear , their children the next to be attacked ! There are nasty rumors going around ; I for one do n’t believe the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts resigned . She has n’t been seen for weeks now . Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day ; I just hope he ’s working on a plan . ”
25685	25699	25701	25701	Fleur	232	“ We must decide ’ ow you will be disguised , ’ Arry , ”
25708	25713	25714	25714	she	232	“ For ze wedding , ”
25722	25754	25714	25714	she	232	“ Of course , none of our guests are Death Eaters , but we can not guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey ’ ave ’ ad champagne . ”
25766	25772	25774	25775	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Yes , good point , ”
25813	25826	25802	25802	she	232	“ Now , Ron , have you cleaned out your room yet ? ”
25827	25830	25832	25832	Ron	227	“ Why ? ”
25844	25867	25832	25832	Ron	227	“ Why does my room have to be cleaned out ? Harry and I are fine with it the way it is ! ”
25868	25887	25802	25802	she	232	“ We are holding your brother ’s wedding here in a few days ’ time , young man — ”
25888	25898	25900	25900	Ron	227	“ And are they getting married in my bedroom ? ”
25903	25917	25900	25900	Ron	227	“ No ! So why in the name of Merlin ’s saggy left — ”
25918	25928	25930	25931	Mr. Weasley	212	“ Do n’t talk to your mother like that , ”
25934	25942	25930	25931	Mr. Weasley	212	“ And do as you ’re told . ”
25966	25978	25979	25979	Harry	177	“ I can help , some of it ’s my mess , ”
25990	26040	25984	25985	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ No , Harry , dear , I ’d much rather you helped Arthur much out the chickens , and Hermione , I ’d be ever so grateful if you ’d change the sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour ; you know they ’re arriving at eleven tomorrow morning . ”
26057	26071	26072	26073	Mr. Weasley	212	“ There ’s no need to , er , mention it to Molly , ”
26084	26181	26072	26073	Mr. Weasley	212	“ but , er , Ted sent me most of what was left of Sirius ’s bike and , er , I ’m hiding — that ’s to say , keeping — it in here . Fantastic stuff ! There ’s an exhaust gaskin , as I believe it ’s called , the most magnificent battery , and it ’ll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work . I ’m going to try and put it all back together again when Molly ’s not — I mean , when I ’ve got time . ”
26207	26224	26226	26226	Ron	227	“ I ’m doing it , I ’m doing — ! Oh , it ’s you , ”
26306	26311	26312	26312	she	197	“ Hi , Harry , ”
26324	26334	26312	26312	she	197	“ And how did you manage to get away ? ”
26335	26354	26358	26358	She	197	“ Oh , Ron ’s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday , ”
26379	26389	26390	26390	Ron	227	“ We were just talking about Mad - Eye , ”
26394	26402	26390	26390	Ron	227	“ I reckon he might have survived . ”
26403	26414	26416	26416	Harry	177	“ But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse , ”
26418	26428	26430	26430	Ron	227	“ Yeah , but Bill was under attack too , ”
26432	26442	26430	26430	Ron	227	“ How can he be sure what he saw ? ”
26443	26461	26463	26463	Hermione	197	“ Even if the Killing Curse missed , Mad - Eye still fell about a thousand feet , ”
26477	26486	26430	26430	Ron	227	“ He could have used a Shield Charm — ”
26487	26499	26501	26501	Harry	177	“ Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand , ”
26503	26517	26519	26519	Ron	227	“ Well , all right , if you want him to be dead , ”
26531	26543	26545	26545	Hermione	197	“ Of course we do n’t want him to be dead ! ”
26550	26565	26545	26545	Hermione	197	“ It ’s dreadful that he ’s dead ! But we ’re being realistic ! ”
26611	26630	26632	26632	Ron	227	“ The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves , that ’s why no one ’s found him , ”
26635	26638	26640	26640	Harry	177	“ Yeah , ”
26642	26667	26640	26640	Harry	177	“ Like Barty Crouch , turned into a bone and buried in Hagrid ’s front garden . They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed him — ”
26668	26672	26674	26674	Hermione	197	“ Do n’t ! ”
26698	26702	26704	26704	Harry	177	“ Oh no , ”
26716	26726	26704	26704	Harry	177	“ Hermione , I was n’t trying to upset — ”
26790	26793	26781	26781	he	227	“ Tergeo . ”
26818	26829	26830	26830	She	197	“ Oh … thanks , Ron … I ’m sorry … ”
26837	26876	26832	26832	her	197	“ It ’s just so awf - ful , is n’t it ? R - right after Dumbledore … I j - just n - never imagined Mad - Eye dying , somehow , he seemed so tough ! ”
26877	26883	26885	26885	Ron	227	“ Yeah , I know , ”
26892	26907	26885	26885	Ron	227	“ But you know what he ’d say to us if he was here ? ”
26908	26916	26918	26918	Hermione	197	“ ‘ C - constant vigilance , ’ ”
26924	26929	26931	26931	Ron	227	“ That ’s right , ”
26935	26964	26931	26931	Ron	227	“ He ’d tell us to learn from what happened to him . And what I ’ve learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit , Mundungus . ”
27024	27033	27034	27034	Hermione	197	“ I ’m sorry , I ’m sorry ! ”
27050	27061	27062	27062	Ron	227	“ What are you doing with all those books anyway ? ”
27071	27083	27085	27085	Hermione	197	“ Just trying to decide which ones to take with us , ”
27087	27096	27085	27085	Hermione	197	“ When we ’re looking for the Horcruxes . ”
27097	27103	27105	27105	Ron	227	“ Oh , of course , ”
27114	27128	27105	27105	Ron	227	“ I forgot we ’ll be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library . ”
27129	27133	27135	27135	Hermione	197	“ Ha ha , ”
27144	27171	27135	27135	Hermione	197	“ I wonder … will we need to translate runes ? It ’s possible … I think we ’d better take it , to be safe . ”
27191	27194	27196	27196	Harry	177	“ Listen , ”
27218	27235	27236	27236	Harry	177	“ I know you said after Dumbledore ’s funeral that you wanted to come with me , ”
27239	27244	27245	27245	Ron	227	“ Here he goes , ”
27254	27261	27262	27262	she	197	“ As we knew he would , ”
27271	27310	27262	27262	she	197	“ You know , I think I will take Hogwarts , A History . Even if we ’re not going back there , I do n’t think I ’d feel right if I did n’t have it with — ”
27311	27314	27316	27316	Harry	177	“ Listen ! ”
27319	27327	27329	27329	Hermione	197	“ No , Harry , you listen , ”
27331	27348	27329	27329	Hermione	197	“ We ’re coming with you . That was decided months ago — years , really . ”
27349	27352	27384	27384	Hermione	197	“ But — ”
27353	27357	27358	27358	Ron	227	“ Shut up , ”
27362	27373	27374	27374	Harry	177	“ — are you sure you ’ve thought this through ? ”
27377	27382	27384	27384	Hermione	197	“ Let ’s see , ”
27462	27475	27417	27417	his	227	“ I — Hermione , I ’m sorry — I did n’t — ”
27476	27510	27549	27549	Ron	227	“ Did n’t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you ? Well , we do . Ron , show Harry what you ’ve done . ”
27511	27519	27521	27521	Ron	227	“ Nah , he ’s just eaten , ”
27523	27532	27549	27549	Ron	227	“ Go on , he needs to know ! ”
27533	27544	27549	27549	Ron	227	“ Oh , all right . Harry , come here . ”
27563	27567	27549	27549	Ron	227	“ C’m on . ”
27568	27571	27572	27572	Harry	177	“ Why ? ”
27586	27589	27591	27591	Ron	227	“ Descendo , ”
27644	27654	27656	27656	Harry	177	“ That ’s your ghoul , is n’t it ? ”
27672	27678	27680	27680	Ron	227	“ Yeah , it is , ”
27686	27695	27680	27680	Ron	227	“ Come and have a look at him . ”
27745	27758	27739	27739	its	1125	“ But it … it looks … do ghouls normally wear pajamas ? ”
27759	27762	27764	27764	Ron	227	“ No , ”
27766	27780	27764	27764	Ron	227	“ Nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustules . ”
27847	27854	27856	27856	Ron	227	“ He ’s me , see ? ”
27858	27861	27863	27863	Harry	177	“ No , ”
27865	27870	27863	27863	Harry	177	“ I do n’t . ”
27871	27888	27890	27890	Ron	227	“ I ’ll explain it back in my room , the smell ’s getting to me , ”
27916	27936	27938	27938	Ron	227	“ Once we ’ve left , the ghoul ’s going to come and live down here in my room , ”
27940	27994	27938	27938	Ron	227	“ I think he ’s really looking forward to it — well , it ’s hard to tell , because all he can do is moan and drool — but he nods a lot when you mention it . Anyway , he ’s going to be me with spattergroit . Good , eh ? ”
28001	28005	28007	28007	Ron	227	“ It is ! ”
28022	28074	28007	28007	Ron	227	“ Look , when we three do n’t turn up at Hogwarts again , everyone ’s going to think Hermione and I must be with you , right ? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for our families to see if they ’ve got information on where you are . ”
28075	28107	28109	28109	Hermione	197	“ But hopefully it ’ll look like I ’ve gone away with Mum and Dad ; a lot of Muggle - borns are talking about going into hiding at the moment , ”
28111	28134	28136	28136	Ron	227	“ We ca n’t hide my whole family , it ’ll look too fishy and they ca n’t all leave their jobs , ”
28138	28150	28152	28152	Harry	177	“ And your mum and dad are in on this plan ? ”
28154	28191	28205	28205	Hermione	197	“ Dad is . He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul . Mum … well , you ’ve seen what she ’s like . She wo n’t accept we ’re going till we ’re gone . ”
28314	28329	28331	28331	Ron	227	“ Ginny ’s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring , ”
28333	28349	28331	28331	Ron	227	“ I dunno why the Delacours have got to come two days before the wedding . ”
28350	28378	28383	28383	she	197	“ Fleur ’s sister ’s a bridesmaid , she needs to be here for the rehearsal , and she ’s too young to come on her own , ”
28392	28406	28408	28408	Ron	227	“ Well , guests are n’t going to help Mum ’s stress levels , ”
28410	28418	28420	28420	Hermione	197	“ What we really need to decide , ”
28444	28489	28420	28420	Hermione	197	“ is where we ’re going after we leave here . I know you said you wanted to go to Godric ’s Hollow first , Harry , and I understand why , but … well … should n’t we make the Horcruxes our priority ? ”
28490	28507	28509	28509	Harry	177	“ If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were , I ’d agree with you , ”
28600	28620	28621	28621	Hermione	197	“ Do n’t you think there ’s a possibility that Voldemort ’s keeping a watch on Godric ’s Hollow ? ”
28624	28648	28621	28621	Hermione	197	“ He might expect you to go back and visit your parents ’ graves once you ’re free to go wherever you like ? ”
28676	28683	28684	28684	he	227	“ This R. A. B. person , ”
28687	28699	28684	28684	he	227	“ You know , the one who stole the real locket ? ”
28703	28720	28700	28700	Hermione	197	“ He said in his note he was going to destroy it , did n’t he ? ”
28744	28764	28765	28765	Harry	177	“ ‘ I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can . ’ ”
28769	28780	28782	28782	Ron	227	“ Well , what if he did finish it off ? ”
28784	28788	28790	28790	Hermione	197	“ Or she , ”
28792	28795	28797	28797	Ron	227	“ Whichever , ”
28799	28810	28797	28797	Ron	227	“ it ’d be one less for us to do ! ”
28811	28833	28835	28835	Hermione	197	“ Yes , but we ’re still going to have to try and trace the real locket , are n’t we ? ”
28837	28848	28835	28835	Hermione	197	“ to find out whether or not it ’s destroyed . ”
28849	28865	28867	28867	Ron	227	“ And once we get hold of it , how do you destroy a Horcrux ? ”
28869	28872	28874	28874	Hermione	197	“ Well , ”
28876	28883	28874	28874	Hermione	197	“ I ’ve been researching that . ”
28884	28887	28889	28889	Harry	177	“ How ? ”
28891	28906	28889	28889	Harry	177	“ I did n’t think there were any books on Horcruxes in the library ? ”
28907	28912	28914	28914	Hermione	197	“ There were n’t , ”
28921	28936	28914	28914	Hermione	197	“ Dumbledore removed them all , but he — he did n’t destroy them . ”
28946	28967	28889	28889	Harry	177	“ How in the name of Merlin ’s pants have you managed to get your hands on those Horcrux books ? ”
28968	28976	28978	28978	Hermione	197	“ It — it was n’t stealing ! ”
28991	29034	28978	28978	Hermione	197	“ They were still library books , even if Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves . Anyway , if he really did n’t want anyone to get at them , I ’m sure he would have made it much harder to — ”
29035	29041	29043	29043	Ron	227	“ Get to the point ! ”
29045	29052	29054	29054	Hermione	197	“ Well … it was easy , ”
29060	29090	29054	29054	Hermione	197	“ I just did a Summoning Charm . You know — Accio . And — they zoomed out of Dumbledore ’s study window right into the girls ’ dormitory . ”
29091	29099	29100	29100	Harry	177	“ But when did you do this ? ”
29113	29122	29124	29124	Hermione	197	“ Just after his — Dumbledore’s — funeral , ”
29138	29169	29131	29131	She	197	“ I ca n’t believe Dumbledore would have been angry , it ’s not as though we ’re going to use the information to make a Horcrux , is it ? ”
29170	29177	29179	29179	Ron	227	“ Can you hear us complaining ? ”
29181	29188	29179	29179	Ron	227	“ Where are these books anyway ? ”
29228	29297	29210	29210	She	197	“ This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux . Secrets of the Darkest Art — it ’s a horrible book , really awful , full of evil magic . I wonder when Dumbledore removed it from the library … if he did n’t do it until he was headmaster , I bet Voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here . ”
29298	29321	29323	29323	Ron	227	“ Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux , then , if he ’d already read that ? ”
29325	29344	29346	29346	Harry	177	“ He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven , ”
29348	29388	29346	29346	Harry	177	“ Dumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to make a Horcrux by the time he asked Slughorn about them . I think you ’re right , Hermione , that could easily have been where he got the information . ”
29389	29399	29401	29401	Hermione	197	“ And the more I ’ve read about them , ”
29403	29449	29401	29401	Hermione	197	“ the more horrible they seem , and the less I can believe that he actually made six . It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it , and that ’s just by making one Horcrux ! ”
29460	29464	29453	29453	Dumbledore	207	“ usual evil . ”
29465	29477	29478	29478	Ron	227	“ Is n’t there any way of putting yourself back together ? ”
29481	29484	29486	29486	Hermione	197	“ Yes , ”
29492	29500	29486	29486	Hermione	197	“ but it would be excruciatingly painful . ”
29501	29510	29512	29512	Harry	177	“ Why ? How do you do it ? ”
29514	29517	29519	29519	Hermione	197	“ Remorse , ”
29521	29559	29519	29519	Hermione	197	“ You ’ve got to really feel what you ’ve done . There ’s a footnote . Apparently the pain of it can destroy you . I ca n’t see Voldemort attempting it somehow , can you ? ”
29560	29563	29565	29565	Ron	227	“ No , ”
29572	29585	29565	29565	Ron	227	“ So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book ? ”
29586	29589	29591	29591	Hermione	197	“ Yes , ”
29604	29648	29591	29591	Hermione	197	“ because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them . From all that I ’ve read , what Harry did to Riddle ’s diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux . ”
29649	29659	29661	29661	Harry	177	“ What , stabbing it with a basilisk fang ? ”
29663	29681	29683	29683	Ron	227	“ Oh well , lucky we ’ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs , then , ”
29685	29698	29683	29683	Ron	227	“ I was wondering what we were going to do with them . ”
29699	29710	29712	29712	Hermione	197	“ It does n’t have to be a basilisk fang , ”
29715	29744	29712	29712	Hermione	197	“ It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux ca n’t repair itself . Basilisk venom only has one antidote , and it ’s incredibly rare — ”
29745	29750	29752	29752	Harry	177	“ — phoenix tears , ”
29756	29759	29761	29761	Hermione	197	“ Exactly , ”
29763	29829	29761	29761	Hermione	197	“ Our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom , and they ’re all dangerous to carry around with you . That ’s a problem we ’re going to have to solve , though , because ripping , smashing , or crushing a Horcrux wo n’t do the trick . You ’ve got to put it beyond magical repair . ”
29830	29842	29844	29844	Ron	227	“ But even if we wreck the thing it lives in , ”
29846	29864	29844	29844	Ron	227	“ why ca n’t the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else ? ”
29865	29878	29761	29761	Hermione	197	“ Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being . ”
29892	29922	29888	29888	Hermione	197	“ Look , if I picked up a sword right now , Ron , and ran you through with it , I would n’t damage your soul at all . ”
29923	29937	29939	29939	Ron	227	“ Which would be a real comfort to me , I ’m sure , ”
29944	29969	29971	29971	Hermione	197	“ It should be , actually ! But my point is that whatever happens to your body , your soul will survive , untouched , ”
29973	30010	29971	29971	Hermione	197	“ But it ’s the other way round with a Horcrux . The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container , its enchanted body , for survival . It ca n’t exist without it . ”
30011	30022	30024	30024	Harry	177	“ That diary sort of died when I stabbed it , ”
30050	30096	29971	29971	Hermione	197	“ And once the diary was properly destroyed , the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist . Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did , flushing it away , but obviously it came back good as new . ”
30097	30101	30103	30103	Ron	227	“ Hang on , ”
30107	30130	30103	30103	Ron	227	“ The bit of soul in that diary was possessing Ginny , was n’t it ? How does that work , then ? ”
30131	30181	30182	30182	she	197	“ While the magical container is still intact , the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object . I do n’t mean holding it for too long , it ’s nothing to do with touching it , ”
30189	30226	30182	30182	she	197	“ I mean close emotionally . Ginny poured her heart out into that diary , she made herself incredibly vulnerable . You ’re in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux . ”
30227	30236	30238	30238	Harry	177	“ I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring ? ”
30240	30252	30238	30238	Harry	177	“ Why did n’t I ask him ? I never really … ”
30397	30410	30411	30411	she	253	“ I ’m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering , ”
30418	30454	30411	30411	she	253	“ I ’m sure you all need your rest … but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I was under the impression that you had agreed to help . ”
30455	30459	30466	30466	she	197	“ Oh yes , ”
30479	30487	30466	30466	she	197	“ we will … we ’re sorry … ”
30507	30517	30519	30519	Ron	227	“ It ’s like being a house - elf , ”
30534	30554	30519	30519	Ron	227	“ Except without the job satisfaction . The sooner this wedding ’s over , the happier I ’ll be . ”
30555	30558	30560	30560	Harry	177	“ Yeah , ”
30562	30585	30560	30560	Harry	177	“ then we ’ll have nothing to do except find Horcruxes … It ’ll be like a holiday , wo n’t it ? ”
30930	30933	30935	30935	Fleur	232	“ Maman ! ”
30943	30946	30935	30935	Fleur	232	“ Papa ! ”
31005	31014	31015	31015	he	299	“ You ’ ave been so much trouble , ”
31022	31035	31015	31015	he	299	“ Fleur tells us you ’ ave been working very ’ ard . ”
31036	31046	31048	31049	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Oh , it ’s been nothing , nothing ! ”
31051	31057	31048	31049	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ No trouble at all ! ”
31082	31086	31088	31089	Monsieur Delacour	299	“ Dear lady ! ”
31106	31128	31088	31089	Monsieur Delacour	299	“ We are most honored at the approaching union of our two families ! Let me present my wife , Apolline . ”
31141	31144	31145	31145	she	282	“ Enchante , ”
31148	31161	31145	31145	she	282	“ Your ’ usband ’ as been telling us such amusing stories ! ”
31195	31211	31213	31214	Monsieur Delacour	299	“ And , of course , you ’ ave met my leetle daughter , Gabrielle ! ”
31265	31273	31275	31276	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Well , come in , do ! ”
31290	31293	31280	31280	she	253	“ No , please!”s
31295	31297	31280	31280	she	253	“ After you!”s
31299	31302	31280	31280	she	253	“ Not at all!”s
31346	31349	31333	31334	Monsieur Delacour	299	“ Charmant ! ”
31496	31506	31508	31508	Ron	227	“ But she still wo n’t leave us alone ! ”
31538	31549	31550	31550	she	253	“ Oh , good , you ’ve fed the chickens , ”
31557	31580	31581	31581	she	253	“ We ’d better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow … to put up the tent for the wedding , ”
31595	31600	31602	31602	Harry	177	“ I ’m sorry , ”
31605	31615	31617	31618	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Oh , do n’t be silly , dear ! ”
31622	31667	31617	31618	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ I did n’t mean — well , your safety ’s much more important ! Actually , I ’ve been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday , Harry . Seventeen , after all , it ’s an important day … ”
31668	31676	31678	31678	Harry	177	“ I do n’t want a fuss , ”
31692	31714	31678	31678	Harry	177	“ Really , Mrs. Weasley , just a normal dinner would be fine … It ’s the day before the wedding … ”
31715	31742	31617	31618	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Oh , well , if you ’re sure , dear . I ’ll invite Remus and Tonks , shall I ? And how about Hagrid ? ”
31743	31749	31751	31751	Harry	177	“ That ’d be great , ”
31753	31765	31751	31751	Harry	177	“ But please , do n’t go to loads of trouble . ”
31766	31780	31781	31781	She	1175	“ Not at all , not at all … It ’s no trouble … ”
31915	31921	31901	31906	the man who held the answer	1180	“ Oi , wake up . ”
31975	31983	32039	32039	Harry	177	“ You were muttering in your sleep . ”
31984	31988	32039	32039	Harry	177	“ Was I ? ”
31989	32003	32039	32039	Harry	177	“ Yeah . ‘ Gregorovitch . ’ You kept saying ‘ Gregorovitch . ’ ”
32018	32023	32039	32039	Harry	177	“ Who ’s Gregorovitch ? ”
32024	32038	32039	32039	Harry	177	“ I dunno , do I ? You were the one saying it . ”
32065	32074	32039	32039	Harry	177	“ I think Voldemort ’s looking for him . ”
32075	32079	32081	32081	Ron	227	“ Poor bloke , ”
32132	32139	32182	32182	Ron	227	“ I think he ’s abroad . ”
32140	32145	32182	32182	Ron	227	“ Who , Gregorovitch ? ”
32146	32169	32182	32182	Ron	227	“ Voldemort . I think he ’s somewhere abroad , looking for Gregorovitch . It did n’t look like anywhere in Britain . ”
32170	32181	32182	32182	Ron	227	“ You reckon you were seeing into his mind again ? ”
32186	32197	32199	32199	Harry	177	“ Do me a favor and do n’t tell Hermione , ”
32201	32215	32199	32199	Harry	177	“ Although how she expects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep … ”
32231	32233	32182	32182	Ron	227	“ Gregorovitch ”
32236	32240	32241	32241	he	177	“ I think , ”
32245	32272	32241	32241	he	177	“ he ’s got something to do with Quidditch . There ’s some connection , but I can’t — I ca n’t think what it is . ”
32273	32276	32278	32278	Ron	227	“ Quidditch ? ”
32280	32289	32278	32278	Ron	227	“ Sure you ’re not thinking of Gorgovitch ? ”
32290	32293	32241	32241	he	177	“ Who ? ”
32294	32323	32278	32278	Ron	227	“ Dragomir Gorgovitch , Chaser , transferred to the Chudley Cannons for a record fee two years ago . Record holder for most Quaffle drops in a season . ”
32324	32327	32329	32329	Harry	177	“ No , ”
32331	32340	32329	32329	Harry	177	“ I ’m definitely not thinking of Gorgovitch . ”
32341	32348	32350	32350	Ron	227	“ I try not to either , ”
32352	32359	32350	32350	Ron	227	“ Well , happy birthday anyway . ”
32360	32374	32329	32329	Harry	177	“ Wow — that ’s right , I forgot ! I ’m seventeen ! ”
32401	32405	32375	32375	Harry	177	“ Accio Glasses ! ”
32437	32440	32442	32442	Ron	227	“ Slick , ”
32507	32518	32519	32519	Ron	227	“ I ’d do your fly by hand , though , ”
32530	32550	32519	32519	Ron	227	“ Here ’s your present . Unwrap it up here , it ’s not for my mother ’s eyes . ”
32551	32555	32557	32557	Harry	177	“ A book ? ”
32565	32577	32557	32557	Harry	177	“ Bit of a departure from tradition , is n’t it ? ”
32578	32586	32588	32588	Ron	227	“ This is n’t your average book , ”
32590	32675	32588	32588	Ron	227	“ It ’s pure gold : Twelve Fail - Safe Ways to Charm Witches . Explains everything you need to know about girls . If only I ’d had this last year I ’d have known exactly how to get rid of Lavender and I would ’ve known how to get going with … Well , Fred and George gave me a copy , and I ’ve learned a lot . You ’d be surprised , it ’s not all about wandwork , either . ”
32714	32727	32729	32730	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth , Harry , ”
32736	32760	32729	32730	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ He had to leave early for work , but he ’ll be back for dinner . That ’s our present on top . ”
32810	32826	32828	32829	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ It ’s traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age , ”
32911	32917	32927	32927	her	197	“ Happy birthday , Harry ! ”
32937	32956	32957	32957	she	197	“ It ’s not much , but I hope you like it . What did you get him ? ”
32969	32979	32981	32981	Ron	227	“ Come on , then , open Hermione ’s ! ”
33055	33063	33064	33064	Hermione	197	“ I ’ll pack these for you , ”
33085	33110	33064	33064	Hermione	197	“ I ’m nearly done , I ’m just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash , Ron — ”
33129	33140	33143	33143	Ginny	238	“ Harry , will you come in here a moment ? ”
33303	33307	33287	33287	Ginny	238	“ Happy seventeenth . ”
33308	33313	33314	33314	She	238	“ Yeah … thanks . ”
33342	33346	33347	33347	he	177	“ Nice view , ”
33366	33376	33377	33377	she	238	“ I could n’t think what to get you , ”
33380	33390	33356	33356	She	238	“ You did n’t have to get me anything . ”
33396	33422	33391	33391	She	238	“ I did n’t know what would be useful . Nothing too big , because you would n’t be able to take it with you . ”
33473	33509	33465	33465	She	238	“ So then I thought , I ’d like you to have something to remember me by , you know , if you meet some veela when you ’re off doing whatever you ’re doing . ”
33510	33529	33465	33465	She	238	“ I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground , to be honest . ”
33530	33542	33543	33543	she	238	“ There ’s the silver lining I ’ve been looking for , ”
33620	33623	33625	33625	Ron	227	“ Oh , ”
33628	33631	33625	33625	Ron	227	“ Sorry . ”
33632	33635	33636	33636	Hermione	197	“ Ron ! ”
33663	33672	33654	33654	Ginny	238	“ Well , happy birthday anyway , Harry . ”
33807	33814	33815	33815	he	227	“ I ’ll see you later , ”
33877	33892	33872	33872	Ron	227	“ You ditched her . What are you doing now , messing her around ? ”
33893	33901	33903	33903	Harry	177	“ I ’m not messing her around , ”
33912	33915	33872	33872	Ron	227	“ Ron — ”
33926	33937	33917	33917	Ron	227	“ She was really cut up when you ended it — ”
33938	33958	33872	33872	Ron	227	“ So was I. You know why I stopped it , and it was n’t because I wanted to . ”
33959	33980	33917	33917	Ron	227	“ Yeah , but you go snogging her now and she ’s just going to get her hopes up again — ”
33981	34009	34011	34011	he	227	“ She ’s not an idiot , she knows it ca n’t happen , she ’s not expecting us to — to end up married , or — ”
34068	34079	34120	34120	he	227	“ If you keep groping her every chance you get — ”
34080	34087	34089	34089	Harry	177	“ It wo n’t happen again , ”
34108	34111	34098	34098	he	177	“ Okay ? ”
34135	34146	34120	34120	he	227	“ Right then , well , that ’s … yeah . ”
34360	34363	34365	34365	Ron	227	“ Nice , ”
34387	34400	34376	34376	Hermione	197	“ You ’ve really got an eye for that sort of thing . ”
34401	34407	34409	34409	Hermione	197	“ Thank you , Ron ! ”
34483	34494	34496	34497	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Out of the way , out of the way ! ”
34569	34577	34566	34566	Harry	177	“ That looks amazing , Mrs. Weasley . ”
34578	34587	34588	34588	she	253	“ Oh , it ’s nothing , dear , ”
34688	34694	34695	34695	she	253	“ Happy birthday , Harry , ”
34702	34707	34709	34709	Hagrid	199	“ Seventeen , eh ! ”
34723	34739	34709	34709	Hagrid	199	“ Six years ter the day since we met , Harry , d’yeh remember it ? ”
34740	34743	34745	34745	Harry	177	“ Vaguely , ”
34752	34777	34745	34745	Harry	177	“ Did n’t you smash down the front door , give Dudley a pig ’s tail , and tell me I was a wizard ? ”
34778	34785	34786	34786	Hagrid	199	“ I forge ’ the details , ”
34789	34798	34786	34786	Hagrid	199	“ All righ ’ , Ron , Hermione ? ”
34799	34804	34806	34806	Hermione	197	“ We ’re fine , ”
34808	34813	34806	34806	Hermione	197	“ How are you ? ”

35001	35004	35005	35005	Charlie	303	“ Norbert ? ”
35008	35019	35005	35005	Charlie	303	“ The Norwegian Ridgeback ? We call her Norberta now . ”
35020	35028	34939	34939	Charlie	303	“ Wha — Norbert ’s a girl ? ”
35029	35033	35035	35035	Charlie	303	“ Oh yeah , ”
35037	35043	35045	35045	Hermione	197	“ How can you tell ? ”
35047	35055	35057	35057	Charlie	303	“ They ’re a lot more vicious , ”
35069	35084	35059	35059	He	303	“ Wish Dad would hurry up and get here . Mum ’s getting edgy . ”
35108	35118	35119	35119	she	253	“ I think we ’d better start without Arthur , ”
35132	35143	35119	35119	she	253	“ He must have been held up at — oh ! ”
35192	35200	35187	35188	Mr. Weasley	212	“ Minister of Magic coming with me . ”
35223	35230	35232	35232	Lupin	189	“ We should n’t be here , ”
35236	35248	35232	35232	Lupin	189	“ Harry — I’m sorry — I’ll explain some other time — ”

35389	35394	35399	35399	he	180	“ Sorry to intrude , ”
35408	35423	35399	35399	he	180	“ Especially as I can see that I am gate - crashing a party . ”
35436	35441	35459	35459	Scrimgeour	180	“ Many happy returns . ”
35442	35445	35447	35447	Harry	177	“ Thanks , ”

35463	35472	35459	35459	Scrimgeour	180	“ Also with Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger . ”
35473	35476	35478	35478	Ron	227	“ Us ? ”
35483	35487	35478	35478	Ron	227	“ Why us ? ”
35488	35501	35503	35503	Scrimgeour	180	“ I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private , ”
35505	35512	35513	35513	he	180	“ Is there such a place ? ”
35519	35525	35527	35528	Mr. Weasley	212	“ Yes , of course , ”
35534	35549	35527	35528	Mr. Weasley	212	“ The , er , sitting room , why do n’t you use that ? ”
35550	35557	35558	35558	Scrimgeour	180	“ You can lead the way , ”
35563	35577	35558	35558	Scrimgeour	180	“ There will be no need for you to accompany us , Arthur . ”
35742	35768	35739	35739	Scrimgeour	180	“ I have some questions for the three of you , and I think it will be best if we do it individually . If you two”—he
35773	35783	35739	35739	Scrimgeour	180	Hermione—“can wait upstairs , I will start with Ronald . ”
35784	35791	35793	35793	Harry	177	“ We ’re not going anywhere , ”
35800	35813	35796	35796	Hermione	197	“ You can speak to us together , or not at all . ”
35841	35848	35849	35849	he	177	“ Very well then , together , ”
35859	35878	35854	35854	He	177	“ I am here , as I ’m sure you know , because of Albus Dumbledore ’s will . ”
35890	35908	35884	35884	Hermione	197	“ A surprise , apparently ! You were not aware then that Dumbledore had left you anything ? ”
35909	35916	35918	35918	Ron	227	“ A — all of us ? ”
35920	35926	35918	35918	Ron	227	“ Me and Hermione too ? ”
35927	35933	35884	35884	Hermione	197	“ Yes , all of — ”
35938	35960	35884	35884	Hermione	197	“ Dumbledore died over a month ago . Why has it taken this long to give us what he left us ? ”
35961	35967	35969	35969	Hermione	197	“ Is n’t it obvious ? ”
35976	35995	35996	35996	she	197	“ They wanted to examine whatever he ’s left us . You had no right to do that ! ”
36005	36011	36013	36013	Scrimgeour	180	“ I had every right , ”
36016	36035	36013	36013	Scrimgeour	180	“ The Decree for Justifiable Confiscation gives the Ministry the power the confiscate the contents of a will — ”
36036	36049	36051	36051	Hermione	197	“ That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts , ”
36053	36090	36051	36051	Hermione	197	“ and the Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased ’s possessions are illegal before seizing them ! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed ? ”
36091	36106	36108	36108	Scrimgeour	180	“ Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law , Miss Granger ? ”
36110	36117	36119	36119	Hermione	197	“ No , I ’m not , ”
36121	36133	36119	36119	Hermione	197	“ I ’m hoping to do some good in the world ! ”
36150	36174	36147	36147	Harry	177	“ So why have you decided to let us have our things now ? Ca n’t think of a pretext to keep them ? ”
36175	36189	36191	36191	Hermione	197	“ No , it ’ll be because thirty - one days are up , ”
36195	36215	36191	36191	Hermione	197	“ They ca n’t keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove they ’re dangerous . Right ? ”
36216	36228	36230	36230	Scrimgeour	180	“ Would you say you were close to Dumbledore , Ronald ? ”
36239	36253	36235	36235	Ron	227	“ Me ? Not — not really … It was always Harry who … ”
36315	36381	36303	36303	He	180	“ If you were not very close to Dumbledore , how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will ? He made exceptionally few personal bequests . The vast majority of his possessions — his private library , his magical instruments , and other personal effects — were left to Hogwarts . Why do you think you were singled out ? ”
36382	36387	36389	36389	Ron	227	“ I … dunno , ”
36391	36411	36389	36389	Ron	227	“ I … when I say we were n’t close … I mean , I think he liked me … ”
36412	36420	36422	36422	Hermione	197	“ You ’re being modest , Ron , ”
36424	36432	36422	36422	Hermione	197	“ Dumbledore was very fond of you . ”
36515	36560	36502	36502	he	180	“ ‘ The Last Will and Testament of Albus Wulfric Brian Dumbledore ’ … Yes , here we are … ‘ To Ronald Bilius Weasley , I leave my Deluminator , in the hope that he will remember me when he uses it . ’ ”
36632	36639	36641	36641	Scrimgeour	180	“ That is a valuable object , ”
36646	36673	36641	36641	Scrimgeour	180	“ It may even be unique . Certainly it is of Dumbledore ’s own design . Why would he have left you an item so rare ? ”
36682	36691	36692	36692	Scrimgeour	180	“ Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students , ”
36695	36729	36692	36692	Scrimgeour	180	“ Yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three . Why is that ? To what use did he think you would put to the Deluminator , Mr. Weasley ? ”
36730	36738	36740	36740	Ron	227	“ Put out lights , I s’pose , ”
36742	36751	36740	36740	Ron	227	“ What else could I do with it ? ”
36776	36809	36768	36768	he	180	“ ‘ To Miss Hermione Jean Granger , I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard , in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive . ’ ”
36894	36908	36910	36910	Scrimgeour	180	“ Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book , Miss Granger ? ”
36912	36921	36923	36923	Hermione	197	“ He … he knew I liked books , ”
36936	36943	36910	36910	Scrimgeour	180	“ But why that particular book ? ”
36944	36959	36923	36923	Hermione	197	“ I do n’t know . He must have thought I ’d enjoy it . ”
36960	36978	36910	36910	Scrimgeour	180	“ Did you ever discuss codes , or any means of passing secret messages , with Dumbledore ? ”
36979	36986	36992	36992	her	197	“ No , I did n’t , ”
36998	37024	36992	36992	her	197	“ And if the Ministry has n’t found any hidden codes in this book in thirty - one days , I doubt that I will . ”
37058	37065	37066	37066	he	180	“ ‘ To Harry Potter , ’ ”
37079	37107	37070	37070	Harry	177	“ ‘ I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts , as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill . ’ ”
37140	37149	37151	37151	Scrimgeour	180	“ Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch ? ”
37153	37157	37159	37159	Harry	177	“ No idea , ”
37161	37189	37159	37159	Harry	177	“ For the reasons you just read out , I suppose … to remind me what you can get if you … persevere and whatever it was . ”
37190	37201	37275	37275	Scrimgeour	180	“ You think this a mere symbolic keepsake , then ? ”
37202	37207	37209	37209	Harry	177	“ I suppose so , ”
37211	37218	37209	37209	Harry	177	“ What else could it be ? ”
37219	37226	37228	37228	Scrimgeour	180	“ I ’m asking the questions , ”
37259	37274	37275	37275	Scrimgeour	180	“ I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch , ”
37280	37285	37275	37275	Scrimgeour	180	“ Why is that ? ”
37290	37314	37315	37315	she	197	“ Oh , it ca n’t be a reference to the fact Harry ’s a great Seeker , that ’s way too obvious , ”
37318	37332	37315	37315	she	197	“ There must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the icing ! ”
37333	37346	37348	37348	Scrimgeour	180	“ I do n’t think there ’s anything hidden in the icing , ”
37350	37374	37348	37348	Scrimgeour	180	“ but a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object . You know why , I ’m sure ? ”
37403	37410	37411	37411	she	197	“ Because Snitches have flesh memories , ”
37414	37417	37419	37419	Harry	177	“ What ? ”
37432	37435	37437	37437	Scrimgeour	180	“ Correct , ”
37472	37479	37481	37481	Scrimgeour	180	“ You do n’t say anything , ”
37483	37493	37481	37481	Scrimgeour	180	“ Perhaps you already know what the Snitch contains ? ”
37494	37497	37499	37499	Harry	177	“ No , ”
37543	37547	37549	37549	Scrimgeour	180	“ Take it , ”
37642	37647	37649	37649	Harry	177	“ That was dramatic , ”
37658	37668	37670	37670	Hermione	197	“ That ’s all , then , is it ? ”
37680	37684	37686	37686	Scrimgeour	180	“ Not quite , ”
37694	37704	37686	37686	Scrimgeour	180	“ Dumbledore left you a second bequest , Potter . ”
37705	37710	37712	37712	Harry	177	“ What is it ? ”
37729	37736	37737	37737	he	180	“ The sword of Godric Gryffindor , ”
37783	37789	37790	37790	Harry	177	“ So where is it ? ”
37794	37797	37799	37799	Scrimgeour	180	“ Unfortunately , ”
37801	37829	37799	37799	Scrimgeour	180	“ that sword was not Dumbledore ’s to give away . The sword of Godric Gryffindor is an important historical artifact , and as such , belongs — ”
37830	37836	37838	37838	Hermione	197	“ It belongs to Harry ! ”
37841	37864	37838	37838	Hermione	197	“ It chose him , he was the one who found it , it came to him out of the Sorting Hat — ”
37865	37882	37884	37884	Scrimgeour	180	“ According to reliable historical sources , the sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor , ”
37886	37905	37884	37884	Scrimgeour	180	“ That does not make it the exclusive property of Mr. Potter , whatever Dumbledore may have decided . ”
37916	37923	37908	37908	his	180	“ Why do you think — ? ”
37924	37934	37936	37936	Harry	177	“ — Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword ? ”
37944	37956	37936	37936	Harry	177	“ Maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall . ”
37957	37966	37968	37968	Scrimgeour	180	“ This is not a joke , Potter ! ”
37970	38029	37968	37968	Scrimgeour	180	“ Was it because Dumbledore believed that only the sword of Godric Gryffindor could defeat the Heir of Slytherin ? Did he wish to give you that sword , Potter , because he believed , as do many , that you are the one destined to destroy He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named ? ”
38030	38034	38036	38036	Harry	177	“ Interesting theory , ”
38038	38044	38046	38046	Scrimgeour	180	“ You go too far ! ”
38091	38094	38096	38096	Ron	227	“ Oi ! ”
38110	38124	38107	38107	Harry	177	“ No ! D’you want to give him an excuse to arrest us ? ”
38125	38136	38138	38138	Scrimgeour	180	“ Remembered you ’re not at school , have you ? ”
38146	38202	38138	38138	Scrimgeour	180	“ Remembered that I am not Dumbledore , who forgave your insolence and insubordination ? You may wear that scar like a crown , Potter , but it is not up to a seventeen - year - old boy to tell me how to do my job ! It ’s time you learned some respect ! ”
38203	38211	38213	38213	Harry	177	“ It ’s time you earned it , ”
38244	38252	38254	38255	Mr. Weasley	212	“ We — we thought we heard — ”
38273	38278	38280	38281	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ — raised voices , ”
38316	38323	38324	38324	he	180	“ It — it was nothing , ”
38327	38334	38335	38335	he	180	“ I … regret your attitude , ”
38347	38372	38335	38335	he	180	“ You seem to think that the Ministry does not desire what you — what Dumbledore — desired . We ought to work together . ”
38373	38383	38385	38385	Harry	177	“ I do n’t like your methods , Minister , ”
38387	38390	38385	38385	Harry	177	“ Remember ? ”
38464	38469	38461	38461	she	253	“ He ’s gone ! ”
38470	38476	38477	38478	Mr. Weasley	212	“ What did he want ? ”
38499	38508	38510	38510	Harry	177	“ To give us what Dumbledore left us , ”
38512	38524	38510	38510	Harry	177	“ They ’ve only just released the content of his will . ”
38613	38637	38608	38609	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Harry , dear , everyone ’s awfully hungry we did n’t like to start without you … Shall I serve dinner now ? ”
38650	38653	38608	38609	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Happy Birthday ”
38702	38707	38708	38708	Harry	177	“ Meet us upstairs , ”
38726	38734	38716	38717	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ After everyone ’s gone to bed . ”
38831	38834	38835	38835	she	197	“ Muffiato , ”
38848	38858	38860	38860	Ron	227	“ Thought you did n’t approve of that spell ? ”
38862	38866	38868	38868	Hermione	197	“ Times change , ”
38870	38878	38868	38868	Hermione	197	“ Now , show us that Deluminator . ”
38907	38912	38914	38914	Hermione	197	“ The thing is , ”
38919	38931	38914	38914	Hermione	197	“ we could have achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder . ”
38958	38965	38967	38967	Ron	227	“ Still , it ’s cool , ”
38973	38985	38967	38967	Ron	227	“ And from what they said , Dumbledore invented it himself ! ”
38986	39011	38914	38914	Hermione	197	“ I know , but surely he would n’t have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights ! ”
39012	39031	39033	39033	Harry	177	“ D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything he ’d left us ? ”
39035	39038	39040	39040	Hermione	197	“ Definitely , ”
39042	39066	39040	39040	Hermione	197	“ He could n’t tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things , but that will does n’t explain … ”
39067	39083	39085	39085	Ron	227	“ … why he could n’t have given us a hint when he was alive ? ”
39087	39092	39094	39094	Hermione	197	“ Well , exactly , ”
39106	39142	39102	39104	Beedle the Bard	322	“ If these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the Ministry , you ’d think he ’d have left us know why … unless he thought it was obvious ? ”
39143	39153	39155	39155	Ron	227	“ Thought wrong , then , did n’t he ? ”
39157	39185	39155	39155	Ron	227	“ I always said he was mental . Brilliant and everything , but cracked . Leaving Harry an old Snitch — what the hell was that about ? ”
39186	39192	39194	39194	Hermione	197	“ I ’ve no idea , ”
39196	39217	39194	39194	Hermione	197	“ When Scrimgeour made you take it , Harry , I was so sure that something was going to happen ! ”
39218	39223	39225	39225	Harry	177	“ Yeah , well , ”
39239	39256	39231	39231	he	177	“ I was n’t going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour , was I ? ”
39257	39263	39265	39265	Hermione	197	“ What do you mean ? ”
39267	39279	39281	39281	Harry	177	“ The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match ? ”
39283	39289	39281	39281	Harry	177	“ Do n’t you remember ? ”
39317	39326	39314	39314	his	227	“ That was the one you nearly swallowed ! ”
39327	39330	39332	39332	Harry	177	“ Exactly , ”
39375	39388	39371	39371	Hermione	197	“ Writing ! There ’s writing on it , quick , look ! ”
39453	39469	39442	39442	He	177	“ ‘ I open at the close … ’ What ’s that supposed to mean ? ”
39480	39497	39470	39470	Hermione	197	“ I open at the close … at the close … I open at the close … ”
39524	39529	39531	39531	Ron	227	“ And the sword , ”
39551	39562	39531	39531	Ron	227	“ Why did he want Harry to have the sword ? ”
39563	39574	39575	39575	Harry	177	“ And why could n’t he just have told me ? ”
39579	39620	39575	39575	Harry	177	“ I was there , it was right there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year ! If he wanted me to have it , why did n’t he just give it to me then ? ”
39684	39691	39693	39693	Hermione	197	“ And as for this book , ”
39695	39711	39693	39693	Hermione	197	“ The Tales of Beedle the Bard … I ’ve never even heard of them ! ”
39712	39725	39727	39727	Ron	227	“ You ’ve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard ? ”
39730	39737	39727	39727	Ron	227	“ You ’re kidding , right ? ”
39738	39745	39747	39747	Hermione	197	“ No , I ’m not , ”
39751	39758	39747	39747	Hermione	197	“ Do you know them then ? ”
39759	39767	39727	39727	Ron	227	“ Well , of course I do ! ”
39799	39841	39727	39727	Ron	227	“ Oh come on ! All the old kids ’ stories are supposed to be Beedle ’s , are n’t they ? The Fountain of Fair Fortune … The Wizard and the Hopping Pot … Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump … ”
39842	39846	39848	39848	Hermione	197	“ Excuse me ? ”
39851	39858	39848	39848	Hermione	197	“ What was the last one ? ”
39859	39864	39866	39866	Ron	227	“ Come off it ! ”
39876	39885	39866	39866	Ron	227	“ You must ’ve heard of Babbitty Rabbitty — ”
39886	39902	39904	39904	Hermione	197	“ Ron , you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles ! ”
39906	39930	39904	39904	Hermione	197	“ We did n’t hear stories like that when we were little , we heard Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and Cinderella — ”
39931	39939	39941	39941	Ron	227	“ What ’s that , an illness ? ”
39943	39951	39953	39953	Hermione	197	“ So these are children ’s stories ? ”
39961	39964	39966	39966	Ron	227	“ Yeah . ”
39969	40001	39966	39966	Ron	227	“ I mean , just what you hear , you know , that all these old stories came from Beedle . I dunno what they ’re like in the original versions . ”
40002	40014	39966	39966	Ron	227	“ But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them ? ”
40019	40036	40038	40038	Ron	227	“ Probably just Charlie , now Mum ’s asleep , sneaking off to regrow his hair , ”
40041	40052	40054	40054	Hermione	197	“ All the same , we should get to bed , ”
40056	40065	40054	40054	Hermione	197	“ It would n’t do to oversleep tomorrow . ”
40066	40069	40071	40071	Ron	227	“ No , ”
40073	40099	40071	40071	Ron	227	“ A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom ’s mother might put a bit of damper on the wedding . I ’ll get the light . ”
40191	40194	40189	40189	Harry	177	“ Cousin Barny ”
40392	40398	40400	40400	Fred	228	“ When I get married , ”
40411	40449	40400	40400	Fred	228	“ I wo n’t be bothering with any of this nonsense . You can all wear what you like , and I ’ll put a full Body - Bind Curse on Mum until it ’s all over . ”
40450	40461	40463	40463	George	229	“ She was n’t too bad this morning , considering , ”
40465	40492	40463	40463	George	229	“ Cried a bit about Percy not being here , but who wants him . Oh blimey , brace yourselves , here they come , look . ”
40581	40593	40595	40595	George	229	“ Excellent , I think I see a few veela cousins , ”
40605	40621	40595	40595	George	229	“ They ’ll need help understanding our English customs , I ’ll look after them … ”
40622	40630	40632	40632	Fred	228	“ Not so fast , Your Holeyness , ”
40652	40661	40649	40649	he	228	“ Here — permetiez moi to assister vous , ”
40717	40720	40726	40726	he	177	“ Wotcher , ”
40753	40771	40772	40772	she	1300	“ Arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair . Sorry about last night , ”
40785	40809	40772	40772	she	1300	“ The Ministry ’s being very anti - werewolf at the museum and we thought our presence might not do you any favors . ”
40810	40818	40820	40820	Harry	177	“ It ’s fine , I understand , ”
41020	41024	41025	41025	he	227	“ Xenophilius Lovegood , ”
41034	41063	41064	41064	he	227	“ my daughter and I live just over the hill , so kind of the good Weasleys to invite us . But I think you know my Luna ? ”
41069	41072	41074	41074	Ron	227	“ Yes , ”
41076	41083	41074	41074	Ron	227	“ Is n’t she with you ? ”
41084	41133	41161	41161	He	227	“ She lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes , such a glorious infestation ! How few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes — or , to give them their correct name , the Gernumbli gardensi . ”
41134	41145	41147	41147	Ron	227	“ Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words , ”
41149	41160	41147	41147	Ron	227	“ but I think Fred and George taught them those . ”
41175	41180	41181	41181	she	340	“ Hello , Harry ! ”
41184	41192	41194	41194	Harry	177	“ Er — my name ’s Barny , ”
41198	41207	41208	41208	she	340	“ Oh , have you changed that too ? ”
41212	41219	41232	41232	her	340	“ How did you know — ? ”
41220	41227	41228	41228	she	340	“ Oh , just your expression , ”
41321	41334	41316	41316	her	1312	“ Daddy , look — one of the gnomes actually bit me . ”
41335	41345	41347	41348	Mr. Lovegood	342	“ How wonderful ! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial , ”
41362	41404	41347	41348	Mr. Lovegood	342	“ Luna , my love , if you should feel any burgeoning talent today — perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaims in Mermish — do not repress it ! You may have been gifted by the Gernumblies ! ”
41419	41424	41426	41426	Luna	340	“ Ron can laugh , ”
41438	41452	41429	41429	Harry	177	“ but my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic . ”
41453	41456	41458	41458	Harry	177	“ Really ? ”
41476	41493	41458	41458	Harry	177	“ Are you sure you do n’t want to put anything on that bite , though ? ”
41494	41501	41503	41503	Luna	340	“ Oh , it ’s fine , ”
41519	41554	41503	41503	Luna	340	“ You look smart . I told Daddy most people would probably wear dress robes , but he believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding , for luck , you know . ”
41597	41639	41640	41640	she	1316	“ … and your hair ’s much too long , Ronald , for a moment I thought you were Ginevra . Merlin ’s beard , what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing ? He looks like an omelet . And who are you ? ”
41645	41658	41640	41640	she	1316	“ Oh yeah , Auntie Muriel , this is our cousin Barny . ”
41659	41699	41640	41640	she	1316	“ Another Weasley ? You breed like gnomes . Is n’t Harry Potter here ? I was hoping to meet him . I thought he was a friend of yours , Ronald , or have you merely been boasting ? ”
41700	41708	41640	41640	she	1316	“ No — he could n’t come — ”
41709	41746	41747	41747	she	1318	“ Hmm . Made an excuse , did he ? Not as gormless as he looks in press photographs , then . I ’ve just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara , ”
41752	41811	41747	41747	she	1318	“ Goblin - made , you know , and been in my family for centuries . She ’s a good - looking girl , but still — French . Well , well , find me a good seat , Ronald , I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too long . ”
41865	41871	41873	41873	Ron	227	“ Nightmare , Muriel is , ”
41896	41901	41892	41892	he	227	“ You look great ! ”
41902	41909	41914	41914	she	197	“ Always the tone of surprise , ”
41939	41988	41932	41932	her	197	“ Your Great - Aunt Muriel does n’t agree , I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara . She said , ‘ Oh dear , is this the Muggle - born ? ’ and then , ‘ Bad posture and skinny ankles . ’ ”
41989	42002	42004	42004	Ron	227	“ Do n’t take it personally , she ’s rude to everyone , ”
42006	42011	42013	42013	George	229	“ Talking about Muriel ? ”
42022	42058	42013	42013	George	229	“ Yeah , she ’s just told me my ears are lopsided . Old bat . I wish old Uncle Bilius was still with us , though ; he was a right laugh at weddings . ”
42059	42077	42079	42079	Hermione	197	“ Was n’t he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty - four hours later ? ”
42081	42095	42097	42097	George	229	“ Well , yeah , he went a bit odd toward the end , ”
42099	42115	42117	42117	Fred	228	“ But before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party , ”
42119	42152	42117	42117	Fred	228	“ He used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky , then run onto the dance floor , hoist up his robes , and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his — ”
42153	42162	42164	42164	Hermione	197	“ Yes , he sounds a real charmer , ”
42172	42180	42182	42182	Ron	227	“ Never married , for some reason , ”
42184	42189	42191	42191	Hermione	197	“ You amaze me , ”
42241	42246	42225	42225	he	1325	“ You look vunderful . ”
42247	42250	42251	42251	she	197	“ Viktor ! ”
42286	42306	42283	42283	she	197	“ I did n’t know you were — goodness — it ’s lovely to see — how are you ? ”
42340	42347	42333	42333	he	349	“ How come you ’re here ? ”
42348	42353	42355	42355	Krum	349	“ Fleur invited me , ”
42394	42404	42406	42406	Krum	349	“ Your friend is not pleased to see me , ”
42416	42423	42424	42424	he	349	“ Or is he a relative ? ”
42436	42439	42440	42440	Harry	177	“ Cousin , ”
42503	42509	42510	42510	Fred	228	“ Time to sit down , ”
42514	42527	42510	42510	Fred	228	“ or we ’re going to get run over by the bride . ”
42566	42578	42561	42561	he	349	“ Did you see he ’s grown a stupid little beard ? ”
42701	42704	42711	42711	her	197	“ Ooooh ! ”
42822	42827	42803	42803	Fleur	232	“ Ladies and gentlemen , ”
42867	42882	42865	42865	Fleur	232	“ We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls … ”
42883	42895	42897	42898	Auntie Muriel	266	“ Yes , my tiara set off the whole thing nicely , ”
42905	42920	42897	42898	Auntie Muriel	266	“ But I must say , Ginevra ’s dress is far too low cut . ”
43008	43020	42983	42983	he	177	“ Do you , William Arthur , take Fleur Isabelle … ? ”
43080	43090	43072	43072	her	197	“ … then I declare you bonded for life . ”
43163	43168	43170	43174	the tufty - haired wizard	1355	“ Ladies and gentlemen ! ”
43176	43184	43170	43174	the tufty - haired wizard	1355	“ If you would please stand up ! ”
43302	43305	43307	43307	Ron	227	“ Smooth , ”
43339	43347	43349	43349	Hermione	197	“ We should go and congratulate them ! ”
43372	43379	43381	43381	Ron	227	“ We ’ll have time later , ”
43396	43415	43381	43381	Ron	227	“ Hermione , cop hold , let ’s grab a table … Not there ! Nowhere near Muriel — ”
43477	43485	43487	43487	Ron	227	“ All right if we join you ? ”
43489	43493	43494	43494	she	340	“ Oh yes , ”
43498	43511	43494	43494	she	340	“ Daddy ’s just gone to give Bill and Fleur our present . ”
43512	43524	43526	43526	Ron	227	“ What is it , a lifetime ’s supply of Gurdyroots ? ”
43602	43608	43610	43610	Luna	340	“ I like this song , ”
43652	43661	43663	43663	Ron	227	“ She ’s great , is n’t she ? ”
43666	43671	43663	43663	Ron	227	“ Always good value . ”
43716	43725	43713	43713	he	349	“ Who is that man in the yellow ? ”
43726	43742	43744	43744	Ron	227	“ That ’s Xenophilius Lovegood , he ’s the father of a friend of ours , ”
43765	43770	43771	43771	he	349	“ Come and dance , ”
43802	43810	43812	43812	Krum	349	“ Ah , they are together now ? ”
43817	43823	43825	43825	Harry	177	“ Er — sort of , ”
43827	43832	43833	43833	Krum	349	“ Who are you ? ”
43836	43840	43880	43880	Xenophilius	339	“ Barny Weasley . ”
43845	43857	43841	43841	They	1374	“ You , Barny — you know this man Lovegood well ? ”
43858	43869	43880	43880	Xenophilius	339	“ No , I only met him today . Why ? ”
43897	43900	43902	43902	Krum	349	“ Because , ”
43904	43932	43902	43902	Krum	349	“ If he vus not a guest of Fleur ’s I vould dud him , here and now , for veering that filthy sign upon his chest . ”
43933	43936	43938	43938	Harry	177	“ Sign ? ”
43956	43965	44002	44002	he	349	“ Why ? What ’s wrong with it ? ”
43966	43975	44002	44002	he	349	“ Grindelvald . That is Grindelvald ’s sign . ”
43976	43985	44002	44002	he	349	“ Grindelwald … the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated ? ”
43986	43989	44002	44002	he	349	“ Exactly . ”
44005	44044	44002	44002	he	349	“ Grindelvald killed many people , my grandfather , for instance . Of course , he vos never powerful in this country , they said he feared Dumbledore — and rightly , seeing how he vos finished . But this”—he
44097	44111	44053	44053	his	349	“ Are you — er — quite sure it ’s Grindelwald ’s — ? ”
44112	44118	44120	44120	Krum	349	“ I am not mistaken , ”
44123	44138	44120	44120	Krum	349	“ I walked past that sign for several years , I know it vell . ”
44139	44147	44149	44149	Harry	177	“ Well , there ’s a chance , ”
44151	44197	44149	44149	Harry	177	“ that Xenophilius does n’t actually know what the symbol means , the Lovegoods are quite … unusual . He could have easily picked it up somewhere and think it ’s a cross section of the head of a Crumple - Horned Snorkack or something . ”
44198	44206	44234	44234	he	177	“ The cross section of a vot ? ”
44207	44231	44149	44149	Harry	177	“ Well , I do n’t know what they are , but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for them … ”
44246	44251	44252	44252	he	177	“ That ’s her , ”
44279	44286	44288	44288	Krum	349	“ Vy is she doing that ? ”
44290	44300	44302	44302	Harry	177	“ Probably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt , ”
44348	44351	44353	44353	Harry	177	“ Gregorovitch ! ”
44395	44400	44402	44402	Krum	349	“ Vot about him ? ”
44405	44411	44436	44436	Krum	349	“ He ’s a wandmaker ! ”
44412	44417	44419	44419	Krum	349	“ I know that , ”
44421	44435	44436	44436	Krum	349	“ He made your wand ! That ’s why I thought — Quidditch — ”
44444	44454	44436	44436	Krum	349	“ How do you know Gregorovitch made my vand ? ”
44455	44466	44468	44468	Harry	177	“ I … I read it somewhere , I think , ”
44470	44478	44479	44479	he	177	“ In a — a fan magazine , ”
44487	44500	44501	44501	he	177	“ I had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans , ”
44504	44515	44436	44436	Krum	349	“ So … er … where is Gregorovitch these days ? ”
44520	44560	44516	44516	Krum	349	“ He retired several years ago . I was one of the last to purchase a Gregorovitch vand . They are the best — although I know , of course , that your Britons set much store by Ollivander . ”
44670	44679	44680	44680	Krum	349	“ This girl is very nice - looking , ”
44701	44710	44689	44689	Krum	349	“ She is also a relative of yours ? ”
44711	44714	44716	44716	Harry	177	“ Yeah , ”
44721	44742	44716	44716	Harry	177	“ and she ’s seeing someone . Jealous type . Big bloke . You would n’t want to cross him . ”
44746	44749	44750	44750	he	349	“ Vot , ”
44763	44783	44750	44750	he	349	“ is the point of being an international Quidditch player if all the good - looking girls are taken ? ”
45000	45004	45011	45012	the crowd	1291	“ Odo the Hero ”
45106	45112	45102	45102	Harry	177	“ May I sit down ? ”
45113	45120	45122	45122	Doge	358	“ Of course , of course , ”
45139	45148	45135	45135	Harry	177	“ Mr. Doge , I ’m Harry Potter . ”
45152	45174	45149	45149	Doge	359	“ My dear boy ! Arthur told me you were here , disguised … I am so glad , so honored ! ”
45189	45197	45198	45198	he	359	“ I thought of writing to you , ”
45201	45216	45198	45198	he	359	“ after Dumbledore … the shock … and for you , I am sure … ”
45226	45238	45240	45240	Harry	177	“ I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet , ”
45242	45254	45240	45240	Harry	177	“ I did n’t realize you knew Professor Dumbledore so well . ”
45255	45261	45263	45263	Doge	359	“ As well as anyone , ”
45272	45297	45263	45263	Doge	359	“ Certainly I knew him longest , if you do n’t count Aberforth — and somehow , people never do seem to count Aberforth . ”
45298	45317	45240	45240	Harry	177	“ Speaking of the Daily Prophet … I do n’t know whether you saw , Mr. Doge — ? ”
45318	45329	45263	45263	Doge	359	“ Oh , please call me Elphias , dear boy . ”
45330	45348	45240	45240	Harry	177	“ Elphias , I do n’t know whether you saw the interview Rita Skeeter gave about Dumbledore ? ”
45357	45420	45263	45263	Doge	359	“ Oh yes , Harry , I saw it . That woman , or vulture might be a more accurate term , positively pestered me to talk to her , I am ashamed to say that I became rather rude , called her an interfering trout , which resulted , as you my have seen , in aspersions cast upon my sanity . ”
45421	45428	45429	45429	Harry	177	“ Well , in that interview , ”
45433	45451	45429	45429	Harry	177	“ Rita Skeeter hinted that Professor Dumbledore was involved in the Dark Arts when he was young . ”
45452	45461	45463	45463	Doge	358	“ Do n’t believe a word of it ! ”
45467	45483	45463	45463	Doge	358	“ Not a word , Harry ! Let nothing tarnish your memories of Albus Dumbledore ! ”
45551	45560	45544	45544	he	1398	“ Harry , Rita Skeeter is a dreadful — ”
45570	45584	45562	45562	he	1398	“ Rita Skeeter ? Oh , I love her , always read her ! ”
45612	45624	45592	45593	Auntie Muriel	266	“ She ’s written a book about Dumbledore , you know ! ”
45625	45630	45632	45632	Doge	358	“ Hello , Muriel , ”
45634	45642	45632	45632	Doge	358	“ Yes , we were just discussing — ”
45643	45659	45592	45593	Auntie Muriel	266	“ You there ! Give me your chair , I ’m a hundred and seven ! ”
45692	45703	45704	45704	she	266	“ Hello again , Barry or whatever your name is , ”
45709	45752	45704	45704	she	266	“ Now what were you saying about Rita Skeeter , Elphias ? You know , she ’s written a biography of Dumbledore ? I ca n’t wait to read it . I must remember to place an order at Flourish and Blotts ! ”
45792	45827	45779	45779	She	266	“ There ’s no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs ! Before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh , there were some mighty funny rumors about Albus ! ”
45828	45834	45836	45836	Doge	358	“ Ill - informed sniping , ”
45844	45852	45854	45855	Auntie Muriel	266	“ You would say that , Elphias , ”
45857	45873	45854	45855	Auntie Muriel	266	“ I noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours ! ”
45874	45882	45884	45884	Doge	358	“ I ’m sorry you think so , ”
45890	45901	45884	45884	Doge	358	“ I assure you I was writing from the heart . ”
45902	45937	45854	45855	Auntie Muriel	266	“ Oh , we all know you worshipped Dumbledore ; I daresay you ’ll still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his Squib sister ! ”
45938	45941	45943	45943	Doge	358	“ Muriel ! ”
45963	45969	45970	45970	he	177	“ What do you mean ? ”
45974	45989	45970	45970	he	177	“ Who said his sister was a Squib ? I thought she was ill ? ”
45990	46002	46004	46005	Auntie Muriel	266	“ Thought wrong , then , did n’t you , Barry ! ”
46016	46019	46021	46021	Doge	358	“ Untrue ! ”
46023	46027	46021	46021	Doge	358	“ Absolutely untrue ! ”
46028	46039	46041	46041	Harry	177	“ He never told me his sister was a Squib , ”
46050	46060	46062	46062	Muriel	266	“ And why on earth would he tell you ? ”
46078	46087	46089	46089	Elphias	358	“ The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana , ”
46097	46116	46089	46089	Elphias	358	“ is , I should have thought , quite clear . He was so devastated by her death — ”
46117	46127	46129	46129	Muriel	266	“ Why did nobody ever see her , Elphias ? ”
46131	46189	46129	46129	Muriel	266	“ Why did half of us never even know she existed , until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her ? Where was saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar ? Off being brilliant at Hogwarts , and never mind what was going on in his own house ! ”
46190	46200	46202	46202	Harry	177	“ What d’you mean , locked in the cellar ? ”
46204	46209	46202	46202	Harry	177	“ What is this ? ”
46222	46245	46129	46129	Muriel	266	“ Dumbledore ’s mother was a terrifying woman , simply terrifying . Muggle - born , though I heard she pretended otherwise — ”
46246	46261	46263	46263	Doge	358	“ She never pretended anything of the sort ! Kendra was a fine woman , ”
46272	46293	46267	46268	Auntie Muriel	266	“ — proud and very domineering , the sort of witch who would have been mortified to produce a Squib — ”
46294	46301	46303	46303	Doge	358	“ Ariana was not a Squib ! ”
46305	46323	46325	46326	Auntie Muriel	266	“ So you say , Elphias , but explain , then , why she never attended Hogwarts ! ”
46334	46368	46328	46328	She	266	“ In our day , Squibs were often hushed up , thought to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she did n’t exist — ”
46369	46380	46382	46382	Doge	358	“ I tell you , that ’s not what happened ! ”
46394	46451	46328	46328	She	266	“ Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the Muggle community … much kinder than trying to find them a place in the Wizarding world , where they must always be second class , but naturally Kendra would n’t have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a Muggle school — ”
46452	46457	46459	46459	Doge	358	“ Ariana was delicate ! ”
46462	46473	46459	46459	Doge	358	“ Her health was always too poor to permit her — ”
46474	46484	46486	46486	Muriel	266	“ — to permit her to leave the house ? ”
46488	46509	46486	46486	Muriel	266	“ And yet she was never taken to St. Mungo ’s and no Healer was ever summoned to see her ! ”
46510	46522	46459	46459	Doge	358	“ Really , Muriel , how can you possibly know whether — ”
46523	46567	46486	46486	Muriel	266	“ For your information , Elphias , my cousin Lancelot was a Healer at St. Mungo ’s at the time , and he told my family in strictest confidence that Ariana had never been seen there . All most suspicious , Lancelot thought ! ”
46668	46678	46679	46679	Muriel	266	“ Now , if Kendra had n’t died first , ”
46682	46696	46679	46679	Muriel	266	“ I ’d have said that it was she who finished off Ariana — ”
46697	46704	46706	46706	Doge	358	“ How can you , Muriel ! ”
46708	46722	46706	46706	Doge	358	“ A mother kill her own daughter ? Think what you ’re saying ! ”
46723	46743	46745	46746	Auntie Muriel	266	“ If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end , why not ? ”
46748	46773	46745	46746	Auntie Muriel	266	“ But as I say , it does n’t fit , because Kendra died before Ariana — of what , nobody ever seemed sure — ”
46774	46793	46795	46796	Auntie Muriel	266	“ Yes , Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed Kendra in the struggle , ”
46799	46820	46795	46796	Auntie Muriel	266	“ Shake your head all you like , Elphias . You were at Ariana ’s funeral , were you not ? ”
46821	46826	46828	46828	Doge	358	“ Yes I was , ”
46834	46850	46828	46828	Doge	358	“ and a more desperately sad occasion I can not remember . Albus was heartbroken — ”
46851	46872	46795	46796	Auntie Muriel	266	“ His heart was n’t the only thing . Did n’t Aberforth break Albus ’ nose halfway through the service ? ”
46912	46918	46920	46920	Doge	358	“ How do you — ? ”
46922	46932	46934	46935	Auntie Muriel	266	“ My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot , ”
46938	46947	46948	46948	Muriel	266	“ And I ’ll tell you something else , ”
46959	47003	46954	46954	she	266	“ I think Bathilda has spilled the beans to Rita Skeeter . All those hints in Skeeter ’s interview about an important source close to the Dumbledores — goodness knows she was there all through the Ariana business , and it would fit ! ”
47004	47013	47015	47015	Doge	358	“ Bathilda would never talk to Rita Skeeter ! ”
47017	47021	47022	47022	Harry	177	“ Bathilda Bagshot ? ”
47025	47034	47022	47022	Harry	177	“ The author of A History of Magic ? ”
47062	47065	47067	47067	Doge	358	“ Yes , ”
47083	47097	47067	47067	Doge	358	“ A most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus ’s . ”
47098	47108	47110	47111	Auntie Muriel	266	“ Quite gaga these days , I ’ve heard , ”
47114	47134	47136	47136	Doge	358	“ If that is so , it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have taken advantage of her , ”
47138	47152	47136	47136	Doge	358	“ and no reliance can be placed on anything Bathilda may have said ! ”
47153	47174	47176	47177	Auntie Muriel	266	“ Oh , there are ways of bringing back memories , and I ’m sure Rita Skeeter knows them all , ”
47179	47223	47176	47177	Auntie Muriel	266	“ But even if Bathilda ’s completely cuckoo , I ’m sure she ’d still have old photographs , maybe even letters . She knew the Dumbledores for years … Well worth a trip to Godric ’s Hollow , I ’d have thought . ”
47267	47276	47264	47264	he	177	“ Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric ’s Hollow ? ”
47277	47302	47264	47264	he	177	“ Oh yes , she ’s been there forever ! The Dumbledores moved there after Perival was imprisoned , and she was their neighbor . ”
47303	47312	47264	47264	he	177	“ The Dumbledores lived in Godric ’s Hollow ? ”
47313	47325	47327	47328	Auntie Muriel	266	“ Yes , Barry , that ’s what I just said , ”
47484	47492	47493	47493	she	197	“ I simply ca n’t dance anymore , ”
47510	47546	47547	47547	She	197	“ Ron ’s gone looking to find more butterbeers . It ’s a bit odd . I ’ve just seen Viktor storming away from Luna ’s father , it looked like they ’d been arguing — ”
47556	47563	47549	47549	her	197	“ Harry , are you okay ? ”
47648	47662	47645	47646	Kingsley Shacklebolt	211	“ The Ministry has fallen . Scrimgeour is dead . They are coming . ”
47663	47677	47645	47646	Kingsley Shacklebolt	211	“ The Ministry has fallen . Scrimgeour is dead . They are coming . ”
47678	47692	47645	47646	Kingsley Shacklebolt	211	“ The Ministry has fallen . Scrimgeour is dead . They are coming . ”
47784	47787	47788	47788	Hermione	197	“ Ron ! ”
47791	47798	47788	47788	Hermione	197	“ Ron , where are you ? ”
47838	47841	47835	47835	them	1416	“ Protego ! ”
47852	47857	47858	47858	Hermione	197	“ Ron ! Ron ! ”
47980	47985	47987	47987	Ron	227	“ Where are we ? ”
48019	48024	48026	48026	Hermione	197	“ Tottenham Court Road , ”
48028	48044	48026	48026	Hermione	197	“ Walk , just walk , we need to find somewhere for you to change . ”
48109	48121	48122	48122	Ron	227	“ Hermione , we have n’t got anything to change into , ”
48140	48155	48157	48157	Harry	177	“ Why did n’t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me ? ”
48165	48176	48157	48157	Harry	177	“ All last year I kept it on me and — ”
48177	48197	48199	48199	Hermione	197	“ It ’s okay , I ’ve got the Cloak , I ’ve got clothes for both of you , ”
48201	48213	48199	48199	Hermione	197	“ Just try and act naturally until — this will do . ”
48231	48244	48246	48246	Harry	177	“ When you say you ’ve got the Cloak , and clothes … ”
48269	48276	48278	48278	Hermione	197	“ Yes , they ’re here , ”
48311	48318	48289	48289	she	197	“ How the ruddy hell — ? ”
48319	48324	48326	48326	Hermione	197	“ Undetectable Extension Charm , ”
48328	48336	48337	48337	Harry	177	“ When did you do all this ? ”
48346	48401	48428	48428	Hermione	197	“ I told you at the Burrow , I ’ve had the essentials packed for days , you know , in case we needed to make a quick getaway . I packed your rucksack this morning , Harry , after you changed , and put it in here … I just had a feeling … ”
48402	48410	48412	48412	Ron	227	“ You ’re amazing , you are , ”
48422	48426	48435	48435	she	197	“ Thank you , ”
48443	48453	48435	48435	she	197	“ Please , Harry , get that Cloak on ! ”
48485	48494	48435	48435	she	197	“ The others — everybody at the wedding — ”
48495	48504	48506	48506	Hermione	197	“ We ca n’t worry about that now , ”
48508	48532	48506	48506	Hermione	197	“ It ’s you they ’re after , Harry , and we ’ll just put everyone in even more danger by going back . ”
48533	48538	48540	48540	Ron	227	“ She ’s right , ”
48562	48576	48540	48540	Ron	227	“ Most of the Order was there , they ’ll look after everyone . ”
48592	48595	48577	48577	Harry	177	“ Yeah . ”
48611	48623	48625	48625	Hermione	197	“ Come on , I think we ought to keep moving , ”
48658	48671	48672	48672	Ron	227	“ Just as a matter of interest , why Tottenham Court Road ? ”
48676	48713	48642	48649	a group of men on the opposite side	1442	“ I ’ve no idea , it just popped into my head , but I ’m sure we ’re safer out in the Muggle world , it ’s not where they ’ll expect us to be . ”
48714	48717	48719	48719	Ron	227	“ True , ”
48724	48735	48719	48719	Ron	227	“ but do n’t you feel a bit — exposed ? ”
48736	48742	48744	48744	Hermione	197	“ Where else is there ? ”
48764	48821	48748	48756	the men on the other side of the road	1443	“ We can hardly book rooms at the Leaky Cauldron , can we ? And Grimmauld Place is out if Snape can get in there … I suppose we could try my parents ’ home , though I think there ’s a chance they might check there … Oh , I wish they ’d shut up ! ”
48822	48828	48829	48837	the drunkest of the men on the other pavement	1444	“ All right , darling ? ”
48841	48855	48829	48837	the drunkest of the men on the other pavement	1444	“ Fancy a drink ? Ditch ginger and come and have a pint ! ”
48856	48863	48864	48864	Hermione	197	“ Let ’s sit down somewhere , ”
48879	48889	48868	48868	Ron	227	“ Look , this will do , in here ! ”
49030	49051	49027	49027	Ron	227	“ You know , we ’re not far from the Leaky Cauldron here , it ’s only in Charing Cross — ”
49052	49059	49061	49061	Hermione	197	“ Ron , we ca n’t ! ”
49065	49080	49027	49027	Ron	227	“ Not to stay there , but to find out what ’s going on ! ”
49081	49104	49027	49027	Ron	227	“ We know what ’s going on ! Voldemort ’s taken over the Ministry , what else do we need to know ? ”
49105	49116	49027	49027	Ron	227	“ Okay , okay , it was just an idea ! ”
49176	49206	49170	49170	her	197	“ I say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the countryside . Once we ’re there , we could send a message to the Order . ”
49207	49218	49220	49220	Ron	227	“ Can you do that talking Patronus thing , then ? ”
49222	49232	49234	49234	Hermione	197	“ I ’ve been practicing and I think so , ”
49236	49264	49265	49265	Ron	227	“ Well , as long as it does n’t get them into trouble , though they might ’ve been arrested already . God , that ’s revolting , ”
49332	49349	49351	49351	Ron	227	“ Let ’s get going , then , I do n’t want to drink this muck , ”
49353	49366	49351	49351	Ron	227	“ Hermione , have you got Muggle money to pay for this ? ”
49367	49396	49398	49398	Hermione	197	“ Yes , I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to the Burrow . I ’ll bet all the change is at the bottom , ”
49482	49485	49475	49475	Harry	177	“ Stupefy ! ”
49593	49596	49598	49600	the Death Eater	240	“ Expulso ! ”
49638	49642	49644	49644	Hermione	197	“ Petrificus Totalus ! ”
49699	49702	49703	49703	she	197	“ Diffindo , ”
49731	49748	49717	49717	she	197	“ Oh , I ’m so sorry , Ron , my hand ’s shaking ! Diffindo ! ”
49794	49809	49810	49810	he	177	“ I should ’ve recognized him , he was there the night Dumbledore died , ”
49837	49842	49844	49844	Ron	227	“ That ’s Dolohov , ”
49846	49865	49844	49844	Ron	227	“ I recognize him from the old wanted posters . I think the big one ’s Thorfinn Rowle . ”
49866	49874	49876	49876	Hermione	197	“ Never mind what they ’re called ! ”
49881	49895	49876	49876	Hermione	197	“ How did they find us ? What are we going to do ? ”
49906	49911	49912	49912	he	177	“ Lock the door , ”
49916	49925	49912	49912	he	177	“ and Ron , turn out the lights . ”
49973	49983	49984	49984	Ron	227	“ What are we going to do with them ? ”
49998	50015	49984	49984	Ron	227	“ Kill them ? They ’d kill us . They had a good go just now . ”
50029	50038	50040	50040	Harry	177	“ We just need to wipe their memories , ”
50042	50069	50040	50040	Harry	177	“ It ’s better like that , it ’ll throw them off the scent . If we killed them it ’d be obvious we were here . ”
50070	50076	50078	50078	Ron	227	“ You ’re the boss , ”
50084	50094	50078	50078	Ron	227	“ But I ’ve never down a Memory Charm . ”
50095	50100	50102	50102	Hermione	197	“ Nor have I , ”
50104	50111	50102	50102	Hermione	197	“ but I know the theory . ”
50131	50134	50112	50112	She	197	“ Obliviate . ”
50146	50149	50151	50151	Harry	177	“ Brilliant ! ”
50159	50176	50151	50151	Harry	177	“ Take care of the other one and the waitress while Ron and I clear up . ”
50177	50181	50183	50183	Ron	227	“ Clear up ? ”
50194	50197	50183	50183	Ron	227	“ Why ? ”
50198	50228	50151	50151	Harry	177	“ Do n’t you think they might wonder what ’s happened if they wake up and find themselves in a place that looks like it ’s just been bombed ? ”
50229	50235	50183	50183	Ron	227	“ Oh right , yeah … ”
50251	50275	50151	50151	Harry	177	“ It ’s no wonder I ca n’t get it out , Hermione , you packed my old jeans , they ’re tight . ”
50276	50284	50286	50286	Hermione	197	“ Oh , I ’m so sorry , ”
50345	50353	50354	50354	Hermione	197	“ But how did they find us ? ”
50366	50375	50354	50354	Hermione	197	“ How did they know where we were ? ”
50381	50402	50376	50376	She	197	“ You — you do n’t think you ’ve still got your Trace on you , do you , Harry ? ”
50403	50409	50411	50411	Ron	227	“ He ca n’t have , ”
50413	50434	50411	50411	Ron	227	“ The Trace breaks at seventeen , that ’s Wizarding law , you ca n’t put it on an adult . ”
50435	50442	50444	50444	Hermione	197	“ As far as you know , ”
50446	50467	50444	50444	Hermione	197	“ What if the Death Eaters have found a way to put it on a seventeen - year - old ? ”
50468	50498	50411	50411	Ron	227	“ But Harry has n’t been near a Death Eater in the last twenty - four hours . Who ’s supposed to have put a Trace back on him ? ”
50521	50545	50546	50546	he	177	“ If I ca n’t use magic , and you ca n’t use magic near me , without us giving away our position — ”
50549	50556	50558	50558	Hermione	197	“ We ’re not splitting up ! ”
50561	50570	50572	50572	Ron	227	“ We need a safe place to hide , ”
50574	50583	50572	50572	Ron	227	“ Give us time to think things through . ”
50584	50588	50590	50590	Harry	177	“ Grimmauld Place , ”
50597	50611	50592	50594	The other two	1208	“ Do n’t be silly , Harry , Snape can get in there ! ”
50612	50633	50634	50634	he	177	“ Ron ’s dad said they ’ve put up jinxes against him — and even if they have n’t worked , ”
50643	50660	50634	50634	he	177	“ so what ? I swear , I ’d like nothing better than to meet Snape ! ”
50661	50664	50592	50594	The other two	1208	“ But — ”
50665	50713	50634	50634	he	177	“ Hermione , where else is there ? It ’s the best chance we ’ve got . Snape ’s only one Death Eater . If I ’ve still got the Trace on me , we ’ll have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go . ”
51034	51043	51044	51044	Hermione	197	“ I think somebody ’s been in here , ”
51051	51061	51062	51062	Ron	227	“ That could ’ve happened as the Order left , ”
51066	51078	51079	51079	Harry	177	“ So where are these jinxes they put up against Snape ? ”
51082	51093	51095	51095	Ron	227	“ Maybe they ’re only activated if he shows up ? ”
51119	51129	51131	51131	Harry	177	“ Well , we ca n’t stay here forever , ”
51140	51144	51134	51134	he	177	“ Severus Snape ? ”
51167	51173	51175	51175	Harry	177	“ We ’re not Snape ! ”
51238	51262	51229	51229	Ron	227	“ That m - must have b - been the T - Tongue - Tying Curse Mad - Eye set up for Snape ! ”
51374	51377	51378	51378	Harry	177	“ No ! ”
51394	51408	51378	51378	Harry	177	“ No ! It was n’t us ! We did n’t kill you — ”
51470	51484	51451	51451	Ron	227	“ It ’s all r - right … It ’s g - gone … ”
51504	51523	51498	51499	Mrs. Black	372	“ Mudbloods , filth , stains of dishonor , taint of shame on the house of my fathers — ”
51524	51528	51529	51529	Harry	177	“ SHUT UP ! ”
51558	51564	51565	51565	Hermione	197	“ That … that was … ”
51576	51579	51581	51581	Harry	177	“ Yeah , ”
51583	51600	51581	51581	Harry	177	“ but it was n’t really him , was it ? Just something to scare Snape . ”
51664	51678	51683	51683	she	197	“ Before we go any farther , I think we ’d better check , ”
51690	51694	51683	51683	she	197	“ Homenum revelio . ”
51698	51709	51711	51711	Ron	227	“ Well , you ’ve just had a big shock , ”
51714	51722	51711	51711	Ron	227	“ What was that supposed to do ? ”
51723	51733	51735	51735	Hermione	197	“ It did what I meant it to do ! ”
51739	51757	51735	51735	Hermione	197	“ That was a spell to reveal human presence , and there ’s nobody here except us ! ”
51758	51763	51765	51765	Ron	227	“ And old Dusty , ”
51782	51788	51790	51790	Hermione	197	“ Let ’s go up , ”
51866	51874	51875	51875	he	227	“ Ca n’t see anyone out there , ”
51878	51918	51875	51875	he	227	“ And you ’d think , if Harry still had a Trace on him , they ’d have followed us here . I know they ca n’t get in the house , but — what ’s up , Harry ? ”
51972	51978	51979	51979	Ron	227	“ What did you see ? ”
51986	51995	51979	51979	Ron	227	“ Did you see him at my place ? ”
51996	52009	52061	52061	Hermione	197	“ No , I just felt anger — he ’s really angry — ”
52010	52019	52021	52021	Ron	227	“ But that could be at the Burrow , ”
52024	52039	52021	52021	Ron	227	“ What else ? Did n’t you see anything ? Was he cursing someone ? ”
52040	52053	52061	52061	Hermione	197	“ No , I just felt anger — I could n’t tell — ”
52073	52092	52066	52066	she	197	“ Your scar , again ? But what ’s going on ? I thought that connection had closed ! ”
52093	52101	52103	52103	Harry	177	“ It did , for a while , ”
52118	52140	52103	52103	Harry	177	“ I — I think it ’s started opening again whenever he loses control , that ’s how it used to — ”
52141	52152	52154	52154	Hermione	197	“ But then you ’ve got to close your mind ! ”
52157	52200	52154	52154	Hermione	197	“ Harry , Dumbledore did n’t want you to use that connection , he wanted you to shut it down , that ’s why you were supposed to use Occlumency ! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your mind , remember — ”
52201	52210	52212	52212	Harry	177	“ Yeah , I do remember , thanks , ”
52382	52395	52419	52419	Hermione	197	“ Family safe , do not reply , we are being watched . ”
52427	52438	52439	52439	she	197	“ They ’re all right , they ’re all right ! ”
52450	52453	52454	52454	he	177	“ Harry , ”
52461	52464	52454	52454	he	177	“ I — ”
52465	52472	52474	52474	Harry	177	“ It ’s not a problem , ”
52484	52503	52474	52474	Harry	177	“ It ’s your family , ’ course you were worried . I ’d feel the same way . ”
52509	52517	52507	52507	Ginny	238	“ I do feel the same way . ”
52545	52571	52543	52543	Hermione	197	“ I do n’t want to be on my own . Could we use the sleeping bags I ’ve brought and camp in here tonight ? ”
52591	52594	52595	52595	he	227	“ Bathroom , ”
52703	52767	52692	52692	Harry	177	“ More , Rowle , or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini ? Lord Voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time … You called me back for this , to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again ? Draco , give Rowle another taste of our displeasure … Do it , or feel my wrath yourself ! ”
52895	52910	52889	52889	Hermione	197	“ Harry , do you want your toothbrush ? I ’ve got it here . ”
52911	52918	52919	52919	he	177	“ Yeah , great , thanks , ”
53369	53372	53366	53366	he	177	“ Lumos , ”
54280	54281	54276	54276	She	1553	“ g”s

54529	54532	54534	54534	he	271	“ down . ”
54902	54909	54957	54957	She	197	“ Harry ? Harry ? Harry ! ”
54910	54915	54916	54916	he	177	“ I ’m here ! ”
54919	54924	54916	54916	he	177	“ What ’s happened ? ”
54940	54952	54953	54953	she	197	“ We woke up and did n’t know where you were ! ”
54965	54973	54957	54957	She	197	“ Ron ! I ’ve found him ! ”
54985	54997	54974	54974	Ron	227	“ Good ! Tell him from me he ’s a git ! ”
54998	55020	55021	55021	She	197	“ Harry , do n’t just disappear , please , we were terrified ! Why did you come up here anyway ? ”
55028	55035	55021	55021	She	197	“ What have you been doing ? ”
55036	55044	55045	55045	He	227	“ Look what I ’ve just found — ”
55079	55083	55073	55073	she	197	“ Oh Harry … ”
55084	55091	55092	55092	He	177	“ And there ’s this too . ”
55116	55128	55129	55129	Harry	177	“ I ’ve been looking for the rest of the letter , ”
55132	55139	55129	55129	Harry	177	“ but it ’s not here . ”
55144	55163	55092	55092	He	177	“ Did you make all this mess , or was some of it done when you got here ? ”
55164	55171	55173	55173	Harry	177	“ Someone had searched before me , ”
55175	55202	55092	55092	He	177	“ I thought so . Every room I looked into on the way up had been disturbed . What were they after , do you think ? ”
55203	55214	55092	55092	He	177	“ Information on the Order , if it was Snape . ”
55215	55239	55092	55092	He	177	“ But you ’d think he ’d already have all he needed . I mean was in the Order , was n’t he ? ”
55240	55244	55246	55246	Harry	177	“ Well then , ”
55254	55285	55246	55246	Harry	177	“ what about information on Dumbledore ? The second page of the letter , for instance . You know this Bathilda my mum mentions , you know who she is ? ”
55286	55289	55092	55092	He	177	“ Who ? ”
55290	55298	55246	55246	Harry	177	“ Bathilda Bagshot , the author of — ”
55299	55305	55307	55307	Hermione	197	“ A History of Magic , ”
55312	55326	55307	55307	Hermione	197	“ So your parents knew her ? She was an incredible magic historian . ”
55327	55334	55336	55336	Harry	177	“ And she ’s still alive , ”
55338	55377	55336	55336	Harry	177	“ and she lives in Godric ’s Hollow . Ron ’s Auntie Muriel was talking about her at the wedding . She knew Dumbledore ’s family too . Be pretty interesting to talk to , would n’t she ? ”
55428	55449	55451	55451	Hermione	197	“ I understand why you ’d love to talk to her about your mum and dad , and Dumbledore too , ”
55453	55460	55461	55461	Harry	177	“ It ’s not just that , ”
55470	55487	55461	55461	Harry	177	“ Muriel said stuff about Dumbledore at the wedding . I want to know the truth … ”
55506	55521	55503	55503	Hermione	197	“ Of course , I can see why that ’s upset you , Harry — ”
55522	55528	55529	55529	he	177	“ I ’m not upset , ”
55532	55547	55503	55503	Hermione	197	“ I ’d just like to know whether or not it ’s true or — ”
55548	55583	55503	55503	Hermione	197	“ Harry , do you really think you ’ll get the truth from a malicious old woman like Muriel , or from Rita Skeeter ? How can you believe them ? You knew Dumbledore ! ”
55584	55590	55591	55591	he	177	“ I thought I did , ”
55594	55626	55503	55503	Hermione	197	“ But you know how much truth there was in everything Rita wrote about you ! Doge is right , how can you let these people tarnish your memories of Dumbledore ? ”
55667	55676	55677	55677	Hermione	197	“ Shall we go down to the kitchen ? ”
55684	55690	55677	55677	Hermione	197	“ Find something for breakfast ? ”
55802	55805	55806	55806	he	177	“ Hermione , ”
55820	55826	55814	55814	his	177	“ Come back up here . ”
55827	55833	55792	55792	Hermione	197	“ What ’s the matter ? ”
55834	55845	55814	55814	his	177	“ R. A. B. I think I ’ve found him . ”
55860	55873	55853	55853	Hermione	197	“ In your mum ’s letter ? But I did n’t see — ”
55900	55905	55906	55906	she	197	“ Sirius ’s brother ? ”
55909	55916	55918	55918	Harry	177	“ He was a Death Eater , ”
55920	55950	55918	55918	Harry	177	“ Sirius told me about him , he joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave — so they killed him . ”
55951	55955	55957	55957	Hermione	197	“ That fits ! ”
55959	55989	55957	55957	Hermione	197	“ If he was a Death Eater , he had access to Voldemort , and if he became disenchanted , then he would have wanted to bring Voldemort down ! ”
56002	56013	55990	55990	She	197	“ Ron ! RON ! Get up here , quick ! ”
56030	56047	56027	56027	his	227	“ What ’s up ? If it ’s massive spiders again I want breakfast before I — ”
56065	56096	56048	56048	He	227	“ What ? That was Sirius ’s brother , was n’t it ? Regulus Arcturus . Regulus . R. A. B. ! The locket — you do n’t reckon — ? ”
56097	56103	56105	56105	Harry	177	“ Let ’s find out , ”
56126	56129	56118	56118	her	197	“ Alohomora . ”
56258	56265	56266	56266	she	197	“ They ’re all about Voldemort , ”
56269	56288	56266	56266	she	197	“ Regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years before he joined the Death Eaters … ”
56389	56394	56396	56396	Harry	177	“ He played Seeker , ”
56398	56401	56406	56406	she	197	“ What ? ”
56416	56437	56439	56439	Harry	177	“ He ’s sitting in the middle of the front row , that ’s where the Seeker … Never mind , ”
56538	56545	56547	56547	Hermione	197	“ There ’s an easier way , ”
56566	56570	56559	56559	She	197	“ Accio Locket ! ”
56590	56602	56574	56574	Ron	227	“ Is that it , then ? It ’s not here ? ”
56603	56618	56620	56620	Hermione	197	“ Oh , it could still be here , but under counter - enchantments , ”
56622	56635	56620	56620	Hermione	197	“ Charms to prevent it from being summoned magically , you know . ”
56636	56648	56650	56650	Harry	177	“ Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave , ”
56664	56674	56676	56676	Ron	227	“ How are we supposed to find it then ? ”
56678	56683	56685	56685	Hermione	197	“ We search manually , ”
56687	56694	56696	56696	Ron	227	“ That ’s a good idea , ”
56756	56768	56790	56790	she	197	“ It could be somewhere else in the house , though , ”
56798	56883	56790	56790	she	197	“ Whether he ’d manage to destroy it or not , he ’d want to keep it hidden from Voldemort , would n’t he ? Remember all those awful things we had to get rid of when we were here last time ? That clock that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes that tried to strangle Ron ; Regulus might have put them there to protect the locket ’s hiding place , even though we did n’t realize it at … at … ”
56921	56927	56928	56928	she	197	“ … at the time , ”
56934	56938	56940	56940	Ron	227	“ Something wrong ? ”
56942	56948	56928	56928	she	197	“ There was a locket . ”
56949	56952	56954	56954	Harry	177	“ What ? ”
56959	56978	56928	56928	she	197	“ In the cabinet in the drawing room . Nobody could open it . And we … we … ”
57047	57057	57059	57059	Harry	177	“ Kreacher nicked loads of things back from us , ”
57089	57107	57076	57076	he	177	“ He had a whole stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen . C’m on . ”
57150	57157	57158	57158	she	1491	“ Filth ! Mudbloods ! Scum ! ”
57293	57300	57302	57302	Harry	177	“ It ’s not over yet , ”
57312	57315	57305	57305	he	177	“ Kreacher ! ”
57412	57415	57425	57425	he	384	“ Master , ”
57434	57452	57425	57425	he	384	“ back in my Mistress ’s old house with the blood - traitor Weasley and the Mudblood — ”
57453	57469	57471	57471	Harry	177	“ I forbid you to call anyone ‘ blood traitor ’ or ‘ Mudblood , ’ ”
57502	57511	57513	57513	Harry	177	“ I ’ve got a question for you , ”
57528	57540	57513	57513	Harry	177	“ and I order you to answer it truthfully . Understand ? ”
57541	57546	57548	57548	Kreacher	384	“ Yes , Master , ”
57572	57577	57579	57579	Harry	177	“ Two years ago , ”
57589	57613	57579	57579	Harry	177	“ there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs . We threw it out . Did you steal it back ? ”
57638	57641	57635	57635	he	384	“ Yes . ”
57642	57648	57650	57650	Harry	177	“ Where is it now ? ”
57678	57681	57659	57659	Kreacher	384	“ Gone . ”
57682	57685	57687	57687	Harry	177	“ Gone ? ”
57695	57705	57687	57687	Harry	177	“ What do you mean , it ’s gone ? ”
57713	57716	57718	57718	Harry	177	“ Kreacher , ”
57721	57726	57718	57718	Harry	177	“ I order you — ”
57727	57731	57733	57734	the elf	1605	“ Mundungus Fletcher , ”
57742	57782	57733	57734	the elf	1605	“ Mundungus Fletcher stole it all ; Miss Bella ’s and Miss Cissy ’s pictures , my Mistress ’s gloves , the Order of Merlin , First Class , the goblets with the family crest , and — and — ”
57810	57831	57804	57804	he	384	“ — and the locket , Master Regulus ’s locket . Kreacher did wrong , Kreacher failed in his orders ! ”
57873	57883	57865	57865	Harry	177	“ Kreacher , I order you to stay still ! ”
57909	57916	57917	57917	Hermione	197	“ Harry , let him up ! ”
57920	57931	57933	57933	Harry	177	“ So he can beat himself up with the poker ? ”
57940	57966	57933	57933	Harry	177	“ I do n’t think so . Right . Kreacher , I want the truth : How do you know Mundungus Fletcher stole the locket ? ”
57967	57972	57974	57975	the elf	1605	“ Kreacher saw him ! ”
57991	58027	57974	57975	the elf	1605	“ Kreacher saw him coming out of Kreacher ’s cupboard with his hands full of Kreacher ’s treasures . Kreacher told the sneak thief to stop , but Mundungus Fletcher laughed and r - ran … ”
58028	58039	58041	58041	Harry	177	“ You called the locket ‘ Master Regulus ’s , ’ ”
58043	58084	58041	58041	Harry	177	“ Why ? Where did it come from ? What did Regulus have to do with it ? Kreacher , sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket , and everything Regulus had to do with it ! ”
58129	58270	58115	58115	his	1605	“ Master Sirius ran away , good riddance , for he was a bad boy and broke my Mistress ’s heart with his lawless ways . But Master Regulus had proper order ; he knew what was due to the name of Black and the dignity of his pure blood . For years he talked of the Dark Lord , who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggle - borns … and when he was sixteen years old , Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord . So proud , so proud , so happy to serve … And one day , a year after he joined , Master Regulus came down to the kitchen to see Kreacher . Master Regulus always liked Kreacher . And Master Regulus said … he said … ”
58279	58291	58271	58273	The old elf	1616	“ … he said that the Dark Lord required an elf . ”
58292	58298	58299	58299	Harry	177	“ Voldemort needed an elf ? ”
58318	58322	58324	58324	Kreacher	384	“ Oh yes , ”
58326	58374	58324	58324	Kreacher	384	“ And Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher . It was an honor , said Master Regulus , an honor for him and for Kreacher , who must be sure to do whatever the Dark Lord ordered him to do … and then to c - come home . ”
58386	58438	58380	58380	his	384	“ So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord . The Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher what they were to do , but took Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea . And beyond the cave was a cavern , and in the cavern was a great black lake … ”
58480	58487	58466	58466	He	177	“ … There was a boat … ”
58549	58573	58574	58575	The elf	1605	“ There was a b - basin full of potion on the island . The D - Dark Lord made Kreacher drink it … ”
58582	58647	58574	58575	The elf	1605	“ Kreacher drank , and as he drank he saw terrible thing … Kreacher ’s insides burned … Kreacher cried for Master Regulus to save him , he cried for his Mistress Black , but the Dark Lord only laughed … He made Kreacher drink all the potion … He dropped a locket into the empty basin … He filled it with more potion . ”
58648	58663	58574	58575	The elf	1605	“ And then the Dark Lord sailed away , leaving Kreacher on the island … ”
58734	58772	58796	58796	his	384	“ Kreacher needed water , he crawled to the island ’s edge and he drank from the black lake … and hands , dead hands , came out of the water and dragged Kreacher under the surface … ”
58773	58780	58781	58781	Harry	177	“ How did you get away ? ”
58809	58818	58819	58819	he	384	“ Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back , ”
58822	58834	58796	58796	his	384	“ I know — but how did you escape the Inferi ? ”
58842	58851	58852	58852	he	384	“ Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back , ”
58855	58861	58803	58803	his	384	“ I know , but — ”
58862	58875	58877	58877	Ron	227	“ Well , it ’s obvious , is n’t it , Harry ? ”
58879	58883	58877	58877	Ron	227	“ He Disapparated ! ”
58884	58898	58900	58900	Harry	177	“ But … you could n’t Apparate in and out of that cave , ”
58902	58906	58900	58900	Harry	177	“ otherwise Dumbledore — ”
58907	58920	58922	58922	Ron	227	“ Elf magic is n’t like wizard ’s magic , is it ? ”
58924	58943	58922	58922	Ron	227	“ I mean , they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we ca n’t . ”
58978	59014	58973	58973	her	197	“ Of course , Voldemort would have considered the ways of house - elves far beneath his notice … It would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he did n’t . ”
59015	59029	59031	59031	Kreacher	384	“ The house - elf ’s highest law is his Master ’s bidding , ”
59033	59046	59031	59031	Kreacher	384	“ Kreacher was told to come home , so Kreacher came home … ”
59047	59063	59065	59065	Hermione	197	“ Well , then , you did what you were told , did n’t you ? ”
59068	59077	59065	59065	Hermione	197	“ You did n’t disobey orders at all ! ”
59089	59098	59099	59099	Harry	177	“ So what happened when you got back ? ”
59102	59114	59099	59099	Harry	177	“ What did Regulus say when you told him what happened ? ”
59115	59125	59127	59127	Kreacher	384	“ Master Regulus was very worried , very worried , ”
59129	59209	59127	59127	Kreacher	384	“ Master Regulus told Kreacher to stay hidden and not to leave the house . And then … it was a little while later … Master Regulus came to find Kreacher in his cupboard one night , and Master Regulus was strange , not as he usually was , disturbed in his mind , Kreacher could tell … and he asked Kreacher to take him to the cave , the cave where Kreacher had gone with the Dark Lord … ”
59281	59290	59292	59292	Harry	177	“ And he made you drink the poison ? ”
59319	59338	59340	59340	Kreacher	384	“ M - Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the Dark Lord had , ”
59352	59373	59340	59340	Kreacher	384	“ And he told Kreacher to take it and , when the basin was empty , to switch the lockets … ”
59392	59462	59390	59390	him	384	“ And he order — Kreacher to leave — without him . And he told Kreacher — to go home — and never to tell my Mistress — what he had done — but to destroy — the first locket . And he drank — all the potion — and Kreacher swapped the lockets — and watched … as Master Regulus … was dragged beneath the water … and … ”
59463	59468	59470	59470	Hermione	197	“ Oh , Kreacher ! ”
59507	59525	59543	59544	the elf	1605	“ The Mudblood touched Kreacher , he will not allow it , what would his Mistress say ? ”
59526	59538	59540	59540	Harry	177	“ I told you not to call her ‘ Mudblood ’ ! ”
59563	59570	59571	59571	Hermione	197	“ Stop him — stop him ! ”
59574	59595	59571	59571	Hermione	197	“ Oh , do n’t you see now how sick it is , the way they ’ve got to obey ? ”
59596	59603	59605	59605	Harry	177	“ Kreacher — stop , stop ! ”
59657	59665	59666	59666	he	177	“ So you brought the locket home , ”
59680	59688	59666	59666	he	177	“ And you tried to destroy it ? ”
59689	59699	59701	59702	the elf	1605	“ Nothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it , ”
59704	59830	59701	59702	the elf	1605	“ Kreacher tried everything , everything he knew , but nothing , nothing would work … So many powerful spells upon the casing , Kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it , but it would not open … Kreacher punished himself , he tried again , he punished himself , he tried again . Kreacher failed to obey orders , Kreacher could not destroy the locket ! And his mistress was mad with grief , because Master Regulus had disappeared and Kreacher could not tell her what had happened , no , because Master Regulus had f - f - forbidden him to tell any of the f - f - family what happened in the c - cave … ”
59895	59904	59905	59905	he	177	“ I do n’t understand you , Kreacher , ”
59909	59952	59905	59905	he	177	“ Voldemort tried to kill you , Regulus died to bring Voldemort down , but you were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort ? You were happy to go to Narcissa and Bellatrix , and pass information to Voldemort through them … ”
59953	59963	59968	59968	her	197	“ Harry , Kreacher does n’t think like that , ”
59977	60063	60064	60064	she	197	“ He ’s a slave ; house - elves are used to bad , even brutal treatment ; what Voldemort did to Kreacher was n’t that far out of the common way . What do wizard wars mean to an elf like Kreacher ? He ’s loyal to people who are kind to him , and Mrs. Black must have been , and Regulus certainly was , so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs . I know what you ’re going to say , ”
60073	60129	60064	60064	she	197	“ that Regulus changed his mind … but he does n’t seem to have explained that to Kreacher , does he ? And I think I know why . Kreacher and Regulus ’s family were all safest if they kept to the old pure - blood line . Regulus was trying to protect them all . ”
60130	60133	60064	60064	she	197	“ Sirius — ”
60134	60249	60064	60064	she	197	“ Sirius was horrible to Kreacher , Harry , and it ’s no good looking like that , you know it ’s true . Kreacher had been alone for such a long time when Sirius came to live here , and he was probably starving for a bit of affection . I ’m sure ‘ Miss Cissy ’ and ‘ Miss Bella ’ were perfectly lovely to Kreacher when he turned up , so he did them a favor and told them everything they wanted to know . I ’ve said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat house - elves . Well , Voldemort did … and so did Sirius . ”
60300	60303	60305	60305	Harry	177	“ Kreacher , ”
60310	60324	60305	60305	Harry	177	“ when you feel up to it , er … please sit up . ”
60357	60370	60372	60372	Harry	177	“ Kreacher , I am going to ask you to do something , ”
60424	60486	60420	60420	She	197	“ Kreacher , I want you , please , to go and find Mundungus Fletcher . We need to find out where the locket — where Master Regulus ’s locket it . It ’s really important . We want to finish the work Master Regulus started , we want to — er — ensure that he did n’t die in vain . ”
60497	60502	60503	60503	he	384	“ Find Mundungus Fletcher ? ”
60506	60516	60518	60518	Harry	177	“ And bring him here , to Grimmauld Place , ”
60520	60531	60518	60518	Harry	177	“ Do you think you could do that for us ? ”
60573	60587	60588	60588	he	177	“ Kreacher , I ’d , er , like you to have this , ”
60600	60625	60588	60588	he	177	“ This belonged to Regulus and I ’m sure he ’d want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you — ”
60626	60631	60633	60633	Ron	227	“ Overkill , mate , ”
60925	60932	60934	60934	Ron	227	“ Death Eaters , for sure , ”
60950	60959	60942	60942	Hermione	197	“ Reckon they know we ’re in here ? ”
60960	60967	60972	60972	she	197	“ I do n’t think so , ”
60976	60991	60972	60972	she	197	“ or they ’d have sent Snape in after us , would n’t they ? ”
60992	61010	61012	61012	Ron	227	“ D’you reckon he ’s been in here and has his tongue tied by Moody ’s curse ? ”
61014	61017	61019	61019	Hermione	197	“ Yes , ”
61021	61064	61019	61019	Hermione	197	“ otherwise he ’d have been able to tell that lot how to get in , would n’t he ? But they ’re probably watching to see whether we turn up . They know that Harry owns the house , after all . ”
61065	61071	61073	61073	Harry	177	“ How do they — ? ”
61075	61095	61019	61019	Hermione	197	“ Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry , remember ? They ’ll know Sirius left you the place . ”
61190	61196	61197	61197	she	197	“ Will you stop it ! ”
61221	61226	61228	61228	Ron	227	“ Sorry , sorry ! ”
61238	61248	61228	61228	Ron	227	“ I do n’t know I ’m doing it ! ”
61249	61262	61197	61197	she	197	“ Well , ca n’t you find something useful to occupy yourself ? ”
61263	61272	61228	61228	Ron	227	“ What , like reading kids ’ stories ? ”
61273	61282	61197	61197	she	197	“ Dumbledore left me this book , Ron — ”
61283	61300	61228	61228	Ron	227	“ — and he left me the Deluminator , maybe I ’m supposed to use it ! ”
61445	61449	61440	61440	Moody	219	“ Severus Snape ? ”
61470	61481	61440	61440	Moody	219	“ It was not I who killed you , Albus , ”
61526	61531	61516	61516	Harry	177	“ Do n’t move ! ”
61560	61568	61555	61555	she	372	“ Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house — ”
61601	61612	61571	61571	Hermione	197	“ Hold your fire , it ’s me , Remus ! ”
61613	61619	61625	61625	her	197	“ Oh , thank goodness , ”
61656	61660	61661	61661	he	177	“ Show yourself ! ”
61682	61736	61665	61665	Lupin	189	“ I am Remus John Lupin , werewolf , sometimes known as Moony , one of the four creators of the Marauder ’s Map , married to Nymphadora , usually known as Tonks , and I taught you how to produce a Patronus , Harry , which takes the form of a stag . ”
61737	61743	61745	61745	Harry	177	“ Oh , all right , ”
61751	61762	61745	61745	Harry	177	“ but I had to check , did n’t I ? ”
61763	61800	61665	61665	Lupin	189	“ Speaking as your ex - Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher , I quite agree that you had to check . Ron , Hermione , you should n’t be so quick to lower your defenses . ”
61827	61835	61836	61836	he	177	“ No sign of Severus , then ? ”
61839	61842	61844	61844	Harry	177	“ No , ”
61846	61859	61861	61861	Lupin	189	“ What ’s going on ? Is everyone okay ? ’ Yes , ”
61863	61883	61861	61861	Lupin	189	“ but we ’re all being watched . There are a couple of Death Eaters in the square outside — ”
61884	61888	61817	61817	he	177	“ We know — ”
61889	61975	61861	61861	Lupin	189	“ I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me . They ca n’t know you ’re in here or I ’m sure they ’d have more people out there ; they ’re staking out everywhere that ’s got any connection with you , Harry . Let ’s go downstairs , there ’s a lot to tell you , and I want to know what happened after you left the Burrow . ”
62031	62052	62054	62054	Lupin	189	“ I ’d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater tailing me , ”
62056	62067	62054	62054	Lupin	189	“ So , you came straight here after the wedding ? ”
62068	62071	62073	62073	Harry	177	“ No , ”
62075	62090	62073	62073	Harry	177	“ only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a cafe . ”
62101	62104	62105	62105	They	1671	“ What ? ”
62120	62149	62116	62116	Lupin	189	“ But how did they find you so quickly ? It ’s impossible to track anyone who Apparates , unless you grab hold of them as they disappear . ”
62150	62172	62174	62174	Harry	177	“ And it does n’t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time , does it ? ”
62176	62180	62182	62182	Hermione	197	“ We wondered , ”
62185	62196	62182	62182	Hermione	197	“ whether Harry could still have the Trace on him ? ”
62197	62200	62202	62202	Lupin	189	“ Impossible , ”
62214	62264	62204	62204	Ron	227	“ Apart from anything else , they ’d know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace on him , would n’t they ? But I ca n’t see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road , that ’s worrying , really worrying . ”
62282	62308	62350	62350	Hermione	197	“ Tell us what happened after we left , we have n’t heard a thing since Ron ’s dad told us the family was safe . ”
62309	62316	62318	62318	Lupin	189	“ Well , Kingsley saved us , ”
62320	62338	62318	62318	Lupin	189	“ Thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived . ”
62339	62348	62350	62350	Hermione	197	“ Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people ? ”
62352	62369	62371	62371	Lupin	189	“ A mixture ; but to all intents and purposes they ’re the same thing now , ”
62373	62424	62371	62371	Lupin	189	“ There were about a dozen of them , but they did n’t know you were there , Harry . Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him ; if it ’s true , he did n’t give you away . ”
62471	62483	62484	62484	Lupin	189	“ The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom , ”
62488	62499	62500	62500	Harry	177	“ The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms ? ”
62522	62550	62552	62552	Lupin	189	“ What you ’ve got to realize , Harry , is that the Death Eaters have got the full might of the Ministry on their side now , ”
62554	62598	62552	62552	Lupin	189	“ They ’ve got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest . They managed to penetrate every defensive spell we ’d cast against them , and once inside , they were completely open about why they ’d come . ”
62599	62617	62624	62624	her	197	“ And are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harry ’s whereabouts out of people ? ”
62627	62630	62631	62631	Lupin	189	“ Well , ”
62648	62651	62652	62652	he	189	“ Here , ”
62663	62681	62652	62652	he	189	“ you ’ll know sooner or later anyway . That ’s their pretext for going after you . ”
62787	62794	62795	62795	Lupin	189	“ I ’m sorry , Harry , ”
62798	62810	62812	62812	Hermione	197	“ So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too ? ”
62818	62828	62815	62815	Lupin	189	“ But surely people realize what ’s going on ? ”
62829	62839	62841	62841	Lupin	189	“ The coup has been smooth and virtually silent , ”
62843	62871	62815	62815	Lupin	189	“ The official version of Scrimgeour ’s murder is that he resigned ; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse , who is under the Imperius Curse . ”
62872	62883	62885	62885	Ron	227	“ Why did n’t Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic ? ”
62890	62899	62901	62901	Harry	177	“ And this dramatic change in Ministry policy , ”
62903	62915	62901	62901	Harry	177	“ involves warning the Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort ? ”
62916	62925	62927	62927	Lupin	189	“ That ’s certainly a part of it , ”
62929	62936	62927	62927	Lupin	189	“ and it is a masterstroke . ”
62965	62973	62975	62975	Ron	227	“ People wo n’t let this happen , ”
62977	62984	62986	62986	Lupin	189	“ It is happening , Ron , ”
62988	63000	62986	62986	Lupin	189	“ Muggle - borns are being rounded up as we speak . ”
63001	63014	63016	63016	Ron	227	“ But how are they supposed to have ‘ stolen ’ magic ? ”
63018	63038	63016	63016	Ron	227	“ It ’s mental , if you could steal magic there would n’t be any Squibs , would there ? ”
63039	63043	63045	63045	Lupin	189	“ I know , ”
63047	63081	63045	63045	Lupin	189	“ Nevertheless , unless you can prove that you have at least one close Wizarding relative , you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment . ”
63090	63116	63082	63082	Ron	227	“ What if purebloods and halfbloods swear a Muggle - born ’s part of their family ? I ’ll tell everyone Hermione ’s my cousin — ”
63128	63141	63117	63117	Hermione	197	“ Thank you , Ron , but I could n’t let you — ”
63142	63150	63152	63152	Ron	227	“ You wo n’t have a choice , ”
63160	63176	63152	63152	Ron	227	“ I ’ll teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it . ”
63183	63230	63231	63231	she	197	“ Ron , as we ’re on the run with Harry Potter , the most wanted person in the country , I do n’t think it matters . If I was going back to school it would be different . What ’s Voldemort planning for Hogwarts ? ”
63235	63247	63248	63248	he	189	“ Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard , ”
63295	63302	63303	63303	he	177	“ It ’s … it ’s … ”
63325	63329	63321	63321	Lupin	189	“ I know . ”
63333	63360	63321	63321	Lupin	189	“ I ’ll understand if you ca n’t confirm this , Harry , but the Order is under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission . ”
63361	63365	63366	63366	Harry	177	“ He did , ”
63369	63385	63366	63366	Harry	177	“ and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they ’re coming with me . ”
63386	63397	63321	63321	Lupin	189	“ Can you confide in me what the mission is ? ”
63423	63447	63321	63321	Lupin	189	“ I ca n’t , Remus , I ’m sorry . If Dumbledore did n’t tell you I do n’t think I can . ”
63448	63456	63458	63458	Lupin	189	“ I thought you ’d say that , ”
63463	63510	63458	63458	Lupin	189	“ But I might still be of some use to you . You know what I am and what I can do . I could come with you to provide protection . There would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to . ”
63554	63560	63561	63561	she	197	“ But what about Tonks ? ”
63564	63569	63571	63571	Lupin	189	“ What about her ? ”
63573	63576	63578	63578	Hermione	197	“ Well , ”
63582	63598	63578	63578	Hermione	197	“ you ’re married ! How does she feel about you going away with us ? ”
63599	63606	63608	63608	Lupin	189	“ Tonks will be perfectly safe , ”
63610	63620	63608	63608	Lupin	189	“ She ’ll be at her parents ’ house . ”
63685	63688	63690	63690	Hermione	197	“ Remus , ”
63693	63706	63690	63690	Hermione	197	“ is everything all right … you know … between you and — ”
63707	63715	63717	63717	Lupin	189	“ Everything is fine , thank you , ”
63751	63760	63737	63737	Lupin	189	“ Tonks is going to have a baby . ”
63761	63767	63769	63769	Hermione	197	“ Oh , how wonderful ! ”
63771	63774	63776	63776	Ron	227	“ Excellent ! ”
63779	63782	63784	63784	Harry	177	“ Congratulations , ”
63801	63860	63786	63786	Lupin	189	“ So … do you accept my offer ? Will three become four ? I can not believe that Dumbledore would have disapproved , he appointed me your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher , after all . And I must tell you that I believe we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined . ”
63869	63877	63878	63878	he	189	“ Just — just to be clear , ”
63881	63898	63878	63878	he	189	“ You want to leave Tonks at her parents ’ house and come away with us ? ”
63899	63913	63915	63915	Lupin	189	“ She ’ll be perfectly safe there , they ’ll look after her , ”
63926	63942	63917	63917	He	189	“ Harry , I ’m sure James would have wanted me to stick with you . ”
63943	63946	63948	63948	Harry	177	“ Well , ”
63951	63979	63948	63948	Harry	177	“ I ’m not . I ’m pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you are n’t sticking with your own kid , actually . ”
64026	64032	64034	64034	Lupin	189	“ You do n’t understand , ”
64038	64043	64045	64045	Harry	177	“ Explain , then , ”
64050	64078	64047	64047	Lupin	189	“ I — I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks . I did it against my better judgment and have regretted it very much every since . ”
64079	64083	64085	64085	Harry	177	“ I see , ”
64087	64105	64085	64085	Harry	177	“ so you ’re just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us ? ”
64145	64176	64119	64119	he	189	“ Do n’t you understand what I ’ve done to my wife and my unborn child ? I should never have married her , I ’ve made her an outcast ! ”
64186	64271	64177	64177	Lupin	189	“ You have only ever seen me amongst the Order , or under Dumbledore ’s protection at Hogwarts ! You do n’t know how most of the Wizarding world sees creatures like me ! When they know of my affliction , they can barely talk to me ! Do n’t you see what I ’ve done ? Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage , what parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf ? And the child — the child — ”
64286	64362	64272	64272	Lupin	189	“ My kind do n’t usually breed ! It will be like me , I am convinced of it — how can I forgive myself , when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child ? And if , by some miracle , it is not like me , then it will be better off , a hundred times so , without a father of whom it must always be ashamed ! ”
64363	64366	64372	64372	her	197	“ Remus ! ”
64375	64390	64372	64372	her	197	“ Do n’t say that — how could any child be ashamed of you ? ”
64391	64401	64403	64403	Harry	177	“ Oh , I do n’t know , Hermione , ”
64405	64414	64403	64403	Harry	177	“ I ’d be pretty ashamed of him . ”
64445	64457	64458	64458	Harry	177	“ If the new regime thinks Muggle - borns are bad , ”
64461	64508	64458	64458	Harry	177	“ what will they do to a half - werewolf whose father ’s in the Order ? My father died trying to protect my mother and me , and you reckon he ’d tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us ? ”
64509	64516	64518	64518	Lupin	189	“ How — how dare you ? ”
64520	64542	64518	64518	Lupin	189	“ This is not about a desire for — for danger or personal glory — how dare you suggest such a — ”
64543	64555	64556	64556	Harry	177	“ I think you ’re feeling a bit of a daredevil , ”
64559	64568	64556	64556	Harry	177	“ You fancy stepping into Sirius ’s shoes — ”
64569	64574	64577	64577	him	177	“ Harry , no ! ”
64590	64598	64599	64599	Harry	177	“ I ’d never have believed this , ”
64602	64615	64599	64599	Harry	177	“ The man who taught me to fight Dementors — a coward . ”
64672	64680	64681	64681	Hermione	197	“ Remus , Remus , come back ! ”
64700	64703	64705	64705	Hermione	197	“ Harry ! ”
64707	64712	64705	64705	Hermione	197	“ How could you ? ”
64713	64718	64720	64720	Harry	177	“ It was easy , ”
64751	64760	64761	64761	he	177	“ Do n’t look at me like that ! ”
64766	64774	64776	64776	Ron	227	“ Do n’t you start on her ! ”
64778	64788	64793	64793	herself	197	“ No — no — we must n’t fight ! ”
64797	64808	64809	64809	Ron	227	“ You should n’t have said that stuff to Lupin , ”
64813	64821	64823	64823	Harry	177	“ He had it coming to him , ”
64864	64867	64869	64869	Harry	177	“ Parents , ”
64871	64885	64869	64869	Harry	177	“ should n’t leave their kids unless — unless they ’ve got to . ”
64886	64889	64891	64891	Hermione	197	“ Harry — ”
64999	65011	64986	64986	He	177	“ I know I should n’t have called him a coward . ”
65012	65019	65021	65021	Ron	227	“ No , you should n’t , ”
65025	65033	64986	64986	He	177	“ But he ’s acting like one . ”
65034	65039	65041	65041	Hermione	197	“ All the same … ”
65043	65047	65049	65049	Harry	177	“ I know , ”
65051	65072	65049	65049	Harry	177	“ But if it makes him go back to Tonks , it ’ll be worth it , wo n’t it ? ”
65687	65699	65669	65669	He	177	“ Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher , Master . ”
65758	65761	65762	65762	he	233	“ What ? ”
65777	65811	65762	65762	he	233	“ Wha’ve I done ? Setting a bleedin ’ ’ ouse - elf on me , what are you playing at , wha’ve I done , lemme go , lemme go , or — ”
65812	65825	65827	65827	Harry	177	“ You ’re not in much of a position to make threats , ”
65895	65908	65910	65911	the elf	1605	“ Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief , Master , ”
65913	65939	65910	65911	the elf	1605	“ Fletcher knows how to avoid capture , has many hidey - holes and accomplices . Nevertheless , Kreacher cornered the thief in the end . ”
65940	65949	65951	65951	Harry	177	“ You ’ve done really well , Kreacher , ”
65959	65971	65972	65972	Harry	177	“ Right , we ’ve got a few questions for you , ”
65981	66041	65910	65911	the elf	1605	“ I panicked , okay ? I never wanted to come along , no offense , mate , but I never volunteered to die for you , an ’ that was bleedin ’ You - Know - Who come flying at me , anyone woulda got outta there . I said all along I did n’t wanna do it — ”
66042	66055	66057	66057	Hermione	197	“ For your information , none of the rest of us Disapparated , ”
66059	66088	65910	65911	the elf	1605	“ Well , you ’re a bunch of bleedin ’ ’ eroes then , are n’t you , but I never pretended I was up for killing meself — ”
66089	66104	66106	66106	Harry	177	“ We ’re not interested in why you ran out on Mad - Eye , ”
66122	66134	66106	66106	Harry	177	“ We already knew you were an unreliable bit of scum . ”
66135	66179	65910	65911	the elf	1605	“ Well then , why the ’ ell am I being ’ unted down by ’ ouse - elves ? Or is this about them goblets again ? I ai n’t got none of ’em left , or you could ’ ave ’em — ”
66180	66195	66197	66197	Harry	177	“ It ’s not about the goblets either , although you ’re getting warmer , ”
66199	66205	66197	66197	Harry	177	“ Shut up and listen . ”
66255	66266	66267	66267	Harry	177	“ When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable , ”
66276	66286	66271	66271	Mundungus	233	“ Sirius never cared about any of the junk — ”
66328	66348	66350	66350	Mundungus	233	“ Call ’ i m off , call ’ i m off , ’ e should be locked up ! ”
66363	66368	66370	66370	Harry	177	“ Kreacher , no ! ”
66388	66400	66372	66372	Kreacher	384	“ Perhaps just one more , Master Harry , for luck ? ”
66404	66424	66426	66426	Harry	177	“ We need him conscious , Kreacher , but if he needs persuading , you can do the honors , ”
66428	66436	66438	66438	Kreacher	384	“ Thank you very much , Master , ”
66461	66475	66476	66476	Harry	177	“ When you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find , ”
66480	66498	66476	66476	Harry	177	“ you took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard . There was a locket there . ”
66518	66526	66511	66511	Hermione	197	“ What did you do with it ? ”
66527	66530	66532	66532	Mundungus	233	“ Why ? ”
66534	66539	66532	66532	Mundungus	233	“ Is it valuable ? ”
66540	66547	66549	66549	Hermione	197	“ You ’ve still got it ! ”
66551	66558	66560	66560	Ron	227	“ No , he has n’t , ”
66563	66577	66560	66560	Ron	227	“ He ’s wondering whether he should have asked more money for it . ”
66578	66581	66583	66583	Mundungus	233	“ More ? ”
66585	66607	66583	66583	Mundungus	233	“ That would n’t have been effing difficult … bleedin ’ gave it away , di’n ’ I ? No choice . ”
66608	66614	66532	66532	Mundungus	233	“ What do you mean ? ”
66615	66682	66583	66583	Mundungus	233	“ I was selling in Diagon Alley and she come up to me and asks if I ’ve got a license for trading in magical artifacts . Bleedin ’ snoop . She was gon na fine me , but she took a fancy to the locket an ’ told me she ’d take it and let me off that time , and to fink meself lucky . ”
66683	66689	66691	66691	Harry	177	“ Who was this woman ? ”
66693	66701	66583	66583	Mundungus	233	“ I dunno , some Ministry hag . ”
66711	66723	66724	66724	He	233	“ Little woman . Bow on top of ’ er head . ”
66730	66736	66724	66724	He	233	“ Looked like a toad . ”
66759	66762	66764	66764	Hermione	197	“ Aquamenti ! ”
67280	67283	67285	67285	him	177	“ Severus Snape ”
67302	67309	67310	67310	he	177	“ I did n’t kill you , ”
67359	67372	67347	67348	Mrs. Black	372	“ I ’ve got news , and you wo n’t like it . ”
67477	67494	67496	67496	Kreacher	384	“ Shoes off , if you please , Master Harry , and hands washed before dinner , ”
67529	67534	67535	67535	Ron	227	“ What ’s happened ? ”
67614	67617	67619	67619	Ron	227	“ No ! ”
67643	67650	67652	67652	Ron	227	“ ‘ Merlin ’s pants ’ ? ”
67657	67663	67664	67664	He	227	“ She must be upset . ”
67677	67717	67664	67664	He	227	“ The other teachers wo n’t stand for this , McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout all know the truth , they know how Dumbledore died . They wo n’t accept Snape as headmaster . And who are these Carrows ? ”
67718	67722	67724	67724	Harry	177	“ Death Eaters , ”
67726	67756	67757	67757	Harry	177	“ There are pictures of them inside . They were at the top of the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore , so it ’s all friends together . And , ”
67767	67830	67757	67757	Harry	177	“ I ca n’t see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay . If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape it ’ll be a choice between staying and teaching , or a nice few years in Azkaban — and that ’s if they ’re lucky . I reckon they ’ll stay to try and protect the students . ”
67862	67867	67869	67869	Harry	177	“ Thanks , Kreacher , ”
67887	67900	67869	67869	Harry	177	“ Well , at least we know exactly where Snape is now . ”
67942	67955	67956	67956	he	177	“ There are still a load of Death Eaters watching this house , ”
67963	67990	67956	67956	he	177	“ more than usual . It ’s like they ’re hoping we ’ll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the Hogwarts Express . ”
67997	68025	67991	67991	Ron	227	“ I ’ve been thinking about that all day . It left nearly six hours ago . Weird , not being on it , is n’t it ? ”
68099	68110	68111	68111	Harry	177	“ They nearly saw me coming back in just now , ”
68114	68128	68111	68111	Harry	177	“ I landed badly on the top step , and the Cloak slipped . ”
68129	68142	68143	68143	Ron	227	“ I do that every time . Oh , here she is , ”
68158	68175	68143	68143	Ron	227	“ And what in the name of Merlin ’s most baggy Y Fronts was that about ? ”
68176	68181	68182	68182	Hermione	197	“ I remembered this , ”
68260	68264	68268	68268	she	197	“ Phineas Nigellus , ”
68284	68287	68289	68289	Ron	227	“ Sorry ? ”
68375	68389	68390	68390	Hermione	197	“ Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him , ”
68400	68423	68390	68390	Hermione	197	“ But let him try it now , all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag . ”
68424	68428	68430	68430	Ron	227	“ Good thinking ! ”
68435	68439	68441	68441	Hermione	197	“ Thank you , ”
68449	68459	68441	68441	Hermione	197	“ So , Harry , what else happened today ? ”
68460	68463	68465	68465	Harry	177	“ Nothing , ”
68467	68492	68465	68465	Harry	177	“ Watched the Ministry entrance for seven hours . No sign of her . Saw your dad though , Ron . He looks fine . ”
68560	68577	68578	68578	Ron	227	“ Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work , ”
68581	68604	68578	68578	Ron	227	“ That ’s why we have n’t seen Umbridge , she ’d never walk , she ’d think she ’s too important . ”
68605	68622	68623	68623	Hermione	197	“ And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes ? ”
68626	68636	68638	68638	Ron	227	“ Oh yeah , the bloke from Magical Maintenance , ”
68640	68651	68652	68652	Hermione	197	“ How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance ? ”
68661	68673	68652	68652	Hermione	197	“ Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes . ”
68674	68682	68683	68683	Hermione	197	“ But you never told us that ! ”
68711	68724	68725	68725	she	197	“ There ’s nothing in here about navy blue robes , nothing ! ”
68734	68742	68652	68652	Hermione	197	“ Well , does it really matter ? ”
68743	68811	68870	68870	Hermione	197	“ Ron , it all matters ! If we ’re going to get into the Ministry and not give ourselves away when they ’re bound to be on the lookout for intruders , every little detail matters ! We ’ve been over and over this , I mean , what ’s the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you are n’t even bothering to tell us — ”
68812	68823	68652	68652	Hermione	197	“ Blimey , Hermione , I forget one little thing — ”
68824	68856	68870	68870	Hermione	197	“ You do realize , do n’t you , that there ’s probably no more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the Ministry of — ”
68857	68866	68868	68868	Harry	177	“ I think we should do it tomorrow , ”
68886	68889	68891	68891	Hermione	197	“ Tomorrow ? ”
68893	68901	68891	68891	Hermione	197	“ You are n’t serious , Harry ? ”
68902	68906	68908	68908	Harry	177	“ I am , ”
68910	68972	68908	68908	Harry	177	“ I do n’t think we ’re going to be much better prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another month . The longer we put it off , the farther away that locket could be . There ’s already a good chance Umbridge has chucked it away ; the thing does n’t open . ”
68973	68976	68978	68978	Ron	227	“ Unless , ”
68980	68995	68978	68978	Ron	227	“ she ’s found a way of opening it and she ’s now possessed . ”
68996	69014	69015	69015	Harry	177	“ Would n’t make any difference to her , she was so evil in the first place , ”
69028	69034	69035	69035	Harry	177	“ We know everything important , ”
69042	69109	69035	69035	Harry	177	“ We know they ’ve stopped Apparition in and out of the Ministry ; We know only the most senior Ministry members are allowed to connect their homes to the Floo Network now , because Ron heard those two Unspeakables complaining about it . And we know roughly where Umbridge ’s office is , because of what you heard the bearded bloke saying to his mate — ”
69110	69127	69128	69128	Hermione	197	“ ‘ I ’ll be up on level one , Dolores wants to see me , ’ ”
69132	69135	69137	69137	Harry	177	“ Exactly , ”
69139	69170	69137	69137	Harry	177	“ And we know you get in using those funny coins , or tokens , or whatever they are , because I saw that witch borrowing one from her friend — ”
69171	69179	69035	69035	Harry	177	“ But we have n’t got any ! ”
69180	69190	69191	69191	Harry	177	“ If the plan works , we will have , ”
69195	69226	69035	69035	Harry	177	“ I do n’t know , Harry , I do n’t know … There are an awful lot of things that could go wrong , so much relies on chance … ”
69227	69241	69243	69243	Harry	177	“ That ’ll be true even if we spend another three months preparing , ”
69245	69252	69243	69243	Harry	177	“ It ’s time to act . ”
69403	69407	69409	69409	Ron	227	“ All right , ”
69412	69432	69409	69409	Ron	227	“ let ’s say we go for it tomorrow … I think it should just be me and Harry . ”
69433	69442	69444	69444	Hermione	197	“ Oh , do n’t start that again ! ”
69446	69454	69444	69444	Hermione	197	“ I thought we ’d settled this . ”
69455	69475	69476	69476	Ron	227	“ It ’s one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak , but this is different , Hermione , ”
69492	69510	69476	69476	Ron	227	“ You ’re on the list of Muggle - borns who did n’t present themselves for interrogation ! ”
69511	69549	69476	69476	Ron	227	“ And you ’re supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the Burrow ! If anyone should n’t go , it ’s Harry , he ’s got a ten - thousand - Galleon price on his head — ”
69550	69558	69560	69560	Harry	177	“ Fine , I ’ll stay here , ”
69562	69576	69560	69560	Harry	177	“ Let me know if you ever defeat Voldemort , wo n’t you ? ”
69623	69639	69640	69640	Ron	227	“ Well , if all three of us go we ’ll have to Disapparate separately , ”
69644	69655	69640	69640	Ron	227	“ We ca n’t all fit under the Cloak anymore . ”
69677	69704	69673	69673	Kreacher	384	“ Master has not finished his soup , would master prefer the savory stew , or else the treacle tart to which Master is so partial ? ”
69705	69723	69673	69673	Kreacher	384	“ Thanks , Kreacher , but I ’ll be back in a minute — er — bathroom . ”
69870	69873	69856	69856	she	1771	“ Gregorovitch ? ”
69907	69912	69881	69881	She	1771	“ I want Gregorovitch . ”
69913	69920	69921	69921	she	1771	“ Er wohnt hier nicht mehr ! ”
69928	69944	69925	69925	her	1771	“ He no live here ! He no live here ! I know him not ! ”
69982	69987	69972	69972	his	177	“ Where is he ? ”
69988	70000	69972	69972	his	177	“ He move ! I know not , I know not ! ”
70035	70040	70018	70018	She	1771	“ Harry ! HARRY ! ”
70061	70067	70053	70053	Hermione	197	“ Harry , open up ! ”
70121	70127	70129	70129	Hermione	197	“ What were you doing ? ”
70132	70140	70142	70142	Harry	177	“ What d’you think I was doing ? ”
70147	70155	70157	70157	Ron	227	“ You were yelling your head off ! ”
70159	70170	70109	70109	he	227	“ Oh yeah … I must ’ve dozed off or — ”
70171	70181	70183	70183	Hermione	197	“ Harry , please do n’t insult our intelligence , ”
70189	70205	70183	70183	Hermione	197	“ We know your scar hurt downstairs , and you ’re white as a sheet . ”
70216	70257	70109	70109	he	227	“ Fine . I ’ve just seen Voldemort murdering a woman . By now he ’s probably killed her whole family . And he did n’t need to . It was Cedric all over again , they were just there … ”
70258	70271	70275	70275	her	197	“ Harry , you are n’t supposed to let this happen anymore ! ”
70282	70320	70275	70275	her	197	“ Dumbledore wanted you to use Occlumency ! He thought the connection was dangerous — Voldemort can use it , Harry ! What good is it to watch him kill and torture , how can it help ? ”
70321	70332	70334	70334	Harry	177	“ Because it means I know what he ’s doing , ”
70336	70350	70275	70275	her	197	“ So you ’re not even going to try to shut him out ? ”
70351	70374	70275	70275	her	197	“ Hermione , I ca n’t . You know I ’m lousy at Occlumency . I never got the hang of it . ”
70375	70381	70382	70382	she	197	“ You never really tried ! ”
70386	70409	70382	70382	she	197	“ I do n’t get it , Harry — do you like having this special connection or relationship or what — whatever — ”
70423	70427	70428	70428	he	177	“ Like it ? ”
70432	70438	70428	70428	he	177	“ Would you like it ? ”
70439	70455	70415	70415	he	177	“ I — no — I’m sorry , Harry . I just did n’t mean — ”
70456	70492	70428	70428	he	177	“ I hate it , I hate the fact that he can get inside me , that I have to watch him when he ’s most dangerous . But I ’m going to use it . ”
70493	70496	70415	70415	he	177	“ Dumbledore — ”
70497	70520	70428	70428	he	177	“ Forget Dumbledore . This is my choice , nobody else ’s . I want to know why he ’s after Gregorovitch . ”
70521	70524	70415	70415	he	177	“ Who ? ”
70525	70532	70534	70534	Harry	177	“ He ’s a foreign wandmaker , ”
70536	70549	70534	70534	Harry	177	“ He made Krum ’s wand and Krum reckons he ’s brilliant . ”
70550	70556	70558	70558	Ron	227	“ But according to you , ”
70560	70585	70558	70558	Ron	227	“ Voldemort ’s got Ollivander locked up somewhere . If he ’s already got a wandmaker , what does he need another one for ? ”
70586	70626	70534	70534	Harry	177	“ Maybe he agrees with Krum , maybe he thinks Gregorovitch is better … or else he thinks Gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing me , because Ollivander did n’t know . ”
70647	70659	70661	70661	Hermione	197	“ Harry , you keep talking about what your wand did , ”
70663	70684	70661	70661	Hermione	197	“ but you made it happen ! Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power ? ”
70685	70708	70709	70709	They	1778	“ Because I know it was n’t me ! And so does Voldemort , Hermione ! We both know what really happened ! ”
70759	70763	70764	70764	he	227	“ Drop it , ”
70768	70796	70764	70764	he	227	“ It ’s up to him . And if we ’re going to the Ministry tomorrow , do n’t you reckon we should go over the plan ? ”
70984	70989	70995	70995	he	227	“ You look terrible , ”
71003	71008	71010	71010	Harry	177	“ Not for long , ”
71045	71048	71049	71049	she	197	“ Robes , ”
71072	71101	71049	71049	she	197	“ Polyjuice Potion … Invisibiliity Cloak … Decoy Detonators … You should each take a couple just in case … Puking Pastilles , Nosebleed Nougat , Extendable Ears … ”
71135	71139	71141	71141	Ron	227	“ Bless him , ”
71144	71165	71141	71141	Ron	227	“ and when you think I used to fantasize about cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall … ”
71270	71274	71279	71279	her	197	“ Right then , ”
71282	71299	71279	71279	her	197	“ she ought to be here in about five minutes . When I ’ve Stunned her — ”
71300	71306	71308	71308	Ron	227	“ Hermione , we know , ”
71311	71327	71308	71308	Ron	227	“ And I thought we were supposed to open the door before she got here ? ”
71331	71339	71340	71340	She	197	“ I nearly forgot ! Stand back — ”
71402	71406	71407	71407	she	197	“ And now , ”
71422	71430	71407	71407	she	197	“ we put on the Cloak again — ”
71431	71437	71438	71438	Ron	227	“ — and we wait , ”
71533	71539	71541	71541	Ron	227	“ Nicely done , Hermione , ”
71611	71617	71618	71618	he	227	“ She ’s Mafalda Hopkirk , ”
71640	71655	71618	71618	he	227	“ You ’d better take this , Hermione , and here are the tokens . ”
71724	71739	71709	71709	she	197	“ We ’re running late , Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any second . ”
71786	71793	71776	71781	a small , ferrety looking wizard	1811	“ Oh , hello , Mafalda . ”
71794	71797	71799	71799	Hermione	197	“ Hello ! ”
71805	71811	71799	71799	Hermione	197	“ How are you today ? ”
71812	71819	71821	71823	the little wizard	1812	“ Not so good , actually , ”
71849	71861	71863	71863	Hermione	197	“ I ’m sorry to hear you ’re under the weather , ”
71891	71898	71872	71872	he	1816	“ Here , have a sweet . ”
71899	71907	71914	71914	Hermione	197	“ Eh ? Oh , no thanks — ”
71908	71912	71914	71914	Hermione	197	“ I insist ! ”
71976	71980	71981	71981	she	197	“ Oh dear ! ”
71992	72002	71981	71981	she	197	“ Perhaps you ’d better take the day off ! ”
72003	72008	72009	72009	He	1816	“ No — no ! ”
72027	72036	72009	72009	He	1816	“ I must — today — must go — ”
72037	72044	72046	72046	Hermione	197	“ But that ’s just silly ! ”
72050	72079	72046	72046	Hermione	197	“ You ca n’t go to work in this state — I think you ought to go to St. Mungo ’s and get them to sort you out . ”
72100	72111	72113	72113	Hermione	197	“ You simply ca n’t go to work like this ! ”
72171	72174	72176	72176	Hermione	197	“ Urgh , ”
72192	72205	72176	72176	Hermione	197	“ It would have made much less mess to Stun him too . ”
72206	72209	72211	72211	Ron	227	“ Yeah , ”
72224	72262	72211	72211	Ron	227	“ but I still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention . Keen on his job , though , is n’t he ? Chuck us the hair and the potion , then . ”
72295	72331	72267	72267	Ron	227	“ Weird he was n’t wearing them today , was n’t it , seeing how much he wanted to go ? Anyway , I ’m Reg Cattermole , according to the label in the back . ”
72332	72337	72338	72338	Hermione	197	“ Now wait here , ”
72350	72362	72338	72338	Hermione	197	“ and we ’ll be back with some hairs for you . ”
72400	72409	72410	72410	Hermione	197	“ We do n’t know who he is , ”
72420	72444	72410	72410	Hermione	197	“ but he ’s gone home with a dreadful nosebleed ! Here , he ’s pretty tall , you ’ll need bigger robes … ”
72524	72531	72533	72533	Ron	227	“ Blimey , that ’s scary , ”
72546	72554	72555	72555	Hermione	197	“ Take one of Mafalda ’s tokens , ”
72559	72570	72555	72555	Hermione	197	“ and let ’s go , it ’s nearly nine . ”
72604	72613	72619	72619	she	197	“ See you in a moment , then , ”
72657	72662	72671	72671	he	1838	“ Morning , Reg ! ”
72689	72721	72671	72671	he	1838	“ Blooming pain in the bum , this , eh ? Forcing us all to get to work this way ! Who are they expecting to turn up , Harry Potter ? ”
72738	72741	72742	72742	he	227	“ Yeah , ”
72745	72752	72742	72742	he	227	“ stupid , is n’t it ? ”
72817	72825	72826	72826	he	177	“ We have to flush ourselves in ? ”
72829	72834	72835	72835	Harry	177	“ Looks like it , ”
73064	73080	73052	73053	Another wizard	1850	“ Out of the way , ca n’t y — oh , sorry , Runcorn . ”
73103	73106	73112	73112	he	177	“ Psst ! ”
73143	73152	73153	73153	Hermione	197	“ You got in all right , then ? ”
73158	73169	73171	73171	Ron	227	“ No , he ’s still stuck in the hog , ”
73173	73187	73188	73188	she	197	“ Oh , very funny … It ’s horrible , is n’t it ? ”
73201	73211	73188	73188	she	197	“ Have you seen what they ’re sitting on ? ”
73270	73273	73275	73275	Hermione	197	“ Muggles , ”
73277	73291	73275	73275	Hermione	197	“ In their rightful place . Come on , let ’s get going . ”
73370	73373	73374	73374	They	1854	“ Cattermole ! ”
73457	73462	73463	73463	Yaxley	173	“ Morning , Yaxley ! ”
73467	73489	73463	73463	Yaxley	173	“ I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out my office , Cattermole . It ’s still raining in there . ”
73505	73522	73502	73502	nobody	694	“ Raining … in your office ? That’s — that ’s not good , is it ? ”
73534	73546	73529	73529	Yaxley	173	“ You think it ’s funny , Cattermole , do you ? ”
73563	73566	73568	73568	Ron	227	“ No , ”
73570	73576	73568	73568	Ron	227	“ no , of course — ”
73577	73637	73547	73550	A pair of witches	1870	“ You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife , Cattermole ? In fact , I ’m quite surprised you ’re not down there holding her hand while she waits . Already given her up as a bad job , have you ? Probably wise . Be sure and marry a pureblood next time . ”
73660	73665	73667	73667	Ron	227	“ I — I — ”
73669	73681	73683	73683	Yaxley	173	“ But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood , ”
73685	73733	73683	73683	Yaxley	173	“ — not that any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such filth — and the Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing , I would make it my priority to do this job , Cattermole . Do you understand me ? ”
73734	73737	73739	73739	Ron	227	“ Yes , ”
73741	73777	73739	73739	Ron	227	“ Then attend to it , Cattermole , and if my office is not completely dry within an hour , your wife ’s Blood Status will be in even greater doubt than it is now . ”
73849	73857	73858	73858	Ron	227	“ What am I going to do ? ”
73870	73888	73866	73866	he	227	“ If I do n’t turn up , my wife … I mean , Cattermole ’s wife — ”
73889	73901	73903	73903	Harry	177	“ We ’ll come with you , we should stick together — ”
73912	73947	73866	73866	he	227	“ That ’s mental , we have n’t got much time . You two find Umbridge , I ’ll go and sort out Yaxley ’s office — but how do I stop a raining ? ”
73948	73953	73955	73955	Hermione	197	“ Try Finite Incantatem , ”
73959	74006	73955	73955	Hermione	197	“ that should stop the rain if it ’s a hex or curse ; if it does n’t something ’s gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm , which will be more difficult to fix , so as an interim measure try Impervius to protect his belongings — ”
74007	74014	74016	74016	Ron	227	“ Say it again , slowly — ”
74043	74075	73955	73955	Hermione	197	“ Level four , Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures , incorporating Beast , Being , and Spirit Divisions , Goblin Liaison Office , and Pest Advisory Bureau , ”
74106	74111	74113	74116	a bushily whiskered man	1879	“ Morning , Albert , ”
74156	74182	74146	74147	The wizard	1311	“ Dirk Cresswell , eh ? From Goblin Liaison ? Nice one , Albert . I ’m pretty confident I ’ll get his job now ! ”
74206	74232	74234	74236	the disembodied witch	1883	“ Level two , Department of Magical Law Enforcement , including the Improper Use of Magic Office , Auror Headquarters , and Wizengamot Administration Services , ”
74281	74314	74275	74275	Hermione	197	“ Actually , Harry , I think I ’d better go after him , I do n’t think he knows what he ’s doing and if he gets caught the whole thing — ”
74315	74326	74275	74275	Hermione	197	“ Level one , Minister of Magic and Support Staff . ”
74385	74390	74392	74392	Umbridge	403	“ Ah , Mafalda ! ”
74398	74406	74392	74392	Umbridge	403	“ Travers sent you , did he ? ”
74407	74412	74414	74414	Hermione	197	“ Y - yes , ”
74416	74425	74426	74426	Umbridge	403	“ God , you ’ll do perfectly well . ”
74436	74462	74463	74463	She	197	“ That ’s that problem solved . Minister , if Mafalda can be spared for record - keeping we shall be able to start straightaway . ”
74468	74497	74498	74498	She	197	“ Ten people today and one of them the wife of a Ministry employee ! Tut , tut … even here , in the heart of the Ministry ! ”
74523	74553	74520	74521	the Minister	4848	“ We ’ll go straight down , Mafalda , you ’ll find everything you need in the courtroom . Good morning , Albert , are n’t you getting out ? ”
74554	74560	74562	74562	Harry	177	“ Yes , of course , ”
74621	74629	74631	74635	the new Minister of Magic	1894	“ What brings you here , Runcorn ? ”
74672	74679	74680	74680	Harry	177	“ Needed a quick word with , ”
74689	74702	74680	74680	Harry	177	“ Arthur Weasley . Someone said he was up on level one . ”
74703	74706	74708	74709	Plum Thicknesse	413	“ Ah , ”
74711	74722	74708	74709	Plum Thicknesse	413	“ Has he been caught having contact with an Undesirable ? ”
74723	74726	74728	74728	Harry	177	“ No , ”
74734	74741	74728	74728	Harry	177	“ No , nothing like that . ”
74742	74755	74757	74757	Thicknesse	413	“ Ah , well . It ’s only a matter of time , ”
74759	74780	74757	74757	Thicknesse	413	“ If you ask me , the blood traitors are as bad as the Mudbloods . Good day , Runcorn . ”
74781	74787	74728	74728	Harry	177	“ Good day , Minister . ”

83364	83389	83349	83349	Ron	227	“ but it feels like a — a jinx or something . Ca n’t we call him You - Know - Who — please ? ”
83390	83398	83400	83400	Harry	177	“ Dumbledore said fear of a name — ”
83402	83431	83432	83432	Ron	227	“ In case you had n’t noticed , mate , calling You - Know - Who by his name did n’t do Dumbledore much good in the end , ”
83436	83452	83432	83432	Ron	227	“ Just — just show You - Know - Who some respect , will you ? ”
83453	83456	83457	83457	Harry	177	“ Respect ? ”
83574	83581	83583	83583	Hermione	197	“ I ’ll make some tea , ”
83650	83659	83645	83645	Ron	227	“ What d’you reckon happened to the Cattermoles ? ”
83660	83671	83673	83673	Hermione	197	“ With any luck , they ’ll have got away , ”
83682	83728	83673	83673	Hermione	197	“ As long as Mr. Cattermole had his wits about him , he ’ll have transported Mrs. Cattermole by Side - Along - Apparition and they ’ll be fleeing the country right now with their children . That ’s what Harry told her to do . ”
83729	83737	83739	83739	Ron	227	“ Blimey , I hope they escaped , ”
83764	83813	83818	83818	Hermione	197	“ I did n’t get the feeling Reg Cattermole was all that quick - witted , though , the way everyone was talking to me when I was him . God , I hope they made it … If they both end up in Azkaban because of us … ”
83888	83896	83897	83897	Harry	177	“ So , have you got it ? ”
83910	83916	83917	83917	she	197	“ Got — got what ? ”
83924	83943	83917	83917	she	197	“ What did we just go through all that for ? The locket ! Where ’s the locket ? ”
83944	83949	83951	83951	Ron	227	“ You got it ? ”
83962	83977	83951	83951	Ron	227	“ No one tells me anything ! Blimey , you could have mentioned it ! ”
83978	83996	83998	83998	Hermione	197	“ Well , we were running for our lives from the Death Eaters , were n’t we ? ”
84000	84003	83998	83998	Hermione	197	“ Here . ”
84058	84073	84075	84075	Ron	227	“ There is n’t any chance someone ’s destroyed it since Kreacher had it ? ”
84078	84091	84075	84075	Ron	227	“ I mean , are we sure it ’s still a Horcrux ? ”
84092	84097	84099	84099	Hermione	197	“ I think so , ”
84112	84127	84099	84099	Hermione	197	“ There ’d be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed . ”
84175	84182	84184	84184	Harry	177	“ I reckon Kreacher ’s right , ”
84186	84206	84184	84184	Harry	177	“ We ’re going to have to work out how to open this thing before we can destroy it . ”
84313	84321	84322	84322	Ron	227	“ Can you feel it , though ? ”
84339	84344	84330	84330	he	227	“ What d’you mean ? ”
84395	84405	84406	84406	Hermione	197	“ What are we going to do with it ? ”
84409	84422	84423	84423	Harry	177	“ Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it . ”
84467	84483	84484	84484	he	177	“ I think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent , ”
84494	84511	84512	84512	he	177	“ And we ’ll need to think about some food as well . You stay there , ”
85404	85412	85381	85381	Snape	172	“ Give it to me , Gregorovitch . ”
85518	85541	85515	85516	Father Christmas	438	“ I have it not , I have it no more ! It was , many years ago , stolen from me ! ”
85542	85559	85498	85498	He	2127	“ Do not lie to Lord Voldemort , Gregorovitch . He knows … He always knows . ”
85730	85738	85740	85743	the high cold voice	2135	“ Who was the thief , Gregorovitch ? ”
85745	85765	85740	85743	the high cold voice	2135	“ I do not know , I never knew , a young man — no — please — PLEASE ! ”
85781	85784	85740	85743	the high cold voice	2135	“ Harry ! ”
85845	85848	85849	85849	he	177	“ Dream , ”
85868	85876	85849	85849	he	177	“ Must ’ve dozed off , sorry . ”
85877	85901	85825	85825	Hermione	197	“ I know it was your scar ! I can tell by the look on your face ! You were looking into Vol — ”
85902	85909	85911	85911	Ron	227	“ Do n’t say his name ! ”
85922	85925	85927	85927	Hermione	197	“ Fine , ”
85929	85940	85927	85927	Hermione	197	“ You - Know - Who ’s mind , then ! ”
85941	85950	85951	85951	Harry	177	“ I did n’t mean it to happen ! ”
85954	85970	85951	85951	Harry	177	“ It was a dream ! Can you control what you dream about , Hermione ? ”
85971	85980	85927	85927	Hermione	197	“ If you just learned to apply Occlumency — ”
86001	86031	85927	85927	Hermione	197	“ He ’s found Gregorovitch , Hermione , and I think he ’s killed him , but before he killed him he read Gregorovitch ’s mind and I saw — ”
86032	86052	86054	86054	Hermione	197	“ I think I ’d better take over the watch if you ’re so tired you ’re falling sleep , ”
86057	86064	85927	85927	Hermione	197	“ I can finish the watch ! ”
86065	86078	86079	86079	She	197	“ No , you ’re obviously exhausted . Go and lie down . ”
86164	86174	86144	86144	Ron	227	“ What ’s You - Know - Who doing ? ”
86194	86210	86175	86175	Harry	177	“ He found Gregorovitch . He had him tied up , he was torturing him . ”
86211	86228	86175	86175	Harry	177	“ How ’s Gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if he ’s tied up ? ”
86229	86241	86175	86175	Harry	177	“ I dunno … It ’s weird , is n’t it ? ”
86298	86305	86306	86306	Harry	177	“ He wanted something from Gregorovitch , ”
86314	86338	86306	86306	Harry	177	“ He asked him to hand it over , but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him … and then … then … ”
86360	86417	86342	86342	he	177	“ He read Gregorovitch ’s mind , and I saw this young bloke perched on a windowsill , and he fired a curse at Gregorovitch and jumped out of sight . He stole it , he stole whatever You - Know - Who ’s after . And I … I think I ’ve seen him somewhere … ”
86480	86491	86477	86477	Ron	227	“ Could n’t you see what the thief was holding ? ”
86492	86502	86477	86477	Ron	227	“ No … it must ’ve been something small . ”
86503	86506	86477	86477	Ron	227	“ Harry ? ”
86522	86544	86477	86477	Ron	227	“ Harry , you do n’t reckon You - Know - Who ’s after something else to turn into a Horcrux ? ”
86545	86551	86553	86553	Harry	177	“ I do n’t know , ”
86556	86586	86553	86553	Harry	177	“ Maybe . But would n’t it be dangerous for him to make another one ? Did n’t Hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already ? ”
86587	86598	86477	86477	Ron	227	“ Yeah , but maybe he does n’t know that . ”
86599	86604	86606	86606	Harry	177	“ Yeah … maybe , ”
87083	87092	87094	87094	Ron	227	“ But you can make a brilliant Patronus ! ”
87118	87126	87127	87127	he	177	“ I could n’t … make one , ”
87137	87143	87127	87127	he	177	“ Would n’t … come . ”
87249	87259	87306	87306	Perkins	337	“ So we still have n’t got any food . ”
87260	87266	87268	87268	Hermione	197	“ Shut up , Ron , ”
87270	87292	87268	87268	Hermione	197	“ Harry , what happened ? Why do you think you could n’t make your Patronus ? You managed perfectly yesterday ! ”
87293	87299	87306	87306	Perkins	337	“ I do n’t know . ”
87362	87365	87366	87366	he	227	“ What ? ”
87371	87392	87366	87366	he	227	“ I ’m starving ! All I ’ve had since I bled half to death is a couple of toadstools ! ”
87393	87406	87408	87408	Harry	177	“ You go and fight your way through the Dementors , then , ”
87412	87431	87366	87366	he	227	“ I would , but my arm ’s in a sling , in case you had n’t noticed ! ”
87432	87437	87366	87366	he	227	“ That ’s convenient . ”
87438	87447	87366	87366	he	227	“ And what ’s that supposed to — ? ”
87448	87452	87454	87454	Hermione	197	“ Of course ! ”
87470	87481	87482	87482	she	197	“ Harry , give me the locket ! Come on , ”
87497	87509	87482	87482	she	197	“ the Horcrux , Harry , you ’re still wearing it ! ”
87567	87570	87572	87572	Hermione	197	“ Better ? ”
87574	87580	87572	87572	Hermione	197	“ Yeah , loads better ! ”
87581	87584	87585	87585	she	197	“ Harry , ”
87608	87621	87585	87585	she	197	“ you do n’t think you ’ve been possessed , do you ? ”
87622	87627	87628	87628	he	177	“ What ? No ! ”
87632	87676	87628	87628	he	177	“ I remember everything we ’ve done while I ’ve been wearing it . I would n’t know what I ’d done if I ’d been possessed , would I ? Ginny told me there were times when she could n’t remember anything . ”
87677	87680	87682	87682	Hermione	197	“ Hmm , ”
87691	87711	87682	87682	Hermione	197	“ Well , maybe we ought not to wear it . We can just keep it in the tent . ”
87712	87722	87723	87723	Harry	177	“ We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around , ”
87727	87738	87723	87723	Harry	177	“ If we lose it , if it gets stolen — ”
87739	87748	87753	87753	she	197	“ Oh , all right , all right , ”
87773	87790	87753	87753	she	197	“ But we ’ll take turns wearing it , so nobody keeps it on too long . ”
87791	87794	87796	87796	Ron	227	“ Great , ”
87799	87815	87796	87796	Ron	227	“ and now we ’ve sorted that out , can we please get some food ? ”
87816	87829	87831	87831	Hermione	197	“ Fine , but we ’ll go somewhere else to find it , ”
87839	87853	87831	87831	Hermione	197	“ There ’s no point staying where we know Dementors are swooping around . ”
87885	87894	87896	87896	Hermione	197	“ It ’s not stealing , is it ? ”
87910	87922	87896	87896	Hermione	197	“ Not if I left some money under the chicken coo ? ”
87935	87952	87923	87923	Ron	227	“ Er - my - nee , ’ oo worry ’ oo much . ’ Elax ! ”
88133	88138	88140	88140	his	227	“ So where next ? ”
88306	88328	88330	88330	Ron	227	“ Yeah , let ’s go to Albania . Should n’t take more than an afternoon to search an entire country , ”
88333	88365	88367	88367	Hermione	197	“ There ca n’t be anything there . He ’d already made five of his Horcruxes before he went into exile , and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth , ”
88369	88385	88367	88367	Hermione	197	“ We know the snake ’s not in Albania , it ’s usually with Vol — ”
88386	88397	88476	88476	Ron	227	“ Did n’t I ask you to stop say that ? ”
88398	88414	88367	88367	Hermione	197	“ Fine ! The snake is usually with You - Know - Who — happy ? ”
88415	88419	88476	88476	Ron	227	“ Not particularly . ”
88420	88433	88435	88435	Harry	177	“ I ca n’t see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes , ”
88457	88475	88435	88435	Harry	177	“ Borgin and Burke were experts at Dark objects , they would ’ve recognized a Horcrux straightaway . ”
88494	88506	88490	88490	Harry	177	“ I still reckon he might have hidden something at Hogwarts . ”
88510	88520	88507	88507	Hermione	197	“ But Dumbledore would have found it , Harry ! ”
88535	88565	88521	88521	Harry	177	“ Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of Hogwarts secrets . I ’m telling you , if there was one place Vol — ”
88566	88569	88490	88490	Harry	177	“ Oi ! ”
88570	88579	88580	88580	Harry	177	“ YOU - KNOW - WHO , then ! ”
88587	88608	88580	88580	Harry	177	“ If there was one place that was really important to You - Know - Who , it was Hogwarts ! ”
88609	88615	88617	88617	Ron	227	“ Oh , come on , ”
88619	88623	88617	88617	Ron	227	“ His school ? ”
88624	88657	88580	88580	Harry	177	“ Yeah , his school ! It was his first real home , the place that meant he was special : it meant everything to him , and even after he left — ”
88658	88676	88678	88678	Ron	227	“ This is You - Know - Who we ’re talking about , right ? Not you ? ”
88706	88727	88729	88729	Hermione	197	“ You told us that You - Know - Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job after he left , ”
88731	88736	88738	88738	Harry	177	“ That ’s right , ”
88740	88768	88729	88729	Hermione	197	“ And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something , probably another founder ’s object , to make into another Horcrux ? ”
88769	88772	88774	88774	Harry	177	“ Yeah , ”
88776	88788	88790	88790	Hermione	197	“ But he did n’t get the job , did he ? ”
88792	88813	88790	88790	Hermione	197	“ So he never got the chance to find a founder ’s object there and hide it in the school ! ”
88814	88819	88821	88821	Harry	177	“ Okay , then , ”
88825	88829	88821	88821	Harry	177	“ Forget Hogwarts . ”
88890	88899	88900	88900	Hermione	197	“ We could try digging in to foundations ? ”
88904	88914	88915	88915	Harry	177	“ He would n’t have hidden a Horcrux here , ”
89165	89173	89175	89175	Ron	227	“ What ? What did you see ? ”
89183	89187	89189	89189	Harry	177	“ A face , ”
89194	89206	89189	89189	Harry	177	“ The same face . The thief who stole from Gregorovitch . ”
89643	89647	89649	89649	Ron	227	“ My mother , ”
89665	89676	89649	89649	Ron	227	“ can make good food appear out of thin air . ”
89746	89758	89760	89760	Hermione	197	“ Your mother ca n’t produce food out of thin air , ”
89762	89784	89760	89760	Hermione	197	“ no one can . Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp ’s Law of Elemental Transfigura — ”
89785	89795	89796	89796	Ron	227	“ Oh , speak English , ca n’t you ? ”
89808	89848	89760	89760	Hermione	197	“ It ’s impossible to make good food out of nothing ! You can Summon it if you know where it is , you can transform it , you can increase the quantity if you ’ve already got some — ”
89849	89862	89864	89864	Ron	227	“ Well , do n’t bother increasing this , it ’s disgusting , ”
89866	89903	89760	89760	Hermione	197	“ Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it ! I notice I ’m always the one who ends up sorting out the food , because I ’m a girl , I suppose ! ”
89904	89920	89923	89923	Ron	227	“ No , it ’s because you ’re supposed to be the best at magic ! ”
89942	89983	89925	89925	Hermione	197	“ You can do the cooking tomorrow , Ron , you can find the ingredients and try and charm them into something worth eating , and I ’ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see you — ”
89984	89988	89990	89990	Harry	177	“ Shut up ! ”
90002	90007	89990	89990	Harry	177	“ Shut up now ! ”
90012	90027	90008	90008	Hermione	197	“ How can you side with him , he hardly ever does the cook — ”
90028	90039	90040	90040	He	177	“ Hermione , be quiet , I can hear someone ! ”
90087	90098	90099	90099	he	177	“ You cast the Muffliato charm over us , right ? ”
90104	90109	90110	90110	she	197	“ I did everything , ”
90114	90143	90110	90110	she	197	“ Muffliato , Muggle - Repelling and Disillusionment Charms , all of it . They should n’t be able to hear of see us , whoever they are . ”
90351	90376	90346	90349	a weary male voice	2228	“ There ought to be a few salmon in here , or d’you reckon it ’s too early in the season ? Accio Salmon ! ”
90519	90526	90513	90515	the first man	2234	“ Here , Griphook , Gornuk . ”
90537	90541	90543	90544	the goblins	2236	“ Thank you , ”
90549	90562	90513	90515	the first man	2234	“ So , you three have been on the run how long ? ”
90592	90601	90603	90605	the tired man	2238	“ Six weeks … Seven … I forget , ”
90607	90635	90603	90605	the tired man	2238	“ Met up with Griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with Gornuk not long after . Nice to have a but of company . ”
90657	90665	90667	90668	the man	4959	“ What made you leave , Ted ? ”
90670	90678	90683	90683	Ted	245	“ Knew they were coming for me , ”
90697	90777	90690	90690	he	245	“ Heard Death Eaters were in the area last week and decided I ’d better run for it . Refused to register as a Muggle - born on principle , see , so I knew it was a matter of time , knew I ’d have to leave in the end . My wife should be okay , she ’s pure - blood . And then I met Dean here , what , a few days ago , son ? ”
90778	90781	90787	90787	Harry	177	“ Yeah , ”
90818	90825	90827	90829	the first man	2234	“ Muggle - born , eh ? ”
90831	90835	90837	90837	Dean	443	“ Not sure , ”
90839	90863	90837	90837	Dean	443	“ My dad left my mum when I was a kid . I ’ve got no proof he was a wizard , though . ”
90883	90913	90879	90879	Ted	245	“ I ’ve got to say , Dirk , I ’m surprised to run into you . Pleased , but surprised . Word was that you ’d been caught . ”
90914	90918	90920	90920	Dirk	412	“ I was , ”
90922	90992	90920	90920	Dirk	412	“ I was halfway to Azkaban when I made a break for it . Stunned Dawlish , and nicked his broom . It was easier than you ’d think ; I do n’t reckon he ’s quite right at the moment . Might be Confunded . If so , I ’d like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it , probably saved my life . ”
91012	91042	91008	91009	The Ted	245	“ And where do you two fit in ? I , er , had the impression the goblins were for You - Know - Who , on the whole . ”
91043	91050	91052	91058	the higher - voiced of the goblins	2245	“ You had a false impression , ”
91060	91073	91052	91058	the higher - voiced of the goblins	2245	“ We take no sides . This is a wizards ’ war . ”
91074	91084	91008	91009	The Ted	245	“ How come you ’re in hiding , then ? ”
91085	91091	91093	91097	the deeper - voiced goblin	2247	“ I deemed in prudent , ”
91099	91120	91093	91097	the deeper - voiced goblin	2247	“ Having refused what I considered an impertinent request , I could see that my person safety was in jeopardy . ”
91121	91130	91132	91132	Ted	245	“ What did they ask you to do ? ”
91134	91145	91147	91148	the goblin	2248	“ Duties ill - befitting the dignity of my race , ”
91161	91170	91150	91150	his	2248	“ I am not a house - elf . ”
91171	91178	91214	91214	his	2248	“ What about you , Griphook ? ”
91179	91183	91185	91188	the higher voiced goblin	2249	“ Similar reasons , ”
91190	91209	91185	91188	the higher voiced goblin	2249	“ Gringotts is no longer under the sole control of my race . I recognize no Wizarding master . ”
91223	91229	91231	91231	Dean	443	“ What ’s the joke ? ”
91233	91237	91239	91239	Dirk	412	“ He said , ”
91241	91253	91239	91239	Dirk	412	“ that there are things wizards do n’t recognize , either . ”
91260	91267	91269	91269	Dean	443	“ I do n’t get it , ”
91271	91281	91283	91283	Griphook	441	“ I had my small revenge before I left , ”
91287	91297	91299	91299	Ted	245	“ Good man — goblin , I should say , ”
91302	91325	91299	91299	Ted	245	“ Did n’t manage to lock a Death Eater up in one of the old high - security vaults , I suppose ? ”
91326	91341	91343	91343	Griphook	441	“ If I had , the sword would not have helped him break out , ”
91356	91366	91368	91368	Ted	245	“ Dean and I are still missing something here , ”
91370	91383	91385	91385	Griphook	441	“ So is Severus Snape , though he does not know it , ”
91422	91432	91434	91434	Dirk	412	“ Did n’t you hear about that , Ted ? ”
91436	91455	91434	91434	Dirk	412	“ About the kids who tried to steal Gryffindor ’s sword out of Snape ’s office at Hogwarts ? ”
91477	91483	91485	91485	Ted	245	“ Never heard a word , ”
91487	91496	91485	91485	Ted	245	“ Not in the Prophet , was it ? ”
91497	91500	91502	91502	Dirk	412	“ Hardly , ”
91504	91539	91502	91502	Dirk	412	“ Griphook here told me , he heard about it from Bill Weasley who works for the bank . One of the kids who tried to take the sword was Bill ’s younger sister . ”
91560	91606	91608	91608	Ted	245	“ She and a couple of friends got into Snape ’s office and smashed open the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword . Snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the staircase . Ah , God bless ’em , ”
91610	91637	91608	91608	Ted	245	“ What did they think , that they ’d be able to use the sword on You - Know - Who ? Or on Snape himself ? ”
91638	91663	91665	91665	Dirk	412	“ Well , whatever they thought they were going to do with it , Snape decided the sword was n’t safe where it was , ”
91667	91704	91665	91665	Dirk	412	“ Couple of days later , once he ’d got the say - so from You - Know - Who , I imagine , he sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts instead . ”
91712	91721	91723	91723	Ted	245	“ I ’m still not seeing the joke , ”
91725	91731	91733	91733	Griphook	441	“ It ’s a fake , ”
91735	91741	91733	91733	Griphook	441	“ The sword of Gryffindor ! ”
91742	91803	91733	91733	Griphook	441	“ Oh yes . It is a copy — an excellent copy , it is true — but it was Wizard - made . The original was forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only goblin - made armor possesses . Wherever the genuine sword of Gryffindor is , it is not in a vault at Gringotts bank . ”
91804	91808	91810	91810	Ted	245	“ I see , ”
91812	91839	91841	91841	Griphook	441	“ And I take it you did n’t bother telling the Death Eaters this ? ’ I saw no reason to trouble them with the information , ”
91898	91916	91887	91887	he	443	“ What happened to Ginny and all the others ? The ones who tried to steal it ? ”
91917	91927	91929	91929	Griphook	441	“ Oh , they were punished , and cruelly , ”
91932	91939	91941	91941	Ted	245	“ They ’re okay , though ? ”
91944	91963	91941	91941	Ted	245	“ I mean , the Weasleys do n’t need any more of their kids injured , do they ? ”
91964	91978	91980	91980	Griphook	441	“ They suffered no serious injury , as far as I am aware , ”
91982	91987	91989	91989	Ted	245	“ Lucky for them , ”
91991	92009	91989	91989	Ted	245	“ With Snape ’s track record I suppose we should just be glad they ’re still alive . ”
92010	92023	92025	92025	Dirk	412	“ You believe that story , then , do you , Ted ? ”
92027	92038	92040	92040	Ted	245	“ You believe Snape killed Dumbledore ? Course I do , ”
92042	92063	92040	92040	Ted	245	“ You ’re not going to sit there and tell me you think Potter had anything to do with it ? ”
92064	92074	92076	92076	Dirk	412	“ Hard to know what to believe these days , ”
92078	92084	92086	92086	Dean	443	“ I know Harry Potter , ”
92088	92110	92086	92086	Dean	443	“ And I reckon he ’s the real thing — the Chosen One , or whatever you want to call it . ”
92111	92128	92130	92130	Dirk	412	“ Yeah , there ’s a lot would like to believe he ’s that , son , ”
92132	92199	92130	92130	Dirk	412	“ me included . But where is he ? Run for it , by the looks of things . You ’d think if he knew anything we do n’t , or had anything special going for him , he ’d be out there now fighting , rallying resistance , instead of hiding . And you know , the Prophet made a pretty good case against him — ”
92200	92204	92206	92206	Ted	245	“ The Prophet ? ”
92208	92234	92206	92206	Ted	245	“ You deserve to be lied to if you ’re still reading that much , Dirk . You want the facts , try The Quibbler . ”
92270	92282	92267	92267	he	412	“ The Quibbler ? That lunatic rag of Xeno Lovegood ’s ? ”
92283	92292	92294	92294	Ted	245	“ It ’s not so lunatic these days , ”
92296	92380	92294	92294	Ted	245	“ You want to give it a look , Xeno is printing all the stuff the Prophet ’s ignoring , not a single mention of Crumple - Horned Snorkacks in the last issue . How long they ’ll let him get with it , mind , I do n’t know . But Xeno says , front page of every issue , that any wizard who ’s against You - Know - Who ought to make helping Harry Potter their number - one priority . ”
92381	92397	92399	92399	Dirk	412	“ Hard to help a boy who ’s vanished off the face of the earth , ”
92401	92420	92422	92422	Ted	245	“ Listen , the fact that they have n’t caught him yet ’s one hell of an achievement , ”
92424	92449	92422	92422	Ted	245	“ I ’d take tips from him gladly ; it ’s what we ’re trying to do , stay free , is n’t it ? ”
92450	92462	92464	92464	Dirk	412	“ Yeah , well , you ’ve got a point there , ”
92467	92511	92464	92464	Dirk	412	“ With the whole of the Ministry and all their informers looking for him , I ’d have expected him to be caught by now . Mind , who ’s to say they have n’t already caught and killed him without publicizing it ? ”
92512	92522	92524	92524	Ted	245	“ Ah , do n’t say that , Dirk , ”
92627	92633	92620	92620	himself	177	“ Ginny — the sword — ”
92634	92638	92640	92640	Hermione	197	“ I know ! ”
92663	92670	92671	92671	she	197	“ Here … we … are … ”
92742	92760	92761	92761	she	197	“ If somebody swapped the real sword for the face while it was in Dumbledore ’s office , ”
92776	92792	92761	92761	she	197	“ Phineas Nigellus would have seen it happen , he hangs right beside the case ! ”
92793	92799	92801	92801	Harry	177	“ Unless he was asleep , ”
92834	92842	92828	92828	her	197	“ Er — Phineas ? Phineas Nigellus ? ”
92846	92850	92852	92852	Hermione	197	“ Phineas Nigellus ? ”
92855	92868	92852	92852	Hermione	197	“ Professor Black ? Please could we talk to you ? Please ? ”
92869	92876	92828	92828	her	197	“ ‘ Please ’ always helps , ”
92898	92901	92895	92895	Hermione	197	“ Obscura ! ”
92927	92938	92852	92852	Hermione	197	“ What — how dare — what are you — ? ”
92939	92948	92950	92950	Hermione	197	“ I ’m very sorry , Professor Black , ”
92952	92960	92950	92950	Hermione	197	“ but it ’s a necessary precaution ! ”
92961	92993	92852	92852	Hermione	197	“ Remove this foul addition at once ! Remove it , I say ! You are ruining a great work of art ! Where am I ? What is going on ? ”
92994	93001	93003	93003	Harry	177	“ Never mind where we are , ”
93020	93033	92852	92852	Hermione	197	“ Can that possible be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter ? ”
93034	93037	93039	93039	Harry	177	“ Maybe , ”
93051	93069	93039	93039	Harry	177	“ We ’ve got a couple of questions to ask you — about the sword of Gryffindor . ”
93070	93073	93075	93076	Phineas Nigellus	378	“ Ah , ”
93095	93106	93075	93076	Phineas Nigellus	378	“ yes . That silly girl acted most unwisely there — ”
93107	93114	93116	93116	Ron	227	“ Shut up about my sister , ”
93125	93131	93132	93132	he	378	“ Who else is here ? ”
93143	93165	93132	93132	he	378	“ Your tone displeases me ! The girl and her friends were foolhardily in the extreme . Thieving from the headmaster . ”
93166	93172	93174	93174	Harry	177	“ They were n’t thieving , ”
93176	93184	93174	93174	Harry	177	“ That sword is n’t Snape ’s . ”
93185	93194	93196	93197	Phineas Nigellus	378	“ It belongs to Professor Snape ’s school , ”
93199	93226	93196	93197	Phineas Nigellus	378	“ Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it ? She deserved her punishment , as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity ! ”
93227	93240	93242	93242	Hermione	197	“ Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity ! ”
93244	93249	93251	93252	Phineas Nigellus	378	“ Where am I ? ”
93262	93281	93251	93252	Phineas Nigellus	378	“ Where have you brought me ? Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears ? ”
93282	93298	93300	93300	Harry	177	“ Never mind that ! How did Snape punish Ginny , Neville , and Luna ? ”
93303	93323	93300	93300	Harry	177	“ Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest , to do some work for the oaf , Hagrid . ”
93324	93331	93333	93333	Hermione	197	“ Hagrid ’s not an oaf ! ”
93336	93347	93349	93349	Harry	177	“ And Snape might ’ve though that was a punishment , ”
93351	93384	93349	93349	Harry	177	“ but Ginny , Neville , and Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid . The Forbidden Forest … they ’ve faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest , big deal ! ”
93403	93441	93442	93443	Phineas Nigellus	378	“ What we really wanted to know , Professor Black , is whether anyone else has , um , taken out the sword at all ? Maybe it ’s been taken away for cleaning — or something ! ”
93456	93461	93462	93462	he	378	“ Muggle - borns , ”
93465	93492	93462	93462	he	378	“ Goblin - made armor does not require cleaning , simple girl . Goblin ’s silver repels mundane dirt , imbibing only that which strengthens it . ”
93493	93500	93502	93502	Harry	177	“ Do n’t call Hermione simple , ”
93504	93511	93513	93514	Phineas Nigellus	378	“ I grow weary of contradiction , ”
93516	93531	93513	93514	Phineas Nigellus	378	“ perhaps it is time for me to return to the headmaster ’s office ? ”
93567	93577	93561	93561	Harry	177	“ Dumbledore ! Ca n’t you bring us Dumbledore ? ”
93578	93584	93586	93587	Phineas Nigellus	378	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
93589	93606	93561	93561	Harry	177	“ Professor Dumbledore ’s portrait — couldn’t you bring him along , here , into yours ? ”
93620	93696	93610	93610	his	378	“ Evidently it is not only Muggle - borns who are ignorant , Potter . The portraits of Hogwarts may commune with each other , but they can not travel outside of the castle except to visit a painting of themselves elsewhere . Dumbledore can not come here with me , and after the treatment I have received at your hands , I can assure you that I will not be making a return visit ! ”
93711	93715	93717	93717	Hermione	197	“ Professor Black , ”
93719	93752	93717	93717	Hermione	197	“ could n’t you just tell us , please , when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case ? Before Ginny took it out , I mean ? ”
93757	93785	93753	93753	Phineas	378	“ I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its case was when Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a ring . ”
93816	93824	93825	93825	he	378	“ Well , good night to you , ”
93858	93869	93852	93852	Harry	177	“ Wait ! Have you told Snape you saw this ? ”
93881	93905	93873	93873	his	378	“ Professor Snape has more important things on his mind that the many eccentricities of Albus Dumbledore . Good - bye , Potter ! ”
93923	93926	93927	93927	Hermione	197	“ Harry ! ”
93930	93934	93935	93935	Harry	177	“ I know ! ”
94015	94043	93997	93997	she	197	“ The sword can destroy Horcruxes ! Goblin - made blades imbibe only that which strengthens them — Harry , that sword ’s impregnated with basilisk venom ! ”
94044	94068	93997	93997	she	197	“ And Dumbledore did n’t five it to me because he still needed it , he wanted to use it on the locket — ”
94069	94091	93997	93997	she	197	“ — and he must have realized they would n’t let you have it if he put it in his will — ”
94092	94100	93997	93997	she	197	“ — so he made a copy — ”
94101	94112	93997	93997	she	197	“ — and put a fake in the glass case — ”
94113	94124	93997	93997	she	197	“ — and he left the real one — where ? ”
94175	94178	94180	94180	Hermione	197	“ Think ! ”
94182	94192	94180	94180	Hermione	197	“ Think ! Where would he have left it ? ”
94193	94198	94200	94200	Harry	177	“ Not at Hogwarts , ”
94206	94211	94213	94213	Hermione	197	“ Somewhere in Hogsmeade ? ”
94215	94220	94222	94222	Harry	177	“ The Shrieking Shack ? ”
94224	94231	94222	94222	Harry	177	“ Nobody ever goes in there . ”
94232	94249	94213	94213	Hermione	197	“ But Snape knows how to get in , would n’t that be a bit risky ? ”
94250	94255	94256	94256	Harry	177	“ Dumbledore trusted Snape , ”
94260	94273	94275	94275	Hermione	197	“ Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords , ”
94277	94284	94286	94286	Harry	177	“ Yeah , you ’re right ! ”
94312	94336	94298	94298	Dumbledore	207	“ So , would he have hidden the sword well away from Hogsmeade , then ? What d’you reckon , Ron ? Ron ? ”
94370	94379	94380	94380	he	177	“ Oh , remembered me , have you ? ”
94383	94386	94387	94387	Ron	227	“ What ? ”
94401	94415	94390	94390	he	227	“ You two carry on . Do n’t let me spoil your fun . ”
94438	94444	94446	94446	Harry	177	“ What ’s the problem ? ”
94448	94456	94458	94458	Ron	227	“ Problem ? There ’s no problem , ”
94467	94475	94458	94458	Ron	227	“ Not according to you , anyways . ”
94493	94503	94505	94505	Harry	177	“ Well , you ’ve obviously got a problem , ”
94507	94515	94505	94505	Harry	177	“ Spit it out , will you ? ”
94535	94582	94528	94528	He	227	“ All right , I ’ll spit it out . Do n’t expect me to skip up and down the tent because there ’s some other damn thing we ’ve got to find . Just add it to the list of stuff you do n’t know . ”
94583	94589	94591	94591	Harry	177	“ I do n’t know ? ”
94593	94599	94591	94591	Harry	177	“ I do n’t know ? ”
94655	94671	94673	94673	Ron	227	“ It ’s not like I ’m not having the time of my life here , ”
94675	94718	94673	94673	Ron	227	“ you know , with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night . I just hoped , you know , after we ’d been running round a few weeks , we ’d have achieved something . ”
94719	94722	94723	94723	Hermione	197	“ Ron , ”
94753	94765	94767	94767	Harry	177	“ I thought you knew what you ’d signed up for , ”
94769	94778	94857	94857	his	227	“ Yeah , I thought I did too . ”
94779	94793	94795	94795	Harry	177	“ So what part of it is n’t living up to your expectations ? ”
94805	94838	94857	94857	his	227	“ Did you think we ’d be staying in five - star hotels ? Finding a Horcrux every other day ? Did you think you ’d be back to Mummy by Christmas ? ”
94839	94849	94851	94851	Ron	227	“ We thought you knew what you were doing ! ”
94864	94883	94857	94857	his	227	“ We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do , we thought you had a real plan ! ”
94884	94887	94889	94889	Hermione	197	“ Ron ! ”
94911	94920	94922	94922	Harry	177	“ Well , sorry to let you down , ”
94936	94970	94922	94922	Harry	177	“ I ’ve been straight with you from the start . I told you everything Dumbledore told me . And in the case you have n’t noticed , we ’ve found one Horcrux — ”
94971	95001	95014	95014	her	197	“ Yeah , and we ’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them — nowhere effing near in other words . ”
95002	95010	95014	95014	her	197	“ Take off the locket , Ron , ”
95019	95042	95014	95014	her	197	“ Please take it off . You would n’t be talking like this if you had n’t been wearing it all day . ”
95043	95049	95051	95051	Harry	177	“ Yeah , he would , ”
95062	95096	95051	95051	Harry	177	“ D’you think I have n’t noticed the two of you whispering behind my back ? D’you think I did n’t guess you were thinking this stuff ? Harry , we were n’t — ”
95097	95102	95103	95103	Ron	227	“ Do n’t lie ! ”
95108	95135	95103	95103	Ron	227	“ You said it too , you said you were disappointed , you said you ’d thought he had a bit more to go on than — ”
95136	95151	95152	95152	she	197	“ I did n’t say it like that — Harry , I did n’t ! ”
95238	95246	95247	95247	Harry	177	“ So why are you still here ? ”
95251	95255	95257	95257	Ron	227	“ Search me , ”
95259	95264	95266	95266	Harry	177	“ Go home then , ”
95268	95275	95277	95277	Ron	227	“ Yeah , maybe I will ! ”
95293	95356	95280	95280	he	227	“ Did n’t you hear what they said about my sister ? But you do n’t give a rat ’s fart , do you , it ’s only the Forbidden Forest , Harry I’ve - Faced - Worse Potter does n’t care what happened to her in there — well , I do , all right , giant spiders and mental stuff — ”
95357	95374	95280	95280	he	227	“ I was only saying — she was with the others , they were with Hagrid — ”
95375	95412	95280	95280	he	227	“ Yeah , I get it , you do n’t care ! And what about the rest of my family , ‘ the Weasleys do n’t need another kid injured , ’ did you hear that ? ”
95413	95418	95280	95280	he	227	“ Yeah , I — ”
95419	95428	95280	95280	he	227	“ Not bothered what it meant , though ? ”
95429	95432	95437	95437	her	197	“ Ron ! ”
95442	95506	95437	95437	her	197	“ I do n’t think it means anything new has happened , anything we do n’t know about ; think , Ron , Bill ’s already scared , plenty of people must have seen that George has lost an ear by now , and you ’re supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit , I ’m sure that ’s all he meant — ”
95507	95550	95607	95607	Ron	227	“ Oh , you ’re sure , are you ? Right then , well , I wo n’t bother myself about them . It ’s all right for you , is n’t it , with your parents safely out of the way — ”
95551	95557	95558	95558	Harry	177	“ My parents are dead ! ”
95561	95571	95573	95573	Ron	227	“ And mine could be going the same way ! ”
95575	95579	95581	95581	Harry	177	“ Then GO ! ”
95583	95606	95581	95581	Harry	177	“ Go back to them , pretend you ’re got over your spattergroit and Mummy’ll be able to feed you up and — ”
95634	95637	95638	95638	she	197	“ Protego ! ”
95715	95720	95721	95721	Harry	177	“ Leave the Horcrux , ”
95746	95752	95741	95741	He	177	“ What are you doing ? ”
95753	95759	95741	95741	He	177	“ What do you mean ? ”
95760	95768	95741	95741	He	177	“ Are you staying , or what ? ”
95769	95772	95773	95773	She	197	“ I … ”
95777	95802	95773	95773	She	197	“ Yes — yes , I ’m staying . Ron , we said we ’d go with Harry , we said we ’d help — ”
95803	95812	95741	95741	He	177	“ I get it . You choose him . ”
95813	95826	95773	95773	She	197	“ Ron , no — please — come back , come back ! ”
95886	95897	95875	95875	she	197	“ He ’s g - g - gone ! Disapparated ! ”
96283	96293	96280	96280	Ron	227	“ We thought you knew what you were doing ! ”
97565	97568	97532	97532	He	177	“ Hermione ? ”
97569	97572	97573	97573	She	197	“ Hmm ? ”
97688	97698	97711	97711	she	197	“ Hermione , I ’ve been thinking , and — ”
97699	97709	97711	97711	she	197	“ Harry , could you help me with something ? ”
97732	97738	97739	97739	she	197	“ Look at that symbol , ”
97781	97790	97739	97739	she	197	“ I never took Ancient Runes , Hermione . ”
97791	97864	97739	97739	she	197	“ I know that ; but it is n’t a rune and it ’s not in the syllabary , either . All along I thought it was a picture of an eye , but I do n’t think it is ! It ’s been inked in , look , somebody ’s drawn it there , it is n’t really part of the book . Think , have you ever seen it before ? ”
97865	97874	97875	97875	Harry	177	“ No … No , wait a moment . ”
97879	97895	97875	97875	Harry	177	“ Is n’t it the same symbol Luna ’s dad was wearing round his neck ? ”
97896	97906	97875	97875	Harry	177	“ Well , that ’s what I thought too ! ”
97907	97915	97875	97875	Harry	177	“ Then it ’s Grindelwald ’s mark . ”
97923	97926	97875	97875	Harry	177	“ What ? ”
97927	97932	97933	97933	He	177	“ Krum told me … ”
97951	97956	97957	97957	She	197	“ Grindelwald ’s mark ? ”
97969	97995	97957	97957	She	197	“ I ’ve never heard that Grindelwald had a mark . There ’s no mention of it in anything I ’ve ever read about him . ”
97996	98021	98022	98022	She	197	“ Well , like I say , Krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at Durmstrang , and Grindelwald put it there . ”
98032	98059	97957	97957	She	197	“ That ’s very odd . If it ’s a symbol of Dark Magic , what ’s it doing in a book of children ’s stories ? ”
98060	98067	98069	98069	Harry	177	“ Yeah , it is weird , ”
98071	98096	98069	98069	Harry	177	“ And you ’d think Scrimgeour would have recognized it . He was Minister , he ought to have been expert on Dark stuff . ”
98097	98125	97957	97957	She	197	“ I know … Perhaps he thought it was an eye , just like I did . All the other stories have little pictures over the titles . ”
98144	98147	97957	97957	She	197	“ Hermione ? ”
98148	98151	97957	97957	She	197	“ Hmm ? ”
98152	98169	97957	97957	She	197	“ I ’ve been thinking . I — I want to go to Godric ’s Hollow . ”
98198	98201	98202	98202	she	197	“ Yes , ”
98205	98223	98202	98202	she	197	“ Yes , I ’ve been wondering that too . I really think we ’ll have to . ”
98224	98231	98232	98232	he	177	“ Did you hear me right ? ”
98235	98295	98202	98202	she	197	“ Of course I did . You want to go to Godric ’s Hollow . I agree . I think we should . I mean , I ca n’t think of anywhere else it could be either . It ’ll be dangerous , but the more I think about it , the more likely it seems it ’s there . ”
98296	98303	98305	98305	Harry	177	“ Er — what ’s there ? ”
98319	98352	98202	98202	she	197	“ Well , the sword , Harry ! Dumbledore must have known you ’d want to go back there , and I mean , Godric ’s Hollow is Godric Gryffindor ’s birthplace — ”
98353	98363	98202	98202	she	197	“ Really ? Gryffindor came from Godric ’s Hollow ? ”
98364	98377	98202	98202	she	197	“ Harry , did you ever even open A History of Magic ? ”
98378	98381	98382	98382	he	177	“ Erm , ”
98405	98424	98382	98382	he	177	“ I might ’ve opened it , you know , when I bought it … just the once … ”
98425	98446	98450	98450	She	197	“ Well , as the village is named after him I ’d have thought you might have made the connection , ”
98479	98495	98468	98468	her	197	“ There ’s a bit about the village in A History of Magic , wait … ”
98536	98545	98546	98546	Hermione	197	“ You and your parents are n’t mentioned , ”
98553	98599	98546	98546	Hermione	197	“ because Professor Bagshot does n’t cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century . But you see ? Godric ’s Hollow , Godric Gryffindor , Gryffindor ’s sword ; do n’t you think Dumbledore would have expected you to make the connection ? ”
98600	98604	98605	98605	Harry	177	“ Oh yeah … ”
98664	98670	98671	98671	he	177	“ Remember what Muriel said ? ”
98675	98678	98661	98662	Bathilda Bagshot	366	“ Who ? ”
98679	98683	98684	98684	he	177	“ You know , ”
98697	98717	98687	98687	He	177	“ Ginny ’s great - aunt . At the wedding . The one who said you had skinny ankles . ”
98718	98721	98723	98723	Hermione	197	“ Oh , ”
98748	98760	98744	98744	He	177	“ She said Bathilda Bagshot still lived in Godric ’s Hollow . ”
98761	98765	98767	98767	Hermione	197	“ Bathilda Bagshot , ”
98788	98794	98770	98770	her	197	“ Well , I suppose — ”
98837	98840	98841	98841	he	177	“ What ? ”
98850	98873	98841	98841	he	177	“ What did you do that for ? I thought you ’d seen a Death Eater unzipping the tent , at least — ”
98874	98893	98841	98841	he	177	“ Harry , what if Bathilda ’s got the sword ? What if Dumbledore entrusted it to her ? ”
98916	98919	98914	98914	she	366	“ gaga . ”
99008	99028	98994	98994	she	197	“ Yeah , he might have done ! So , are we going to go to Godric ’s Hollow ? ”
99029	99044	99045	99045	She	197	“ Yes , but we ’ll have to think it through carefully , Harry . ”
99072	99141	99065	99065	her	197	“ We ’ll need to practice Disapparating together under the Invisibility Cloak for a start , and perhaps Disillusionment Charms would be sensible too , unless you think we should go the whole hog and use Polyjuice Potion ? In that case we ’ll need to collect hair from somebody . I actually think we ’d better do that , Harry , the thicker our disguises the better … ”
99632	99637	99638	99638	Hermione	197	“ All this snow ! ”
99644	99683	99638	99638	Hermione	197	“ Why did n’t we think of snow ? After all our precautions , we ’ll leave prints ! We ’ll just have to get rid of them — you go in front , I ’ll do it — ”
99708	99716	99718	99718	Harry	177	“ Let ’s take off the Cloak , ”
99726	99745	99722	99722	she	197	“ Oh , come on , we do n’t look like us and there ’s no one around . ”
100031	100041	100043	100043	Hermione	197	“ Harry , I think it ’s Christmas Eve ! ”
100045	100049	100043	100043	Hermione	197	“ Is it ? ”
100067	100074	100076	100076	Hermione	197	“ I ’m sure it is , ”
100084	100110	100076	100076	Hermione	197	“ They … they ’ll be in there , wo n’t they ? Your mum and dad ? I can see the graveyard behind it . ”
100181	100186	100177	100177	she	197	“ Harry , look ! ”
100308	100312	100314	100314	Harry	177	“ C’m on , ”
100553	100574	100546	100546	Harry	177	“ Look at this , it ’s an Abbott , could be some long - lost relation of Hannah ’s ! ”
100575	100581	100582	100582	Hermione	197	“ Keep your voice down , ”
100632	100637	100675	100675	She	197	“ Harry , here ! ”
100662	100667	100638	100638	Hermione	197	“ Is it — ? ”
100668	100674	100675	100675	She	197	“ No , but look ! ”
100955	100964	100965	100965	Hermione	197	“ Are you sure he never mentioned — ? ”
100968	100971	100973	100973	Harry	177	“ No , ”
100978	100984	100973	100973	Harry	177	“ let ’s keep looking , ”
101009	101012	101014	101014	Hermione	197	“ Here ! ”
101026	101038	101014	101014	Hermione	197	“ Oh no , sorry ! I thought it said Potter . ”
101061	101069	101058	101058	her	197	“ Harry , come back a moment . ”
101092	101095	101083	101083	his	177	“ What ? ”
101096	101101	101058	101058	her	197	“ Look at this ! ”
101127	101138	101119	101119	Hermione	197	“ Harry , that ’s the mark in the book ! ”
101179	101186	101144	101144	she	197	“ Yeah … it could be … ”
101201	101211	101189	101189	her	197	“ It says Ig — Ignotus , I think … ”
101212	101226	101227	101227	Harry	177	“ I ’m going to keep looking for my parents , all right ? ”
101427	101437	101442	101442	her	197	“ Harry , they ’re here … right here . ”
101587	101600	101579	101579	he	177	“ ‘ The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death ’ … ”
101615	101629	101579	101579	he	177	“ Is n’t that a Death Eater idea ? Why is that there ? ”
101630	101648	101652	101652	her	197	“ It does n’t mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it , Harry , ”
101656	101671	101652	101652	her	197	“ It means … you know … living beyond death . Living after death . ”
102004	102009	102016	102016	They	805	“ Harry , stop . ”
102010	102015	102016	102016	They	805	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
102028	102049	102016	102016	They	805	“ There ’s someone there . Someone watching us . I can tell . There , over by the bushes . ”
102077	102082	102016	102016	They	805	“ Are you sure ? ”
102083	102096	102097	102097	She	2442	“ I saw something move . I could have sworn I did … ”
102107	102113	102114	102114	Harry	177	“ We look like Muggles , ”
102118	102143	102016	102016	They	805	“ Muggles who ’ve just been laying flowers on your parents ’ grave ? Harry , I ’m sure there ’s someone over there ! ”
102193	102199	102201	102201	Harry	177	“ It ’s a cat , ”
102209	102244	102201	102201	Harry	177	“ or a bird . If it was a Death Eater we ’d be dead by now . But let ’s get out of here , and we can put the Cloak back on . ”
102343	102350	102340	102340	Hermione	197	“ Let ’s go this way , ”
102418	102429	102431	102431	Hermione	197	“ How are we going to find Bathilda ’s house ? ”
102446	102456	102443	102443	her	197	“ Harry ? What do you think ? Harry ? ”
102509	102512	102501	102501	she	197	“ Harry — ”
102513	102522	102491	102491	he	177	“ Look … Look at it , Hermione … ”
102523	102530	102501	102501	she	197	“ I do n’t … oh ! ”
102646	102656	102658	102658	Hermione	197	“ I wonder why nobody ’s ever rebuilt it ? ”
102660	102668	102669	102669	Harry	177	“ Maybe you ca n’t rebuild it ? ”
102672	102690	102669	102669	Harry	177	“ Maybe it ’s like the injuries from Dark Magic and you ca n’t repair the damage ? ”
102724	102746	102747	102747	His	177	“ You ’re not going to go inside ? It looks unsafe , it might — oh , Harry , look ! ”
102799	102868	102912	102912	others	711	“ On this spot , on this night of 31 October 1981 , Lily and James lost their lives . Their son , Harry , remains the only wizard ever to have survived the Killing Curse . This house , invisible to Muggles , has been left in its ruined state as a monument to the Potters and as a reminder of the violence that tore apart their family ”
102949	102959	102961	102961	Hermione	197	“ They should n’t have written on the sign ! ”
102971	102984	102966	102966	Harry	177	“ It ’s brilliant . I ’m glad they did . I … ”
103279	103285	103273	103273	her	197	“ How does she know ? ”
103421	103426	103411	103411	Harry	177	“ Are you Bathilda ? ”
103716	103719	103720	103720	Harry	177	“ Bathilda ? ”
103804	103814	103816	103816	Hermione	197	“ Harry , I ’m not sure about this , ”
103818	103837	103839	103839	Harry	177	“ Look at the size of her , I think we could overpower her if we had to , ”
103841	103865	103839	103839	Harry	177	“ Listen , I should have told you , I knew she was n’t all there . Muriel called her ‘ gaga . ’ ”
103866	103869	103871	103871	Bathilda	366	“ Come ! ”
103885	103890	103892	103892	Harry	177	“ It ’s okay , ”

104380	104388	104389	104389	he	177	“ Do you know who this is ? ”
104401	104415	104389	104389	he	177	“ This man ? Do you know him ? What ’s he called ? ”
104436	104442	104443	104443	he	177	“ Who is this man ? ”
104447	104455	104457	104457	Hermione	197	“ Harry , what are you doing ? ”
104459	104479	104480	104480	he	177	“ This picture . Hermione , it ’s the thief , the thief who stole from Gregorovitch ! Please ! ”
104485	104490	104480	104480	he	177	“ Who is this ? ”
104498	104513	104515	104515	Hermione	197	“ Why did you ask us to come with you , Mrs.—Miss — Bagshot ? ”
104522	104532	104518	104518	her	197	“ Was there something you wanted to tell us ? ”
104566	104573	104574	104574	he	177	“ You want us to leave ? ”
104598	104616	104577	104577	She	366	“ Oh , right … Hermione , I think she wants me to go upstairs with her . ”
104617	104621	104623	104623	Hermione	197	“ All right , ”
104625	104630	104623	104623	Hermione	197	“ let ’s go . ”
104655	104666	104638	104638	her	366	“ She wants me to go with her , alone . ”
104667	104670	104672	104672	Hermione	197	“ Why ? ”
104700	104717	104691	104691	her	2512	“ Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me , and only to me ? ”
104718	104729	104675	104675	her	197	“ Do you really think she knows who you are ? ”
104730	104733	104735	104735	Harry	177	“ Yes , ”
104748	104754	104735	104735	Harry	177	“ I think she does . ”
104755	104767	104778	104778	She	366	“ Well , okay then , but be quick , Harry . ”
104768	104773	104774	104774	Harry	177	“ Lead the way , ”
104962	104965	104967	104967	Harry	177	“ Lumos , ”
105000	105005	105006	105006	she	366	“ You are Potter ? ”
105009	105015	104979	104979	Bathilda	366	“ Yes , I am . ”
105043	105051	105052	105052	Harry	177	“ Have you got anything for me ? ”

105164	105172	105173	105173	he	177	“ Have you got anything for me ? ”
105183	105187	105188	105188	she	366	“ Over here , ”
105245	105250	105251	105251	he	177	“ What is it ? ”
105273	105276	105277	105277	she	366	“ There , ”
105468	105471	105465	105465	Hermione	197	“ Harry ? ”

105519	105522	105511	105511	he	177	“ Yes , ”
105527	105536	105511	105511	he	177	“ Yesss … hold you … hold you … ”
105537	105543	105511	105511	he	177	“ Accio … Accio Wand … ”
105837	105848	105850	105850	he	177	“ He ’s coming ! Hermione , he ’s coming ! ”
105964	105967	105961	105961	Hermione	197	“ Confringo ! ”
106628	106650	106619	106619	he	177	“ Lily , take Harry and go ! It ’s him ! Go ! Run ! I ’ll hold him off ! ”
106670	106674	106663	106663	He	177	“ Avada Kedavra ! ”
106869	106880	106834	106834	she	2555	“ Not Harry , not Harry , please not Harry ! ”
106881	106894	106834	106834	she	2555	“ Stand aside , you silly girl … stand aside , now . ”
106895	106909	106834	106834	she	2555	“ Not Harry , please no , take me , kill me instead — ”
106910	106917	106834	106834	she	2555	“ This is my last warning — ”
106918	106942	106834	106834	she	2555	“ Not Harry ! Please … have mercy … have mercy … Not Harry ! Not Harry ! Please — I’ll do anything … ”
106943	106952	106834	106834	she	2555	“ Stand aside . Stand aside , girl ! ”
107117	107121	107109	107115	the small ones whining in the orphanage	2572	“ Avada Kedavra ! ”
107167	107170	107171	107171	he	5674	“ No , ”
107198	107201	107193	107193	he	4825	“ No … ”
107247	107250	107237	107237	He	5674	“ No … ”
107251	107264	107265	107265	He	5674	“ Harry , it ’s all right , you ’re all right ! ”
107289	107300	107276	107276	he	5674	“ No … I dropped it … I dropped it … ”
107301	107314	107315	107315	He	5674	“ Harry , it ’s okay , wake up , wake up ! ”
107340	107343	107344	107344	Hermione	197	“ Harry , ”
107347	107356	107344	107344	Hermione	197	“ Do you feel all — all right ? ”
107357	107360	107361	107361	he	5674	“ Yes , ”
107423	107428	107475	107475	her	197	“ We got away . ”
107429	107432	107434	107434	Hermione	197	“ Yes , ”
107436	107469	107434	107434	Hermione	197	“ I had to use a Hover Charm to get you into your bunk . I could n’t lift you . You ’ve been … Well , you have n’t been quite … ”
107495	107501	107502	107502	she	197	“ You ’ve been ill , ”
107505	107509	107502	107502	she	197	“ Quite ill . ”
107510	107518	107485	107485	her	197	“ How long ago did we leave ? ”
107519	107528	107502	107502	she	197	“ Hours ago . It ’s nearly morning . ”
107529	107539	107485	107485	her	197	“ And I ’ve been … what , unconscious ? ”
107540	107544	107546	107546	Hermione	197	“ Not exactly , ”
107549	107560	107561	107561	she	197	“ You ’ve been shouting and moaning and … things , ”
107590	107600	107607	107607	she	197	“ I could n’t get the Horcrux off you , ”
107614	107665	107607	107607	she	197	“ It was stuck , stuck to your chest . You ’ve got a mark ; I ’m sorry , I had to use a Severing Charm to get it away . The snake hit you too , but I ’ve cleaned the wound and put some dittany on it … ”
107711	107719	107698	107698	He	5674	“ Where ’ve you put the Horcrux ? ”
107720	107736	107746	107746	her	197	“ In my bag . I think we should keep it off for a while . ”
107751	107779	107698	107698	He	5674	“ We should n’t have gone to Godric ’s Hollow . It ’s my fault , it ’s all my fault . Hermione , I ’m sorry . ”
107780	107806	107698	107698	He	5674	“ It ’s not you fault . I wanted to go too ; I really thought Dumbledore might have left the sword there for you . ”
107807	107821	107698	107698	He	5674	“ Yeah , well … we got that wrong , did n’t we ? ”
107822	107854	107698	107698	He	5674	“ What happened , Harry ? What happened when she took you upstairs ? Was the snake hiding somewhere ? Did it just come out and kill her and attack you ? ”
107855	107858	107859	107859	he	2583	“ No . ”
107862	107877	107859	107859	he	2583	“ She was the snake … or the snake was her … all along . ”
107878	107883	107698	107698	He	5674	“ W - what ? ”
107907	107951	107698	107698	He	5674	“ Bathilda must ’ve been dead a while . The snake was … was inside her . You - Know - Who put it there in Godric ’s Hollow , to wait . You were right . He knew I ’d go back . ”
107952	107959	107884	107884	He	2583	“ The snake was inside her ? ”
107972	107984	107985	107985	Harry	177	“ Lupin said there would be magic we ’d never imagined , ”
107988	108066	107985	107985	Harry	177	“ She did n’t want to talk in front of you , because it was Parseltongue , all Parseltongue , and I did n’t realize , but of course I could understand her . Once we were up in the room , the snake sent a message to You - Know - Who , I heard it happen inside my head , I felt him get excited , he said to keep me there … and then … ”
108087	108100	108101	108101	He	177	“ … she changed , changed into the snake , and attacked . ”
108109	108130	108101	108101	He	177	“ It was n’t supposed to kill me , just keep me there till You - Know - Who came . ”
108165	108178	108214	108214	She	197	“ Harry , no , I ’m sure you ought to rest ! ”
108179	108213	108258	108258	She	197	“ You ’re the one who needs sleep . No offense , but you look terrible . I ’m fine . I ’ll keep watch for a while . Where ’s my wand ? ”
108225	108233	108219	108219	she	197	“ Where ’s my wand , Hermione ? ”
108247	108250	108234	108234	She	197	“ Harry … ”
108251	108257	108234	108234	She	197	“ Where ’s my wand ? ”
108345	108351	108337	108337	he	177	“ Mend it . Please . ”
108352	108367	108337	108337	he	177	“ Harry , I do n’t think , when it ’s broken like this — ”
108368	108375	108337	108337	he	177	“ Please , Hermione , try ! ”
108376	108381	108337	108337	he	177	“ R - Reparo . ”
108396	108399	108391	108391	Harry	177	“ Lumos ! ”
108415	108418	108409	108409	Harry	177	“ Expelliarmus ! ”
108477	108480	108481	108481	Hermione	197	“ Harry , ”
108491	108542	108481	108481	Hermione	197	“ I ’m so , so sorry . I think it was me . As we were leaving , you know , the snake was coming for us , and so I cast a Blasting Curse , and it rebounded everywhere , and it must have — must have hit — ”
108543	108549	108551	108551	Harry	177	“ It was an accident , ”
108560	108571	108551	108551	Harry	177	“ We’ll — we’ll find a way to repair it . ”
108572	108587	108589	108589	Hermione	197	“ Harry , I do n’t think we ’re going to be able to , ”
108598	108629	108589	108589	Hermione	197	“ Remember … remember Ron ? When he broke his wand , crashing the car ? It was never the same again , he had to get a new one . ”
108660	108663	108664	108664	he	177	“ Well , ”
108677	108695	108664	108664	he	177	“ well , I ’ll just borrow yours for now , then . While I keep watch . ”
109260	109263	109253	109253	Voldemort	175	“ Harry ? ”
109304	109307	109308	109308	he	177	“ Thanks , ”
109317	109327	109283	109283	she	197	“ Do you mind if I talk to you ? ”
109328	109331	109332	109332	he	177	“ No , ”
109344	109367	109283	109283	she	197	“ Harry , you wanted to know who that man in the picture was . Well … I ’ve got the book . ”
109388	109394	109369	109369	she	197	“ Where — how — ? ”
109395	109419	109369	109369	she	197	“ It was in Bathilda ’s sitting room , just lying there … This note was sticking out of the top of it . ”
109434	109498	109420	109420	Hermione	197	“ ‘ Dear Batty , Thanks for your help . Here ’s a copy of the book , hope you like it . You said everything , even if you do n’t remember it . Rita . ’ I think it must have arrived while the real Bathilda was alive , but perhaps she was n’t in any fit state to read it ? ”
109499	109507	109508	109508	Harry	177	“ No , she probably was n’t . ”
109549	109562	109564	109564	Hermione	197	“ You ’re still really angry at me , are n’t you ? ”
109591	109594	109595	109595	he	177	“ No , ”
109599	109641	109595	109595	he	177	“ No , Hermione , I know it was an accident . You were trying to get us out of there alive , and you were incredible . I ’d be dead if you had n’t been there to help me . ”
109779	109782	109773	109773	she	197	“ Grindelwald ! ”
109842	109847	109852	109852	Hermione	197	“ The Greater Good . ”
109909	109912	109877	109877	She	197	“ Harry — ”
109972	109975	109976	109976	She	197	“ Harry . ”
109984	110000	109976	109976	She	197	“ Listen to me . It — it does n’t make a very nice reading — ”
110001	110009	109976	109976	She	197	“ Yeah , you could say that — ”
110010	110025	109976	109976	She	197	“ — but do n’t forget , Harry , this is Rita Skeeter writing . ”
110026	110039	109976	109976	She	197	“ You did read that letter to Grindelwald , did n’t you ? ”
110040	110048	110049	110049	She	197	“ Yes , I — I did . ”
110063	110135	110049	110049	She	197	“ I think that ’s the worst bit . I know Bathilda thought it was all just talk , but ‘ For the Greater Good ’ became Grindelwald ’s slogan , his justification for all the atrocities he committed later . And … from that … it looks like Dumbledore gave him the idea . They say ‘ For the Greater Good ’ was even carved over the entrance to Nurmengard . ”
110136	110141	109976	109976	She	197	“ What ’s Nurmengard ? ”
110142	110218	110049	110049	She	197	“ The prison Grindelwald had built to hold his opponents . He ended up in there himself , once Dumbledore had caught him . Anyway , it’s — it ’s an awful thought that Dumbledore ’s ideas helped Grindelwald rise to power . But on the other hand , even Rita ca n’t pretend that they knew each other for more than a few months one summer when they were both really young , and — ”
110219	110227	110229	110229	Harry	177	“ I thought you ’d say that , ”
110254	110313	110250	110250	his	177	“ I thought you ’d say ‘ They were young . ’ They were the same age as we are now . And here we are , risking our lives to fight the Dark Arts , and there he was , in a huddle with his new best friend , plotting their rise to power over the Muggles . ”
110339	110350	110352	110352	Hermione	197	“ I ’m not trying to defend what Dumbledore wrote , ”
110354	110392	110352	110352	Hermione	197	“ All that ‘ right to rule ’ rubbish , it ’s ‘ Magic Is Might ’ all over again . But Harry , his mother had just died , he was stuck alone in the house — ”
110393	110419	110488	110488	his	177	“ Alone ? He was n’t alone ! He had his brother and sister for company , his Squib sister he was keeping locked up — ”
110420	110427	110429	110429	Hermione	197	“ I do n’t believe it , ”
110436	110464	110431	110431	She	197	“ Whatever was wrong with that girl , I do n’t think she was a Squib . The Dumbledore we knew would never , ever have allowed — ”
110465	110484	110485	110485	Harry	177	“ The Dumbledore , who we thought we knew , did n’t want to conquer Muggles by force ! ”
110512	110598	110488	110488	his	177	“ He changed , Harry , he changed ! It ’s as simple as that ! Maybe he did believe these things when he was seventeen , but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts ! Dumbledore was the one who stopped Grindelwald , the one who always voted for Muggle protection and Muggle - born rights , who fought You - Know - Who from the start , and who died trying to bring him down ! ”
110621	110649	110599	110599	Rita	205	“ Harry , I ’m sorry , but I think the real reason you ’re so angry is that Dumbledore never told you any of this himself . ”
110650	110655	110656	110656	Harry	177	“ Maybe I am ! ”
110690	110700	110671	110671	he	177	“ Look what he asked from me , Hermione ! ”
110735	110740	110741	110741	Hermione	197	“ He loved you , ”
110744	110751	110741	110741	Hermione	197	“ I know he loved you . ”
110757	110809	110752	110752	Harry	177	“ I do n’t know who he loved , Hermione , but it was never me . This is n’t love , the mess he ’s left me in . He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever shared with me . ”
110836	110855	110856	110856	She	197	“ Thanks for the tea . I ’ll finish the watch . You get back in the warm . ”
111045	111053	111054	111054	she	197	“ We ’ll go somewhere more sheltered , ”
111068	111089	111059	111059	she	197	“ I kept thinking I could hear people moving outside . I even though I saw somebody once or twice . ”
111112	111120	111122	111122	Hermione	197	“ I ’m sure I imagined it , ”
111127	111155	111122	111122	Hermione	197	“ The snow the dark , it plays tricks on your eyes … But perhaps we ought to Disapparate under the Invisibility Cloak , just in case ? ”
111210	111215	111216	111216	he	177	“ Where are we ? ”
111241	111247	111248	111248	she	197	“ The Forest of Dean , ”
111251	111263	111248	111248	she	197	“ I came camping here once with my mum and dad . ”
111950	111953	111954	111954	he	177	“ No , ”
111967	111971	111954	111954	he	177	“ Come back ! ”

112639	112643	112628	112628	He	177	“ Accio Sword . ”
112722	112725	112726	112726	he	177	“ Help , ”
112938	112940	112945	112945	he	177	“ chivalry ”
113593	113600	113577	113577	Someone	5213	“ Are — you — mental ? ”
113668	113673	113675	113675	Ron	227	“ Why the hell , ”
113697	113709	113675	113675	Ron	227	“ did n’t you take the thing off before you dived ? ”
113811	113818	113819	113819	Harry	177	“ It was y - you ? ”
113840	113845	113847	113847	Ron	227	“ Well , yeah , ”
113853	113861	113902	113902	Harry	177	“ Y - you cast that doe ? ”
113862	113879	113824	113824	his	177	“ What ? No , of course not ! I thought it was you doing it ! ”
113880	113887	113902	113902	Harry	177	“ My Patronus is a stag . ”
113888	113901	113824	113824	his	177	“ Oh yeah . I thought it looked different . No antlers . ”
113931	113938	113902	113902	Harry	177	“ How come you ’re here ? ”
113955	113969	113970	113970	He	227	“ Well , I’ve — you know — I’ve come back . If — ”
113975	113984	113972	113972	his	227	“ You know . You still want me . ”
114043	114052	114053	114053	he	227	“ Oh yeah , I got it out , ”
114068	114078	114053	114053	he	227	“ That ’s why you jumped in , right ? ”
114079	114082	114084	114084	Harry	177	“ Yeah , ”
114086	114105	114084	114084	Harry	177	“ But I do n’t understand . How did you get here ? How did you find us ? ”
114106	114110	114112	114112	Ron	227	“ Long story , ”
114114	114162	114112	114112	Ron	227	“ I ’ve been looking for you for hours , it ’s a big forest , is n’t it ? And I was just thinking I ’d have to go kip under a tree and wait for morning when I saw that deer coming and you following . ”
114163	114171	114084	114084	Harry	177	“ You did n’t see anyone else ? ”
114172	114175	114177	114177	Ron	227	“ No , ”
114179	114182	114177	114177	Ron	227	“ I — ”
114198	114245	114184	114184	he	227	“ I did think I saw something move over there , but I was running to the pool at the time , because you ’d gone in and you had n’t come up , so I was n’t going to make a detour to — hey ! ”
114330	114334	114335	114335	Ron	227	“ Anything there ? ”
114338	114341	114343	114343	Harry	177	“ No , ”
114345	114356	114318	114318	Ron	227	“ So how did the sword get in that pool ? ”
114357	114368	114343	114343	Harry	177	“ Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there . ”
114392	114401	114403	114403	Ron	227	“ You reckon this is the real one ? ”
114405	114416	114418	114418	Harry	177	“ One way to find out , is n’t there ? ”
114515	114519	114520	114520	he	177	“ Come here , ”
114558	114566	114523	114523	he	177	“ No , you should do it . ”
114567	114570	114572	114572	Ron	227	“ Me ? ”
114577	114580	114572	114572	Ron	227	“ Why ? ”
114581	114601	114523	114523	he	177	“ Because you got the sword out of the pool . I think it ’s supposed to be you . ”
114657	114665	114667	114667	Harry	177	“ I ’m going to open it , ”
114669	114703	114667	114667	Harry	177	“ and you will stab it . Straightaway , okay ? Because whatever ’s in there will put up a fight . The bit of Riddle in the Diary tried to kill me . ”
114704	114713	114715	114715	Ron	227	“ How are you going to open it ? ”
114721	114734	114736	114736	Harry	177	“ I ’m going to ask it to open , using Parseltongue , ”
114802	114805	114807	114807	Ron	227	“ No ! ”
114809	114819	114807	114807	Ron	227	“ Do n’t open it ! I ’m serious ! ”
114820	114824	114826	114826	Harry	177	“ Why not ? ”
114828	114843	114826	114826	Harry	177	“ Let ’s get rid of the damn thing , it ’s been months — ”
114844	114859	114807	114807	Ron	227	“ I ca n’t , Harry , I ’m serious — you do it — ”
114860	114864	114826	114826	Harry	177	“ But why ? ”
114865	114874	114876	114876	Ron	227	“ Because that thing ’s bad for me ! ”
114887	114980	114876	114876	Ron	227	“ I ca n’t handle it ! I ’m not making excuses , for what I was like , but it affects me worse than it affects you and Hermione , it made me think stuff — stuff that I was thinking anyway , but it made everything worse . I ca n’t explain it , and then I ’d take it off and I ’d get my head straight again , and then I ’d have to put the effing thing back on — I ca n’t do it , Harry ! ”
114997	115003	115005	115005	Harry	177	“ You can do it , ”
115007	115040	115005	115005	Harry	177	“ you can ! You ’ve just got the sword , I know it ’s supposed to be you who uses it . Please , just get rid of it , Ron . ”
115071	115076	115077	115077	he	227	“ Tell me when , ”
115080	115084	115086	115086	Harry	177	“ On three , ”
115141	115150	115199	115199	he	293	“ One … two … three … open . ”
115208	115211	115213	115213	Harry	177	“ Stab , ”
115269	115281	115339	115339	his	177	“ I have seen your heart , and it is mine . ”
115282	115289	115290	115290	Harry	177	“ Do n’t listen to it ! ”
115294	115298	115290	115290	Harry	177	“ Stab it ! ”
115299	115331	115339	115339	his	177	“ I have seen your dreams , Ronald Weasley , and I have seen your fears . All you desire is possible , but all that you dread is also possible … ”
115332	115335	115337	115337	Harry	177	“ Stab ! ”
115361	115396	115353	115353	Ron	227	“ Least loved , always , by the mother who craved a daughter … Least loved , now , by the girl who prefers your friend … Second best , always , eternally overshadowed … ”
115397	115404	115405	115405	Harry	177	“ Ron , stab it now ! ”
115543	115546	115547	115547	he	227	“ Ron ! ”
115575	115606	115565	115565	Ron	227	“ Why return ? We were better without you , happier without you , glad of your absence … We laughed at your stupidity , your cowardice , your presumption — ”
115607	115610	115612	115612	Riddle	293	“ Presumption ! ”
115654	115695	115637	115637	Ron	227	“ Who could look at you , who would ever look at you , beside Harry Potter ? What have you ever done , compared with the Chosen One ? What are you , compared with the Boy Who Lived ? ”
115696	115705	115706	115706	Harry	177	“ Ron , stab it , STAB IT ! ”
115758	115763	115765	115765	Riddle	293	“ Your mother confessed , ”
115779	115796	115772	115772	Riddle	293	“ that she would have preferred me as a son , would be glad to exchange … ”
115797	115820	115822	115822	Riddle	293	“ Who would n’t prefer him , what woman would take you , you are nothing , nothing , nothing to him , ”
115881	115887	115888	115888	Harry	177	“ Do it , Ron ! ”
115909	115913	115906	115906	his	227	“ Ron — ? ”
116180	116185	116186	116186	he	177	“ After you left , ”
116204	116241	116186	116186	he	177	“ she cried for a week . Probably longer , only she did n’t want me to see . There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other . With you gone … ”
116267	116274	116275	116275	he	177	“ She ’s like my sister , ”
116279	116310	116275	116275	he	177	“ I love her like a sister and I reckon that she feels the same way about me . It ’s always been like that . I thought you knew . ”
116392	116397	116398	116398	he	177	“ I ’m sorry , ”
116405	116420	116398	116398	he	177	“ I ’m sorry I left . I know I was a — a — ”
116444	116455	116457	116457	Harry	177	“ You ’ve sort of made up for it tonight , ”
116459	116473	116457	116457	Harry	177	“ Getting the sword . Finishing off the Horcrux . Saving my life . ”
116474	116486	116487	116487	Ron	227	“ That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was , ”
116490	116502	116504	116504	Harry	177	“ Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was , ”
116506	116518	116504	116504	Harry	177	“ I ’ve been trying to tell you that for years . ”
116538	116542	116544	116544	Harry	177	“ And now , ”
116550	116563	116544	116544	Harry	177	“ all we ’ve got to do is find that tent again . ”
116678	116681	116670	116670	Harry	177	“ Hermione ! ”
116698	116710	116682	116682	She	197	“ What ’s wrong ? Harry ? Are you all right ? ”
116711	116733	116670	116670	Harry	177	“ It ’s okay , everything ’s fine . More than fine , I ’m great . There ’s someone here . ”
116734	116743	116682	116682	She	197	“ What do you mean ? Who — ? ”
116849	116864	116835	116835	herself	197	“ Ouch — ow — gerroff ! What the — ? Hermione — OW ! ”
116865	116876	116877	116877	She	197	“ You — complete — arse — Ronald — Weasley ! ”
116896	116920	116921	116921	She	197	“ You — crawl — back — here — after — weeks — and — weeks — oh , where ’s my wand ? ”
116939	116942	116921	116921	She	197	“ Protego ! ”
116975	116978	116980	116980	Harry	177	“ Hermione ! ”
116982	116985	116980	116980	Harry	177	“ Calm — ”
116986	116993	116994	116994	she	197	“ I will not calm down ! ”
117013	117026	117008	117008	she	197	“ Give me back my wand ! Give it back to me ! ”
117027	117034	116980	116980	Harry	177	“ Hermione , will you please — ”
117035	117047	117048	117048	she	197	“ Do n’t you tell me what do , Harry Potter ! ”
117051	117065	117048	117048	she	197	“ Do n’t you dare ! Give it back now ! And YOU ! ”
117092	117110	117066	117066	She	197	“ I came running after you ! I called you ! I begged you to come back — ”
117111	117115	117116	117116	Ron	227	“ I know , ”
117119	117130	117116	117116	Ron	227	“ Hermione , I ’m sorry , I ’m really — ”
117131	117138	117139	117139	She	197	“ Oh , you ’re sorry ! ”
117167	117193	117139	117139	She	197	“ You came back after weeks — weeks — and you think it ’s all going to be all right if you just say sorry ? ”
117194	117203	117204	117204	Ron	227	“ Well , what else can I say ? ”
117217	117225	117227	117227	Hermione	197	“ Oh , I do n’t know ! ”
117232	117248	117227	117227	Hermione	197	“ Rack your brains , Ron , that should only take a couple of seconds — ”
117249	117252	117254	117254	Harry	177	“ Hermione , ”
117263	117269	117254	117254	Harry	177	“ he just saved my — ”
117270	117276	117277	117277	she	197	“ I do n’t care ! ”
117280	117304	117277	117277	she	197	“ I do n’t care what he ’s done ! Weeks and weeks , we could have been dead for all he knew — ”
117305	117313	117315	117315	Ron	227	“ I knew you were n’t dead ! ”
117339	117388	117330	117330	he	227	“ Harry ’s all over the Prophet , all over the radio , they ’re looking for you everywhere , all these rumors and mental stories , I knew I ’d hear straight off if you were dead , you do n’t know what it ’s been like — ”
117389	117399	117400	117400	Her	197	“ What it ’s been like for you ? ? ”
117436	117467	117431	117431	Ron	227	“ I wanted to come back the minute I ’d Disapparated , but I walked straight into a gang of Snatchers , Hermione , and I could n’t go anywhere ! ”
117468	117474	117476	117476	Harry	177	“ A gang of what ? ”
117506	117509	117511	117511	Ron	227	“ Snatchers , ”
117513	117589	117511	117511	Ron	227	“ They ’re everywhere — gangs trying to earn gold by rounding up Muggle - borns and blood traitors , there ’s a reward from the Ministry for everyone captured . I was on my own and I look like I might be school age ; they got really excited , thought I was a Muggle - born in hiding . I had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to the Ministry . ”
117590	117598	117643	117643	Ron	227	“ What did you say to them ? ”
117599	117614	117511	117511	Ron	227	“ Told them I was Stan Shunpike . First person I could think of . ”
117615	117621	117643	117643	Ron	227	“ And they believed that ? ”
117622	117642	117511	117511	Ron	227	“ They were n’t the brightest . One of them was definitely part troll , the smell of him … ”
117671	117764	117767	117767	his	2684	“ Anyway , they had a row about whether I was Stan or not . It was a bit pathetic to be honest , but there were still five of them and only one of me , and they ’d taken my wand . Then two of them got into a fight and while the others were distracted I managed to hit the one holding me in the stomach , grabbed his wand , Disarmed the bloke holding mine , and Disapparated . I did n’t do it so well . Splinched myself again”—Ron
117780	117810	117778	117778	her	197	coldly—“and I came out miles from where you were . By the time I got back to that bit of riverbank where we ’d been … you were gone . ”
117811	117819	117820	117820	Hermione	197	“ Gosh , what a gripping story , ”
117833	117897	117820	117820	Hermione	197	“ You must have been simply terrified . Meanwhile we went to Godric ’s Hollow and , let ’s think , what happened there , Harry ? Oh yes , You - Know - Who ’s snake turned up , it nearly killed both of us , and then You - Know - Who himself arrived and missed us by about a second . ”
117898	117901	117902	117902	Ron	227	“ What ? ”
117916	117935	117914	117914	him	227	“ Imagine losing fingernails , Harry ! That really puts our sufferings into perspective , does n’t it ? ”
117936	117939	117941	117941	Harry	177	“ Hermione , ”
117944	117951	117941	117941	Harry	177	“ Ron just saved my life . ”
117960	117971	117972	117972	she	197	“ One thing I would like to know , though , ”
117988	118026	117972	117972	she	197	“ How exactly did you find us tonight ? That ’s important . Once we know , we ’ll be able to make sure we ’re not visited by anyone else we do n’t want to see . ”
118043	118046	118039	118039	his	227	“ This . ”
118061	118065	118066	118066	she	197	“ The Deluminator ? ”
118079	118091	118093	118093	Ron	227	“ It does n’t just turn the lights on and off , ”
118095	118147	118093	118093	Ron	227	“ I do n’t know how it works or why it happened then and not any other time , because I ’ve been wanting to come back ever since I left . But I was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning and I heard … I heard you . ”
118154	118162	118163	118163	she	197	“ You heard me on the radio ? ”
118167	118182	118183	118183	he	227	“ No , I heard you coming out of my pocket . Your voice , ”
118190	118196	118183	118183	he	227	“ came out of this . ”
118197	118205	118207	118207	Hermione	197	“ And what exactly did I say ? ”
118217	118234	118209	118209	her	197	“ My name . ‘ Ron . ’ And you said … something about a wand … ”
118282	118289	118290	118290	Ron	227	“ So I took it out , ”
118299	118341	118290	118290	Ron	227	“ and it did n’t seem different or anything , but I was sure I ’d heard you . So I clicked it . And the light went out in my room , but another light appeared right outside the window . ”
118366	118393	118354	118354	his	227	“ It was a ball of light , kind of pulsing , and bluish , like that light you get around a Portkey , you know ? ”
118394	118397	118399	118399	Harry	177	“ Yeah , ”
118405	118412	118414	118414	Ron	227	“ I knew this was it , ”
118416	118479	118414	118414	Ron	227	“ I grabbed my stuff and packed it , then I put on my rucksack and went out into the garden . The little ball of light was hovering there , waiting for me , and when I came out it bobbed along a bit and I followed it behind the shed and then it … well , it went inside me . ”
118480	118483	118485	118485	Harry	177	“ Sorry ? ”
118494	118502	118504	118504	Ron	227	“ It sort of floated toward me , ”
118515	118534	118535	118535	he	227	“ right to my chest , and then — it just went straight through . It was here , ”
118544	118600	118535	118535	he	227	“ I could feel it , it was hot . And once it was inside me , I knew what I was supposed to do . I knew it would take me where I needed to go . So I Disapparated and came out on the side of a hill . There was snow everywhere … ”
118601	118606	118608	118608	Harry	177	“ We were there , ”
118610	118637	118608	118608	Harry	177	“ We spent two nights there , and the second night I kept thinking I could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out ! ”
118638	118649	118651	118651	Ron	227	“ Yeah , well , that would ’ve been me , ”
118653	118717	118651	118651	Ron	227	“ Your protective spells work , anyway , because I could n’t see you and I could n’t hear you . I was sure you were around , though , so in the end I got in my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear . I thought you ’d have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent . ”
118718	118723	118725	118725	Hermione	197	“ No , actually , ”
118727	118759	118725	118725	Hermione	197	“ We ’ve been Disapparating under the Invisibility Cloak as an extra precaution . And we left really early , because as Harry says , we ’d heard somebody blundering around . ”
118760	118771	118773	118773	Ron	227	“ Well , I stayed on that hill all day , ”
118775	118862	118773	118773	Ron	227	“ I kept hoping you ’d appear . But when it started to get dark I knew I must have missed you , so I clicked the Deluminator again , the blue light came out and went inside me , and I Disapparated and arrived here in these woods . I still could n’t see you , so I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end — and Harry did . Well , I saw the doe first , obviously . ”
118863	118869	118871	118871	Hermione	197	“ You saw the what ? ”
118917	118926	118927	118927	she	197	“ But it must have been a Patronus ! ”
118930	118964	118927	118927	she	197	“ Could n’t you see who was casting it ? Did n’t you see anyone ? And it led you to the sword ! I ca n’t believe this ! Then what happened ? ”
119026	119036	119022	119022	Harry	177	“ — and Ron stabbed it with the sword . ”
119037	119048	119049	119049	she	197	“ And … and it went ? Just like that ? ”
119052	119060	119062	119062	Harry	177	“ Well , it — it screamed , ”
119070	119073	119062	119062	Harry	177	“ Here . ”
119121	119139	119119	119119	Ron	227	“ Did you just say now that you got away from the snatchers with a spare wand ? ”
119140	119143	119145	119145	Ron	227	“ What ? ”
119156	119162	119145	119145	Ron	227	“ Oh — oh yeah . ”
119182	119196	119163	119163	He	227	“ Here , I figured it ’s always handy to have a backup . ”
119197	119202	119204	119204	Harry	177	“ You were right , ”
119211	119216	119204	119204	Harry	177	“ Mine ’s broken . ”
119217	119222	119223	119223	Ron	227	“ You ’re kidding ? ”
119272	119284	119286	119286	Harry	177	“ About the best you could hope for , I think , ”
119288	119291	119293	119293	Ron	227	“ Yeah , ”
119295	119309	119293	119293	Ron	227	“ Could ’ve been worse . Remember those birds she set on me ? ”
119310	119319	119321	119321	Hermione	197	“ I still have n’t ruled it out , ”
119436	119441	119442	119442	he	227	“ Someone helped us , ”
119446	119464	119442	119442	he	227	“ Someone sent that doe , Someone ’s on our side , One Horcrux down , mate ! ”
119649	119661	119662	119662	he	177	“ … and how did you find out about the Taboo ? ”
119680	119684	119662	119662	he	177	“ The what ? ”
119685	119700	119662	119662	he	177	“ You and Hermione have stopped saying You - Know - Who ’s name ! ”
119701	119719	119721	119721	Harry	177	“ Oh , yeah , Well , it ’s just a bad habit we ’ve slipped into , ”
119723	119735	119721	119721	Harry	177	“ But I have n’t got a problem calling him V — ”
119736	119739	119741	119741	Ron	227	“ NO ! ”
119758	119761	119763	119763	Ron	227	“ Sorry , ”
119773	119816	119763	119763	Ron	227	“ but the name ’s been jinxed , Harry , that ’s how they track people ! Using his name breaks protective enchantments , it causes some kind of magical disturbance — it ’s how they found us in Tottenham Court Road ! ”
119817	119824	119721	119721	Harry	177	“ Because we used his name ? ”
119825	119894	119763	119763	Ron	227	“ Exactly ! You ’ve got to give them credit , it makes sense . It was only people who were serious about standing up to him , like Dumbledore , who even dared use it . Now they ’ve put a Taboo on it , anyone who says it is trackable — quick - and - easy way to find Order members ! They nearly got Kingsley — ”
119895	119900	119721	119721	Harry	177	“ You ’re kidding ? ”
119901	119931	119932	119932	Ron	227	“ Yeah , a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him , Bill said but he fought his way out . He ’s on the run now just like us . ”
119944	119956	119932	119932	Ron	227	“ You do n’t reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe ? ”
119957	119973	119721	119721	Harry	177	“ His Patronus is a lynx , we saw it at the wedding , remember ? ”
119974	119978	119932	119932	Ron	227	“ Oh yeah … ”
119993	120006	119721	119721	Harry	177	“ Harry … you do n’t reckon it could ’ve been Dumbledore ? ”
120007	120011	119721	119721	Harry	177	“ Dumbledore what ? ”
120025	120034	120012	120012	Ron	227	“ Dumbledore … the doe ? I mean , ”
120047	120059	120044	120044	his	227	“ he had the real sword last , did n’t he ? ”
120107	120112	120113	120113	he	177	“ Dumbledore ’s dead , ”
120116	120143	120102	120102	He	177	“ I saw it happen , I saw the body . He ’s definitely gone . Anyway his Patronus was a phoenix , not a doe . ”
120144	120154	120156	120156	Ron	227	“ Patronuses can change , though ca n’t they ? ”
120158	120167	120156	120156	Ron	227	“ Tonks ’s changed , did n’t it ? ”
120168	120194	120102	120102	He	177	“ Yeah , but if Dumbledore was alive , why would n’t he show himself ? Why would n’t he just hand us the sword ? ”
120195	120199	120201	120201	Ron	227	“ Search me , ”
120203	120235	120201	120201	Ron	227	“ Same reason he did n’t give it to you while he was alive ? Same reason he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kid ’s stories ? ”
120236	120241	120243	120243	Harry	177	“ Which is what ? ”
120258	120262	120264	120264	Ron	227	“ I dunno , ”
120266	120329	120264	120264	Ron	227	“ Sometimes I ’ve thought , when I ’ve been a bit hacked off , he was having a laugh or — or he just wanted to make it more difficult . But I do n’t think so , not anymore . He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator , did n’t he ? He — well , ”
120356	120368	120350	120350	he	227	“ he must ’ve known I ’d run out on you . ”
120369	120372	120373	120373	Harry	177	“ No , ”
120377	120390	120373	120373	Harry	177	“ He must ’ve known you ’d always want to come back . ”
120408	120422	120405	120405	Harry	177	“ Speaking of Dumbledore , have you heard what Skeeter wrote about him ? ”
120423	120427	120429	120429	Ron	227	“ Oh yeah , ”
120433	120520	120429	120429	Ron	227	“ people are talking about it quite a lot . ’ Course , if things were different it ’d be huge news , Dumbledore being pals with Grindelwald , but now it ’s just something to laugh about for people who did n’t like Dumbledore , and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who thought he was such a good bloke . I do n’t know that it ’s such a big deal , though . He was really young when they — ”
120521	120525	120527	120527	Harry	177	“ Our age , ”
120598	120601	120574	120574	Ron	227	“ Engorgio . ”
120627	120631	120633	120633	Ron	227	“ Stop that , ”
120636	120648	120633	120633	Ron	227	“ I ’m sorry I said Dumbledore was young , okay ? ”
120658	120663	120652	120652	Ron	227	“ Sorry — Reducio . ”
120725	120732	120734	120734	Hermione	197	“ You just need to practice , ”
120758	120769	120749	120749	Harry	177	“ It ’s all a matter of confidence , Harry . ”
120946	120953	120954	120954	he	227	“ There ’s this one program , ”
120962	121044	120954	120954	he	227	“ that tells the news like it really is . All the others are on You - Know - Who ’s side and are following the Ministry line , but this one … you wait till you hear it , it ’s great . Only they ca n’t do it every night , they have to keep changing locations in case they ’re raided and you need a password to tune in … Trouble is , I missed the last one … ”
121136	121147	121148	121148	he	227	“ If it ’s annoying you , I ’ll stop ! ”
121164	121170	121171	121171	she	197	“ We need to talk , ”
121195	121198	121199	121199	he	177	“ What ? ”
121245	121255	121259	121259	her	197	“ I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood . ”
121261	121264	121256	121256	He	177	“ Sorry ? ”
121265	121282	121259	121259	her	197	“ Xenophilius Lovegood , Luna ’s father . I want to go and talk to him ! ”
121283	121288	121256	121256	He	177	“ Er — why ? ”
121303	121320	121289	121289	She	197	“ It ’s that mark , the mark in Beedle the Bard . Look at this ! ”
121380	121384	121386	121386	Hermione	197	“ The signature , ”
121388	121396	121386	121386	Hermione	197	“ Look at the signature , Harry ! ”
121454	121462	121464	121464	Ron	227	“ Er — what are you — ? ”
121480	121490	121491	121491	she	197	“ It keeps cropping up , does n’t it ? ”
121494	121584	121491	121491	she	197	“ I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald ’s mark , but it was definitely on that old grave in Godric ’s Hollow , and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along ! And now this ! Well , we ca n’t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means — I do n’t even know whether Grindelwald ’s still alive — but we can ask Mr. Lovegood . He was wearing the symbol at the wedding . I ’m sure this is important , Harry ! ”
121616	121637	121613	121613	he	177	“ Hermione , we do n’t need another Godric ’s Hollow . We talked ourselves into going there , and — ”
121638	121671	121613	121613	he	177	“ But it keeps appearing , Harry ! Dumbledore left me The Tales of Beedle the Bard , how do you know we ’re not supposed to find out about the sign ? ”
121672	121678	121679	121679	Harry	177	“ Here we go again ! ”
121684	121699	121679	121679	Harry	177	“ We keep trying to convince ourselves Dumbledore left us secret signs and clues — ”
121700	121710	121713	121713	Ron	227	“ The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful , ”
121715	121732	121713	121713	Ron	227	“ I think Hermione ’s right , I think we ought to go and see Lovegood . ”
121766	121776	121777	121777	Ron	227	“ It wo n’t be like Godric ’s Hollow , ”
121780	121809	121777	121777	Ron	227	“ Lovegood ’s on your side , Harry , The Quibbler ’s been for you all along , it keeps telling everyone they ’ve got to help you ! ”
121810	121818	121820	121820	Hermione	197	“ I ’m sure this is important ! ”
121823	121844	121777	121777	Ron	227	“ But do n’t you think if it was , Dumbledore would have told me about it before he died ? ”
121845	121860	121862	121862	Hermione	197	“ Maybe … maybe it ’s something you need to find out for yourself , ”
121872	121875	121877	121877	Ron	227	“ Yeah , ”
121880	121885	121877	121877	Ron	227	“ that makes sense . ”
121886	121893	121895	121895	Hermione	197	“ No , it does n’t , ”
121897	121935	121895	121895	Hermione	197	“ but I still think we ought to talk to Mr. Lovegood . A symbol that links Dumbledore , Grindelwald , and Godric ’s Hollow ? Harry , I ’m sure we ought to know about this ! ”
121936	121945	121947	121947	Ron	227	“ I think we should vote on it , ”
121949	121959	121947	121947	Ron	227	“ Those in favor of going to see Lovegood — ”
121980	121987	121989	121989	Ron	227	“ Outvoted , Harry , sorry , ”
121997	122000	122002	122002	Harry	177	“ Fine , ”
122010	122056	122058	122058	Ron	227	“ Only , once we ’ve seen Lovegood , let ’s try and look for some more Horcruxes , shall we ? Where do the Lovegoods live , anyway ? Do either of you know ? Yeah , they ’re not far from my place , ”
122060	122087	122058	122058	Ron	227	“ I dunno exactly where , but Mum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention them . Should n’t be hard to find . ”
122101	122115	122098	122098	his	177	“ You only agreed to try and get back in her good books . ”
122116	122125	122127	122127	Ron	227	“ All ’s fair in love and war , ”
122130	122152	122127	122127	Ron	227	“ and this is a bit of both . Cheer up , it ’s the Christmas holidays , Luna’ll be home ! ”
122251	122266	122268	122268	Ron	227	“ It ’s weird , being this near , but not going to visit , ”
122270	122290	122292	122292	Hermione	197	“ Well , it ’s not like you have n’t just seen them . You were there for Christmas , ”
122295	122303	122305	122305	Ron	227	“ I was n’t at the Burrow ! ”
122311	122355	122305	122305	Ron	227	“ Do you think I was going to go back there and tell them all I ’d walked out on you ? Yeah , Fred and George would ’ve been great about it . And Ginny , she ’d have been really understanding . ”
122356	122365	122367	122367	Hermione	197	“ But where have you been , then ? ”
122371	122478	122305	122305	Ron	227	“ Bill and Fleur ’s new place . Shell cottage . Bill ’s always been decent to me . He — he was n’t impressed when he heard what I ’d done , but he did n’t go on about it . He knew I was really sorry . None of the rest of the family know I was there . Bill told Mum he and Fleur were n’t going home for Christmas because they wanted to spend it alone . You know , first holiday after they were married . I do n’t think Fleur minded . You know how much she hates Celestina Warbeck . ”
122487	122494	122495	122495	he	227	“ Let ’s try up here , ”
122547	122563	122565	122565	Hermione	197	“ Do you think it ’s theirs , and they ’ve gone away for Christmas ? ”
122585	122620	122582	122582	Ron	227	“ Listen , I ’ve got a feeling you ’d be able to tell who lived there if you looked through the Lovegoods ’ window . Let ’s try the next lot of hills . ”
122630	122633	122635	122635	Ron	227	“ Aha ! ”
122692	122719	122646	122646	Ron	227	“ That ’s got to be Luna ’s house , who else would live in a place like that ? It looks like a giant rook ! ”
122720	122728	122730	122730	Hermione	197	“ It ’s nothing like a bird , ”
122737	122746	122748	122748	Ron	227	“ I was talking about a chess rook , ”
122750	122756	122748	122748	Ron	227	“ A castle to you . ”
122796	122801	122803	122803	Ron	227	“ It ’s theirs , ”
122805	122808	122803	122803	Ron	227	“ Look . ”
122938	122950	122952	122952	Hermione	197	“ You ’d better take off the Invisibility Cloak , Harry , ”
122954	122967	122952	122952	Hermione	197	“ It ’s you Mr. Lovegood wants to help , not us . ”
123063	123079	123080	123080	he	339	“ What ? What is it ? Who are you ? What do you want ? ”
123117	123123	123125	123125	Harry	177	“ Hello , Mr. Lovegood , ”
123132	123140	123125	123125	Harry	177	“ I ’m Harry , Harry Potter . ”
123170	123180	123182	123182	Harry	177	“ Would it be okay if we came in ? ”
123184	123195	123182	123182	Harry	177	“ There ’s something we ’d like to ask you . ”
123196	123207	123209	123209	Xenophilius	339	“ I … I ’m not sure that ’s advisable , ”
123222	123244	123211	123211	He	339	“ Rather a shock … My word … I … I ’m afraid I do n’t really think I ought to — ”
123245	123252	123254	123254	Harry	177	“ It wo nt take long , ”
123267	123283	123211	123211	He	339	“ I — oh , all right then . Come in , quickly . Quickly ! ”
123427	123434	123444	123444	he	339	“ You ’d better come up , ”
123612	123616	123621	123621	he	339	“ Excuse me , ”
123668	123675	123663	123663	He	339	“ Why have you come here ? ”
123692	123700	123683	123683	Hermione	197	“ Mr. Lovegood — what ’s that ? ”
123734	123746	123748	123748	Xenophilius	339	“ It is the horn of a Crumple - Horned Snorkack , ”
123750	123757	123759	123759	Hermione	197	“ No , it is n’t ! ”
123761	123764	123766	123766	Harry	177	“ Hermione , ”
123770	123777	123766	123766	Harry	177	“ now ’s not the moment — ”
123778	123808	123701	123701	See	468	“ But Harry , it ’s an Erumpent horn ! It ’s a Class B Tradeable Material and it ’s an extraordinary dangerous thing to have in a house ! ”
123809	123820	123822	123822	Ron	227	“ How ’d you know it ’s an Erumpent horn ? ”
123843	123881	123701	123701	See	468	“ There ’s a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them ! Mr. Lovegood , you need to get rid of it straightaway , do n’t you know it can explode at the slightest touch ? ”
123882	123888	123890	123890	Xenophilius	339	“ The Crumple Horned Snorkack , ”
123901	123915	123890	123890	Xenophilius	339	“ is a shy and highly magical creature , and it ’s horn — ”
123916	123949	123701	123701	See	468	“ Mr. Lovegood , I recognize the grooved markings around the base , that ’s an Erumpent horn and it ’s incredibly dangerous — I do n’t know where you got it — ”
123950	123955	123957	123957	Xenophilius	339	“ I bought it , ”
123960	123988	123989	123989	he	339	“ Two weeks ago , from a delightful young wizard who knew my interest in the exquisite Snorkack . A Christmas surprise for my Luna . Now , ”
123996	124007	123989	123989	he	339	“ why exactly have you come here , Mr. Potter ? ”
124008	124014	124016	124016	Harry	177	“ We need some help , ”
124024	124027	124029	124029	Xenophilius	339	“ Ah , ”
124031	124036	124029	124029	Xenophilius	339	“ Help , Hmm . ”
124054	124068	124037	124037	His	339	“ Yes . The thing is … helping Harry Potter … rather dangerous … ”
124069	124088	124090	124090	Ron	227	“ Are n’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it ’s their first duty to help Harry ? ”
124092	124099	124090	124090	Ron	227	“ In that magazine of yours ? ”
124118	124131	124100	124100	Xenophilius	339	“ Er — yes , I have expressed that view . However — ”
124132	124145	124147	124147	Ron	227	“ That ’s for everyone else to do , not you personally ? ”
124180	124185	124187	124187	Hermione	197	“ Where ’s Luna ? ”
124189	124197	124187	124187	Hermione	197	“ Let ’s see what she thinks . ”
124226	124269	124209	124209	he	339	“ Luna is down at the stream , fishing for Freshwater Plimpies . She … she will like to see you . I ’ll go and call her and then — yes , very well . I shall try to help you . ”
124291	124296	124298	124298	Ron	227	“ Cowardly old wart , ”
124300	124309	124298	124298	Ron	227	“ Luna ’s got ten times his guts . ”
124310	124331	124333	124333	Harry	177	“ He ’s probably worried about what ’ll happen to them if the Death Eaters find out I was here , ”
124335	124343	124345	124345	Hermione	197	“ Well , I agree with Ron , ”
124347	124367	124345	124345	Hermione	197	“ Awful old hypocrite , telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm out of it himself . ”
124462	124467	124469	124469	Harry	177	“ Look at this , ”
124471	124474	124476	124476	Ron	227	“ Fetching , ”
124478	124489	124476	124476	Ron	227	“ Surprised he did n’t wear that to the wedding . ”
124534	124544	124545	124545	he	339	“ Ah , you have spotted my pet invention , ”
124564	124591	124592	124592	He	339	“ Modeled , fittingly enough , upon the head of the beautiful Rowena Ravenclaw , ‘ Wit beyond measure is a man ’s greatest treasure ! ’ ”
124600	124622	124623	124623	he	339	“ These are the Wrackpurt siphons — to remove all sources of distraction from the thinker ’s immediate area . Here , ”
124630	124645	124646	124646	he	339	“ a billywig propeller , to induce an elevated frame of mind . Finally , ”
124653	124669	124646	124646	he	339	“ the Dirigible Plum , so as to enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary . ”
124693	124704	124706	124706	Xenophilius	339	“ May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots ? ”
124708	124714	124716	124716	he	339	“ We make it ourselves . ”
124736	124786	124733	124733	he	339	“ Luna is down beyond Bottom Bridge , she is most excited that you are here . She ought not to be too long , she has caught nearly enough Plumpies to make soup for all of us . Do sit down and help yourselves to sugar . Now , ”
124806	124816	124801	124801	his	339	“ how may I help you , Mr. Potter ? ”
124817	124820	124822	124822	Harry	177	“ Well , ”
124832	124860	124826	124826	Hermione	197	“ it ’s about that symbol you were wearing around your neck at Bill and Fleur ’s wedding , Mr. Lovegood . We wondered what it meant . ”
124866	124878	124863	124863	his	339	“ Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows ? ”
124901	124906	124896	124896	Xenophilius	339	“ The Deathly Hallows ? ”
124907	124912	124914	124914	Xenophilius	339	“ That ’s right , ”
124916	124936	124937	124937	he	339	“ You have n’t heard of them ? I ’m not surprised . Very , very few wizards believe , ”
124956	124961	124963	124963	Harry	177	“ I ’m sorry , ”
124965	124973	124963	124963	Harry	177	“ I still do n’t really understand . ”
125009	125021	125023	125023	Xenophilius	339	“ Well , you see , believers seek the Deathly Hallows , ”
125036	125044	125046	125046	Hermione	197	“ But what are the Deathly Hallows ? ”
125055	125070	125048	125048	Xenophilius	339	“ I assume that you are familiar with The Tale of the Three Brothers ? ”
125074	125077	125071	125071	Harry	177	“ No , ”
125085	125088	125079	125079	Ron	227	“ Yes . ”
125093	125119	125158	125158	she	197	“ Well , well , Mr. Potter , the whole thing starts with The Tale of the Three Brothers … I have a copy somewhere … ”
125139	125156	125136	125136	Hermione	197	“ I ’ve got a copy , Mr. Lovegood , I ’ve got it right here . ”
125174	125178	125180	125180	Xenophilius	339	“ The original ? ”
125191	125215	125188	125188	he	339	“ Well then , why do n’t you read it out aloud ? Much the best way to make sure we all understand . ”
125216	125222	125224	125224	Hermione	197	“ Er … all right , ”
125259	125279	125227	125227	She	197	“ ‘ There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely , winding road at twilight — ’ ”
125280	125289	125291	125291	Ron	227	“ Midnight , our mum always told us , ”
125314	125330	125332	125332	Ron	227	“ Sorry , I just think it ’s a bit spookier if it ’s midnight ! ”
125334	125349	125351	125351	Harry	177	“ Yeah , because we really need a bit more fear in our lives , ”
125379	125385	125358	125358	Xenophilius	339	“ Go on , Hermione . ”
125386	125459	125306	125306	Hermione	197	“ In time , the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across . However , these brothers were learned in the magical arts , and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water . They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure . ‘ And Darth spoke to them — ’ ”
125460	125739	125358	125358	Xenophilius	339	“ ‘ And Darth spoke to them . He was angry that he had been cheated out of the three new victims , for travelers usually drowned in the river . But Darth was cunning . He pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic , and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him . ‘ So the oldest brother , who was a combative man , asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence : a wand that must always win duels for its owner , a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Darth ! So Darth crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river , fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there , and gave it to the oldest brother . ‘ Then the second brother , who was an arrogant man , decided that he wanted to humiliate Darth still further , and asked for the power to recall others from Darth . So Darth picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother , and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead . ‘ And then Darth asked the third and youngest brother what he would like . The youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers , and he did not trust Darth . So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by Darth . And Darth , most unwillingly , handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility . ’ ”
125740	126141	125306	125306	Hermione	197	“ ‘ Then Darth stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way , and they did so talking with wonder of the adventure they had had and admiring Darth ’s gifts . ‘ In due course the brothers separated , each for his own destination . ‘ The first brother traveled on for a week more , and reaching a distant village , sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel . Naturally , with the Elder Wand as his weapon , he could not fail to win the duel that followed . Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor the oldest brother proceeded to an inn , where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Darth himself , and of how it made him invincible . ‘ That very night , another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay , wine - sodden upon his bed . The thief took the wand and for good measure , slit the oldest brother ’s throat . ‘ And so Darth took the first brother for his own . ‘ Meanwhile , the second brother journeyed to his own home , where he lived alone . Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead , and turned it thrice in his hand . To his amazement and his delight , the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry , before her untimely death , appeared at once before him . ‘ Yet she was sad and cold , separated from him as by a veil . Though she had returned to the mortal world , she did not truly belong there and suffered . Finally the second brother , driven mad with hopeless longing , killed himself so as to truly join her . ‘ And so Darth took the second brother from his own . ‘ But though Darth searched for the third brother for many years , he was never able to find him . It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son . And the he greeted Darth as an old friend , and went with him gladly , and , equals , they departed this life . ’ ”
126175	126182	126165	126165	he	339	“ Well , there you are . ”
126183	126186	126188	126188	Hermione	197	“ Sorry ? ”
126193	126200	126202	126202	Xenophilius	339	“ Those are the Deathly Hallows , ”
126229	126234	126235	126235	he	339	“ The Elder Wand , ”
126248	126253	126254	126254	he	339	“ The Resurrection Stone , ”
126267	126273	126274	126274	he	339	“ The Cloak of Invisibility , ”
126295	126298	126299	126299	he	339	“ Together , ”
126302	126307	126299	126299	he	339	“ the Deathly Hallows . ”
126308	126325	126327	126327	Hermione	197	“ But there ’s no mention of the words ‘ Deathly Hallows ’ in the story , ”
126329	126336	126338	126338	Xenophilius	339	“ Well , of course not , ”
126343	126395	126338	126338	Xenophilius	339	“ That is a children ’s tale , told to amuse rather than to instruct . Those of us who understand these matters , however , recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects , or Hallows , which , if united , will make the possessor master of death . ”
126419	126428	126429	126429	he	339	“ Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon , ”
126433	126443	126445	126445	Ron	227	“ When you say ‘ master of death ’ — ”
126447	126450	126452	126452	Xenophilius	339	“ Master , ”
126459	126469	126452	126452	Xenophilius	339	“ Conqueror . Vanquisher . Whichever term you prefer . ”
126470	126478	126480	126480	Hermione	197	“ But then … do you mean … ”
126502	126515	126488	126488	she	197	“ that you believe these objects — these Hallows — really exist ? ”
126522	126528	126518	126518	his	339	“ Well , of course . ”
126529	126532	126534	126534	Hermione	197	“ But , ”
126546	126557	126540	126540	her	197	“ Mr. Lovegood , how can you possibly believe — ? ”
126558	126570	126572	126572	Xenophilius	339	“ Luna has told me all about you , young lady , ”
126574	126594	126572	126572	Xenophilius	339	“ You are , I gather , not unintelligent , but painfully limited . Narrow . Close - minded . ”
126595	126607	126609	126609	Ron	227	“ Perhaps you ought to try on the hat , Hermione , ”
126627	126631	126632	126632	Hermione	197	“ Mr. Lovegood , ”
126636	126659	126632	126632	Hermione	197	“ We all know that there are such things as Invisibility Cloaks . They are rare , but they exist . But — ”
126660	126770	126632	126632	Hermione	197	“ Ah , but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of Invisibility , Miss Granger ! I mean to say , it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm , or carrying a Bedazzling Hex , or else woven from Demiguise hair , which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque . We are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible , and endures eternally , giving constant and impenetrable concealment , no matter what spells are cast at it . How many cloaks have you ever seen like that , Miss Granger ? ”
126836	126839	126845	126845	he	339	“ Exactly , ”
126854	126876	126845	126845	he	339	“ None of you have ever seen such a thing . The possessor would be immeasurably rich , would he not ? ”
126897	126901	126903	126903	Hermione	197	“ All right , ”
126907	126929	126903	126903	Hermione	197	“ Say the Cloak existed … what about that stone , Mr. Lovegood ? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone ? ”
126930	126935	126877	126877	He	339	“ What of it ? ”
126936	126945	126903	126903	Hermione	197	“ Well , how can that be real ? ”
126946	126952	126954	126954	Xenophilius	339	“ Prove that is not , ”
126960	127031	126903	126903	Hermione	197	“ But that’s — I’m sorry , but that ’s completely ridiculous ! How can I possibly prove it does n’t exist ? Do you expect me to get hold of — of all the pebbles in the world and test them ? I mean , you could claim that anything ’s real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody ’s proved it does n’t exist ! ”
127032	127038	127040	127040	Xenophilius	339	“ Yes , you could , ”
127042	127057	127040	127040	Xenophilius	339	“ I am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little . ”
127058	127064	127066	127066	Harry	177	“ So the Elder Wand , ”
127074	127081	127066	127066	Harry	177	“ you think that exists too ? ”
127082	127095	127097	127097	Xenophilius	339	“ Oh , well , in that case there is endless evidence , ”
127099	127125	127097	127097	Xenophilius	339	“ The Elder Wand is the Hallow that is most easily traced , because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand . ”
127126	127131	127133	127133	Harry	177	“ Which is what ? ”
127135	127162	127164	127164	Xenophilius	339	“ Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner , if he is to be truly master of it , ”
127166	127244	127164	127164	Xenophilius	339	“ Surely you have heard of the way the wand came to Egbert the Egregious , after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil ? Of how Godelot died in his own cellar after his son , Hereward , took the wand from him ? Of the dreadful Loxias , who took the wand from Baraabas Deverill , whom he had killed ? The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history . ”
127263	127275	127277	127277	Ron	227	“ So where do you think the Elder Wand is now ? ”
127279	127285	127287	127287	Xenophilius	339	“ Alas , who knows ? ”
127297	127351	127290	127290	he	339	“ Who knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden ? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius . Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias , and which took the wand ? And who can say who may have defeated them ? History , alas , does not tell us . ”
127362	127379	127357	127358	Finally Hermione	197	“ Mr. Lovegood , does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows ? ”
127408	127419	127421	127421	Xenophilius	339	“ But you have been misleading me , young woman ! ”
127436	127464	127421	127421	Xenophilius	339	“ I thought you were new to the Hallows Quest ! Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything — everything!—to do with the Hallows ! ”
127465	127471	127473	127473	Ron	227	“ Who are the Peverells ? ”
127475	127494	127496	127496	Hermione	197	“ That was the name on the grave with the mark on it , in Godric ’s Hollow , ”
127502	127506	127496	127496	Hermione	197	“ Ignotus Peverell . ”
127507	127510	127512	127512	Xenophilius	339	“ Exactly ! ”
127519	127534	127512	127512	Xenophilius	339	“ The sign of the Death Hallows on Ignotus ’s grave is conclusive proof ! ”
127535	127539	127541	127541	Ron	227	“ Of what ? ”
127543	127576	127496	127496	Hermione	197	“ Why , that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell brothers , Antioch , Cadmus and Ignotus ! That they were the original owners of the Hallows ! ”
127601	127608	127609	127609	he	339	“ You will stay for dinner ? ”
127618	127629	127609	127609	he	339	“ Everybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimply soup . ”
127630	127642	127644	127644	Ron	227	“ Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo ’s , ”
127665	127671	127672	127672	he	339	“ What do you think ? ”
127676	127681	127682	127682	she	197	“ Oh , Harry , ”
127686	127721	127682	127682	she	197	“ it ’s a pile of utter rubbish . This ca n’t be what the sign really means . This must just be his weird take on it . What a waste of time . ”
127722	127737	127739	127739	Ron	227	“ I s’pose this is the man who brought us Crumple - Horned Snorkacks , ”
127741	127749	127750	127750	Harry	177	“ You did n’t believe it either ? ”
127754	127827	127828	127828	Ron	227	“ Nah , that story ’s just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons , is n’t it ? ‘ Do n’t go looking for trouble , do n’t go pick fights , do n’t go messing around with stuff that ’s best left alone ! Just keep your head down , mind your own business , and you ’ll be okay . Come to think of it , ”
127831	127845	127828	127828	Ron	227	“ maybe that story ’s why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky . ”
127846	127853	127917	127917	Hermione	197	“ What are you talking about ? ”
127854	127906	127828	127828	Ron	227	“ One of those superstitions , is n’t it ? ‘ May - born witches will marry Muggles . ’ ‘ Jinx by twilight , undone by midnight . ’ ‘ Wand of cider , never prosper . ’ You must have heard them . My mum ’s full of them . ”
127907	127916	127917	127917	Hermione	197	“ Harry and I were raised by Muggles , ”
127921	127928	127917	127917	Hermione	197	“ We were taught different superstitions . ”
127968	127975	127976	127976	she	197	“ I think you ’re right , ”
127980	128002	127976	127976	she	197	“ It ’s just a morality tale , it ’s obvious which gift is best , which one you ’d choose — ”
128016	128020	128021	128021	Ron	227	“ the Cloak , ”
128024	128028	128021	128021	Ron	227	“ the wand , ”
128033	128037	128030	128030	Harry	177	“ the stone . ”
128050	128059	128060	128060	Ron	227	“ You ’re supposed to say the Cloak , ”
128064	128088	128060	128060	Ron	227	“ but you would n’t need to be invisible if you had the wand . An unbeatable wand , Hermione , come on ! ”
128089	128098	128100	128100	Harry	177	“ We ’ve already got an Invisibility Cloak , ”
128102	128119	128121	128121	Hermione	197	“ And it ’s helped us rather a lot , in case you had n’t noticed ! ”
128123	128134	128121	128121	Hermione	197	“ Whereas the wand would be bound to attract trouble — ”
128135	128143	128145	128145	Ron	227	“ Only if you shouted about it , ”
128147	128198	128145	128145	Ron	227	“ Only if you were prat enough to go dancing around waving it over your head , and singing , ‘ I ’ve got an unbeatable wand , come and have a go if you think you ’re hard enough . ’ As long as you kept your trap shut — ”
128199	128211	128213	128213	Hermione	197	“ — Yes , but could you keep your trap shut ? ”
128218	128245	128213	128213	Hermione	197	“ You know the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra - powerful wands for hundreds of years . ”
128246	128250	128252	128252	Harry	177	“ There have ? ”
128273	128350	128267	128267	Ron	227	“ The Deathstick , the Wand of Destiny , they crop up under different names through the centuries , usually in the possession of some Dark wizard who ’s boasting about them . Professor Binns mentioned some of them , but — oh it ’s all nonsense . Wands are only as powerful as the wizards who use them . Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than other people ’s . ”
128351	128358	128360	128360	Harry	177	“ But how do you know , ”
128362	128389	128360	128360	Harry	177	“ that those wands — the Deathstick , and the Wand of Destiny — aren’t the same wand , surfacing over the centuries under different names ? ”
128390	128405	128407	128407	Ron	227	“ What if they ’re all really the Elder Wand , made by Darth ? ”
128476	128485	128486	128486	Ron	227	“ So why would you take the stone ? ”
128490	128514	128518	128518	Hermione	197	“ Well , if you could bring people back , we could have Sirius , Mad - Eye , Dumbledore , my parents … ”
128521	128540	128542	128542	Harry	177	“ But according to Beedle the Bard , they would n’t want to come back , would they ? ”
128553	128577	128578	128578	he	177	“ I do n’t suppose there have been loads of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead , have there ? ”
128582	128585	128586	128586	she	197	“ No , ”
128590	128635	128586	128586	she	197	“ I do n’t think anyone except Mr. Lovegood could kid themselves that ’s possible . Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorcerer ’s Stone ; you know , instead of a stone to make you immortal , a stone to reverse death . ”
128672	128680	128682	128682	Ron	227	“ What about the Cloak , though ? ”
128685	128738	128682	128682	Ron	227	“ Do n’t you realize , he ’s right ? I ’ve got so used to Harry ’s Cloak and how good it is , I never stopped to think . I ’ve never heard of one like Harry ’s . It ’s infallible . We ’ve never been spotted under it — ”
128739	128754	128652	128652	Harry	177	“ Of course not — we’re invisible when we ’re under it , Ron ! ”
128755	128841	128682	128682	Ron	227	“ But all the stuff he said about other cloaks , and they ’re not exactly ten a Knut , you know , is true ! It ’s never occurred to me before but I ’ve heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when they get old , or them being ripped apart by spells so they ’ve got holes , Harry ’s was owned by his dad , so it ’s not exactly new , is it , but it ’s just … perfect ! ”
128842	128854	128652	128652	Harry	177	“ Yes , all right , but Ron , the stone … ”
128935	128957	128928	128928	he	177	“ Harry , what are you doing ? I do n’t think you should look around when he ’s not here ! ”
129204	129209	129210	129210	Hermione	197	“ What ’s wrong ? ”
129243	129247	129249	129249	Harry	177	“ Mr. Lovegood , ”
129251	129256	129249	129249	Harry	177	“ Where ’s Luna ? ”
129257	129261	129224	129224	Xenophilius	339	“ Excuse me ? ”
129262	129267	129249	129249	Harry	177	“ Where ’s Luna ? ”
129275	129294	129268	129268	Xenophilius	339	“ I — I’ve already told you . She is down at the Botions Bridge fishing for Plimpies . ”
129295	129307	129249	129249	Harry	177	“ So why have you only laid that tray for four ? ”
129344	129356	129358	129358	Harry	177	“ I do n’t think Luna ’s been here for weeks , ”
129360	129389	129358	129358	Harry	177	“ Her clothes are gone , her bed has n’t been slept in . Where is she ? and why do you keep looking out of the window ? ”
129470	129477	129478	129478	He	339	“ Harry , look at this ! ”
129507	129511	129499	129499	his	339	“ Undesirable Number One ”
129519	129531	129532	129532	Harry	177	“ The Quibbler ’s going for a new angle , then ? ”
129542	129566	129532	129532	Harry	177	“ Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden , Mr. Lovegood ? Sending an owl to the Ministry ? ”
129572	129578	129579	129579	he	339	“ They took my Luna , ”
129582	129625	129579	129579	he	339	“ Because of what I ’ve been writing . They took my Luna and I do n’t know where she is , what they ’ve done to her . But they might give her back to me if I — If I — ”
129626	129631	129632	129632	Hermione	197	“ Hand over Harry ? ”
129637	129641	129643	129643	Ron	227	“ No deal , ”
129646	129657	129643	129643	Ron	227	“ Get out of the way , we ’re leaving . ”
129675	129699	129700	129700	He	339	“ They will be here any moment . I must save Luna . I can not lose Luna . You must not leave . ”
129729	129737	129738	129738	Harry	177	“ Do n’t make us hurt you , ”
129741	129751	129738	129738	Harry	177	“ Get out of the way , Mr. Lovegood . ”
129752	129755	129756	129756	Hermione	197	“ Harry ! ”
130038	130053	130084	130084	Xenophilius	339	“ Did n’t I tell you there was no need to hurry , Travers ? ”
130059	130073	130084	130084	Xenophilius	339	“ Did n’t I tell you this nutter was just raving as usual ? ”
130086	130095	130084	130084	Xenophilius	339	“ No … no … upstairs … Potter ! ”
130096	130138	130084	130084	Xenophilius	339	“ I told you last week , Lovegood , we were n’t coming back for anything less than some solid information ! Remember last week ? When you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid bleeding headdress ? And the week before”—Another
130142	130157	130084	130084	Xenophilius	339	squeal—“When you thought we ’d give her back if you offered us proof there are Cumple”—Bang—“Headed”—bang—“Snorkacks
130159	130159	130084	130084	Xenophilius	339	”
130160	130170	130172	130172	Xenophilius	339	“ No — no — I beg of you ! ”
130174	130182	130172	130172	Xenophilius	339	“ It really is Potter , Really ! ”
130183	130201	130203	130205	the Death Eater	240	“ And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up ! ”
130222	130236	130084	130084	Xenophilius	339	“ The place looks like it ’s about to fall in , Selwyn , ”
130249	130267	130084	130084	Xenophilius	339	“ The stairs are completely blocked . Could try clearing it ? Might bring the place down . ”
130268	130275	130277	130280	the wizard named Selwyn	2793	“ You lying piece of filth , ”
130282	130320	130280	130280	Selwyn	244	“ You have never seen Potter in your life , have you ? Thought you ’d lure us here to kill us , did you ? And you think you ’ll get your girl back like this ? ”
130321	130332	130084	130084	Xenophilius	339	“ I swear … I swear … Potter ’s upstairs ! ”
130333	130337	130280	130280	Selwyn	244	“ Homenum revelio , ”
130373	130384	130386	130388	the second man	2794	“ There ’s someone up there all right , Selwyn , ”
130391	130404	130406	130406	Xenophilius	339	“ It ’s Potter , I tell you , it ’s Potter ! ”
130408	130423	130406	130406	Xenophilius	339	“ Please … please … give me Luna , just let me have Luna … ”
130424	130434	130436	130436	Selwyn	244	“ You can have your little girl , Lovegood , ”
130438	130495	130436	130436	Selwyn	244	“ if you get up those stairs and bring me down Harry Potter . But if this is a plot , if it ’s a trick , if you ’ve got an accomplice waiting up there to ambush us , we ’ll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury . ”
130523	130527	130528	130528	Harry	177	“ Come on , ”
130531	130541	130528	130528	Harry	177	“ we ’ve got to get out of here . ”
130622	130626	130628	130628	Hermione	197	“ All right , ”
130659	130667	130645	130645	Xenophilius	339	“ Do you trust me , Harry ? ”
130671	130675	130676	130676	Hermione	197	“ Okay then , ”
130679	130696	130676	130676	Hermione	197	“ Give me the Invisibility Cloak . Ron , you ’re going to put it on . ”
130697	130703	130645	130645	Xenophilius	339	“ Me ? But Harry — ”
130704	130724	130676	130676	Hermione	197	“ Please , Ron ! Harry , hold on tight to my hand , Ron , grab my shoulder . ”
130768	130771	130772	130772	she	197	“ Hold tight ”
130775	130782	130772	130772	she	197	“ Hold tight … any second … ”
130797	130800	130802	130802	Hermione	197	“ Obliviate ! ”
130818	130821	130802	130802	Hermione	197	“ Deprimo ! ”
130949	130956	130946	130946	her	197	“ Protego Totalum … Salvio Hexia … ”
130957	130963	130964	130964	Ron	227	“ That treacherous old bleeder , ”
130979	131001	130964	130964	Ron	227	“ Hermione , you ’re a genius , a total genius . I ca n’t believe we got out of that . ”
131002	131031	130946	130946	her	197	“ Cave Inimicum … Did n’t I say it was an Erumpent horn , did n’t I tell him ? And now his house has been blown apart ! ”
131032	131037	131039	131039	Ron	227	“ Serves him right , ”
131052	131063	131039	131039	Ron	227	“ What ’d you reckon they ’ll do to him ? ”
131064	131074	131076	131076	Hermione	197	“ Oh I hope they do n’t kill him ! ”
131078	131106	131076	131076	Hermione	197	“ That ’s why I wanted the Death Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left , so they knew Xenophilius had n’t been lying ! ”
131107	131113	131115	131115	Ron	227	“ Why hide me though ? ”
131117	131154	131039	131039	Ron	227	“ You ’re supposed to be in bed with spattergroit , Ron ! They ’ve kidnapped Luna because her father supported Harry ! What would happen to your family if they knew you ’re with him ? ”
131155	131164	131076	131076	Hermione	197	“ But what about your mum and dad ? ”
131165	131171	131173	131173	Hermione	197	“ They ’re in Australia , ”
131175	131188	131173	131173	Hermione	197	“ They should be all right . They do n’t know anything . ”
131189	131195	131196	131196	Ron	227	“ You ’re a genius , ”
131202	131210	131212	131212	Harry	177	“ Yeah , you are , Hermione , ”
131215	131227	131212	131212	Harry	177	“ I do n’t know what we ’d do without you . ”
131237	131242	131173	131173	Hermione	197	“ What about Luna ? ”
131243	131258	131260	131260	Ron	227	“ Well , if they ’re telling the truth and she ’s still alive — ”
131262	131273	131275	131275	Hermione	197	“ Do n’t say that , do n’t say it ! ”
131277	131286	131275	131275	Hermione	197	“ She must be alive , she must ! ”
131287	131298	131300	131300	Ron	227	“ Then she ’ll be in Azkaban , I expect , ”
131302	131315	131300	131300	Ron	227	“ Whether she survives the place , though … Loads do n’t … ”
131316	131320	131322	131322	Harry	177	“ She will , ”
131333	131359	131322	131322	Harry	177	“ She ’s tough , Luna , much tougher than you ’d think . She ’s probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and Nargles . ”
131360	131367	131369	131369	Hermione	197	“ I hope you ’re right , ”
131379	131389	131371	131371	She	197	“ I ’d feel so sorry for Xenophilius if — ”
131390	131408	131410	131410	Ron	227	“ — if he had n’t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters , yeah , ”
131450	131459	131461	131461	Hermione	197	“ Oh , why did we go there ? ”
131469	131538	131461	131461	Hermione	197	“ Harry , you were right , it was Godric ’s Hollow all over again , a complete waste of time ! The Deathly Hallows … such rubbish … although actually . He might have made it all up , might n’t he ? He probably does n’t believe in the Deathly Hallows at all , he just wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived ! ”
131539	131546	131548	131548	Ron	227	“ I do n’t think so , ”
131550	131642	131548	131548	Ron	227	“ It ’s a damn sight harder making stuff up when you ’re under stress than you ’d think . I found that out when the Snatchers caught me . It was much easier pretending to be Stan , because I knew a bit about him , than inventing a whole new person . Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure , trying to make sure we stayed put . I reckon he told us the truth , or what he thinks is the truth , just to keep us talking . ”
131643	131653	131655	131655	Hermione	197	“ Well , I do n’t suppose it matters , ”
131657	131678	131655	131655	Hermione	197	“ Even if he was being honest , I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life . ”
131679	131685	131687	131687	Ron	227	“ Hang on , though , ”
131689	131705	131687	131687	Ron	227	“ The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a myth , was n’t it ? ”
131706	131717	131655	131655	Hermione	197	“ But the Deathly Hallows ca n’t exist , Ron ! ”
131718	131730	131732	131732	Ron	227	“ You keep saying that , but one of them can , ”
131734	131740	131732	131732	Ron	227	“ Harry ’s Invisibility Cloak — ”
131741	131752	131754	131754	Hermione	197	“ The Tale of the Three Brothers is a story , ”
131757	131788	131754	131754	Hermione	197	“ A story about how humans are frightened of death . If surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak , we ’d have everything we need already ! ”
131789	131803	131805	131805	Harry	177	“ I do n’t know . We could do with an unbeatable wand , ”
131819	131828	131754	131754	Hermione	197	“ There ’s no such thing , Harry ! ”
131829	131847	131754	131754	Hermione	197	“ You said there have been loads of wands — the Deathstick and whatever they were called — ”
131848	131871	131872	131872	Her	197	“ All right , even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand ’s real , what about the Resurrection Stone ? ”
131887	131900	131882	131882	her	197	“ No magic can raise the dead , and that ’s that ! ”
131901	131925	131754	131754	Hermione	197	“ When my wand connected with You - Know - Who ’s , it made my mum and dad appear … and Cedric … ”
131926	131940	131942	131942	Hermione	197	“ But they were n’t really back from the dead , were they ? ”
131944	131964	131942	131942	Hermione	197	“ Those kind of — of pale imitations are n’t the same as truly bringing someone back to life . ”
131965	132026	132027	132027	He	2807	“ But she , the girl in the tale , did n’t really come back , did she ? The story says that once people are dead , they belong with the dead . But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her , did n’t he ? He even lived with her for a while … ”
132068	132081	132082	132082	he	2807	“ So that Peverell bloke who ’s buried in Godric ’s Hollow , ”
132092	132103	132082	132082	he	2807	“ you do n’t know anything about him , then ? ”
132104	132107	132108	132108	she	197	“ No , ”
132119	132184	132185	132185	she	197	“ I looked him up after I saw the mark on his grave ; if he ’d been anyone famous or done anything important , I ’m sure he ’d be in one of our books . The only place I ’ve managed to find the name ‘ Peverell ’ is Nature ’s Nobility : A Wizarding Genealogy . I borrowed it from Kreacher , ”
132193	132222	132185	132185	she	197	“ It lists the pure - blood families that are now extinct in the male line . Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish . ”
132223	132230	132232	132232	Ron	227	“ Extinct in the male line ? ”
132234	132242	132244	132244	Hermione	197	“ It means the name died out , ”
132246	132273	132244	132244	Hermione	197	“ centuries ago , in the case of the Peverells . They could still have descendents , though , they ’d just be called something different . ”
132296	132298	132300	132303	a filthy old man	2809	“ Peverell ”
132321	132325	132317	132317	he	177	“ Marvolo Gaunt ! ”
132326	132329	132331	132331	Ron	227	“ Sorry ? ”
132336	132365	132366	132366	Ron	227	“ Marvolo Gaunt ! You - Know - Who ’s grandfather ! In the Pensieve ! With Dumbledore ! Marvolo Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells ! ”
132372	132418	132317	132317	he	177	“ The ring , the ring that became the Horcrux , Marvolo Gaunt said it had the Peverell coat of arms on it ! I saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministry ’s face , he nearly shoved it up his nose ! ”
132419	132426	132428	132428	Hermione	197	“ The Peverell coat of arms ? ”
132431	132440	132428	132428	Hermione	197	“ Could you see what it looked like ? ”
132441	132445	132447	132447	Harry	177	“ Not really , ”
132453	132488	132447	132447	Harry	177	“ There was nothing fancy on there , as far as I could see ; maybe a few scratches . I only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked open . ”
132513	132533	132535	132535	Harry	177	“ Blimey … You reckon it was this sign again ? The sign of the Hallows ? Why not , ”
132538	132639	132535	132535	Harry	177	“ Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig , all he cared about was his ancestry . If that ring had been passed down through the centuries , he might not have known what it really was . There were no books in that house , and trust me , he was n’t the type to read fairy tales to his kids . He ’d have loved to think the scratches on the stone were a coat of arms , because as far as he was concerned , having pure blood made you practically royal . ”
132640	132650	132652	132652	Hermione	197	“ Yes … and that ’s all very interesting , ”
132655	132670	132652	132652	Hermione	197	“ but Harry , if you ’re thinking what I think you ’re think — ”
132671	132680	132682	132682	Harry	177	“ Well , why not ? Why not ? ”
132687	132697	132698	132698	He	177	“ It was a stone , was n’t it ? ”
132705	132714	132698	132698	He	177	“ What if it was the Resurrection Stone ? ”
132721	132734	132652	132652	Hermione	197	“ Blimey — but would it still work if Dumbledore broke — ? ”
132735	132756	132760	132760	her	197	“ Work ? Work ? Ron , it never worked ! There ’s no such thing as a Resurrection Stone ! ”
132768	132782	132760	132760	her	197	“ Harry , you ’re trying to fit everything into the Hallows story — ”
132783	132788	132789	132789	he	177	“ Fit everything in ? ”
132792	132824	132789	132789	he	177	“ Hermione , it fits of its own accord ! I know the sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone ! Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells ! ”
132825	132842	132760	132760	her	197	“ A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly ! ”
132843	132853	132854	132854	Ron	227	“ Where ’d you reckon the ring is now ? ”
132858	132871	132854	132854	Ron	227	“ What did Dumbledore do with it after he broke it open ? ”
132955	132958	132963	132963	Hermione	197	“ Harry ? ”
133058	133069	133055	133055	he	177	“ Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died ! ”
133089	133128	133129	133129	Harry	177	“ My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak ! This is why ! He wanted to examine it , because he thought it was the third Hallow ! Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric ’s Hollow … ”
133151	133170	133129	133129	Harry	177	“ He ’s my ancestor . I ’m descended from the third brother ! It all makes sense ! ”
133210	133213	133219	133219	he	177	“ Harry , ”
133234	133238	133239	133239	he	177	“ Read it , ”
133252	133294	133239	133239	he	177	“ Read it ! Dumbledore had the Cloak , Hermione ! Why else would he want it ? He did n’t need a Cloak , he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one ! ”
133355	133373	133351	133351	he	177	“ It ’s in here ! He left me the ring — it ’s in the Snitch ! ”
133374	133380	133381	133381	He	177	“ You — you reckon ? ”
133491	133499	133503	133503	his	177	“ That ’s what he ’s after . ”
133514	133526	133503	133503	his	177	“ You - Know - Who ’s after the Elder Wand . ”
133878	133883	133884	133884	Harry	177	“ This is it , ”
133900	133919	133884	133884	Harry	177	“ This explains everything . The Deathly Hallows are real and I ’ve got one — maybe two — ”
133926	133954	133920	133920	He	177	“ — and You - Know - Who ’s chasing the third , but he does n’t realize … he just thinks it ’s a powerful wand — ”
133955	133958	133960	133960	Hermione	197	“ Harry , ”
133974	133991	133960	133960	Hermione	197	“ I ’m sorry , but I think you ’ve got this wrong , all wrong . ”
133992	134003	133920	133920	He	177	“ But do n’t you see ? It all fits — ”
134004	134011	134012	134012	she	197	“ Not , it does n’t , ”
134015	134031	134032	134032	she	197	“ It does n’t . Harry , you ’re just getting carried away . Please , ”
134040	134087	134035	134035	she	197	“ please just answer me this : If the Deathly Hallows really existed , and Dumbledore knew about them , knew that the person who possessed all of them would be master of death — Harry , why would n’t he have told you ? Why ? ”
134094	134118	134088	134088	He	2832	“ But you said it , Hermione ! You ’ve got to find out about them for yourself ! It ’s a Quest ! ”
134119	134137	134139	134139	Hermione	197	“ But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods ’ ! ”
134143	134151	134139	134139	Hermione	197	“ I did n’t really believe it ! ”
134157	134189	134152	134152	Harry	177	“ Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself . He let me try my strength , take risks . This feels like the kind of thing he ’d do . ”
134190	134244	134250	134250	her	197	“ Harry , this is n’t a game , this is n’t practice ! This is the real thing , and Dumbledore left you very clear instructions : Find and destroy the Horcruxes ! That symbol does n’t mean anything , forget the Deathly Hallows , we ca n’t afford to get sidetracked — ”
134298	134309	134293	134293	She	197	“ You do n’t believe in this , do you ? ”
134317	134332	134334	134334	Ron	227	“ I dunno … I mean … bits of it sort of fit together , ”
134337	134347	134334	134334	Ron	227	“ But when you look at the whole thing … ”
134354	134388	134348	134348	He	227	“ I think we ’re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes , Harry . That ’s what Dumbledore told us to do . Maybe … maybe we should forget about this Hallows business . ”
134389	134395	134397	134397	Hermione	197	“ Thank you , Ron , ”
134399	134406	134397	134397	Hermione	197	“ I ’ll take first watch . ”
134957	134960	134962	134962	Hermione	197	“ Obsession ? ”
134997	135023	134982	134982	Hermione	197	“ We ’re not the one with an obsession , Harry ! We ’re the ones trying to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do ! ”
135087	135099	135100	135100	Harry	177	“ ‘ The last enemy shall be destroyed is death , ’ ”
135104	135121	135122	135122	Hermione	197	“ I thought it was You - Know - Who we were supposed to be fighting ? ”
135422	135427	135428	135428	he	227	“ Three Horcruxes left , ”
135432	135459	135428	135428	he	227	“ We need a plan of action , come on ! Where have n’t we looked ? Let ’s go through it again . The orphanage … ”
135558	135563	135565	135565	Ron	227	“ You never know , ”
135570	135595	135565	135565	Ron	227	“ Upper Flagley is a Wizarding village , he might ’ve wanted to live there . Let ’s go and have a poke around . ”
135610	135624	135626	135626	Ron	227	“ Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters , ”
135628	135654	135626	135626	Ron	227	“ The lot that got me were a bit pathetic , but Bill recons some of them are really dangerous . They said on Potterwatch — ”
135655	135659	135661	135661	Harry	177	“ On what ? ”
135663	135736	135626	135626	Ron	227	“ Potterwatch , did n’t I tell you that ’s what it was called ? The program I keep trying to get on the radio , the only one that tells the truth about what ’s going on ! Nearly all of the programs are following You - Know - Who ’s line , all except Potterwatch , I really want you to hear it , but it ’s tricky tuning in … ”
135779	135789	135791	135791	he	227	“ A Cauldron Full of Hot , Strong Love . ”
135814	135825	135826	135826	he	227	“ They ’re normally something to do with the Order , ”
135830	135850	135826	135826	he	227	“ Bill had a real knack for guessing them . I ’m bound to get one in the end … ”
135901	135924	135893	135893	Ron	227	“ I ’ve got it , I ’ve got it ! Password was ‘ Albus ’ ! Get in here , Harry . ”
135997	136026	136145	136145	Lee	357	“ … apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves , which was due to a number of house calls in our area by those charming Death Eaters . ”
136027	136034	136036	136036	Hermione	197	“ But that ’s Lee Jordan ! ”
136038	136042	136044	136044	Ron	227	“ I know ! ”
136046	136051	136044	136044	Ron	227	“ Cool , eh ? ”
136052	136061	136062	136062	Lee	357	“ … now found ourselves another secure location , ”
136066	136091	136062	136062	Lee	357	“ and I ’m pleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening . Evening , boys ! ”
136092	136095	136044	136044	Ron	227	“ Hi . ”
136096	136101	136062	136062	Lee	357	“ Evening , River . ”
136102	136108	136109	136109	Ron	227	“ ‘ River’—that ’s Lee , ”
136112	136126	136109	136109	Ron	227	“ They ’ve all got code names , but you can usually tell — ”
136127	136130	136132	136132	Hermione	197	“ Shh ! ”
136134	136144	136145	136145	Lee	357	“ But before we hear from Royal and Romulus , ”
136149	136195	136145	136145	Lee	357	“ let ’s take a moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily Prophet do n’t think important enough to mention . It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted and Dirk Cresswell . ”
136271	136275	136277	136277	Lee	357	“ Thank you , ”
136281	136307	136277	136277	Lee	357	“ And now we can return to regular contributor Royal , for an update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world . ”
136308	136313	136339	136339	Hermione	197	“ Thanks , River , ”
136325	136328	136331	136331	Ron	227	“ Kingsley ! ”
136333	136337	136339	136339	Hermione	197	“ We know ! ”
136344	136362	136364	136364	Kingsley	211	“ Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to sustain heavy casualties , ”
136366	136438	136364	136364	Kingsley	211	“ However , we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and neighbors , often without the Muggles ’ knowledge . I ’d like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their example , perhaps by casting a protective charm over any Muggle dwellings in your street . Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken . ”
136439	136467	136469	136469	Lee	357	“ And what would you say , Royal , to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times , it should be ‘ Wizards first ’ ? ”
136471	136500	136502	136502	Kingsley	211	“ I ’d say that it ’s one short step from ‘ Wizards first ’ to ‘ Purebloods first , ’ and then to ‘ Death Eaters , ’ ”
136504	136526	136502	136502	Kingsley	211	“ We ’re all human , are n’t we ? Every human life is worth the same , and worth saving . ”
136527	136552	136554	136554	Lee	357	“ Excellently put , Royal , and you ’ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if we ever get out of this mess , ”
136556	136573	136554	136554	Lee	357	“ And now , over to Romulus for our popular feature ‘ Pals of Potter . ’ ”
136574	136579	136502	136502	Kingsley	211	“ Thanks , River , ”
136599	136606	136554	136554	Lee	357	“ We know it ’s Lupin ! ”
136607	136633	136592	136592	Hermione	197	“ Romulus , do you maintain , as you have every time you ’ve appeared on our program , that Harry Potter is still alive ? ”
136634	136638	136640	136640	Lupin	189	“ I do , ”
136674	136691	136592	136592	Hermione	197	“ And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening , Romulus ? ”
136692	136705	136707	136707	Lupin	189	“ I ’d tell him we ’re all with him in spirit , ”
136713	136732	136707	136707	Lupin	189	“ And I ’d tell him to follow his instincts , which are good and nearly always right . ”
136745	136750	136751	136751	she	197	“ Nearly always right , ”
136754	136763	136765	136765	Ron	227	“ Oh , did n’t I tell you ? ”
136769	136789	136765	136765	Ron	227	“ Bill told me Lupin ’s living with Tonks again ! And apparently she ’s getting pretty big too … ”
136790	136810	136811	136811	Lee	357	“ … and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter ’s who are suffering for their allegiance ? ”
136815	136848	136850	136850	Lupin	189	“ Well , as regular listeners will know , several of the more outspoken supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned , including Xenophilius Lovegood , erstwhile editor of The Quibbler , ”
136852	136860	136862	136862	Ron	227	“ At least he ’s still alive ! ”
136864	136876	136765	136765	Ron	227	“ We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid”—all
136890	136945	136811	136811	Lee	357	sentence—“well - known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School , has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts , where he is rumored to have hosted a ‘ Support Harry Potter ’ party in his house . However , Hagrid was not taken into custody , and is , we believe , on the run . ”
136946	136971	136973	136973	Lee	357	“ I suppose it helps , when escaping from Death Eaters , if you ’ve got a sixteen - foot - high half brother ? ”
136975	136985	136987	136988	Lupin gravely	189	“ It would tend to give you an edge , ”
136990	137036	136987	136988	Lupin gravely	189	“ May I just add that while we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid ’s spirit , we would urge even the most devoted of Harry ’s supporters against following Hagrid ’s lead . ‘ Support Harry Potter ’ parties are unwise in the present climate . ”
137037	137044	137046	137046	Lee	357	“ Indeed they are , Romulus , ”
137048	137131	137046	137046	Lee	357	“ so we suggest that you continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to Potterwatch ! And now let ’s move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter . We like to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater , and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about him , I ’d like to introduce a new correspondent . Rodent ? ”
137132	137137	137145	137145	Harry	177	“ ‘ Rodent ’ ? ”
137155	137158	137150	137150	Hermione	197	“ Fred ! ”
137159	137166	137046	137046	Lee	357	“ No — is it George ? ”
137167	137175	137177	137177	Ron	227	“ It ’s Fred , I think , ”
137190	137213	137177	137177	Ron	227	“ I ’m not being ‘ Rodent , ’ no way , I told you I wanted to be ‘ Rapier ’ ! ”
137214	137246	137046	137046	Lee	357	“ Oh , all right then , ‘ Rapier , ’ could you please give us your take on the various stories we ’ve been hearing about the Chief Death Eater ? ”
137247	137255	137257	137257	Fred	228	“ Yes , River , I can , ”
137259	137332	137257	137257	Fred	228	“ As our listeners will know , unless they ’ve taken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar , You - Know - Who ’s strategy of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic . Mind you , if all the alleged sightings of him are genuine , we must have a good nineteen You - Know - Whos running around the place . ”
137333	137341	137343	137343	Kingsley	211	“ Which suits him , of course , ”
137345	137359	137343	137343	Kingsley	211	“ The air of mystery is creating more terror than actually showing himself . ”
137360	137363	137365	137365	Fred	228	“ Agreed , ”
137367	137475	137365	137365	Fred	228	“ So , people , let ’s try and calm down a bit . Things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well . For instance , this new idea that You - Know - Who can kill people with a single glance from his eyes . That ’s a basilisk , listeners . One simple test : Check whether the thing that ’s glaring at you has got legs . If it has , it ’s safe to look into its eyes , although if it really is You - Know - Who , that ’s still likely to be the last thing you ever do . ”
137499	137510	137512	137512	Lee	357	“ And the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad ? ”
137514	137536	137538	137538	Fred	228	“ Well , who would n’t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he ’s been putting in ? ”
137540	137627	137538	137538	Fred	228	“ Point is , people , do n’t get lulled into a false sense of security , thinking he ’s out of the country . Maybe he is , maybe he is n’t , but the fact remains he can move faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to , so do n’t count on him being a long way away if you ’re planning to take any risks . I never thought I ’d hear myself say it , but safety first ! ”

138896	138901	138903	138903	Ron	227	“ Nod a laugh , ”
138905	138908	138903	138903	Ron	227	“ Aggiden . ”
138909	138912	138867	138867	Scabior	505	“ Accident ? ”

138956	138999	138937	138937	Greyback	350	“ Well , they do n’t show the Dark Lord proper respect , so the name ’s been Tabooed . A few Order members have been tracked that way . We ’ll see . Bind them up with the other two prisoners ! ”
139071	139078	139064	139064	Harry	177	“ Anyone still got a wand ? ”

139175	139185	139186	139186	Greyback	350	“ Not a bad little haul for one night , ”
139210	139233	139234	139234	he	350	“ A Mudblood , a runaway goblin , and these truants . You checked their names on the list yet , Scabior ? ”

139332	139362	139310	139310	he	350	“ So you are n’t wanted , then , Vernon ? Or are you on that list under a different name ? What house were you in at Hogwarts ? ”

139371	139385	139387	139387	Scabior	505	“ Funny ’ ow they all thinks we wants to ’ ear that , ”
139393	139407	139387	139387	Scabior	505	“ But none of ’em can tell us where the common room is . ”
139408	139415	139417	139417	Harry	177	“ It ’s in the dungeons , ”
139420	139447	139417	139417	Harry	177	“ You enter through the wall . It ’s full of skulls and stuff and its under the lake , so the light ’s all green . ”
139454	139470	139472	139472	Scabior	505	“ Well , well , looks like we really ’ ave caught a little Slytherin , ”
139474	139496	139472	139472	Scabior	505	“ Good for you , Vernon , ’cause there ai n’t a lot of Mudblood Slytherins . Who ’s your father ? ”
139497	139504	139505	139505	Harry	177	“ He works at the Ministry , ”
139546	139554	139531	139531	his	177	“ Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes . ”
139555	139562	139564	139564	Scabior	505	“ You know what , Greyback , ”
139566	139576	139564	139564	Scabior	505	“ I think there is a Dudley in there . ”
139595	139600	139602	139602	Greyback	350	“ Well , well , ”
139666	139701	139661	139661	Greyback	350	“ If you ’re telling the truth , ugly , you ’ve got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry . I expect your father’ll reward us just for picking you up . ”
139702	139705	139707	139707	Harry	177	“ But , ”
139714	139721	139707	139707	Harry	177	“ if you just let us — ”
139722	139725	139661	139661	Greyback	350	“ Hey ! ”

139853	139870	139872	139872	Scabior	505	“ ’ Ang on a minute , Greyback ! Look at this , in the Prophet ! ”
139994	140000	140001	140001	Scabior	505	“ ‘ Hermione Granger , ’ ”
140005	140021	140001	140001	Scabior	505	“ ‘ the Mudblood who is known to be traveling with ’ Arry Potter . ’ ”
140067	140086	140058	140058	he	350	“ You know what , little girly ? This picture looks a hell of a lot like you . ”
140087	140097	140098	140098	Hermione	197	“ It is n’t ! It is n’t me ! ”
140109	140121	140123	140123	Greyback	350	“ ‘ … known to be traveling with Harry Potter , ’ ”
140170	140181	140183	140183	Greyback	350	“ Well , this changed things , does n’t it ? ”
140232	140242	140243	140243	he	350	“ What ’s that on your forehead , Vernon ? ”
140265	140271	140272	140272	Harry	177	“ Do n’t touch it ! ”
140293	140302	140304	140304	Greyback	350	“ I thought you wore glasses , Potter ? ”

140322	140334	140315	140320	the Snatchers skulking in the background	2891	“ There was glasses in the tent , Greyback , wait — ”
140360	140364	140366	140366	Greyback	350	“ It is ! ”
140368	140374	140366	140366	Greyback	350	“ We ’ve caught Potter ! ”
140498	140518	140478	140478	he	177	“ … completely sure it ’s him ? ’Cause if it ai n’t , Greyback , we ’re dead . ”

140536	140591	140528	140528	Greyback	350	“ I say that ’s Potter , and him plus his wand , that ’s two hundred thousand Galleons right there ! But if you ’re too gutless to come along , any of you , it ’s all for me , and with any luck , I ’ll get the girl thrown in ! ”
140633	140637	140639	140639	Scabior	505	“ All right ! ”
140641	140666	140639	140639	Scabior	505	“ All right , we ’re in ! And what about the rest of ’em , Greyback , what ’ll we do with ’em ? ”
140667	140707	140742	140742	Greyback	350	“ Might as well take the lot . We ’ve got two Mudbloods , that ’s another ten Galleons . Give me the sword as well . If they ’re rubies , that ’s another small fortune right there . ”
140727	140740	140742	140742	Greyback	350	“ Grab hold and make it tight . I ’ll do Potter ! ”
140763	140773	140755	140755	his	350	“ On three ! One — two — three — ”

147206	147209	147211	147211	Bellatrix	188	“ Now , ”
147224	147269	147215	147215	Draco	186	“ Cissy , I think we ought to tie these little heroes up again , while Greyback takes care of Miss Mudblood . I am sure the Dark Lord will not begrudge you the girl , Greyback , after what you have done tonight . ”
147421	147424	147396	147396	He	177	“ Stupefy ! ”
147487	147490	147491	147491	she	187	“ Dobby ! ”
147498	147507	147495	147495	Bellatrix	188	“ You ! You dropped the chandelier — ? ”
147525	147533	147534	147534	he	3035	“ You must not hurt Harry Potter , ”
147537	147543	147545	147545	Bellatrix	188	“ Kill him , Cissy ! ”
147573	147579	147581	147581	Bellatrix	188	“ You dirty little monkey ! ”
147583	147600	147581	147581	Bellatrix	188	“ How dare you take a witch ’s wand , how dare you defy your masters ? ”
147601	147607	147609	147610	the elf	1605	“ Dobby has no master ! ”
147612	147631	147609	147610	the elf	1605	“ Dobby is a free elf , and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends ! ”
147656	147664	147665	147665	he	177	“ Ron , catch — and GO ! ”
147927	147933	147934	147934	he	177	“ Are you all right ? ”
147978	147986	147987	147987	he	177	“ Dobby , is this Shell Cottage ? ”
148010	148021	147987	147987	he	177	“ Have we come to the right place ? Dobby ? ”
148034	148037	148026	148028	The little elf	2996	“ DOBBY ! ”
148074	148081	148082	148082	Harry	177	“ Dobby — no — HELP ! ”
148094	148097	148082	148082	Harry	177	“ HELP ! ”
148160	148173	148148	148148	Harry	177	“ Dobby , no , do n’t die , do n’t die — ”
148192	148197	148182	148182	his	1605	“ Harry … Potter … ”
148290	148295	148283	148283	Harry	177	“ Dobby … Dobby … ”
148354	148357	148358	148358	he	177	“ Hermione , ”
148362	148367	148358	148358	he	177	“ Where is she ? ”
148368	148375	148377	148377	Bill	230	“ Ron ’s taken her inside , ”
148379	148386	148377	148377	Bill	230	“ She ’ll be all right . ”
148569	148577	148535	148535	His	177	“ I want to do it properly , ”
148591	148602	148535	148535	His	177	“ Not by magic . Have you got a spade ? ”
148999	149004	148997	148997	Dean	443	“ How ’s Hermione ? ”
149005	149008	149010	149010	Ron	227	“ Better , ”
149012	149019	149010	149010	Ron	227	“ Fleur ’s looking after her . ”
149133	149140	149113	149113	Dean	443	“ We should close his eyes . ”
149244	149247	149248	149248	she	340	“ There , ”
149252	149259	149248	149248	she	340	“ Now he could be sleeping . ”
149367	149376	149379	149379	Luna	340	“ I think we ought to say something , ”
149381	149390	149379	149379	Luna	340	“ I ’ll go first , shall I ? ”
149410	149459	149398	149398	she	340	“ Thank you so much , Dobby , for rescuing me from that cellar . It ’s so unfair that you had to die when you were so good and brave . I ’ll always remember what you did for us . I hope you ’re happy now . ”
149479	149486	149470	149470	his	227	“ yeah … thanks , Dobby . ”
149487	149490	149492	149492	Dean	443	“ Thanks , ”
149497	149503	149504	149504	he	177	“ Good bye , Dobby , ”
149553	149563	149564	149564	he	177	“ D’ya mind if I stay here a moment ? ”
149903	149936	149937	149937	He	177	“ … lucky that Ginny ’s on holiday . If she ’d been at Hogwarts they could have taken her before we reached her . Now we know she ’s safe too . ”
149946	149958	149959	149959	he	177	“ I ’ve been getting them all out of the Burrow , ”
149962	149990	149991	149991	he	177	“ Moved them to Muriel ’s . The Death Eaters know Ron ’s with you now , they ’re bound to target the family — don’t apologize , ”
150001	150028	149991	149991	he	177	“ It was always a matter of time , Dad ’s been saying so for months . We ’re the biggest blood traitor family there is . ”
150029	150035	150037	150037	Harry	177	“ How are they protected ? ”
150039	150140	149991	149991	he	177	“ Fidelius Charm . Dad ’s Secret - Keeper . And we ’ve done it on this cottage too ; I ’m Secret - Keeper here . None of us can go to work , but that ’s hardly the most important thing now . Once Ollivander and Griphook are well enough , we ’ll move them to Muriel ’s too . There is n’t much room here , but she ’s got plenty . Griphook ’s legs are on the mend . Fleur ’s given him Skele - Gro — we could probably move them in an hour or — ”
150141	150144	150145	150145	Harry	177	“ No , ”
150152	150171	150148	150148	Bill	230	“ I need both of them here . I need to talk to them . It ’s important . ”
150211	150218	150219	150219	Harry	177	“ I ’m going to wash , ”
150236	150248	150221	150221	Bill	230	“ Then I ’ll need to see them , straight away . ”
150666	150676	150677	150677	Harry	177	“ I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander , ”
150680	150683	150685	150685	Fleur	232	“ No , ”
150687	150704	150685	150685	Fleur	232	“ You will ’ ave to wait , ’ Arry . Zey are both too tired — ”
150705	150710	150711	150711	he	177	“ I ’m sorry , ”
150716	150740	150711	150711	he	177	“ but it ca n’t wait . I need to talk to them now . Privately — and separately . It ’s urgent . ”
150741	150751	150753	150753	Bill	230	“ Harry , what the hell ’s going on ? ”
150755	150792	150753	150753	Bill	230	“ You turn up here with a dead house - elf and a half - conscious goblin , Hermione looks as though she ’s been tortured , and Ron ’s just refused to tell me anything — ”
150793	150804	150806	150806	Harry	177	“ We ca n’t tell you what we ’re doing , ”
150809	150838	150806	150806	Harry	177	“ You ’re in the Order , Bill , you know Dumbledore left us a mission . We ’re not supposed to talk about it to anyone else . ”
150873	150886	150870	150870	Bill	230	“ All right . Who do you want to talk to first ? ”
150916	150919	150920	150920	Harry	177	“ Griphook , ”
150923	150931	150920	150920	Harry	177	“ I ’ll speak to Griphook first . ”
150950	150956	150958	150958	Bill	230	“ Up here , then , ”
150976	150984	150985	150985	he	177	“ I need you two as well ! ”
151019	151024	151025	151025	Harry	177	“ How are you ? ”
151029	151047	151025	151025	Harry	177	“ You were amazing — coming up with that story when she was hurting you like that — ”
151063	151072	151073	151073	he	177	“ What are we doing now , Harry ? ”
151076	151084	151054	151054	Ron	227	“ You ’ll see . Come on . ”
151108	151112	151114	151114	Bill	230	“ In here , ”
151215	151226	151228	151228	Harry	177	“ I ’m sorry to take you out of bed , ”
151230	151236	151228	151228	Harry	177	“ How are your legs ? ”
151237	151240	151242	151243	the goblin	2248	“ Painful , ”
151245	151249	151242	151243	the goblin	2248	“ But mending . ”
151325	151332	151333	151333	Harry	177	“ You probably do n’t remember — ”
151336	151358	151360	151360	Griphook	441	“ — that I was the goblin who showed you to your vault , the first time you ever visited Gringotts ? ”
151362	151378	151360	151360	Griphook	441	“ I remember , Harry Potter . Even amongst goblins , you are very famous . ”
151444	151450	151451	151451	he	2248	“ You buried the elf , ”
151458	151471	151451	151451	he	2248	“ I watched you from the window of the bedroom next door . ”
151472	151475	151477	151477	Harry	177	“ Yes , ”
151493	151503	151488	151488	his	441	“ You are an unusual wizard , Harry Potter . ”
151504	151509	151511	151511	Harry	177	“ In what way ? ”
151518	151524	151488	151488	his	441	“ You dug the grave . ”
151525	151528	151488	151488	his	441	“ So ? ”
151572	151580	151565	151565	He	177	“ Griphook , I need to ask — ”
151581	151588	151629	151629	Griphook	441	“ You also rescued a goblin . ”
151589	151592	151565	151565	He	177	“ What ? ”
151593	151602	151629	151629	Griphook	441	“ You brought me here . Saved me . ”
151603	151614	151616	151616	Harry	177	“ Well , I take it you ’re not sorry ? ”
151621	151627	151629	151629	Griphook	441	“ No , Harry Potter , ”
151645	151654	151635	151635	he	441	“ but you are a very odd wizard . ”
151655	151658	151660	151660	Harry	177	“ Right , ”
151662	151680	151660	151660	Harry	177	“ Well , I need some help , Griphook , and you can give it to me . ”
151705	151715	151697	151697	he	177	“ I need to break into a Gringotts vault . ”
151778	151781	151783	151783	Hermione	197	“ Harry — ”
151793	151800	151802	151803	the goblin	2248	“ Break into a Gringotts vault ? ”
151817	151822	151809	151809	he	2248	“ It is impossible . ”
151823	151830	151831	151831	Ron	227	“ No , it is n’t , ”
151835	151841	151831	151831	Ron	227	“ It ’s been done . ”
151842	151845	151847	151847	Harry	177	“ Yeah , ”
151849	151867	151847	151847	Harry	177	“ The same day I first met you , Griphook . My birthday , seven years ago . ”
151868	151879	151881	151882	the goblin	2248	“ The vault in question was empty at the time , ”
151907	151913	151895	151895	he	177	“ Its protection was minimal . ”
151914	151939	151941	151941	Harry	177	“ Well , the vault we need to get into is n’t empty , and I ’m guessing its protection will be pretty powerful , ”
151943	151950	151941	151941	Harry	177	“ It belongs to the Lestranges . ”
151978	151984	151986	151986	Griphook	441	“ You have no chance , ”
151989	152009	151986	151986	Griphook	441	“ No chance at all . If you seek beneath our floors , a treasure that was never yours — ”
152010	152028	152030	152030	Harry	177	“ Thief , you have been warned , beware — yeah , I know , I remember , ”
152032	152060	152030	152030	Harry	177	“ But I ’m not trying to get myself any treasure , I ’m not trying to take anything for personal gain . Can you believe that ? ”
152092	152111	152113	152113	Griphook	441	“ If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek personal gain , ”
152116	152150	152113	152113	Griphook	441	“ it would be you , Harry Potter . Goblins and elves are not used to the protection or the respect that you have shown this night . Not from wand - carriers . ”
152151	152156	152158	152158	Harry	177	“ Wand - carriers , ”
152189	152197	152199	152200	the goblin	2248	“ The right to carry a wand , ”
152203	152213	152199	152200	the goblin	2248	“ has long been contested between wizards and goblins . ”
152214	152224	152226	152226	Ron	227	“ Well , goblins can do magic without wands , ”
152228	152258	152199	152200	the goblin	2248	“ That is immaterial ! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand - lore with other magical beings , they deny us the possibility of extending our powers ! ”
152259	152272	152274	152274	Ron	227	“ Well , goblins wo n’t share any of their magic either , ”
152276	152306	152274	152274	Ron	227	“ You wo n’t tell us how to make swords and armor the way you do . Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have never — ”
152307	152313	152315	152315	Harry	177	“ It does n’t matter , ”
152323	152339	152318	152318	Griphook	441	“ This is n’t about wizards versus goblins or any other sort of magical creature — ”
152346	152396	152340	152340	Griphook	441	“ But it is , it is precisely that ! As the Dark Lord becomes ever more powerful , your race is set still more firmly above mine ! Gringotts falls under Wizarding rule , house - elves are slaughtered , and who amongst the wand - carriers protests ? ”
152397	152401	152403	152403	Hermione	197	“ We do ! ”
152415	152439	152411	152411	her	197	“ We protest ! And I ’m hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf , Griphook ! I ’m a Mudblood ! ”
152440	152446	152447	152447	Ron	227	“ Do n’t call yourself — ”
152450	152456	152458	152458	Hermione	197	“ Why should n’t I ? ”
152460	152498	152458	152458	Hermione	197	“ Mudblood , and proud of it ! I ’ve got no higher position under this new order than you have , Griphook ! It was me they chose to torture , back at the Malfoys ’ ! ”
152526	152539	152540	152540	she	197	“ Did you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free ? ”
152543	152558	152560	152560	Ron	227	“ Did you know that we ’ve wanted elves to be freed for years ? ”
152572	152590	152560	152560	Ron	227	“ You ca n’t want You - Know - Who defeated more than we do , Griphook ! ”
152605	152616	152617	152617	he	2248	“ What do you seek within the Lestranges ’ vault ? ”
152621	152638	152639	152639	He	2248	“ The sword that lies inside it is a fake . This is the real one . ”
152649	152668	152639	152639	He	2248	“ I think that you already know this . You asked me to lie for you back there . ”
152669	152686	152688	152688	Harry	177	“ But the fake sword is n’t the only thing in that vault , is it ? ”
152690	152700	152688	152688	Harry	177	“ Perhaps you ’ve seen other things in there ? ”
152731	152776	152721	152722	The goblin	2248	“ It is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts . We are the guardians of fabulous treasures . We have a duty to the objects placed in our care , which were , so often , wrought by our fingers . ”
152799	152803	152804	152804	he	2248	“ So young , ”
152808	152815	152804	152804	he	2248	“ to be fighting so many . ”
152816	152822	152824	152824	Harry	177	“ Will you help us ? ”
152826	152848	152824	152824	Harry	177	“ We have n’t got a hope of breaking in without a goblin ’s help . You ’re our one chance . ”
152849	152857	152859	152859	Griphook	441	“ I shall … think about it , ”
152862	152865	152866	152866	Ron	227	“ But — ”
152877	152881	152883	152883	Harry	177	“ Thank you , ”
152901	152905	152906	152906	he	2248	“ I think , ”
152919	152942	152906	152906	he	2248	“ that the Skele - Gro has finished its work . I may be able to sleep at last . Forgive me … ”
152943	152949	152951	152951	Harry	177	“ Yeah , of course , ”
152996	153000	153002	153002	Ron	227	“ Little git , ”
153004	153012	153002	153002	Ron	227	“ He ’s enjoying keeping us hanging . ”
153013	153016	153018	153018	Hermione	197	“ Harry , ”
153038	153061	153018	153018	Hermione	197	“ are you saying what I think you ’re saying ? Are you saying there ’s a Horcrux in the Lestranges vault ? ”
153062	153065	153067	153067	Harry	177	“ Yes , ”
153069	153121	153067	153067	Harry	177	“ Bellatrix was terrified when she thought we ’d been in there , she was beside herself . Why ? What did she think we ’d seen , what else did she think we might have taken ? Something she was petrified You - Know - Who would find out about . ”
153122	153146	153148	153148	Ron	227	“ But I thought we were looking for places You - Know - Who ’s been , places he ’s done something important ? ”
153153	153163	153148	153148	Ron	227	“ Was he ever inside the Lestranges ’ vault ? ”
153164	153176	153178	153178	Harry	177	“ I do n’t know whether he was ever inside Gringotts , ”
153180	153219	153178	153178	Harry	177	“ He never had gold there when he was younger , because nobody left him anything . He would have seen the bank from the outside , though , the first time he ever went to Diagon Alley . ”
153245	153324	153230	153230	he	177	“ I think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Gringotts vault . I think he ’d have seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the Wizarding world . And do n’t forget , he trusted Bellatrix and her husband . They were his most devoted servants before he fell , and they went looking for him after he vanished . He said it night he came back , I heard him . ”
153330	153398	153325	153325	Harry	177	“ I do n’t think he ’d have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux , though . He never told Lucius Malfoy the truth about the diary . He probably told her it was a treasured possession and asked her to place it in her vault . The safest place in the world for anything you want to hide , Hagrid told me … except for Hogwarts . ”
153410	153416	153325	153325	Harry	177	“ You really understand him . ”
153417	153422	153424	153424	Harry	177	“ Bits of him , ”
153426	153450	153424	153424	Harry	177	“ Bits … I just wish I ’d understood Dumbledore as much . But we ’ll see . Come on — Ollivander now . ”
153480	153484	153486	153486	them	3156	“ Come in ! ”
153603	153614	153615	153615	Harry	177	“ Mr. Ollivander , I ’m sorry to disturb you , ”
153618	153623	153624	153624	Ollivander	273	“ My dear boy , ”
153630	153656	153624	153624	Ollivander	273	“ You rescued us , I thought we would die in that place , I can never thank you … never thank you … enough . ”
153657	153665	153624	153624	Ollivander	273	“ We were glad to do it . ”
153751	153760	153732	153732	he	177	“ Mr. Ollivander , I need some help . ”
153761	153766	153768	153769	the wandmaker	2997	“ Anything . Anything , ”
153772	153782	153732	153732	he	177	“ Can you mend this ? Is it possible ? ”
153802	153808	153810	153810	Ollivander	273	“ Holly and phoenix feather , ”
153816	153824	153810	153810	Ollivander	273	“ Eleven inches . Nice and supple . ”
153825	153828	153830	153830	Harry	177	“ Yes , ”
153832	153837	153830	153830	Harry	177	“ Can you — ? ”
153838	153841	153843	153843	Ollivander	273	“ No , ”
153845	153875	153843	153843	Ollivander	273	“ I am sorry , very sorry , but a wand that has suffered this degree of damage can not be repaired by any means that I know of . ”
153942	153948	153949	153949	Harry	177	“ Can you identify these ? ”
153982	153988	153989	153989	he	2997	“ Walnut and dragon heartstring , ”
153992	154011	153989	153989	he	2997	“ Twelve - and - three - quarter inches . Unyielding . This wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange . ”
154012	154017	153952	153953	The wandmaker	2997	“ And this one ? ”
154024	154045	154018	154018	Ollivander	273	“ Hawthorn and unicorn hair . Ten inches precisely . Reasonably springy . This was the wand of Draco Malfoy . ”
154046	154049	154051	154051	Harry	177	“ Was ? ”
154053	154060	154051	154051	Harry	177	“ Is n’t it still his ? ”
154061	154070	154018	154018	Ollivander	273	“ Perhaps not . If you took it — ”
154071	154076	154051	154051	Harry	177	“ — I did — ”
154077	154119	154018	154018	Ollivander	273	“ — then it may be yours . Of course , the manner of taking matters . Much also depends upon the wand itself . In general , however , where a wand has been won , its allegiance will change . ”
154137	154148	154150	154150	Harry	177	“ You talk about wands like they ’ve got feelings , ”
154152	154160	154150	154150	Harry	177	“ like they can think for themselves . ”
154161	154168	154170	154170	Ollivander	273	“ The wand chooses the wizard , ”
154172	154188	154170	154170	Ollivander	273	“ That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore . ”
154189	154205	154207	154207	Harry	177	“ A person can still use a wand that has n’t chosen them , though ? ”
154209	154283	154170	154170	Ollivander	273	“ Oh yes , if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any instrument . The best results , however , must always come where there is the strongest affinity between wizard and wand . These connections are complex . An initial attraction , and then a mutual quest for experience , the wand learning from the wizard , the wizard from the wand . ”
154297	154308	154310	154310	Harry	177	“ I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force , ”
154312	154319	154310	154310	Harry	177	“ Can I use it safely ? ”
154320	154345	154453	154453	Ollivander	273	“ I think so . Subtle laws govern wand ownership , but the conquered wand will usually bend its will to its new master . ”
154346	154354	154356	154356	Ron	227	“ So I should use this one ? ”
154372	154429	154453	154453	Ollivander	273	“ Chestnut and dragon heartstring . Nine - and - a - quarter inches . Brittle . I was forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping , for Peter Pettigrew . Yes , if you won it , it is more likely to do your bidding , and do it well , than another wand . ”
154430	154442	154444	154444	Harry	177	“ And this holds true for all wands , does it ? ”
154446	154451	154453	154453	Ollivander	273	“ I think so , ”
154463	154482	154455	154455	his	273	“ You ask deep questions , Mr. Potter . Wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic . ”
154483	154503	154505	154505	Harry	177	“ So , it is n’t necessary to kill the previous owner to take the possession of a wand ? ”
154510	154526	154507	154507	Ollivander	273	“ Necessary ? No , I should not say that it is necessary to kill . ”
154527	154534	154536	154536	Harry	177	“ There are legends , though , ”
154568	154588	154558	154558	Voldemort	175	“ Legends about a wand — or wands — that have been passed from hand to hand by murder . ”
154618	154626	154627	154627	he	273	“ Only one wand , I think , ”
154630	154646	154648	154648	Harry	177	“ And You - Know - Who is interested in it , is n’t he ? ”
154650	154655	154660	154660	he	273	“ I — how ? ”
154670	154677	154660	154660	he	273	“ How do you know this ? ”
154678	154694	154696	154696	Harry	177	“ He wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands , ”
154702	154734	154660	154660	he	273	“ He tortured me , you must understand that ! The Cruciatus Curse , I — I had no choice but to tell him what I knew , what I guessed ! ”
154735	154739	154741	154741	Harry	177	“ I understand , ”
154743	154764	154741	154741	Harry	177	“ You told him about the twin cores ? You said he just had to borrow another wizard ’s wand ? ”
154782	154789	154790	154790	Harry	177	“ But it did n’t work , ”
154794	154809	154790	154790	Harry	177	“ Mine still beat the borrowed wand . Do you know why that is ? ”
154821	154910	154816	154816	he	273	“ I had … never heard of such a thing . Your wand performed something unique that night . The connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare , yet why your wand would have snapped the borrowed wand , I do not know … We were talking about the other wand , the wand that changes hands by murder . When You - Know - Who realized my wand had done something strange , he came back and asked about that other wand , did n’t he ? ”
154911	154918	154816	154816	he	273	“ How do you know this ? ”
154924	154930	154932	154932	Ollivander	273	“ Yes , he asked , ”
154934	154963	154932	154932	Ollivander	273	“ He wanted to know everything I could tell him about the wand variously known as the Deathstick , the Wand of Destiny , or the Elder Wand . ”
154974	154979	154981	154981	Ollivander	273	“ The Dark Lord , ”
154988	155041	154981	154981	Ollivander	273	“ had always been happy with the wand I made him — yew and phoenix feather , thirteen - and - a - half inches — until he discovered the connection of the twin cores . Now he seeks another , more powerful wand , as the only way to conquer yours . ”
155042	155062	155064	155064	Harry	177	“ But he ’ll know soon , if he does n’t already , that mine ’s broken beyond repair , ”
155067	155070	155072	155072	Hermione	197	“ No ! ”
155077	155091	155072	155072	Hermione	197	“ He ca n’t know that , Harry , how could he — ? ”
155092	155096	155098	155098	Harry	177	“ Priori Incantatem , ”
155100	155169	155098	155098	Harry	177	“ We left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the Malfoys ’ , Hermione . If they examine them properly , make them re - create the spells they ’ve cast lately , they ’d see that yours broke mine , they ’ll see that you tried and failed to mend it , and they ’ll realize that I ’ve been using the blackthorn one ever since . ”
155195	155204	155185	155185	Ron	227	“ Let ’s not worry about that now — ”
155210	155244	155206	155207	Mr. Ollivander	273	“ The Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your destruction , Mr. Potter . He is determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly invulnerable . ”
155245	155250	155206	155207	Mr. Ollivander	273	“ And will it ? ”
155251	155263	155265	155265	Ollivander	273	“ The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack , ”
155267	155288	155265	155265	Ollivander	273	“ but the idea of the Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is , I must admit … formidable . ”
155342	155357	155359	155359	Hermione	197	“ You — you really think this wand exists , then , Mr. Ollivander ? ”
155361	155365	155367	155367	Ollivander	273	“ Oh yes , ”
155369	155457	155367	155367	Ollivander	273	“ Yes , it is perfectly possible to trace the wand ’s course through history . There are gaps , of , course , and long ones , where it vanishes from view , temporarily lost or hidden ; but always it resurfaces . It has certain identifying characteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognize . There are written accounts , some of them obscure , that I and other wandmakers have made it our business to study . They have the ring of authenticity . ”
155458	155476	155477	155477	Hermione	197	“ So you — you do n’t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth ? ”
155481	155484	155486	155486	Ollivander	273	“ No , ”
155488	155557	155486	155486	Ollivander	273	“ Whether it needs to pass by murder , I do not know . Its history is bloody , but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object , and arouses such passions in wizards . Immensely powerful , dangerous in the wrong hands , and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands . ”
155558	155562	155564	155564	Harry	177	“ Mr. Ollivander , ”
155566	155585	155564	155564	Harry	177	“ you told You - Know - Who that Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand , did n’t you ? ”
155602	155611	155599	155599	he	273	“ But how — how do you — ? ”
155612	155620	155622	155622	Harry	177	“ Never mind how I know it , ”
155660	155674	155599	155599	he	273	“ You told You - Know - Who that Gregorovitch had the wand ? ”
155675	155681	155683	155683	Ollivander	273	“ It was a rumor , ”
155685	155731	155683	155683	Ollivander	273	“ A rumor , years and years ago , long before you were born , I believe Gregorovitch himself started it . You can see how good it would be for business ; that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder Wand ! ”
155732	155740	155742	155742	Harry	177	“ Yes , I can see that , ”
155748	155775	155744	155744	He	177	“ Mr. Ollivander , one last thing , and then we ’ll let you get some rest . What do you know about the Deathly Hallows ? ”
155776	155782	155784	155785	the wandmaker	2997	“ The — the what ? ”
155791	155796	155744	155744	He	177	“ The Deathly Hallows . ”
155797	155820	155744	155744	He	177	“ I ’m afraid I do n’t know what you ’re talking about . Is this still something to do with wands ? ”
155843	155847	155849	155849	Harry	177	“ Thank you , ”
155851	155867	155849	155849	Harry	177	“ Thank you very much . We ’ll leave you to get some rest now . ”
155872	155878	155879	155879	he	273	“ He was torturing me ! ”
155882	155892	155879	155879	he	273	“ The Cruciatus Curse … you have no idea … ”
155893	155897	155899	155899	Harry	177	“ I do , ”
155901	155920	155899	155899	Harry	177	“ I really do . Please get some rest . Thank you for telling me all of this . ”
156087	156098	156099	156099	he	177	“ Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago , ”
156102	156172	156099	156099	he	177	“ I saw You - Know - Who trying to find him . When he tracked him down , he found that Gregorovitch did n’t have it anymore : It was stolen from him by Grindelwald . How Grindelwald found out that Gregorovitch had it , I do n’t know — but if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor , it ca n’t have been that difficult . ”
156205	156251	156173	156173	Voldemort	175	“ And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful . And at the height of his power , when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him , he dueled Grindelwald and beat him , and he took the Elder Wand . ”
156252	156259	156261	156261	Ron	227	“ Dumbledore had the Elder Wand ? ”
156263	156272	156261	156261	Ron	227	“ But then — where is it now ? ”
156273	156277	156279	156279	Harry	177	“ At Hogwarts , ”
156293	156301	156303	156303	Ron	227	“ But then , let ’s go ! ”
156306	156319	156303	156303	Ron	227	“ Harry , let ’s go and get it before he does ! ”
156320	156328	156330	156330	Harry	177	“ It ’s too late for that , ”
156349	156361	156332	156332	He	177	“ He knows where it is . He ’s there now . ”
156362	156365	156366	156366	Ron	227	“ Harry ! ”
156370	156403	156366	156366	Ron	227	“ How long have you known this — why have we been wasting time ? Why did you talk to Griphook first ? We could have gone — we could still go — ”
156404	156407	156409	156409	Harry	177	“ No , ”
156421	156452	156409	156409	Harry	177	“ Hermione ’s right . Dumbledore did n’t want me to have it . He did n’t want me to take it . He wanted me to get the Horcruxes . ”
156453	156460	156462	156462	Ron	227	“ The unbeatable wand , Harry ! ”
156464	156479	156524	156524	his	227	“ I ’m not supposed to … I ’m supposed to get the Horcruxes … ”
156510	156520	156521	156521	he	227	“ I shall join you in the castle shortly , ”
156530	156535	156521	156521	he	227	“ Leave me now . ”
157026	157044	157008	157008	He	177	“ What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand ? ”
157045	157064	157008	157008	He	177	“ What if working out what the symbol meant made you ‘ worthy ’ to get the Hallows ? ”
157065	157091	157008	157008	He	177	“ Harry , if that really is the Elder Wand , how the hell are we supposed to finish off You - Know - Who ? ”
157212	157222	157223	157223	she	197	“ You could never have done that , Harry , ”
157229	157240	157223	157223	she	197	“ You could n’t have broken into Dumbledore ’s grave . ”
157341	157347	157349	157349	Ron	227	“ But is he dead ? ”
157401	157416	157387	157387	they	3214	“ Yes , he is . Ron , please do n’t start that again ! ”
157417	157425	157427	157427	Ron	227	“ Look at the facts , Hermione , ”
157441	157457	157431	157431	Harry	177	“ The solve doe . The sword . The eye Harry saw in the mirror — ”
157458	157474	157387	157387	they	3214	“ Harry admits he could have imagined the eye ! Do n’t you , Harry ? ”
157475	157480	157482	157482	Harry	177	“ I could have , ”
157488	157500	157502	157502	Ron	227	“ But you do n’t think you did , do you ? ”
157504	157511	157513	157513	Harry	177	“ No , I do n’t , ”
157515	157520	157522	157522	Ron	227	“ There you go ! ”
157531	157550	157522	157522	Ron	227	“ If it was n’t Dumbledore , explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar , Hermione ? ”
157551	157575	157606	157606	Dumbledore	207	“ I can’t — but can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us if he ’s lying in a tomb at Hogwarts ? ”
157576	157587	157522	157522	Ron	227	“ I dunno , it could ’ve been his ghost ! ”
157588	157598	157600	157600	Harry	177	“ Dumbledore would n’t come back as a ghost , ”
157619	157626	157614	157614	he	177	“ He would have gone on . ”
157627	157637	157639	157639	Ron	227	“ What d’you mean , ‘ gone on ’ ? ”
157655	157659	157614	157614	he	177	“ ’ Arry ? ”
157677	157709	157660	157660	Fleur	232	“ ’ Arry , Grip’ook would like to speak to you . ’ E eez in ze smallest bedroom , ’ e says ’ e does not want to be over’eard . ”
157797	157807	157809	157810	the goblin	2248	“ I have reached my decision , Harry Potter , ”
157831	157850	157809	157810	the goblin	2248	“ Though the goblins of Gringotts will consider it base treachery , I have decided to help you — ”
157851	157856	157858	157858	Harry	177	“ That ’s great ! ”
157865	157875	157858	157858	Harry	177	“ Griphook , thank you , we ’re really — ”
157876	157881	157883	157884	the goblin	2248	“ — in return , ”
157887	157891	157883	157884	the goblin	2248	“ for payment . ”
157899	157911	157858	157858	Harry	177	“ How much do you want ? I ’ve got gold . ”
157912	157916	157918	157918	Griphook	441	“ Not gold , ”
157920	157925	157918	157918	Griphook	441	“ I have gold . ”
157939	157951	157858	157858	Harry	177	“ I want the sword . The sword of Godric Gryffindor . ”
157957	157964	157965	157965	he	177	“ You ca n’t have that , ”
157968	157973	157965	157965	he	177	“ I ’m sorry . ”
157974	157977	157979	157980	the goblin	2248	“ Then , ”
157983	157989	157979	157980	the goblin	2248	“ we have a problem . ”
157990	157998	158000	158000	Ron	227	“ We can give you something else , ”
158003	158027	158000	158000	Ron	227	“ I ’ll bet the Lestranges have got loads of stuff , you can take your pick once we get into the vault . ”
158039	158062	158035	158035	Griphook	441	“ I am not a thief , boy ! I am not trying to procure treasures to which I have no right ! ”
158063	158069	158140	158141	the goblin	2248	“ The sword ’s ours — ”
158070	158075	158077	158078	the goblin	2248	“ It is not , ”
158080	158092	158077	158078	the goblin	2248	“ We ’re Gryffindors , and it was Godric Gryffindor ’s — ”
158093	158105	158107	158108	the goblin	2248	“ And before it was Gryffindor ’s , whose was it ? ”
158114	158119	158121	158121	Ron	227	“ No one ’s , ”
158123	158134	158121	158121	Ron	227	“ It was made for him , was n’t it ? ”
158135	158138	158140	158141	the goblin	2248	“ No ! ”
158155	158207	158147	158147	he	2248	“ Wizarding arrogance again ! That sword was Ragnuk the First ’s , taken from him by Godric Gryffindor ! It is a lost treasure , a masterpiece of goblinwork ! It belongs with the goblinwork . The sword is the price of my hire , take it or leave it ! ”
158223	158246	158213	158213	Harry	177	“ We need to discuss this , Griphook , if that ’s all right . Could you give us a few minutes ? ”
158283	158299	158280	158280	Ron	227	“ He ’s having a laugh . We ca n’t let him have that sword . ”
158300	158305	158306	158306	Harry	177	“ It is true ? ”
158310	158318	158306	158306	Harry	177	“ Was the sword stolen by Gryffindor ? ”
158319	158325	158326	158326	she	197	“ I do n’t know , ”
158330	158362	158326	158326	she	197	“ Wizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races , but there ’s no account that I know of that says Gryffindor stole the sword . ”
158363	158373	158375	158375	Ron	227	“ It ’ll be one of those goblin stories , ”
158377	158409	158375	158375	Ron	227	“ about how the wizards are always trying to get one over on them . I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he has n’t asked for one of our wands . ”
158410	158422	158424	158424	Hermione	197	“ Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards , Ron , ”
158426	158436	158424	158424	Hermione	197	“ They ’ve been treated brutally in the past . ”
158437	158451	158453	158453	Ron	227	“ Goblins are n’t exactly fluffy little bunnies , though , are they ? ”
158455	158469	158453	158453	Ron	227	“ They ’ve killed plenty of us . They ’ve fought dirty too . ”
158470	158498	158424	158424	Hermione	197	“ But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhanded and violent is n’t going to make him more likely to help us , is it ? ”
158539	158542	158544	158544	Ron	227	“ Okay , ”
158554	158600	158547	158547	Harry	177	“ how ’s this ? We tell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the vault and then he can have it . There ’s a fake in these , is n’t there ? We switch them , and give him the fake . ”
158601	158614	158616	158616	Hermione	197	“ Ron , he ’d know the difference better than we would ! ”
158618	158632	158616	158616	Hermione	197	“ He ’s the only one who realized there had been a swap ! ”
158633	158644	158547	158547	Harry	177	“ Yeah , but we could scarper before he realizes — ”
158655	158658	158659	158659	she	197	“ That , ”
158663	158690	158659	158659	she	197	“ is despicable . Ask for his help , then double - cross him ? And you wonder why goblins do n’t like wizards , Ron ? ”
158698	158722	158691	158691	Ron	227	“ All right , all right ! It was the only thing I could think of ! What ’s your solution , then ? ”
158723	158737	158691	158691	Ron	227	“ We need to offer him something else , something just as valuable . ”
158738	158761	158691	158691	Ron	227	“ Brilliant , I ’ll go and get one of our ancient goblin - made swords and you can gift wrap it . ”
158869	158875	158876	158876	Harry	177	“ Maybe he ’s lying , ”
158884	158907	158876	158876	Harry	177	“ Griphook . Maybe Gryffindor did n’t take the sword . How do we know the goblin version of history ’s right ? ”
158908	158915	158917	158917	Hermione	197	“ Does it make a difference ? ”
158919	158927	158929	158929	Harry	177	“ Changes how I feel about it , ”
158937	158973	158931	158931	He	177	“ We ’ll tell him he can have the sword after he ’s helped us get into that vault — but we ’ll be careful to avoid telling him exactly when he can have it . ”
158990	158997	158983	158983	Hermione	197	“ Harry , we ca n’t — ”
158998	159004	159005	159005	Harry	177	“ He can have it , ”
159009	159036	159005	159005	Harry	177	“ after we ’ve used it on all of the Horcruxes . I ’ll make sure he gets it then . I ’ll keep my word . ”
159037	159044	159046	159046	Hermione	197	“ But that could be years ! ”
159048	159066	159046	159046	Hermione	197	“ I know that , but he need n’t . I wo n’t be lying … really . ”
159110	159117	159119	159119	Hermione	197	“ I do n’t like it , ”
159121	159128	159129	159129	Harry	177	“ Nor do I , much , ”
159132	159141	159143	159143	Ron	227	“ Well , I think it ’s genius , ”
159149	159157	159143	159143	Ron	227	“ Let ’s go and tell him . ”
159223	159246	159215	159215	Griphook	441	“ I have your word , Harry Potter , that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help you ? ”
159247	159250	159252	159252	Harry	177	“ Yes , ”
159254	159258	159260	159261	the goblin	2248	“ Then shake , ”
159300	159306	159288	159288	Griphook	441	“ So . We begin ! ”
159342	159353	159354	159354	Griphook	441	“ I have visited the Lestranges ’ vault only once , ”
159358	159403	159354	159354	Griphook	441	“ on the occasion I was told to place inside it the false sword . It is one of the most ancient chambers . The oldest Wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level , where the vaults are largest and best protected … ”
159447	159459	159461	159461	Hermione	197	“ There ’s really only enough left for one of us , ”
159750	159755	159756	159756	he	177	“ I ’m sorry , ”
159771	159785	159756	159756	he	177	“ I never meant you to have to deal with all of this . ”
159831	159847	159825	159825	her	232	“ ’ Arry , you saved my sister ’s life , I do not forget . ”
159872	159875	159876	159876	Fleur	232	“ Anyway , ”
159899	159918	159919	159919	she	232	“ Mr. Ollivander leaves for Muriel ’s zis evening . Zat will make zings easier . Ze goblin , ”
159929	159946	159919	159919	she	232	“ can move downstairs , and you , Ron , and Dean can take zat room . ”
159947	159958	159960	159960	Harry	177	“ We do n’t mind sleeping in the living room , ”
159986	159993	159978	159978	Griphook	441	“ Do n’t worry about us . ”
160004	160030	160000	160000	he	177	“ We ’ll be off your hands soon too , Ron , Hermione , and I. We wo n’t need to be here much longer . ”
160031	160039	160040	160040	she	232	“ But , what do you mean ? ”
160059	160073	160040	160040	she	232	“ Of course you must not leave , you are safe ’ ere ! ”
160117	160124	160125	160125	Luna	340	“ … and tiny little ears , ”
160129	160166	160125	160125	Luna	340	“ a bit like hippo ’s , Daddy says , only purple and hairy . And if you want to call them , you have to hum ; they prefer a waltz , nothing too fast … ”
160217	160269	160270	160270	Luna	340	“ … and if you ever come to our house I ’ll be able to show you the horn , Daddy wrote to me about it but I have n’t seen it yet , because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and I never got home for Christmas , ”
160282	160289	160290	160290	Hermione	197	“ Luna , we told you , ”
160296	160314	160290	160290	Hermione	197	“ That horn exploded . It came from an Erumpent , not a Crumple - Horned Snorkack — ”
160315	160325	160327	160327	Luna	340	“ No , it was definitely a Snorkack horn , ”
160330	160352	160327	160327	Luna	340	“ Daddy told me . It will probably have re - formed by now , they mend themselves , you know . ”
160398	160409	160411	160411	Luna	340	“ I ’m going to miss you , Mr. Ollivander , ”
160418	160426	160428	160428	Ollivander	273	“ And I you , my dear , ”
160436	160449	160428	160428	Ollivander	273	“ You were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place . ”
160450	160459	160461	160461	Fleur	232	“ So , au revoir , Mr. Ollivander , ”
160469	160495	160461	160461	Fleur	232	“ And I wonder whezzer you could oblige me by delivering a package to Bill ’s Auntie Muriel ? I never returned ’ er tiara . ”
160496	160503	160505	160505	Ollivander	273	“ It will be an honor , ”
160511	160525	160505	160505	Ollivander	273	“ the very least I can do in return for your generous hospitality . ”
160558	160563	160565	160565	Griphook	441	“ Moonstones and diamonds , ”
160577	160585	160565	160565	Griphook	441	“ Made by goblins , I think ? ”
160586	160593	160595	160595	Bill	230	“ And paid for by wizards , ”
160708	160713	160714	160714	he	230	“ Everything ’s fine , ”
160718	160782	160714	160714	he	230	“ Ollivander settled in , Mum and Dad say hello . Ginny sends you all her love , Fred and George are driving Muriel up the wall , they ’re still operating an Owl - Order business out of her back room . It cheered her up to have her tiara back , though . She said she thought we ’d stolen it . ”
160783	160793	160795	160795	Fleur	232	“ Ah , she eez charmante , your aunt , ”
160825	160832	160835	160835	Luna	340	“ Daddy ’s made a tiara , ”
160837	160847	160835	160835	Luna	340	“ Well , more of a crown , really . ”
160874	160911	160848	160848	Ron	227	“ Yes , he ’s trying to re - create the lost diadem of Ravenclaw . He thinks he ’s identified most of the main elements now . Adding the billywig wings really made a difference — ”
160973	160978	160979	160979	Bill	230	“ Who is it ? ”
160982	160991	160945	160945	his	230	“ It is I , Remus John Lupin ! ”
161011	161045	161000	161000	Harry	177	“ I am a werewolf , married to Nymphadora Tonks , and you , the Secret - Keeper of Shell Cottage , told me the address and bade me come in an emergency ! ”
161046	161049	161051	161051	Bill	230	“ Lupin , ”
161107	161124	161087	161087	He	189	“ It ’s a boy ! We ’ve named him Ted , after Dora ’s father ! ”
161128	161140	161125	161125	Hermione	197	“ Wha — ? Tonks — Tonks has had the baby ? ”
161141	161152	161154	161154	Lupin	189	“ Yes , yes , she ’s had the baby ! ”
161175	161178	161169	161169	Hermione	197	“ Congratulations ! ”
161183	161189	161180	161180	Ron	227	“ Blimey , a baby ! ”
161202	161210	161212	161212	Lupin	189	“ Yes — yes — a boy , ”
161245	161251	161252	161252	he	189	“ You ’ll be godfather ? ”
161259	161264	161266	161266	Harry	177	“ M - me ? ”
161268	161284	161255	161255	he	189	“ You , yes , of course — Dora quite agrees , no one better — ”
161285	161292	161255	161255	he	189	“ I — yeah — blimey — ”
161321	161333	161335	161335	Lupin	189	“ I ca n’t stay long , I must get back , ”
161354	161363	161343	161343	He	189	“ Thank you , thank you , Bill — ”
161383	161387	161389	161389	Lupin	189	“ To Tim , ”
161391	161399	161389	161389	Lupin	189	“ a great wizard in the making ! ”
161400	161409	161410	161410	Fleur	232	“ ’ Oo does ’ e look like ? ”
161413	161477	161478	161478	He	230	“ I think he looks like Dora , but she thinks he is like me . Not much hair . It looked black when he was born , but I swear it ’s turned ginger in the hour since . Probably blond by the time I get back . Andromeda says Tonks ’s hair started changing color the day that she was born . ”
161483	161494	161495	161495	he	230	“ Oh , go on then , just one more , ”
161612	161623	161625	161625	Lupin	189	“ No … no … I really must get back , ”
161650	161685	161636	161636	He	189	“ Good - bye , good - bye — I’ll try and bring some pictures in a few day ’s time — they’ll all be so glad to know that I ’ve seen you — ”
161716	161721	161723	161723	Bill	230	“ Godfather , Harry ! ”
161737	161744	161723	161723	Bill	230	“ A real honor ! Congratulations ! ”
161786	161814	161815	161815	Bill	230	“ I wanted a private word , actually , Harry . It has n’t been easy to get an opportunity with the cottage this full of people . ”
161818	161828	161815	161815	Bill	230	“ Harry , you ’re planning something with Griphook . ”
161855	161860	161862	161862	Bill	230	“ I know goblins , ”
161864	161906	161862	161862	Bill	230	“ I ’ve worked for Gringotts ever since I left Hogwarts . As far as there can be friendship between wizards and goblins , I have goblin friends — or , at least , goblins I know well , and like . ”
161912	161931	161909	161909	Bill	230	“ Harry , what do you want from Griphook , and what have you promised him in return ? ”
161932	161940	161942	161942	Harry	177	“ I ca n’t tell you that , ”
161944	161949	161942	161942	Harry	177	“ Sorry , Bill . ”
161967	161970	161971	161971	Bill	230	“ Wait , ”
161975	161980	161971	161971	Bill	230	“ Just a moment . ”
161991	161999	162000	162000	Bill	230	“ Then I have to say this , ”
162004	162048	162000	162000	Bill	230	“ If you have struck any kind of bargain with Griphook , and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure , you must be exceptionally careful . Goblin notions of ownership , payment , and repayment are not the same as human ones . ”
162067	162073	162074	162074	he	230	“ What do you mean ? ”
162077	162088	162090	162090	Bill	230	“ We are talking about a different breed of being , ”
162092	162176	162090	162090	Bill	230	“ Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries — but you ’ll know all that from History of Magic . There has been fault on both sides , I would never claim that wizards have been innocent . However , there is a belief among some goblins , and those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it , that wizards can not be trusted in matters of gold and treasure , that they have no respect for goblin ownership . ”
162177	162181	162182	162182	Harry	177	“ I respect — ”
162191	162242	162186	162186	Bill	230	“ You do n’t understand , Harry , nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins . To a goblin , the rightful and true master of any object is the maker , not the purchaser . All goblin made objects are , in goblin eyes , rightfully theirs . ”
162243	162249	162090	162090	Bill	230	“ But it was bought — ”
162250	162359	162186	162186	Bill	230	“ — then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money . They have , however , great difficulty with the idea of goblin - made objects passing from wizard to wizard . You saw Griphook ’s face when the tiara passed under his eyes . He disapproves . I believe he thinks , as do the fiercest of his kind , that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original purchaser died . They consider our habit of keeping goblin - made objects , passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment , little more than theft . ”
162379	162385	162387	162387	Bill	230	“ All I am saying , ”
162401	162433	162387	162387	Bill	230	“ is to be very careful what you promise goblins , Harry . It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin . ”
162434	162437	162439	162439	Harry	177	“ Right , ”
162446	162458	162441	162441	Bill	230	“ yeah . Thanks . I ’ll bear that in mind . ”
162537	162547	162549	162549	Harry	177	“ And you ’ll be using her actual wand , ”
162557	162567	162549	162549	Harry	177	“ so I reckon you ’ll be pretty convincing . ”
162585	162591	162592	162592	she	197	“ I hate that thing , ”
162599	162626	162592	162592	she	197	“ I really hate it . It feels all wrong , it does n’t work properly for me … It ’s like a bit of her . ”
162698	162710	162712	162712	Ron	227	“ It ’ll probably help you get in character , though , ”
162714	162722	162712	162712	Ron	227	“ think what that wand ’s done ! ”
162723	162730	162732	162732	Hermione	197	“ But that ’s my point ! ”
162734	162763	162732	162732	Hermione	197	“ This is the wand that tortured Neville ’s mum and dad , and who knows how many other people ? This is the wand that killed Sirius ! ”
162807	162813	162814	162814	Hermione	197	“ I miss my wand , ”
162818	162831	162814	162814	Hermione	197	“ I wish Mr. Ollivander could have made me another one too . ”
163010	163049	163007	163007	he	177	“ We ’ve just been checking the last - minute stuff , Griphook . We ’ve told Bill and Fleur we ’re leaving tomorrow , and we ’ve told them not to get up to see us off . ”
163302	163310	163312	163312	Ron	227	“ He could give my mother lessons , ”
163404	163415	163377	163377	Ron	227	“ We ’ll just have to wing it , mate . ”
163899	163920	163886	163886	she	197	“ She tasted disgusting , worse than Gurdyroots ! Okay , Ron , come here so I can do you … ”
163921	163936	163886	163886	she	197	“ Right , but remember , I do n’t like the beard too long — ”
163937	163952	163886	163886	she	197	“ Oh , for heaven ’s sake , this is n’t about looking handsome — ”
163953	163985	163886	163886	she	197	“ It ’s not that , it gets in the way ! But I liked my nose a bit shorter , try and do it the way you did last time . ”
164045	164048	164050	164050	Hermione	197	“ There , ”
164052	164060	164050	164050	Hermione	197	“ how does he look , Harry ? ”
164116	164130	164132	164132	Harry	177	“ Well , he ’s not my type , but he ’ll do , ”
164134	164141	164132	164132	Harry	177	“ Shall we go , then ? ”
164199	164212	164196	164196	Griphook	441	“ I should climb up now , Harry Potter , I think ? ”
164274	164277	164278	164278	she	197	“ Perfect , ”
164289	164301	164278	164278	she	197	“ I ca n’t see a thing . Let ’s go . ”
164433	164437	164439	164439	Tom	443	“ Madam Lestrange , ”
164451	164455	164457	164457	Hermione	197	“ Good morning , ”
164479	164483	164484	164484	Harry	177	“ Too polite , ”
164502	164513	164484	164484	Harry	177	“ You need to treat people like they ’re scum ! ”
164514	164519	164520	164520	Hermione	197	“ Okay , okay ! ”
164768	164772	164773	164773	he	3356	“ My children , ”
164793	164812	164789	164789	he	3356	“ Where are my children ? What has he done with them ? You know , you know ! ”
164813	164819	164821	164821	Hermione	197	“ I — I really — ”
164965	164971	164978	164978	his	441	“ Why , Madam Lestrange ! ”
165008	165013	165015	165016	the goblin	2248	“ It ’s Travers , ”
165053	165060	165037	165037	herself	197	“ And what do you want ? ”
165070	165077	165079	165079	Griphook	441	“ He ’s another Death Eater ! ”
165094	165102	165104	165104	Travers	260	“ I merely sought to greet you , ”
165107	165116	165104	165104	Travers	260	“ but if my presence is not welcome … ”
165139	165150	165152	165152	Hermione	197	“ No , no , not at all , Travers , ”
165162	165167	165152	165152	Hermione	197	“ How are you ? ”
165168	165185	165225	165225	Harry	177	“ Well , I confess I am surprised to see you out and about , Bellatrix . ”
165186	165191	165193	165193	Hermione	197	“ Really ? Why ? ”
165195	165198	165199	165199	Travers	260	“ Well , ”
165202	165224	165199	165199	Travers	260	“ I heard that the Inhabitants of Malfoy Manor were confined to the house , after the … ah … escape . ”
165249	165265	165267	165267	Hermione	197	“ The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past , ”
165279	165295	165267	165267	Hermione	197	“ Perhaps your credit is not as good with him as mine is , Travers . ”
165320	165327	165309	165309	He	240	“ How did it offend you ? ”
165328	165341	165343	165343	Hermione	197	“ It does not matter , it will not do so again , ”
165346	165355	165357	165357	Travers	260	“ Some of these wandless can be troublesome , ”
165359	165408	165409	165409	he	260	“ While they do nothing but beg I have no objection , but one of them actually asked me to plead her case in the Ministry last week . ‘ I ’m a witch , sir , I ’m a witch , let me prove it to you ! ”
165416	165432	165434	165434	Travers	260	“ As if I was going to give her my wand — but whose wand , ”
165437	165454	165434	165434	Travers	260	“ are you using at the moment , Bellatrix ? I heard that your own was — ”
165455	165462	165464	165464	Hermione	197	“ I have my wand here , ”
165473	165494	165464	165464	Hermione	197	“ I do n’t know what rumors you have been listening to , Travers , but you seem sadly misinformed . ”
165511	165523	165505	165505	he	260	“ Who is your friend ? I do not recognize him . ”
165524	165530	165532	165532	Hermione	197	“ This is Dragomir Despard , ”
165550	165581	165546	165546	Ron	227	“ He speaks very little English , but he is in sympathy with the Dark Lord ’s aims . He has traveled here from Transylvania to see our new regime . ”
165582	165592	165607	165607	Travers	260	“ Indeed ? How do you do , Dragomir ? ”
165593	165598	165600	165600	Ron	227	“ ’ Ow you ? ”
165623	165641	165643	165643	Travers	260	“ So what brings you and your — ah — sympathetic friend to Diagon Alley this early ? ”
165645	165652	165654	165654	Hermione	197	“ I need to visit Gringotts , ”
165656	165662	165664	165664	Travers	260	“ Alas , I also , ”
165666	165695	165664	165664	Travers	260	“ Gold , filthy gold ! We can not live without it , yet I confess I deplore the necessity of consorting with our long - fingered friends . ”
165708	165712	165714	165714	Travers	260	“ Shall we ? ”
165865	165871	165873	165873	Travers	260	“ Ah , Probity Probes , ”
165876	165884	165873	165873	Travers	260	“ so crude — but so effective ! ”
165952	165954	165937	165937	Harry	177	“ Confundo ”
166001	166007	166009	166010	the guard	3380	“ One moment , madam , ”
166016	166024	166026	166026	Hermione	197	“ But you ’ve just done that ! ”
166069	166080	166058	166059	his companion	690	“ Yeah , you ’ve just checked them , Marius . ”
166190	166205	166184	166184	Hagrid	199	“ Like I said , yeh’d be mad ter try an ’ rob it . ”
166339	166342	166323	166324	The goblin	2248	“ Leprechaun , ”
166369	166373	166375	166376	the goblin	2248	“ Madam Lestrange ! ”
166381	166394	166375	166376	the goblin	2248	“ Dear me ! How — how may I help you today ? ”
166395	166403	166405	166405	Hermione	197	“ I wish to enter my vault , ”
166444	166450	166452	166453	the goblin	2248	“ You have … identification ? ”
166455	166469	166471	166471	Hermione	197	“ Identification ? I — I have never been asked for identification before ! ”
166473	166477	166479	166479	Griphook	441	“ They know ! ”
166485	166497	166479	166479	Griphook	441	“ They must have been warned there might be an imposter ! ”
166498	166506	166508	166509	the goblin	2248	“ Your wand will do , madam , ”
166543	166550	166552	166552	Griphook	441	“ Act now , act now , ”
166558	166563	166552	166552	Griphook	441	“ the Imperious Curse ! ”
166591	166594	166564	166564	Harry	177	“ Imperio ! ”
166651	166665	166636	166637	The goblin	2248	“ Ah , you have had a new wand made , Madam Lestrange ! ”
166666	166669	166671	166671	Hermione	197	“ What ? ”
166673	166682	166671	166671	Hermione	197	“ No , no , that ’s mine — ”
166683	166688	166690	166690	Travers	260	“ A new wand ? ”
166705	166719	166690	166690	Travers	260	“ But how could you have done , which wandmaker did you use ? ”
166734	166737	166731	166731	he	177	“ Imperio ! ”
166741	166748	166750	166750	Travers	260	“ Oh yes , I see , ”
166759	166785	166750	166750	Travers	260	“ yes , very handsome . And is it working well ? I always think wands require a little breaking in , do n’t you ? ”
166822	166829	166830	166830	he	3405	“ I shall need the Clankers , ”
166863	166879	166881	166883	the old goblin	3396	“ Good , good ! So , if you will follow me , Madam Lestrange , ”
166895	166904	166881	166883	the old goblin	3396	“ I shall take you to your vault . ”
166955	166960	166941	166941	Ron	227	“ Wait — Bogrod ! ”
166969	166974	166975	166975	he	3411	“ We have instructions , ”
166983	167001	166975	166975	he	3411	“ Forgive me , Madam , but there have been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange . ”
167018	167046	167052	167052	he	3411	“ I am aware of the instructions , Madam Lestrange wishes to visit her vault … Very old family … old clients … This way , please … ”
167126	167135	167137	167137	Harry	177	“ We ’re in trouble ; they suspect , ”
167178	167183	167184	167184	he	441	“ They ’re Imperiused , ”
167210	167226	167199	167199	Bogrod	538	“ I do n’t think I did it strongly enough , I do n’t know … ”
167254	167263	167236	167239	the real Bellatrix Lestrange	188	“ You need to mean them , Potter ! ”
167264	167270	167272	167272	Ron	227	“ What do we do ? ”
167274	167285	167272	167272	Ron	227	“ Shall we get out now , while we can ? ”
167286	167291	167293	167293	Hermione	197	“ If we can , ”
167313	167326	167328	167328	Harry	177	“ We ’ve got this far , I say we go on , ”
167330	167333	167335	167335	Griphook	441	“ Good ! ”
167337	167365	167335	167335	Griphook	441	“ So , we need Bogrod to control the cart ; I no long have the authority . But there will not be room for the wizard . ”
167373	167376	167366	167366	Harry	177	“ Imperio ! ”
167392	167400	167377	167378	The wizard	1311	“ What are you making him do ? ”
167401	167404	167408	167408	he	177	“ Hide , ”
167646	167649	167643	167643	Griphook	441	“ No ! ”
167733	167739	167740	167740	Hermione	197	“ C - Cushioning Charm , ”
167804	167810	167812	167812	Griphook	441	“ The Thief ’s Downfall ! ”
167839	167866	167816	167816	his	441	“ It washes away all enchantment , all magical concealment ! They know there are imposers in Gringotts , they have set off defenses against us ! ”
167923	167928	167930	167930	Griphook	441	“ We need him , ”
167932	167951	167930	167930	Griphook	441	“ we can not enter the vault without a Gringott ’s goblin . And we need the clankers ! ”
167952	167955	167956	167956	Harry	177	“ Imperio ! ”
168014	168025	168030	168030	she	197	“ Harry , I think I can hear people coming ! ”
168041	168044	168030	168030	she	197	“ Protego ! ”
168063	168067	168069	168069	Harry	177	“ Good thinking , ”
168071	168078	168069	168069	Harry	177	“ Lead the way , Griphook ! ”
168079	168089	168090	168090	Ron	227	“ How are we going to get out again ? ”
168114	168125	168127	168127	Harry	177	“ Let ’s worry about that when we have to , ”
168147	168154	168135	168135	He	177	“ Griphook , how much farther ? ”
168155	168165	168129	168129	He	177	“ Not far , Harry Potter , not far … ”
168324	168330	168332	168332	Griphook	441	“ It is partially blind , ”
168334	168368	168332	168332	Griphook	441	“ but even more savage for that . However , we have the means to control it . It has learned what to expect when the Clankers come . Give them to me . ”
168411	168418	168419	168419	Griphook	441	“ You know what to do , ”
168428	168456	168419	168419	Griphook	441	“ It will expect pain when it hears the noise . It will retreat , and Bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault . ”
168549	168559	168560	168560	Griphook	441	“ Make him press his hand to the door ! ”
168640	168645	168647	168647	Harry	177	“ Search , fast ! ”
168730	168742	168744	168744	Griphook	441	“ No matter , Bogrod will be able to release us ! ”
168753	168770	168746	168746	Ron	227	“ Light your wands , ca n’t you ? And hurry , we have little time ! ”
168771	168774	168746	168746	Ron	227	“ Lumos ! ”
168829	168839	168809	168809	Ron	227	“ Harry , could this be — ? Aargh ! ”
168909	168914	168916	168916	Hermione	197	“ It burned me ! ”
168923	168932	168934	168934	Griphook	441	“ They have added Germino and Flagrante Curses ! ”
168936	168974	168934	168934	Griphook	441	“ Everything you touch will burn and multiply , but the copies are worthless — and if you continue to handle the treasure , you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold ! ”
168975	168983	168985	168985	Harry	177	“ Okay , do n’t touch anything ! ”
169033	169041	169043	169043	Hermione	197	“ Stand still , do n’t move ! ”
169049	169054	169056	169056	Harry	177	“ Just look around ! ”
169058	169094	169056	169056	Harry	177	“ Remember , the cup ’s small and gold , it ’s got a badger engraved on it , two handles — otherwise see if you can spot Ravenclaw ’s symbol anywhere , the eagle — ”
169209	169219	169220	169220	Ron	227	“ It ’s there , it ’s up there ! ”
169273	169289	169291	169291	Ron	227	“ And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything ? ”
169293	169297	169299	169299	Hermione	197	“ Accio Cup ! ”
169318	169325	169327	169328	the goblin	2248	“ No use , no use ! ”
169330	169337	169339	169339	Harry	177	“ Then what do we do ? ”
169346	169381	169339	169339	Harry	177	“ If you want the sword , Griphook , then you ’ll have to help us more than — wait ! Can I touch stuff with the sword ? Hermione , give it here ! ”
169431	169453	169406	169406	Harry	177	“ If I can just poke the sword through a handle — but how am I going to get up there ? ”
169578	169581	169583	169583	Harry	177	“ Hermione , ”
169591	169609	169583	169583	Harry	177	“ I ’ve got to get up there , we ’ve got to get rid of it — ”
169623	169626	169612	169612	her	197	“ Levicorpus . ”
169719	169722	169730	169730	herself	197	“ Impervius ! ”

169845	169849	169850	169850	Harry	177	“ Get it ! ”
169884	169897	169865	169865	Griphook	441	“ Where ’s the sword ? It had the cup on it ! ”
169916	169919	169920	169920	It	3461	“ There ! ”
170158	170167	170168	170168	He	177	“ Thieves ! Thieves ! Help ! Thieves ! ”

He things the Hogwarts one is safest , because Snape ’s there , because it ’ll be so hard not to be seen getting in . I think he ’ll check that one last , but he could still be there within hours — ”

176903	176906	176896	176896	him	3667	“ Yes , ”
176928	176964	176919	176919	Aberforth	360	“ I knew my brother , Potter . He learned secrecy at our mother ’s knee . Secrets and lies , that ’s how we grew up , and Albus … he was a natural . ”
177010	177014	177016	177016	Hermione	197	“ Mr. Dumbledore , ”
177020	177028	177016	177016	Hermione	197	“ Is that your sister ? Ariana ? ”
177029	177032	177034	177034	Aberforth	360	“ Yes , ”
177037	177048	177034	177034	Aberforth	360	“ Been reading Rita Skeeter , have you , missy ? ”
177066	177074	177076	177076	Harry	177	“ Elphias Doge mentioned her to us , ”
177083	177088	177090	177090	Aberforth	360	“ That old berk , ”
177098	177132	177090	177090	Aberforth	360	“ Thought the sun shone out of my brother ’s every office , he did . Well , so did plenty of people , you three included , by the looks of it . ”
177281	177291	177293	177293	Hermione	197	“ Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry , very much , ”
177299	177304	177306	177306	Aberforth	360	“ Did he now ? ”
177308	177337	177306	177306	Aberforth	360	“ Funny thing how many of the people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if he ’d left ’em well alone . ”
177338	177344	177346	177346	Hermione	197	“ What do you mean ? ”
177349	177354	177356	177356	Aberforth	360	“ Never you mind , ”
177358	177369	177371	177371	Hermione	197	“ But that ’s a really serious thing to say ! ”
177373	177384	177371	177371	Hermione	197	“ Are you — are you talking about your sister ? ”
177411	177506	177406	177406	he	360	“ When my sister was six years old , she was attacked , by three Muggle boys . They ’d seen her doing magic , spying through the back garden hedge : She was a kid , she could n’t control it , no witch or wizard can at that age . What they saw , scared them , I expect . They forced their way through the hedge , and when she could n’t show them the trick , they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it . ”
177542	177611	177613	177613	Aberforth	360	“ It destroyed Ariana , what they did : she was never right again . She would n’t use magic , but she could n’t get rid of it ; it turned inward and drove her mad , it exploded out of her when she could n’t control it , and at times she was strange and dangerous . But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless , ”
177666	177714	177659	177659	he	360	“ So that put paid to Albus ’s trip round the world with little Doge . The pair of ’em came home for my mother ’s funeral and then Doge went off on his own , and Albus settled down as head of the family . Ha ! ”
177721	177813	177715	177715	Aberforth	360	“ I ’d have looked after her , I told him so , I did n’t care about school , I ’d have stayed home and done it . He told me I had to finish my education and he ’d take over from my mother . Bit of a comedown for Mr. Brilliant , there ’s no prizes for looking after your half - mad sister , stopping her blowing up the house every other day . But he did all right for a few weeks … till he came . ”
177843	177888	177889	177889	His	360	“ — and I think she wanted to help , but Ariana did n’t really know what she was doing , and I do n’t know which of us did it , it could have been any of us — and she was dead . ”
177946	177956	177957	177957	Hermione	197	“ I ’m so … I ’m so sorry , ”
177960	177963	177965	177965	Aberforth	360	“ Gone , ”
177967	177971	177965	177965	Aberforth	360	“ Gone forever . ”
177984	178045	177972	177972	He	360	“ ’ Course , Grindelwald scarpered . He had a bit of a track record already , back in his own country , and he did n’t want Ariana set to his account too . And Albus was free , was n’t he ? Free of the burden of his sister , free to become the greatest wizard of the — ”
178046	178052	178054	178054	Harry	177	“ He was never free , ”
178056	178062	178064	178064	Aberforth	360	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
178066	178069	178071	178071	Harry	177	“ Never , ”
178073	178118	178071	178071	Harry	177	“ The night that your brother died , he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind . He started screaming , pleading with someone who was n’t there . ‘ Do n’t hurt them , please … hurt me instead . ’ ”
178164	178181	178183	178183	Harry	177	“ He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald , I know he did , ”
178191	178224	178242	178242	he	360	“ He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana … It was torture to him , if you ’d seen him then , you would n’t say he was free . ”
178245	178285	178242	178242	he	360	“ How can you be sure , Potter , that my brother was n’t more interested in the greater good than in you ? How can you be sure you are n’t dispensable , just like my little sister ? ”
178297	178308	178310	178310	Hermione	197	“ I do n’t believe it . Dumbledore loved Harry , ”
178312	178324	178327	178327	Aberforth	360	“ Why did n’t he tell him to hide , then ? ”
178329	178351	178327	178327	Aberforth	360	“ Why did n’t he say to him , ‘ Take care of yourself , here ’s how to survive ’ ? ”
178352	178355	178357	178357	Harry	177	“ Because , ”
178363	178392	178357	178357	Harry	177	“ sometimes you ’ve got to think about more than your own safety ! Sometimes you ’ve got to think about the greater good ! This is war ! ”
178393	178400	178327	178327	Aberforth	360	“ You ’re seventeen , boy ! ”
178401	178421	178357	178357	Harry	177	“ I ’m of age , and I ’m going to keep fighting even if you ’ve given up ! ”
178422	178430	178327	178327	Aberforth	360	“ Who says I ’ve given up ? ”
178431	178440	178441	178441	Harry	177	“ The Order of the Phoenix is finished , ”
178444	178467	178441	178441	Harry	177	“ You - Know - Who ’s won , it ’s over , and anyone who ’s pretending different ’s kidding themselves . ”
178468	178483	178327	178327	Aberforth	360	“ I do n’t say I like it , but it ’s the truth ! ”
178484	178491	178493	178493	Harry	177	“ No , it is n’t , ”
178495	178549	178493	178493	Harry	177	“ Your brother knew how to finish You - Know - Who and he passed the knowledge on to me . I ’m going to keep going until I succeed — or I die . Do n’t think I do n’t know how this might end . I ’ve known it for years . ”
178569	178577	178579	178579	Harry	177	“ We need to get into Hogwarts , ”
178582	178628	178579	178579	Harry	177	“ If you ca n’t help us , we ’ll wait till daybreak , leave you in peace , and try to find a way in ourselves . If you can help us — well , now would be a great time to mention it . ”
178677	178684	178685	178685	he	360	“ You know what to do , ”
178741	178747	178749	178749	Ron	227	“ Er — what — ? ”
178751	178760	178762	178762	Aberforth	360	“ There ’s only one way in now , ”
178764	178851	178762	178762	Aberforth	360	“ You must know they ’ve got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends , Dementors all around the boundary walls , regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell me . The place has never been so heavily guarded . How you expect to do anything once you get inside it , with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his deputies … well , that ’s your lookout , is n’t it ? You say you ’re prepared to die . ”
178852	178857	178859	178859	Hermione	197	“ But what … ? ”
179015	179028	178997	178998	Neville Longbottom	401	“ I knew you ’d come ! I knew it , Harry ! ”
179029	179038	178997	178998	Neville Longbottom	401	“ Neville — what the — how — ? ”
179119	179136	179110	179110	he	401	“ I knew you ’d come ! Kept telling Seamus it was a matter of time ! ”
179137	179146	179110	179110	he	401	“ Neville , what ’s happened to you ? ”
179147	179152	179153	179153	Neville	401	“ What ? This ? ”
179164	179185	179186	179186	he	401	“ This is nothing , Seamus is worse . You ’ll see . Shall we get going then ? Oh , ”
179191	179205	179186	179186	he	401	“ Ab , there might be a couple more people on the way . ”
179206	179210	179212	179212	Aberforth	360	“ Couple more ? ”
179215	179239	179212	179212	Aberforth	360	“ What d’you mean , a couple more , Longbottom ? There ’s a curfew and a Camwaulding Charm on the whole village ! ”
179240	179256	179258	179258	Neville	401	“ I know , that ’s why they ’ll be Apparating directly into the bar , ”
179260	179279	179258	179258	Neville	401	“ Just send them down the passage when they get here , will you ? Thanks a lot . ”
179311	179328	179307	179307	Harry	177	“ I do n’t know how to thank you . You ’ve saved our lives twice . ”
179329	179336	179338	179338	Aberforth	360	“ Look after ’em , then , ”
179341	179354	179338	179338	Aberforth	360	“ I might not be able to save ’em a third time . ”
179421	179429	179430	179430	Ron	227	“ How long ’s this been here ? ”
179437	179465	179430	179430	Ron	227	“ It is n’t on the Marauder ’s Map , is it , Harry ? I thought there were only seven passages in and out of school ? ”
179466	179480	179482	179482	Neville	401	“ They sealed off all of those before the start of the year , ”
179484	179514	179515	179515	He	401	“ There ’s no chance of getting through any of them now , not with the curses over the entrances and Death Eaters and Dementors waiting at the exits . ”
179526	179577	179515	179515	He	401	“ Never mind that stuff … Is it true ? Did you break into Gringotts ? Did you escape on a dragon ? It ’s everywhere , everyone ’s talking about it , Terry Boot got beaten up by Carrow for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner ! ”
179578	179585	179587	179587	Harry	177	“ Yeah , it ’s true , ”
179593	179602	179515	179515	He	401	“ What did you do with the dragon ? ”
179603	179610	179612	179612	Ron	227	“ Released it into the wild , ”
179614	179625	179612	179612	Ron	227	“ Hermione was all for keeping it as a pet — ”
179626	179633	179515	179515	He	401	“ Do n’t exaggerate , Ron — ”
179634	179672	179612	179612	Ron	227	“ But what have you been doing ? People have been saying you ’ve just been on the run , Harry , but I do n’t think so . I think you ’ve been up to something . ”
179673	179678	179680	179680	Harry	177	“ You ’re right , ”
179682	179697	179680	179680	Harry	177	“ but tell us about Hogwarts , Neville , we have n’t heard anything . ”
179698	179713	179715	179715	Neville	401	“ It ’s been … Well , it ’s not really like Hogwarts anymore , ”
179727	179735	179715	179715	Neville	401	“ Do you know about the Carrows ? ”
179736	179745	179612	179612	Ron	227	“ Those two Death Eaters who teach here ? ”
179746	179753	179755	179755	Neville	401	“ They do more than teach , ”
179757	179773	179755	179755	Neville	401	“ They ’re in charge of all discipline . They like punishment , the Carrows . ”
179774	179778	179612	179612	Ron	227	“ Like Umbridge ? ”
179779	179831	179755	179755	Neville	401	“ Nah , they make her look tame . The other teachers are all supposed to refer us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong . They do n’t , though , if they can avoid it . You can tell they all hate them as much as we do . ”
179832	179874	179612	179612	Ron	227	“ Amycus , the bloke , he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark Arts , except now it ’s just the Dark Arts . We ’re supposed to practice the Cruciatus Curse on people who ’ve earned detentions — ”
179875	179878	179755	179755	Neville	401	“ What ? ”
179895	179898	179900	179900	Neville	401	“ Yeah , ”
179902	179911	179912	179912	he	401	“ That ’s how I got this one , ”
179923	179957	179912	179912	he	401	“ I refused to do it . Some people are into it , though ; Crabbe and Goyle love it . First time they ’ve ever been top in anything , I expect . ”
179958	180021	180022	180022	he	401	“ Alecto , Amycus ’s sister , teaches Muggle Studies , which is compulsory for everyone . We ’ve all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals , stupid and dirty , and how they drive wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them , and how the natural order is being reestablished . I got this one , ”
180030	180045	180022	180022	he	401	“ for asking her how much Muggle blood she and her brother have got . ”
180046	180051	180053	180053	Ron	227	“ Blimey , Neville , ”
180055	180069	180053	180053	Ron	227	“ there ’s a time and a place for getting a smart mouth . ”
180070	180077	180079	180079	Neville	401	“ You did n’t see her , ”
180081	180120	180079	180079	Neville	401	“ You would n’t have stood it either . The thing is , it helps when people stand up to them , it gives everyone hope . I used to notice that when you did it , Harry . ”
180121	180132	180134	180134	Ron	227	“ But they ’ve used you as a knife sharpener , ”
180157	180192	180154	180154	Neville	401	“ Does n’t matter . They do n’t want to spill too much pure blood , so they ’ll torture us a bit if we ’re mouthy but they wo n’t actually kill us . ”
180221	180274	180306	180306	his	401	“ The only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the outside are giving trouble . They get taken hostage . Old Xeno Lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in The Quibbler , so they dragged Luna off the train on the way back for Christmas . ”
180275	180288	180306	180306	his	401	“ Neville , she ’s all right , we ’ve seen her — ”
180289	180304	180306	180306	his	401	“ Yeah , I know , she managed to get a message to me . ”
180336	180342	180344	180344	Neville	401	“ These have been great , ”
180350	180394	180344	180344	Neville	401	“ The Carrows never rumbled how we were communicating , it drove them mad . We used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls : Dumbledore ’s Army , Still Recruiting , stuff like that . Snape hated it . ”
180395	180400	180402	180402	Harry	177	“ You used to ? ”
180411	180423	180425	180425	Neville	401	“ Well , it got more difficult as time went one , ”
180427	180505	180425	180425	Neville	401	“ We lost Luna at Christmas , and Ginny never came back after Easter , and the three of us were sort of the leaders . The Carrows seemed to know I was behind a lot of it , so they started coming down on me hard , and then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first - year they ’d chained up , and they tortured him pretty badly . That scared people off . ”
180506	180510	180512	180512	Ron	227	“ No kidding , ”
180522	180589	180425	180425	Neville	401	“ Yeah , well , I could n’t ask people to go through what Michael did , so we dropped those kinds of stunts . But we were still fighting , doing underground stuff , right up until a couple of weeks ago . That ’s when they decided there was only one way to stop me , I suppose , and they went for Gran . ”
180590	180594	180596	180596	Harry	177	“ They what ? ”
180604	180607	180609	180609	Neville	401	“ Yeah , ”
180624	180627	180629	180629	Ron	227	“ Cool , ”
180631	180634	180636	180636	Neville	401	“ Yeah , ”
180639	180692	180636	180636	Neville	401	“ Only thing was , once they realized they had no hold over me , they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all . I do n’t know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban , either way , I knew it was time to disappear . ”
180693	180696	180698	180698	Ron	227	“ But , ”
180704	180715	180698	180698	Ron	227	“ aren’t — aren’t we heading straight back for Hogwarts ? ”
180716	180720	180722	180722	Neville	401	“ ’ Course , ”
180724	180733	180722	180722	Neville	401	“ You ’ll see . We ’re here . ”
180790	180802	180783	180783	Neville	401	“ Look who it is ! Did n’t I tell you ? ”
180882	180890	180891	180891	Neville	401	“ Okay , okay , calm down ! ”
181041	181046	181175	181175	he	177	“ Where are we ? ”
181047	181055	181057	181057	Neville	401	“ Room of Requirement , of course ! ”
181059	181141	181057	181057	Neville	401	“ Surpassed itself , has n’t it ? The Carrows were chasing me , and I knew I had just one chance for a hideout : I managed to get through the door and this is what I found ! Well , it was n’t exactly like this when I arrived , it was a load smaller , there was only one hammock and just Gryffindor hangings . But it ’s expanded as more and more of the D.A. have arrived . ”
181142	181151	181153	181153	Harry	177	“ And the Carrows ca n’t get in ? ”
181161	181164	181166	181167	Seamus Finnigan	554	“ No , ”
181186	181279	181178	181178	Seamus	554	“ It ’s a proper hideout , as long as one of us stays in here , they ca n’t get at us , the door wo n’t open . It ’s all down to Neville . He really gets this room . You ’ve got to ask for exactly what you need — like , I do n’t want any Carrow supporters to be able to get in’—and it ’ll do it for you ! You ’ve just got to make sure you close the loopholes . Neville ’s the man ! ”
181280	181288	181290	181290	Neville	401	“ It ’s quite straightforward , really , ”
181293	181385	181387	181387	Ron	227	“ I ’d been in here about a day and a half , and getting really hungry , and wishing I could get something to eat , and that ’s when the passage to Hog ’s Head opened up . I went through it and met Aberforth . He ’s been providing us with food , because for some reason , that ’s the one thing the room does n’t really do . Yeah , well , food ’s one of the five exceptions to Gamp ’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration , ”
181392	181405	181407	181407	Seamus	554	“ So we ’ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks , ”
181409	181436	181407	181407	Seamus	554	“ and it just makes more hammocks every time we need room , and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up — ”
181437	181450	181452	181453	Lavender Brown	310	“ — and thought they ’d quite like to wash , yes , ”
181498	181510	181512	181512	Ernie	562	“ Tell us what you ’ve been up to , though , ”
181514	181534	181535	181535	He	562	“ There ’ve been so many rumors , we ’ve been trying to keep up with you on Potterwatch . ”
181541	181549	181535	181535	He	562	“ You did n’t break into Gringotts ? ”
181550	181554	181556	181556	Neville	401	“ They did ! ”
181558	181566	181556	181556	Neville	401	“ And the dragon ’s true too ! ”
181583	181589	181591	181591	Seamus	554	“ What were you after ? ”
181721	181729	181730	181730	Neville	401	“ Are you all right , Harry ? ”
181734	181750	181730	181730	Neville	401	“ What to sit down ? I expect you ’re tired , are n’t — ? ”
181751	181754	181756	181756	Harry	177	“ No , ”
181805	181812	181813	181813	he	175	“ We need to get going , ”
181825	181837	181839	181839	Seamus	554	“ What are we going to do , then , Harry ? ”
181841	181847	181839	181839	Seamus	554	“ What ’s the plan ? ”
181848	181851	181853	181853	Harry	177	“ Plan ? ”
181877	181905	181871	181871	His	177	“ Well , there ’s something we — Ron , Hermione , and I — need to do , and then we ’ll get out of here . ”
181917	181929	181913	181913	Neville	401	“ What d’you mean , ‘ get out of here ’ ? ”
181930	181939	181941	181941	Harry	177	“ We have n’t come back to stay , ”
181953	181963	181941	181941	Harry	177	“ There ’s something important we need to do — ”
181964	181969	181913	181913	Neville	401	“ What is it ? ”
181970	181979	181941	181941	Harry	177	“ I — I ca n’t tell you . ”
181994	182017	181913	181913	Neville	401	“ Why ca n’t you tell us ? It ’s something to do with fighting You - Know - Who , right ? ”
182018	182023	181941	181941	Harry	177	“ Well , yeah — ”
182024	182031	181913	181913	Neville	401	“ Then we ’ll help you . ”
182064	182070	182071	182071	Harry	177	“ You do n’t understand , ”
182085	182103	182071	182071	Harry	177	“ We — we ca n’t tell you . We ’ve got to do it — alone . ”
182104	182107	182109	182109	Neville	401	“ Why ? ”
182111	182114	182116	182116	his	177	“ Because … ”
182160	182170	182171	182171	he	401	“ Dumbledore left the three of us a job , ”
182175	182200	182171	182171	he	401	“ and we were n’t supposed to tell — I mean , he wanted us to do it , just the three of us . ”
182201	182207	182209	182209	Neville	401	“ We ’re his army , ”
182211	182239	182209	182209	Neville	401	“ Dumbledore ’s Army . We were all in it together , we ’ve been keeping it going while you three have been off on your own — ”
182240	182251	182253	182253	Ron	227	“ It has n’t exactly been a picnic , mate , ”
182255	182311	182171	182171	he	401	“ I never said it had , but I do n’t see why you ca n’t trust us . Everyone in this room ’s been fighting and they ’ve been driven in here because the Carrows were hunting them down . Everyone in here ’s proven they ’re loyal to Dumbledore — loyal to you . ”
182312	182315	182316	182316	Harry	177	“ Look , ”
182343	182362	182316	182316	Harry	177	“ We got your message , Neville ! Hello you three , I thought you must be here ! ”
182384	182389	182391	182391	Luna	340	“ Hi , everyone ! ”
182394	182404	182391	182391	Luna	340	“ Oh , it ’s great to be back ! ”
182405	182408	182410	182410	Harry	177	“ Luna , ”
182413	182425	182410	182410	Harry	177	“ what are you doing here ? How did you — ? ”
182426	182432	182434	182434	Neville	401	“ I sent for her , ”
182442	182484	182434	182434	Neville	401	“ I promised her and Ginny that if you turned up I ’d let them know . We all thought that if you came back , it would mean revolution . That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows . ”
182485	182494	182496	182496	Luna	340	“ Of course that ’s what it means , ”
182499	182516	182496	182496	Luna	340	“ Is n’t it , Harry ? We ’re going to fight them out of Hogwarts ? ”
182517	182520	182522	182522	Harry	177	“ Listen , ”
182530	182557	182522	182522	Harry	177	“ I ’m sorry , but that ’s not what we came back for . There ’s something we ’ve got to do , and then — ”
182558	182569	182571	182572	Michael Corner	559	“ You ’re going to leave us in this mess ? ”
182574	182577	182579	182579	Ron	227	“ No ! ”
182581	182608	182579	182579	Ron	227	“ What we ’re doing will benefit everyone in the end , it ’s all about trying to get rid of You - Know - Who — ”
182609	182615	182617	182617	Neville	401	“ Then let us help ! ”
182620	182630	182617	182617	Neville	401	“ We want to be a part of it ! ”
182703	182711	182713	182713	Fred	228	“ Aberforth ’s getting a bit annoyed , ”
182726	182742	182713	182713	Fred	228	“ He wants a kip , and his bar ’s turned into a railway station . ”
182767	182773	182774	182774	she	564	“ I got the message , ”
182793	182802	182804	182804	George	229	“ So what ’s the plan , Harry ? ”
182806	182812	182814	182814	Harry	177	“ There is n’t one , ”
182841	182860	182862	182862	Fred	228	“ Just going to make it up as we go along , are we ? My favorite kind , ”
182864	182872	182873	182873	Harry	177	“ You ’ve got to stop this ! ”
182877	182891	182873	182873	Harry	177	“ What did you call them all back for ? This is insane — ”
182892	182901	182903	182903	Dean	443	“ We ’re fighting , are n’t we ? ”
182911	182936	182903	182903	Dean	443	“ The message said Harry was back , and we were going to fight ! I ’ll have to get a wand , though — ”
182937	182946	182948	182948	Seamus	554	“ You have n’t got a wand — ? ”
182956	182963	182950	182950	Ron	227	“ Why ca n’t they help ? ”
182964	182967	182976	182976	his	177	“ What ? ”
182968	182973	182974	182974	He	177	“ They can help , ”
182996	183025	182989	182989	Hermione	197	“ We do n’t know where it is . We ’ve got to find it fast . We do n’t have to tell them it ’s a Horcrux . ”
183036	183058	183031	183031	Hermione	197	“ I think Ron ’s right . We do n’t even know what we ’re looking for , we need them . ”
183065	183077	183061	183061	Harry	177	“ You do n’t have to do everything alone , Harry . ”
183168	183172	183173	183173	he	177	“ All right , ”
183181	183184	183185	183185	he	177	“ Okay , ”
183226	183235	183236	183236	Harry	177	“ There ’s something we need to find , ”
183239	183297	183236	183236	Harry	177	“ Something — something that ’ll help us overthrow You - Know - Who . It ’s here at Hogwarts , but we do n’t know where . It might have belonged to Ravenclaw . Has anyone heard of an object like that ? Has anyone come across something with her eagle on it , for instance ? ”
183334	183366	183321	183321	Luna	340	“ Well , there ’s her lost diadem . I told you about it , remember , Harry ? The lost diadem of Ravenclaw ? Daddy ’s trying to duplicate it . ”
183367	183375	183377	183378	Michael Corner	559	“ Yeah , but the lost diadem , ”
183384	183397	183377	183378	Michael Corner	559	“ is lost , Luna . That ’s sort of the point . ”
183398	183404	183406	183406	Harry	177	“ When was it lost ? ”
183408	183415	183417	183417	Cho	564	“ Centuries ago , they say , ”
183425	183442	183443	183443	she	564	“ Professor Flitwick says the diadem vanished with Ravenclaw herself . People have looked , but , ”
183450	183463	183443	183443	she	564	“ Nobody ’s ever found a trace of it , have them ? ”
183470	183479	183481	183481	Ron	227	“ Sorry , but what is a diadem ? ”
183483	183491	183493	183494	Terry Boot	245	“ It ’s a kind of crown , ”
183496	183513	183493	183494	Terry Boot	245	“ Ravenclaw ’s was supposed to have magical properties , enhance the wisdom of the wearer . ”
183514	183522	183524	183524	Harry	177	“ Yes , Daddy ’s Wrackspurt siphons — ”
183529	183595	183524	183524	Harry	177	“ And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it ? They all shook their heads again . Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him . An object that had been lost this long , and apparently without trace , did not seem like a good candidate for the Horcrux hidden in the castle … ”
183610	183649	183606	183606	Cho	564	“ If you ’d like to see what the diadem ’s supposed to look like , I could take you up to our common room and show you , Harry . Ravenclaw ’s wearing it in her statue . ”
183719	183726	183727	183727	he	177	“ He ’s on the move , ”
183745	183795	183735	183735	He	177	“ Listen , I know it ’s not much of a lead , but I ’m going to go look at this statue , at least find out what the diadem looks like . Wait for me here and keep , you know — the other one — safe . ”
183809	183823	183804	183804	Ginny	238	“ No , Luna will take Harry , wo n’t you , Luna ? ”
183824	183834	183836	183836	Luna	340	“ Oooh , yes , I ’d like to , ”
183848	183855	183856	183856	Harry	177	“ How do we get out ? ”
183860	183864	183865	183865	He	177	“ Over here . ”
183884	183903	183904	183904	he	177	“ It comes out somewhere different every day , so they ’ve never been able to find it , ”
183907	183942	183904	183904	he	177	“ Only trouble is , we never know exactly where we ’re going to end up when we go out . Be careful , Harry , they ’re always patrolling the corridors at night . ”
183943	183947	183949	183949	Harry	177	“ No problem , ”
183951	183958	183949	183949	Harry	177	“ See you in a bit . ”
183993	183998	183999	183999	Harry	177	“ Get under here , ”
184099	184108	184109	184109	he	177	“ We ’re up on the fifth floor , ”
184123	184130	184113	184113	filch	567	“ Come on , this way . ”
184265	184271	184273	184273	Luna	340	“ The way , Harry , ”
184397	184408	184356	184356	She	340	“ Which came first , the phoenix or the flame ? ”
184409	184419	184421	184421	Luna	340	“ Hmm … What do you think , Harry ? ”
184426	184435	184356	184356	She	340	“ What ? Is n’t there a password ? ”
184436	184448	184450	184450	Luna	340	“ Oh no , you ’ve got to answer a question , ”
184452	184460	184356	184356	She	340	“ What if you get it wrong ? ”
184461	184475	184477	184477	Luna	340	“ Well , you have to wait for somebody who gets it right , ”
184479	184488	184477	184477	Luna	340	“ That way you learn , you see ? ”
184489	184508	184356	184356	She	340	“ Yeah … Trouble is , we ca n’t really afford to wait for anyone else , Luna . ”
184509	184518	184520	184520	Luna	340	“ No , I see what you mean , ”
184523	184539	184520	184520	Luna	340	“ Well then , I think the answer is that a circle has no beginning . ”
184540	184544	184356	184356	She	340	“ Well reasoned , ”
184770	184782	184752	184752	Harry	177	“ ‘ Wit beyond measure is man ’s greatest treasure . ’ ”
184783	184792	184763	184763	Ravenclaw	470	“ Which makes you pretty skint , witless , ”
184946	184958	184960	184960	Luna	340	“ I ’ve never Stunned anyone except in our D.A. lessons , ”
184966	184977	184960	184960	Luna	340	“ That was noisier than I though it would be . ”
185014	185029	185030	185030	Luna	340	“ Luna , where are you ? I need to get under the Cloak ! ”
185128	185136	185137	185137	he	177	“ I think she might be dead ! ”
185142	185146	185148	185148	Luna	340	“ Oh look , ”
185159	185164	185152	185153	the Ravenclaws	3772	“ They ’re pleased ! ”
185165	185170	185152	185153	the Ravenclaws	3772	“ Yeah … great … ”
185256	185263	185310	185311	The Ravenclaws	565	“ Where do Vanished objects go ? ”
185264	185274	185289	185289	Amycus	557	“ I dunno , do I ? Shut it ! ”
185291	185309	185289	185289	Amycus	557	“ Alecto ? Alecto ? Are you there ? Have you got him ? Open the door ! ”
185342	185370	185371	185371	Amycus	557	“ Alecto ! If he comes , and we have n’t got Potter — d’you want to go the same way as the Malfoys ? ANSWER ME ! ”
185454	185466	185635	185638	the eagle door knocker	3779	“ May I ask what you are doing , Professor Carrow ? ”
185467	185479	185481	185481	Amycus	557	“ Trying — to get — through this damned — door ! ”
185483	185497	185481	185481	Amycus	557	“ Go and get Flitwick ! Get him to open it , now ! ”
185498	185507	185509	185510	Professor McGonagall	396	“ But is n’t your sister in there ? ”
185512	185548	185509	185510	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Did n’t Professor Flitwick let her in earlier this evening , at your urgent request ? Perhaps she could open the door for you ? Then you need n’t wake up half the castle . ”
185549	185570	185635	185638	the eagle door knocker	3779	“ She ai n’t answering , you old besom ! You open it ! Garn ! Do it , now ! ”
185571	185579	185581	185582	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Certainly , if you wish it , ”
185603	185610	185635	185638	the eagle door knocker	3779	“ Where do Vanished objects go ? ”
185611	185624	185626	185627	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Into non - being , which is to say , everything , ”
185629	185633	185635	185638	the eagle door knocker	3779	“ Nicely phrased , ”
185707	185717	185718	185718	he	557	“ What ’ve they done , the little whelps ? ”
185721	185747	185748	185748	he	557	“ I ’ll Cruciate the lot of ’em till they tell me who did it — and what ’s the Dark Lord going to say ? ”
185765	185780	185748	185748	he	557	“ We have n’t got him , and they ’ve gone and killed her ! ”
185781	185787	185789	185790	Professor McGonagall	396	“ She ’s only Stunned , ”
185801	185809	185789	185790	Professor McGonagall	396	“ She ’ll be perfectly all right . ”
185810	185818	185820	185820	Amycus	557	“ No she bludgering well wo n’t ! ”
185822	185855	185820	185820	Amycus	557	“ Not after the Dark Lord gets hold of her ! She ’s gone and sent for him , I felt me Mark burn , and he thinks we ’ve got Potter ! ”
185856	185862	185864	185865	Professor McGonagall	396	“ ‘ Got Potter ’ ? ”
185868	185879	185864	185865	Professor McGonagall	396	“ What do you mean , ‘ got Potter ’ ? ”
185880	185903	185820	185820	Amycus	557	“ He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower , and to send for him if we caught him ! ”
185904	185922	185864	185865	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower ! Potter belongs in my House ! ”
185949	185959	185961	185961	Carrow	556	“ He was told he might come in here ! ”
185963	185971	185961	185961	Carrow	556	“ I dunno why , do I ? ”
185997	186007	186009	186009	Amycus	557	“ We can push it off on the kids , ”
186018	186041	186011	186011	his	557	“ Yeah , that ’s what we ’ll do . We ’ll say Alecto was ambushed by the kids , them kids up there”—he
186050	186089	185977	185977	her	3783	dormitories—“and we ’ll say they forced her to press her Mark , and that ’s why he got a false alarm … He can punish them . Couple of kids more or less , what ’s the difference ? ”
186090	186103	186105	186106	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Only the difference between truth and lie , courage and cowardice , ”
186113	186161	186105	186106	Professor McGonagall	396	“ a difference , in short , which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate . But let me make one thing very clear . You are not going to pass off your many ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts . I shall not permit it . ”
186162	186166	186167	186167	Amycus	557	“ Excuse me ? ”
186212	186255	186257	186257	he	557	“ It ’s not a case of what you ’ll permit , Minerva McGonagall . Your time ’s over . It ’s us what ’s in charge here now , and you ’ll back me up or you ’ll pay the price . ”
186277	186285	186271	186271	his	177	“ You should n’t have done that . ”
186294	186297	186291	186291	Harry	177	“ Crucio ! ”
186352	186359	186361	186361	Harry	177	“ I see what Bellatrix meant , ”
186370	186378	186361	186361	Harry	177	“ you need to really mean it . ”
186379	186382	186384	186385	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Potter ! ”
186391	186403	186384	186385	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Potter — you’re here ! What — ? How — ? ”
186411	186418	186404	186404	She	3787	“ Potter , that was foolish ! ”
186419	186425	186427	186427	Harry	177	“ He spat at you , ”
186429	186450	186404	186404	She	3787	“ Potter , I — that was very — very gallant of you — but do n’t you realize — ? ”
186451	186457	186458	186458	Harry	177	“ Yeah , I do , ”
186468	186478	186463	186463	her	3787	“ Professor McGonagall , Voldemort ’s on the way . ”
186479	186491	186493	186493	Luna	340	“ Oh , are we allowed to say the name now ? ”
186539	186553	186554	186554	Harry	177	“ I do n’t think it makes any difference what we call him , ”
186558	186566	186554	186554	Harry	177	“ He already knows where I am . ”
186614	186619	186621	186622	Professor McGonagall	396	“ You must flee , ”
186624	186635	186621	186622	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Now , Potter , as quickly as you can ! ”
186636	186641	186643	186643	Harry	177	“ I ca n’t , ”
186645	186666	186643	186643	Harry	177	“ There ’s something I need to do . Professor , do you know where the diadem of Ravenclaw is ? ”
186667	186686	186687	186687	She	396	“ The d - diadem of Ravenclaw ? Of course not — hasn’t it been lost for centuries ? ”
186694	186711	186687	186687	She	396	“ Potter , it was madness , utter madness , for you to enter this castle — ”
186712	186717	186719	186719	Harry	177	“ I had to , ”
186721	186752	186719	186719	Harry	177	“ Professor , there ’s something hidden here that I ’m supposed to find , and it could be the diadem — if I could just speak to Professor Flitwick — ”
186795	186798	186784	186784	her	396	“ Imperio . ”
186869	186872	186874	186875	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Potter , ”
186891	186912	186874	186875	Professor McGonagall	396	“ if He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named does indeed know that you are here — ”
186963	186971	186977	186977	Harry	177	“ Potter , are you all right ? ”
186991	187060	186981	186981	He	177	“ Time ’s running out , Voldemort ’s getting nearer . Professor , I ’m acting on Dumbledore ’s orders , I must find what he wanted me to find ! But we ’ve got to get the students out while I ’m searching the castle — It ’s me Voldemort wants , but he wo n’t care about killing a few more or less , not now — ”
187078	187087	187088	187088	she	3795	“ You ’re acting on Dumbledore ’s orders ? ”
187107	187134	187098	187098	she	3795	“ We shall secure the school against He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named while you search for this — this object . ”
187135	187140	187098	187098	she	3795	“ Is that possible ? ”
187141	187146	187148	187149	Professor McGonagall	396	“ I think so , ”
187152	187201	187148	187149	Professor McGonagall	396	“ we teachers are rather good at magic , you know . I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it . Of course , something will have to be done about Professor Snape — ”
187202	187206	187098	187098	she	3795	“ Let me — ”
187207	187261	187148	187149	Professor McGonagall	396	“ — and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege , with the Dark Lord at the gates , it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible . With the Floo Network under observation , and Apparition impossible within the grounds — ”
187262	187268	187270	187270	Harry	177	“ There ’s a way , ”
187286	187297	187148	187149	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Potter , we ’re talking about hundreds of students — ”
187298	187333	187148	187149	Professor McGonagall	396	“ I know , Professor , but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concentrating on the school boundaries they wo n’t be interested in anyone who ’s Disapparating out of Hog ’s Head . ”
187334	187341	187342	187342	she	3798	“ There ’s something in that , ”
187394	187415	187416	187416	She	3798	“ Come . We must alert the other Heads of House . You ’d better put that Cloak back on . ”
187580	187585	187567	187567	She	3798	“ Who ’s there ? ”
187586	187591	187571	187571	her	3798	“ It is I , ”
187686	187692	187693	187693	he	172	“ Where are the Carrows ? ”
187697	187710	187712	187713	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Wherever you told them to be , I expect , Severus , ”
187752	187759	187761	187761	Snape	172	“ I was under the impression , ”
187763	187771	187761	187761	Snape	172	“ that Alecto had apprehended an intruder . ”
187772	187775	187777	187778	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Really ? ”
187780	187788	187777	187778	Professor McGonagall	396	“ And what gave you that impression ? ”
187810	187816	187818	187819	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Oh , but naturally , ”
187821	187836	187818	187819	Professor McGonagall	396	“ You Death Eaters have your own private means of communication , I forgot . ”
187874	187891	187857	187857	he	172	“ I did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors , Minerva . ”
187892	187898	187857	187857	he	172	“ You have some objection ? ”
187899	187916	187857	187857	he	172	“ I wonder what could have brought you out of our bed at this late hour ? ”
187917	187925	187927	187928	Professor McGonagall	396	“ I thought I heard a disturbance , ”
187930	187938	187857	187857	he	172	“ Really ? But all seems calm . ”
187945	187963	187939	187939	Snape	172	“ Have you seen Harry Potter , Minerva ? Because if you have , I must insist — ”
188132	188135	188144	188144	him	177	“ Minerva ! ”
188180	188183	188185	188185	Flitwick	572	“ No ! ”
188191	188201	188185	188185	Flitwick	572	“ You ’ll do no more murder at Hogwarts ! ”
188299	188304	188296	188296	McGonagall	396	“ Coward ! COWARD ! ”
188305	188314	188316	188316	Luna	340	“ What ’s happened , what ’s happened ? ”
188357	188361	188363	188364	Professor McGonagall	396	“ He jumped , ”
188374	188381	188382	188382	Harry	177	“ You mean he ’s dead ? ”
188402	188410	188412	188412	McGonagall	396	“ No , he ’s not dead , ”
188415	188439	188412	188412	McGonagall	396	“ Unlike Dumbledore , he was still carrying a wand … and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master . ”
188487	188490	188491	188491	he	292	“ Harry ! ”
188506	188526	188491	188491	he	292	“ My dear boy … what a surprise … Minerva , do please explain … Severus … what … ? ”
188527	188536	188538	188539	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Our headmaster is taking a short break , ”
188552	188555	188556	188556	Harry	177	“ Professor ! ”
188601	188617	188598	188598	his	177	“ Professor , we ’ve got to barricade the school , he ’s coming now ! ”
188618	188636	188637	188637	she	3817	“ Very well . He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named is coming , ”
188655	188691	188648	188648	Slughorn	292	“ Potter has work to do in the castle on Dumbledore ’s orders . We need to put in place every protection of which we are capable while Potter does what he needs to do . ”
188692	188716	188718	188718	Flitwick	572	“ You realize , of course , that nothing we do will be able to keep out You - Know - Who indefinitely ? ”
188720	188728	188730	188731	Professor Sprout	398	“ But we can hold him up , ”
188733	188739	188741	188742	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Thank you , Pomona , ”
188757	188809	188718	188718	Flitwick	572	“ I suggest we establish basic protection around the place , then gather our students and meet in the Great Hall . Most must be evacuated , though if any of those who are over age wish to stay and fight , I think they ought to be given the chance . ”
188810	188813	188815	188816	Professor Sprout	398	“ Agreed , ”
188824	188840	188815	188816	Professor Sprout	398	“ I shall meet you in the Great Hall in twenty minutes with my House . ”
188855	188879	188852	188852	her	3820	“ Tentacula , Devil ’s Snare . And Snargaluff pods … yes , I ’d like to see the Death Eaters fighting those . ”
188880	188887	188889	188889	Flitwick	572	“ I can act from here , ”
188938	188941	188942	188942	Harry	177	“ Professor , ”
188951	188977	188942	188942	Harry	177	“ Professor , I ’m sorry to interrupt , but this is important . Have you got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is ? ”
188978	188988	188990	188990	Flitwick	572	“ — Protego Horribillis — the diadem of Ravenclaw ? ”
188992	189016	188990	188990	Flitwick	572	“ A little extra wisdom never goes amiss , Potter , but I hardly think it would be much use in this situation ! ”
189017	189035	188942	188942	Harry	177	“ I only meant — do you know where it is ? Have you ever seen it ? ”
189036	189055	188990	188990	Flitwick	572	“ Seen it ? Nobody has seen it in living memory ! Long since lost , my boy ! ”
189074	189089	189091	189092	Professor McGonagall	396	“ We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall , Filius ! ”
189115	189119	189120	189120	he	292	“ My word , ”
189132	189180	189120	189120	he	292	“ What a to - do ! I ’m not at all sure whether this is wise , Minerva . He is bound to find a way in , you know , and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in the most grievous peril — ”
189181	189198	189200	189201	Professor McGonagall	396	“ I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes also , ”
189203	189248	189200	189201	Professor McGonagall	396	“ If you wish to leave with your students , we shall not stop you . But if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this castle , then , Horace , we duel to kill . ”
189249	189252	189253	189253	he	3825	“ Minerva ! ”
189258	189272	189274	189275	Professor McGonagall	396	“ The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties , ”
189277	189286	189274	189275	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Go and wake your students , Horace . ”
189321	189336	189318	189318	her	396	“ Piertotum — oh , for heaven ’s sake , Filch , not now — ”
189348	189359	189337	189339	The aged caretaker	3827	“ Students out of bed ! Students in the corridors ! ”
189360	189372	189374	189374	McGonagall	396	“ They ’re supposed to be here , you blithering idiot ! ”
189376	189387	189374	189374	McGonagall	396	“ Now go and do something constructive ! Find Peeves ! ”
189388	189394	189396	189396	Filch	567	“ ‘ P - Peeves ? ”
189407	189439	189374	189374	McGonagall	396	“ Yes , Peeves , you fool , Peeves ! Have n’t you been complaining about him for a quarter of a century ? Go and fetch him , at once ! ”
189465	189472	189474	189475	Professor McGonagall	396	“ And now — Piertotum Locomotor ! ”
189519	189524	189526	189527	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Hogwarts is threatened ! ”
189529	189544	189526	189527	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Man the boundaries , protect us , do your duty to our school ! ”
189587	189592	189594	189595	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Now , Potter , ”
189597	189623	189594	189595	Professor McGonagall	396	“ you and Miss Lovegood had better return to your friends and bring them to the Great Hall — I shall rouse the other Gryffindors . ”
189679	189684	189636	189636	Luna	340	“ That was Potter ! ”
189685	189689	189705	189705	Harry	177	“ Harry Potter ! ”
189690	189703	189636	189636	Luna	340	“ It was him , I swear , I just saw him ! ”
189748	189752	189740	189740	Luna	340	“ Wh — ? ”
189818	189825	189827	189827	Lupin	189	“ Harry , what ’s happening ? ”
189838	189879	189880	189880	Fred	228	“ Voldemort ’s on his way , they ’re barricading he school — Snape ’s run for it — What are you doing here ? How did you know ? We sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore ’s Army , ”
189883	189914	189880	189880	Fred	228	“ You could n’t expect everyone to miss the fun , Harry , and the D.A. let the Order of the Phoenix know , and it all kind of snowballed . ”
189915	189921	189923	189923	George	229	“ What first , Harry ? ”
189925	189931	189923	189923	George	229	“ What ’s going on ? ”
189932	189951	189952	189952	Harry	177	“ They ’re evacuating the younger kids and everyone ’s meeting in the Great Hall to get organized , ”
189955	189960	189952	189952	Harry	177	“ We ’re fighting . ”

190247	190266	190244	190244	Bill	230	“ You ca n’t do this . Everyone underage will have to leave , it ’s only right . ”
190267	190274	190275	190275	Ginny	238	“ I ca n’t go home ! ”
190285	190304	190275	190275	Ginny	238	“ My whole family ’s here , I ca n’t stand waiting there alone and not knowing and — ”
190332	190335	190336	190336	she	238	“ Fine , ”
190353	190366	190336	190336	she	238	“ I ’ll say good - bye now , then , and — ”

190635	190649	190651	190651	Fred	228	“ Ministry - loving , family - disowning , power - hungry moron , ”
190656	190662	190604	190604	Percy	302	“ Yes , I was ! ”
190663	190674	190676	190676	Fred	228	“ Well , you ca n’t say fairer than that , ”
190721	190728	190729	190729	Percy	302	“ I ’m sorry , Dad , ”
190747	190756	190758	190758	George	229	“ What made you see sense , Perce ? ”
190760	190770	190772	190772	Percy	302	“ It ’s been coming on for a while , ”
190788	190846	190772	190772	Percy	302	“ But I had to find a way out and it ’s not so easy at the Ministry , they ’re imprisoning traitors all the time . I managed to make contact with Aberforth and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that Hogwarts was going to make a fight of it , so here I am . ”
190847	190866	190868	190868	George	229	“ Well , we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these , ”
190880	190898	190868	190868	George	229	“ Now let ’s get upstairs and fight , or all the good Death Eaters’ll be taken . ”
190899	190911	190913	190913	Percy	302	“ So , you ’re my sister in - law now ? ”
190934	190937	190939	190940	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ Ginny ! ”
190958	190965	190967	190967	Lupin	189	“ Molly , how about this , ”
190969	191005	190967	190967	Lupin	189	“ Why does n’t Ginny stay here , then at least she ’ll be on the scene and know what ’s going on , but she wo n’t be in the middle of the fighting ? ”
191006	191009	191061	191062	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ I — ”
191010	191017	191019	191020	Mr. Weasley	212	“ That ’s a good idea , ”
191023	191036	191019	191020	Mr. Weasley	212	“ Ginny , you stay in this room , you hear me ? ”
191073	191078	191080	191080	Harry	177	“ Where ’s Ron ? ”
191082	191087	191080	191080	Harry	177	“ Where ’s Hermione ? ”
191088	191099	191100	191101	Mr. Weasley	212	“ They must have gone up the Great Hall already , ”
191107	191116	191118	191118	Harry	177	“ I did n’t see them pass me , ”
191120	191128	191130	191130	Ginny	238	“ They said something about a bathroom , ”
191132	191139	191130	191130	Ginny	238	“ not long after you left . ”
191140	191144	191145	191145	Harry	177	“ A bathroom ? ”
191170	191179	191145	191145	Harry	177	“ You ’re sure they said bath — ? ”
191355	191393	191394	191397	Many of the students	3892	“ … evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madame Pomfrey . Prefects , when I give the word , you will organize your House and take your charges in orderly fashion to the evacuation point . ”
191429	191440	191418	191419	Ernie Macmillan	562	“ And what if we want to stay and fight ? ”
191448	191459	191461	191462	Professor McGonagall	396	“ If you are of age , you may stay , ”
191464	191470	191472	191477	a girl at the Ravenclaw table	3894	“ What about our things ? ”
191479	191486	191472	191477	a girl at the Ravenclaw table	3894	“ Our trunks , our owls ? ”
191487	191496	191498	191499	Professor McGonagall	396	“ We have no time to collect possessions , ”
191501	191514	191498	191499	Professor McGonagall	396	“ The important thing is to get you out of here safely . ”
191515	191521	191523	191528	a girl from the Slytherin table	3895	“ Where ’s Professor Snape ? ”
191530	191544	191546	191547	Professor McGonagall	396	“ He has , to use the common phrase , done a bunk , ”
191601	191611	191612	191613	Professor McGonagall	396	“ We have already placed protection around the castle , ”
191617	191651	191612	191613	Professor McGonagall	396	“ but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it . I must ask you , therefore , to move quickly and calmly , and do as your prefects — ”
191711	191721	191726	191727	the students	5720	“ I know that you are preparing to fight . ”
191747	191786	191729	191745	some of whom clutched each other , looking around in terror for the source of the sound	3899	“ Your efforts are futile . You can not fight me . I do not want to kill you . I have great respect for the teachers of Hogwarts . I do not want to spill magical blood . ”
191815	191821	191823	191823	Voldemort	175	“ Give me Harry Potter , ”
191827	191862	191823	191823	Voldemort	175	“ and none shall not be harmed . Give me Harry Potter and I shall leave the school untouched . Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded . You have until midnight . ”
191920	191934	191912	191912	she	587	“ But he ’s there ! Potter ’s there . Someone grab him ! ”
192018	192025	192027	192028	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Thank you , Miss Parkinson , ”
192034	192054	192027	192028	Professor McGonagall	396	“ You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch . If the rest of your House could follow . ”
192079	192085	192087	192088	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Ravenclaws , follow on ! ”
192150	192163	192164	192164	Harry	177	“ Absolutely not , Creevey , go ! And you , Peakes ! ”
192179	192186	192203	192203	he	212	“ Where are Ron and Hermione ? ”
192187	192194	192196	192197	Mr. Weasley	212	“ Have n’t you found — ? ”
192223	192303	192305	192305	Kingsley	211	“ We ’ve only got half an hour until midnight , so we need to act fast . A battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of Hogwarts and the Order of the Phoenix . Professors Flitwick , Sprout and McGonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers — Ravenclaw , Astronomy , and Gryffindor — where they ’ll have good overview , excellent positions from which to work spells . Meanwhile Remus ”
192309	192311	192313	192313	Kingsley	211	“ Arthur ”
192325	192352	192316	192317	Mr. Weasley	212	“ and I will take groups into the grounds . We ’ll need somebody to organize defense of the entrances or the passageways into the school — ”
192353	192361	192363	192363	Fred	228	“ Sounds like a job for us , ”
192376	192391	192373	192373	his	228	“ All right , leaders up here and we ’ll divide up the troops ! ”
192392	192395	192397	192398	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Potter , ”
192418	192429	192406	192406	students	5265	“ Are n’t you supposed to be looking for something ? ”
192430	192435	192437	192437	Harry	177	“ What ? Oh , ”
192439	192443	192437	192437	Harry	177	“ oh yeah ! ”
192485	192493	192474	192474	Hermione	197	“ Then go , Potter , go ! ”
192494	192499	192500	192500	He	177	“ Right — yeah — ”
192970	192982	192964	192964	he	177	“ Nick ! Nick ! I need to talk to you ! ”
193017	193024	193025	193025	Nick	592	“ Harry ! My dear boy ! ”
193050	193068	193025	193025	Nick	592	“ Nick , you ’ve got to help me . Who ’s the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower ? ”
193079	193097	193025	193025	Nick	592	“ The Gray Lady , of course ; but if it is ghostly services you require — ? ”
193098	193112	193025	193025	Nick	592	“ It ’s got to be her — d’you know where she is ? ”
193113	193118	193025	193025	Nick	592	“ Let ’s see … ”
193144	193161	193129	193129	he	592	“ That ’s her over there , Harry , the young woman with the long hair . ”
193236	193244	193220	193220	her	3939	“ Hey — wait — come back ! ”
193311	193318	193290	193290	her	3939	“ You ’re the Gray Lady ? ”
193326	193333	193319	193319	She	3939	“ The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower ? ”
193334	193339	193290	193290	her	3939	“ That is correct . ”
193346	193368	193290	193290	her	3939	“ Please , I need some help . I need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem . ”
193376	193381	193382	193382	she	3939	“ I am afraid , ”
193389	193397	193382	193382	she	3939	“ that I can not help you . ”
193398	193401	193373	193373	her	3939	“ Wait ! ”
193439	193444	193445	193445	he	177	“ This is urgent , ”
193449	193466	193445	193445	he	177	“ If that diadem ’s at Hogwarts , I ’ve got to find it , fast . ”
193467	193479	193480	193480	she	3939	“ You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem , ”
193484	193492	193480	193480	she	3939	“ Generations of students have badgered me — ”
193493	193504	193505	193505	Harry	177	“ This is n’t about trying to get better marks ! ”
193510	193527	193505	193505	Harry	177	“ It ’s about Voldemort — defeating Voldemort — or are n’t you interested in that ? ”
193550	193561	193547	193547	she	3939	“ Of course I — how dare you suggest — ? ”
193562	193569	193542	193542	her	3939	“ Well , help me then ! ”
193575	193585	193586	193586	she	3939	“ It — it is not a question of — ”
193589	193595	193586	193586	she	3939	“ My mother ’s diadem — ”
193596	193601	193542	193542	her	3939	“ Your mother ’s ? ”
193608	193613	193614	193614	she	3939	“ When I lived , ”
193618	193624	193614	193614	she	3939	“ I was Helena Ravenclaw . ”
193625	193642	193542	193542	her	3939	“ You ’re her daughter ? But then , you must know what happed to it . ”
193643	193650	193651	193651	she	3939	“ While the diadem bestows wisdom , ”
193662	193681	193651	193651	she	3939	“ I doubt that it would greatly increase you chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself Lord — ”
193682	193697	193698	193698	Harry	177	“ Have n’t I told you , I ’m not interested in wearing it ! ”
193702	193738	193698	193698	Harry	177	“ There ’s no time to explain — but if you care about Hogwarts , if you want to see Voldemort finished , you ’ve got to tell me anything you know about the diadem ! ”
193805	193814	193787	193787	He	177	“ I stole the diadem from my mother . ”
193815	193822	193798	193798	she	3939	“ You — you did what ? ”
193823	193829	193831	193832	Helena Ravenclaw	593	“ I stole the diadem , ”
193837	193857	193831	193832	Helena Ravenclaw	593	“ I sought to make myself cleverer , more important than my mother . I ran away with it . ”
193886	193984	193882	193882	she	3939	“ My mother , they say , never admitted that the diadem was gone , but pretended that she had it still . She concealed her loss , my dreadful betrayal , even from the other founders of Hogwarts . Then my mother fell ill — fatally ill . In spite of my perfidy , she was desperate to see me one more time . She sent a man who had long loved me , though I spurned his advances , to find me . She knew that he would not rest until he had done so . ”
193999	194047	193988	193988	She	3943	“ He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding . When I refused to return with him , he became violent . The baron was always a hot - tempered man . Furious at my refusal , jealous of my freedom , he stabbed me . ”
194048	194056	194071	194071	she	3943	“ The Baron ? You mean — ? ”
194057	194064	194071	194071	she	3943	“ The Bloody Baron , yes , ”
194103	194140	194141	194141	she	3943	“ He took the weapon that had claimed my life , and used it to kill himself . All these centuries later , he wears his chains as an act of penitence … as he should , ”
194145	194152	194141	194141	she	3943	“ And — and the diadem ? ”
194153	194179	194141	194141	she	3943	“ It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering through the forest toward me . Concealed inside a hollow tree . ”
194180	194185	194187	194187	Harry	177	“ A hollow tree ? ”
194189	194197	194187	194187	Harry	177	“ What tree ? Where was this ? ”
194198	194217	194141	194141	she	3943	“ A forest in Albania . A lonely place I thought was far beyond my mother ’s reach . ”
194218	194221	194223	194223	Harry	177	“ Albania , ”
194249	194265	194242	194242	she	3943	“ You ’ve already told someone this story , have n’t you ? Another student ? ”
194273	194293	194266	194266	She	3943	“ I had … no idea … He was flattering . He seemed to … understand … to sympathize … ”
194320	194335	194336	194336	Harry	177	“ Well , you were n’t the first person Riddle wormed things out of , ”
194339	194348	194336	194336	Harry	177	“ He could be charming when he wanted … ”
194479	194489	194491	194491	Harry	177	“ — the night he asked for a job ! ”
194497	194503	194472	194472	Voldemort	175	“ I beg your pardon ? ”
194504	194523	194525	194525	Harry	177	“ He hid the diadem in the castle , the night he asked Dumbledore to let him teach ! ”
194540	194592	194525	194525	Harry	177	“ He must ’ve hidden the diadem on his way up to , or down from , Dumbledore ’s office ! But it was well worth trying to get the job — then he might ’ve got the chance to nick Gryffindor ’s sword as well — thank you , thanks ! ”
194768	194771	194772	194772	Harry	177	“ Hagrid ! ”
194791	194796	194807	194807	Hagrid	199	“ What the — ? ”
194797	194806	194807	194807	Hagrid	199	“ Harry , yer here ! Yer here ! ”
194830	194836	194837	194837	he	199	“ Good boy , Grawpy ! ”
194846	194861	194837	194837	he	199	“ I ’ll se yer in a moment , there ’s a good lad ! ”
194903	194908	194910	194910	Hagrid	199	“ Blimey , Harry , ”
194912	194923	194910	194910	Hagrid	199	“ this is it , eh ? Time ter fight ? ”
194924	194933	194887	194887	He	177	“ Hagrid , where have you come from ? ”
194934	194947	194949	194949	Hagrid	199	“ Heard You - Know - Who from up in our cave , ”
194952	194955	194957	194957	Harry	177	“ That , ”
194959	194969	194957	194957	Harry	177	“ is a really good question . Come on . ”
195013	195019	195021	195021	Hagrid	199	“ Where ’re we goin’ ? ”
195035	195040	195042	195042	Harry	177	“ I dunno exactly , ”
195049	195060	195042	195042	Harry	177	“ but Ron and Hermione must be around here somewhere … ”
195125	195141	195112	195112	Harry	177	“ Oh , do n’t mind me … I ’ll just be here and crumble … ”
195384	195387	195388	195388	Neville	401	“ Mandrakes ! ”
195399	195414	195388	195388	Neville	401	“ Going to lob them over the walls — they wo n’t like this ! ”
195527	195542	195544	195544	Hagrid	199	“ It ’s all righ ’ , Fang — it ’s all righ ’ ! ”
195631	195651	195623	195623	his	177	“ Braggarts and rogues , dogs and scoundrels , drive them out , Harry Potter , see them off ! ”
195701	195707	195708	195708	Fred	228	“ Nice night for it ! ”
195766	195769	195753	195753	her	599	“ Potter ! ”
195782	195796	195777	195777	his	360	“ I ’ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub , Potter ! ”
195797	195805	195806	195806	Harry	177	“ I know , we ’re evacuating , ”
195809	195813	195806	195806	Harry	177	“ Voldemort ’s — ”
195814	195827	195829	195829	Aberforth	360	“ — attacking because they have n’t handed you over , yeah , ”
195831	195885	195829	195829	Aberforth	360	“ I ’m not deaf , the whole of Hogsmeade heard him . And it never occurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins hostage ? There are kids of Death Eaters you ’ve just sent to safety . Would n’t it have been a bit smarter to keep ’em here ? ”
195886	195893	195895	195895	Harry	177	“ It would n’t stop Voldemort , ”
195897	195907	195895	195895	Harry	177	“ and your brother would never have done it . ”
196005	196013	196014	196014	Harry	177	“ Where the hell have you been ? ”
196017	196022	196024	196024	Ron	227	“ Chamber of Secrets , ”
196026	196031	196033	196033	Harry	177	“ Chamber — what ? ”
196043	196053	196055	196055	Hermione	197	“ It was Ron , all Ron ’s idea ! ”
196058	196117	196055	196055	Hermione	197	“ Was n’t it absolutely brilliant ? There we were , after we left , and I said to Ron , even if we find the other one , how are we going to get rid of it ? We still had n’t got rid of the cup ! And then he thought of it ! The basilisk ! ”
196118	196123	196148	196148	Hermione	197	“ What the — ? ”
196124	196132	196134	196134	Ron	227	“ Something to get rid of Horcruxes , ”
196170	196179	196180	196180	he	177	“ But how did you get in there ? ”
196190	196197	196180	196180	he	177	“ You need to speak Parseltongue ! ”
196198	196202	196204	196204	Hermione	197	“ He did ! ”
196206	196212	196204	196204	Hermione	197	“ Show him , Ron ! ”
196221	196232	196233	196233	he	177	“ It ’s what you did to open the locket , ”
196238	196253	196254	196254	he	177	“ I had to have a few goes to get it right , but , ”
196258	196266	196254	196254	he	177	“ we got there in the end . ”
196267	196272	196274	196274	Hermione	197	“ He was amazing ! ”
196276	196279	196274	196274	Hermione	197	“ Amazing ! ”
196280	196283	196284	196284	Harry	177	“ So … ”
196291	196294	196284	196284	Harry	177	“ So … ”
196295	196303	196305	196305	Ron	227	“ So we ’re another Horcrux down , ”

202767	202777	202779	202779	Harry	177	“ He does n’t think he needs to fight , ”
202781	202792	202779	202779	Harry	177	“ He thinks I ’m going to go to him . ”
202793	202797	202877	202877	Harry	177	“ But why ? ”
202798	202830	202779	202779	Harry	177	“ He knows I ’m after Horcruxes — he ’s keeping Nagini close beside him — obviously I ’m going to have to go to him to get near the thing — ”
202831	202834	202836	202836	Ron	227	“ Right , ”
202842	202876	202836	202836	Ron	227	“ So you ca n’t go , that ’s what he wants , what he ’s expecting . You stay here and look after Hermione , and I ’ll go and get it — ”

206058	206068	206038	206038	Snape	449	“ … my Lord , their resistance is crumbling — ”
206069	206080	206084	206084	his	175	“ — and it is doing so without your help , ”
206090	206117	206084	206084	his	175	“ Skilled wizard though you are , Severus , I do not think you will make much difference now . We are almost there … almost . ”
206118	206143	206084	206084	his	175	“ Let me find the boy . Let me bring you Potter . I know I can find him , my Lord . Please . ”
206229	206237	206239	206239	Voldemort	175	“ I have a problem , Severus , ”
206242	206246	206248	206248	Snape	172	“ My Lord ? ”
206268	206279	206250	206250	Voldemort	175	“ Why does n’t it work for me , Severus ? ”
206310	206316	206318	206318	Snape	172	“ My — my lord ? ”
206321	206338	206318	206318	Snape	172	“ I do not understand . You — you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand . ”
206339	206342	206344	206344	Voldemort	175	“ No , ”
206346	206393	206344	206344	Voldemort	175	“ I have performed my usual magic . I am extraordinary , but this wand … no . It has not revealed the wonders it has promised . I feel no difference between this wand and the one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago . ”
206433	206437	206439	206439	Voldemort	175	“ No difference , ”
206508	206530	206489	206489	he	172	“ I have thought long and hard , Severus … do you know why I have called you back from battle ? ”
206554	206574	206541	206541	His	177	“ No , my Lord , but I beg you will let me return . Let me find Potter . ”
206575	206650	206541	206541	His	177	“ You sound like Lucius . Neither of you understands Potter as I do . He does not need finding . Potter will come to me . I knew his weakness , you see , his one great flaw . He will hate watching the others struck down around him , knowing that it is for him that it happens . He will want to stop it at any cost . He will come . ”
206651	206667	206541	206541	His	177	“ But my Lord , he might be killed accidentally by someone other than yourself — ”
206668	206727	206541	206541	His	177	“ My instructions to the Death Eaters have been perfectly clear . Capture Potter . Kill his friends — the more , the better — but do not kill him . But it is of you that I wished to speak , Severus , not Harry Potter . You have been very valuable to me . Very valuable . ”
206728	206764	206541	206541	His	177	“ My Lord knows I seek only to serve him . But — let me go and find the boy , my Lord . Let me bring him to you . I know I can — ”
206765	206773	206775	206775	Voldemort	175	“ I have told you , no ! ”
206817	206837	206809	206809	Voldemort	175	“ My concern at the moment , Severus , is what will happen when I finally meet the boy ! ”
206838	206851	206809	206809	Voldemort	175	“ My Lord , there can be no question , surely — ? ”
206852	206865	206809	206809	Voldemort	175	“ — but there is a question , Severus . There is . ”
206891	206907	206877	206877	he	177	“ Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at Harry Potter ? ”
206908	206920	206877	206877	he	177	“ I — I can not answer that , my Lord . ”
206921	206926	206877	206877	he	177	“ Ca n’t you ? ”
206976	207033	206965	206965	he	177	“ My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it , Severus , except to kill Harry Potter . Twice it failed . Ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores , told me to take another ’s wand . I did so , but Lucius ’s wand shattered upon meeting Potter ’s . ”
207034	207045	206965	206965	he	177	“ I — I have no explanation , my Lord . ”
207069	207108	207054	207054	His	172	“ I sought a third wand , Severus . The Elder Wand , the Wand of Destiny , the Deathstick . I took it from its previous master . I took it from the grave of Albus Dumbledore . ”
207152	207163	207135	207135	he	172	“ My Lord — let me go to the boy — ”
207164	207183	207185	207185	Voldemort	175	“ All this long night when I am on the brink of victory , I have sat here , ”
207195	207235	207187	207187	his	175	“ wondering , wondering , why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be , refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner … and I think I have the answer . ”
207241	207275	207187	207187	his	175	“ Perhaps you already know it ? You are a clever man , after all , Severus . You have been a good and faithful servant , and I regret what must happen . ”
207276	207280	207187	207187	his	175	“ My Lord — ”
207281	207334	207187	207187	his	175	“ The Elder Wand can not serve me properly , Severus , because I am not its true master . The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner . You killed Albus Dumbledore . While you live , Severus , the Elder Wand can not truly be mine . ”
207335	207339	207340	207340	Snape	172	“ My Lord ! ”
207347	207356	207358	207358	Voldemort	175	“ It can not be any other way , ”
207360	207380	207358	207358	Voldemort	175	“ I must master the wand , Severus . Master the wand , and I master Potter at last . ”
207453	207456	207448	207448	Voldemort	175	“ Kill . ”
207516	207521	207523	207523	Voldemort	175	“ I regret it , ”
207675	207678	207685	207685	he	177	“ Harry ! ”
207827	207836	207803	207803	Snape	172	“ Take … it … Take … it … ”
207939	207946	207947	207947	he	172	“ Look … at … me … ”
208112	208117	208062	208062	he	177	“ You have fought , ”
208125	208220	208062	208062	he	177	“ valiantly . Lord Voldemort knows how to value bravery . Yet you have sustained heavy losses . If you continue to resist me , you will all die , one by one . I do not wish this to happen . Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste . Lord Voldemort is merciful . I command my forces to retreat immediately . You have one hour . Dispose of your dead with dignity . Treat your injured . I speak now , Harry Potter , directly to you . ”
208234	208241	208243	208243	Ron	227	“ Do n’t listen to him , ”
208245	208252	208254	208254	Hermione	197	“ It ’ll be all right , ”
208257	208285	208254	208254	Hermione	197	“ Let’s — let ’s get back to the castle , if he ’s gone to the forest we ’ll need to think of a new plan — ”

209572	209576	209578	209578	Petunia	206	“ Stop it ! ”
209580	209587	209589	209589	Lily	379	“ It ’s not hurting you , ”
209607	209613	209615	209615	Petunia	206	“ It ’s not right , ”
209634	209641	209642	209642	she	206	“ How do you do it ? ”
209654	209663	209664	209664	Snape	172	“ It ’s obvious , is n’t it ? ”
209723	209728	209730	209730	Lily	379	“ What ’s obvious ? ”
209761	209768	209754	209754	he	172	“ I know what you are . ”
209769	209775	209756	209756	his	172	“ What do you mean ? ”
209776	209785	209787	209787	Snape	172	“ You ’re … you ’re a witch , ”
209793	209806	209789	209789	She	379	“ That ’s not a very nice thing to say to somebody ! ”
209822	209825	209827	209827	Snape	172	“ No ! ”
209908	209912	209914	209914	Snape	172	“ You are , ”
209918	209952	209914	209914	Snape	172	“ You are a witch . I ’ve been watching you for a while . But there ’s nothing wrong with that . My mum ’s one , and I ’m a wizard . ”
209961	209964	209965	209965	she	206	“ Wizard ! ”
209984	210007	210008	210008	she	206	“ I know who you are . You ’re that Snape boy ! They live down Spinner ’s End by the river , ”
210028	210037	210008	210008	she	206	“ Why have you been spying on us ? ”
210038	210044	210046	210046	Snape	172	“ Have n’t been spying , ”
210060	210069	210070	210070	he	172	“ Would n’t spy on you , anyway , ”
210074	210080	210070	210070	he	172	“ you ’re a Muggle . ”
210097	210107	210108	210108	she	206	“ Lily , come on , we ’re leaving ! ”
210259	210278	210244	210244	his	172	“ … and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school , you get letters . ”
210279	210288	210378	210378	she	379	“ But I have done magic outside school ! ”
210289	210324	210325	210325	he	172	“ We ’re all right . We have n’t got wands yet . They let you off when you ’re a kid and you ca n’t help it . But once you ’re eleven , ”
210329	210344	210325	210325	he	172	“ and they start training you , then you ’ve got to go careful . ”
210392	210431	210378	210378	she	379	“ It is real , is n’t it ? It ’s not a joke ? Petunia says you ’re lying to me . Petunia says there is n’t a Hogwarts . It is real , is n’t it ? ”
210432	210439	210441	210441	Snape	172	“ It ’s real for us , ”
210443	210459	210441	210441	Snape	172	“ Not for her . But we ’ll get the letter , you and me . ”

210467	210470	210472	210472	Snape	172	“ Definitely , ”
210505	210514	210515	210515	Lily	379	“ And will it really come by owl ? ”
210518	210521	210523	210523	Snape	172	“ Normally , ”
210525	210548	210523	210523	Snape	172	“ But you ’re Muggle - born , so someone from the school will have to come and explain to your parents . ”
210549	210561	210562	210562	Snape	172	“ Does it make a difference , being Muggle - born ? ”
210586	210589	210590	210590	he	172	“ No , ”
210593	210601	210590	210590	he	172	“ It does n’t make any difference . ”
210602	210605	210607	210607	Lily	379	“ Good , ”
210620	210628	210630	210630	Snape	172	“ You ’ve got loads of magic , ”
210632	210645	210630	210630	Snape	172	“ I saw that . All the time I was watching you … ”
210689	210697	210698	210698	Lily	379	“ How are things at your house ? ”
210709	210712	210713	210713	he	172	“ Fine , ”
210716	210723	210706	210706	his	172	“ They ’re not arguing anymore ? ”
210724	210732	210734	210734	Snape	172	“ Oh yes , they ’re arguing , ”
210757	210771	210736	210736	He	172	“ But it wo n’t be that long and I ’ll be gone . ”
210772	210780	210706	210706	his	172	“ Does n’t your dad like magic ? ”
210781	210790	210792	210792	Snape	172	“ He does n’t like anything , much , ”
210794	210797	210706	210706	his	172	“ Severus ? ”
210811	210814	210706	210706	his	172	“ Yeah ? ”
210815	210823	210706	210706	his	172	“ Tell me about the Dementors again . ”
210824	210834	210706	210706	his	172	“ What d’you want to know about them for ? ”
210835	210843	210706	210706	his	172	“ If I use magic outside school — ”
210844	210888	210706	210706	his	172	“ They would n’t give you to the Dementors for that ! Dementors are for people who do really bad stuff . They guard the wizard prison , Azkaban . You ’re not going to end up in Azkaban , you ’re too — ”
210921	210924	210926	210926	Lily	379	“ Tuney ! ”
210943	210949	210950	210950	he	172	“ Who ’s spying now ? ”
210953	210958	210950	210950	he	172	“ What d’you want ? ”
210979	210989	210990	210990	she	206	“ What is that you ’re wearing , anyway ? ”
210999	211005	210990	210990	she	206	“ Your mum ’s blouse ? ”
211040	211043	211032	211032	she	206	“ Tuney ! ”
211055	211062	211050	211050	Lily	379	“ Did you make that happen ? ”
211063	211066	211067	211067	He	172	“ No . ”
211074	211078	211079	211079	She	379	“ You did ! ”
211086	211094	211079	211079	She	379	“ You did ! You hurt her ! ”
211095	211104	211079	211079	She	379	“ No — no , I did n’t ! ”
211225	211239	211240	211240	She	379	“ … I ’m sorry , Tuney , I ’m sorry ! Listen — ”
211261	211297	211254	211254	Petunia	206	“ Maybe once I ’m there — no , listen , Tuney ! Maybe once I ’m there , I ’ll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind ! ”
211298	211308	211310	211310	Petunia	206	“ I don’t — want — to — go ! ”
211325	211344	211313	211313	she	206	“ You think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a — a … ”
211408	211421	211422	211422	Lily	379	“ — you think I want to be a — a freak ? ”
211437	211444	211446	211446	Lily	379	“ I ’m not a freak , ”
211448	211457	211446	211446	Lily	379	“ That ’s a horrible thing to say . ”
211458	211466	211468	211468	Petunia	206	“ That ’s where you ’re going , ”
211472	211511	211468	211468	Petunia	206	“ A special school for freaks . You and that Snape boy … weirdos , that ’s what you two are . It ’s good you ’re being separated from normal people . It ’s for our safety . ”
211552	211577	211545	211545	her	379	“ You did n’t think it was such a freaks ’ school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged him to take you . ”
211582	211590	211545	211545	her	379	“ Beg ? I did n’t beg ! ”
211591	211602	211545	211545	her	379	“ I saw his reply . It was very kind . ”
211603	211610	211612	211612	Petunia	206	“ You should n’t have read — ”
211614	211625	211612	211612	Petunia	206	“ that was my private — how could you — ? ”
211643	211660	211640	211640	Petunia	206	“ That boy found it ! You and that boy have been sneaking in my room ! ”
211661	211667	211669	211669	Lily	379	“ No — not sneaking — ”
211675	211714	211669	211669	Lily	379	“ Severus saw the envelope , and he could n’t believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts , that ’s all ! He says there must be wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of — ”
211715	211724	211726	211726	Petunia	206	“ Apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere ! ”
211737	211740	211741	211741	she	206	“ Freak ! ”
211868	211878	211879	211879	she	379	“ I do n’t want to talk to you , ”
211886	211890	211912	211912	She	379	“ Why not ? ”
211891	211906	211912	211912	She	379	“ Tuney h - hates me . Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore . ”
211907	211911	211912	211912	She	379	“ So what ? ”
211921	211928	211912	211912	She	379	“ So she ’s my sister ! ”
211929	211935	211936	211936	He	172	“ She ’s only a — ”
211959	211965	211966	211966	he	172	“ But we ’re going ! ”
211978	211989	211966	211966	he	172	“ This is it ! We ’re off to Hogwarts ! ”
212007	212015	212017	212017	Snape	172	“ You ’d better be in Slytherin , ”
212027	212030	212003	212003	she	379	“ Slytherin ? ”
212111	212129	212130	212130	James	270	“ Who wants to be in Slytherin ? I think I ’d leave , would n’t you ? ”
212158	212167	212168	212168	he	198	“ My whole family have been in Slytherin , ”
212171	212174	212176	212176	James	270	“ Blimey , ”
212178	212187	212176	212176	James	270	“ and I thought you seemed all right ! ”
212191	212211	212188	212188	Sirius	198	“ Maybe I ’ll break the tradition . Where are you heading , if you ’ve got the choice ? ”
212218	212234	212212	212212	James	270	“ ‘ Gryffindor , where dwell the brave at heart ! ’ Like my dad . ”
212248	212255	212243	212243	James	270	“ Got a problem with that ? ”
212256	212259	212261	212261	Snape	172	“ No , ”
212270	212280	212264	212264	his	172	“ If you ’d rather be brawny than brainy — ”
212281	212295	212297	212297	Sirius	198	“ Where ’re you hoping to go , seeing as you ’re neither ? ”
212320	212332	212304	212304	Lily	379	“ Come on , Severus , let ’s find another compartment . ”
212333	212336	212341	212341	her	379	“ Oooooo … ”
212354	212360	212304	212304	Lily	379	“ See ya , Snivellus ! ”
212402	212407	212398	212399	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Evans , Lily ! ”
212452	212455	212425	212426	Professor McGonagall	396	“ Gryffindor ! ”
212604	212607	212587	212587	Harry	177	“ Slytherin ! ”
212718	212728	212729	212729	Snape	172	“ … thought we were supposed to be friends ? ”
212733	212737	212729	212729	Snape	172	“ Best friends ? ”
212738	212799	212729	212729	Snape	172	“ We are , Sev , but I do n’t like some of the people you ’re hanging round with ! I ’m sorry , but I detest Avery and Mulciber ! Mulciber ! What do you see in him , Sev , he ’s creepy ! D’you know what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day ? ”
212819	212824	212826	212826	Snape	172	“ That was nothing , ”
212828	212838	212826	212826	Snape	172	“ It was a laugh , that ’s all — ”
212839	212853	212876	212876	he	172	“ It was Dark Magic , and if you think that ’s funny — ”
212854	212867	212869	212869	Snape	172	“ What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to ? ”
212891	212901	212903	212903	Lily	369	“ What ’s Potter got to do with anything ? ”
212905	212926	212876	212876	he	172	“ They sneak out at night . There ’s something weird about that Lupin . Where does he keep going ? ”
212927	212932	212934	212934	Lily	369	“ He ’s ill , ”
212936	212943	212934	212934	Lily	369	“ They say he ’s ill — ”
212944	212952	212954	212954	Snape	172	“ Every month at the full moon ? ”
212956	212962	212964	212964	Lily	369	“ I know your theory , ”
212971	212992	212967	212967	she	4336	“ Why are you so obsessed with them anyway ? Why do you care what they ’re doing at night ? ”
212993	213014	213018	213018	his	172	“ I ’m just trying to show you they ’re not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are . ”
213024	213034	213035	213035	She	4336	“ They do n’t use Dark Magic , though . ”
213040	213077	213035	213035	She	4336	“ And you ’re being really ungrateful . I heard what happened the other night . You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow , and James saved you from whatever ’s down there — ”
213087	213123	213084	213084	he	172	“ Saved ? Saved ? You think he was playing the hero ? He was saving his neck and his friends ’ too ! You ’re not going to — I wo n’t let you — ”
213124	213131	213035	213035	She	4336	“ Let me ? Let me ? ”
213145	213172	213140	213140	Snape	172	“ I did n’t mean — I just do n’t want to see you made a fool of — He fancies you , James fancies you ! ”
213183	213196	213180	213180	his	172	“ And he ’s not … everyone thinks … big Quidditch hero — ”
213220	213229	213230	213230	she	4337	“ I know Jame is an arrogant toerag , ”
213237	213277	213230	213230	she	4337	“ I do n’t need you to tell me that . But Mulciber ’s and Avery ’s idea of humor is just evil . Evil , Sev . I do n’t understand how you can be friends with them . ”
213453	213456	213438	213438	Snape	172	“ Mudblood . ”
213461	213466	213438	213438	Snape	172	“ I ’m sorry . ”
213467	213473	213438	213438	Snape	172	“ I ’m not interested . ”
213474	213479	213438	213438	Snape	172	“ I ’m sorry ! ”
213480	213485	213438	213438	Snape	172	“ Save your breath — ”
213521	213537	213438	213438	Snape	172	“ I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here . ”
213538	213558	213438	213438	Snape	172	“ I was . I would have done . I never meant to call you Mudblood , it just — ”
213559	213563	213438	213438	Snape	172	“ Slipped out ? ”
213573	213650	213569	213569	Lily	369	“ It ’s too late . I ’ve made excuses for you for years . None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you . You and your precious little Death Eater friends — you see , you do n’t even deny it ! You do n’t even deny that ’s what you ’re all aiming to be ! You ca n’t wait to join You - Know - Who , can you ? ”
213662	213680	213438	213438	Snape	172	“ I ca n’t pretend anymore . You ’ve chosen your way , I ’ve chosen mine . ”
213681	213691	213731	213731	she	4345	“ No — listen , I did n’t mean — ”
213692	213717	213438	213438	Snape	172	“ — to call me Mudblood ? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood , Severus . Why should I be any different ? ”
213891	213897	213875	213875	Snape	172	“ Do n’t kill me ! ”
213898	213905	213927	213927	Snape	172	“ That was not my intention . ”
213950	213964	213936	213936	his	207	“ Well , Severus ? What message does Lord Voldemort have for me ? ”
213965	213978	213947	213947	his	172	“ No — no message — I’m here on my own account ! ”
214000	214016	213985	213985	He	172	“ I — I come with a warning — no , a request — please — ”
214048	214059	214017	214017	Dumbledore	207	“ What request could a Death Eater make of me ? ”
214060	214071	214017	214017	Dumbledore	207	“ The — the prophecy … the prediction … Trelawney … ”
214072	214077	214079	214079	Dumbledore	207	“ Ah , yes , ”
214081	214091	214079	214079	Dumbledore	207	“ How much did you relay to Lord Voldemort ? ”
214092	214099	214101	214101	Snape	172	“ Everything — everything I heard ! ”
214103	214121	214101	214101	Snape	172	“ That is why — it is for that reason — he thinks it means Lily Evans ! ”
214122	214132	214134	214134	Dumbledore	207	“ The prophecy did not refer to a woman , ”
214136	214149	214134	214134	Dumbledore	207	“ It spoke of a boy born at the end of July — ”
214150	214176	214101	214101	Snape	172	“ You know what I mean ! He thinks it means her son , he is going to hunt her down — kill them all — ”
214177	214186	214188	214188	Dumbledore	207	“ If she means so much to you , ”
214190	214214	214188	214188	Dumbledore	207	“ surely Lord Voldemort will spare her ? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother , in exchange for the son ? ”
214215	214224	214101	214101	Snape	172	“ I have — I have asked him — ”
214225	214230	214232	214232	Dumbledore	207	“ You disgust me , ”
214253	214283	214246	214246	Snape	172	“ You do not care , then , about the deaths of her husband and child ? They can die , as long as you have what you want ? ”
214295	214302	214303	214303	he	172	“ Hide them all , then , ”
214306	214316	214303	214303	he	172	“ Keep her — them — safe . Please . ”
214317	214329	214293	214293	Dumbledore	207	“ And what will you give me in return , Severus ? ”
214330	214336	214303	214303	he	172	“ In — in return ? ”
214357	214360	214354	214354	he	172	“ Anything . ”
214434	214448	214415	214415	he	172	“ I thought … you were going … to keep her … safe … ”
214449	214461	214463	214463	Dumbledore	207	“ She and James put their faith in the wrong person , ”
214465	214483	214463	214463	Dumbledore	207	“ Rather like you , Severus . Were n’t you hoping that Lord Voldemort would spare her ? ”
214490	214495	214497	214497	Dumbledore	207	“ Her boy survives , ”
214516	214546	214415	214415	he	172	“ Her son lives . He has her eyes , precisely her eyes . You remember the shape and color of Lily Evans ’s eyes , I am sure ? ”
214547	214550	214552	214552	Snape	172	“ DON’T ! ”
214554	214559	214552	214552	Snape	172	“ Gone … dead … ”
214560	214567	214415	214415	he	172	“ Is this remorse , Severus ? ”
214568	214578	214552	214552	Snape	172	“ I wish … I wish I were dead … ”
214579	214589	214591	214591	Dumbledore	207	“ And what use would that be to anyone ? ”
214594	214614	214591	214591	Dumbledore	207	“ If you loved Lily Evans , if you truly loved her , then your way forward is clear . ”
214639	214647	214552	214552	Snape	172	“ What — what do you mean ? ”
214648	214672	214626	214626	Dumbledore	207	“ You know how and why she died . Make sure it was not in vain . Help me protect Lily ’s son . ”
214673	214686	214552	214552	Snape	172	“ He does not need protection . The Dark Lord has gone — ”
214687	214706	214626	214626	Dumbledore	207	“ The Dark Lord will return , and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does . ”
214731	214770	214728	214728	he	172	“ Very well . Very well . But never — never tell , Dumbledore ! This must be between us ! Swear it ! I can not bear … especially Potter ’s son … I want your word ! ”
214771	214787	214788	214788	Dumbledore	207	“ My word , Severus , that I shall never reveal the best of you ? ”
214801	214806	214788	214788	Dumbledore	207	“ If you insist … ”
214827	214854	214816	214816	Snape	172	“ — mediocre , arrogant as his father , a determined rule - breaker , delighted to find himself famous , attention - seeking and impertinent — ”
214855	214866	214868	214868	Dumbledore	207	“ You see what you expect to see , Severus , ”
214881	214906	214868	214868	Dumbledore	207	“ Other teachers report that the boy is modest , likeable , and reasonably talented . Personally , I find him an engaging child . ”
214919	214930	214907	214907	Dumbledore	207	“ Keep an eye on Quirrell , wo n’t you ? ”
214970	214973	214975	214975	Dumbledore	207	“ Well ? ”
214977	215009	215010	215010	Snape	172	“ Karkaroff ’s Mark is becoming darker too . He is panicking , he fears retribution ; you know how much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell . ”
215021	215031	215010	215010	Snape	172	“ Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark burns . ”
215032	215036	215038	215038	Dumbledore	207	“ Does he ? ”
215054	215063	215045	215046	Roger Davies	635	“ And are you tempted to join him ? ”
215064	215067	215069	215069	Snape	172	“ No , ”
215083	215091	215071	215071	his	172	“ I am not such a coward . ”
215092	215095	215097	215097	Dumbledore	207	“ No , ”
215099	215122	215097	215097	Dumbledore	207	“ You are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff . You know , I sometimes think we Sort too soon … ”
215222	215225	215227	215227	Snape	172	“ Why , ”
215232	215256	215227	215227	Snape	172	“ why did you put on that ring ? It carries a curse , surely you realized that . Why even touch it ? ”
215283	215293	215280	215280	Dumbledore	207	“ I … was a fool . Sorely tempted … ”
215294	215299	215317	215317	Snape	172	“ Tempted by what ? ”
215305	215316	215317	215317	Snape	172	“ It is a miracle you managed to return here ! ”
215321	215354	215317	215317	Snape	172	“ That ring carried a curse of extraordinary power , to contain it is all we can hope for ; I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being — ”
215377	215394	215317	215317	Snape	172	“ You have done very well , Severus . How long do you think I have ? ”
215418	215453	215411	215411	Snape	172	“ I can not tell . Maybe a year . There is no halting such a spell forever . It will spread eventually , it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time . ”
215479	215494	215454	215454	Dumbledore	207	“ I am fortunate , extremely fortunate , that I have you , Severus . ”
215495	215520	215522	215522	Snape	172	“ If you had only summoned me a little earlier , I might have been able to do more , buy you more time ! ”
215536	215549	215525	215525	He	172	“ Did you think that breaking the ring would break the curse ? ”
215550	215562	215564	215564	Dumbledore	207	“ Something like that … I was delirious , no doubt … ”
215576	215588	215569	215569	he	207	“ Well , really , this makes matters much more straightforward . ”
215597	215621	215594	215594	Dumbledore	207	“ I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me . His plan to have the poor Malfoy boy murder me . ”
215678	215716	215675	215675	Snape	172	“ The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed . This is merely punishment for Lucius ’s recent failures . Slow torture for Draco ’s parents , while they watch him fail and pay the price . ”
215717	215737	215739	215739	Dumbledore	207	“ In short , the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have , ”
215741	215762	215739	215739	Dumbledore	207	“ Now , I should have thought the natural successor to the job , once Draco fails , is yourself ? ”
215769	215782	215675	215675	Snape	172	“ That , I think , is the Dark Lord ’s plan . ”
215783	215803	215675	215675	Snape	172	“ Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at Hogwarts ? ”
215804	215818	215675	215675	Snape	172	“ He believes the school will soon be in his grasp , yes . ”
215819	215829	215831	215831	Dumbledore	207	“ And if it does fall into his grasp , ”
215842	215862	215831	215831	Dumbledore	207	“ I have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students at Hogwarts ? ”
215869	215918	215863	215863	Snape	172	“ Good . Now then . Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up to . A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself . Offer him help and guidance , he ought to accept , he likes you — ”
215919	215943	216006	216006	he	172	“ — much less since his father has lost favor . Draco blames me , he thinks I have usurped Lucius ’s position . ”
215944	215995	215863	215863	Snape	172	“ All the same , try . I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy . Ultimately , of course , there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from Lord Voldemort ’s wrath . ”
216009	216019	216006	216006	he	172	“ Are you intending to let him kill you ? ”
216020	216029	216006	216006	he	172	“ Certainly not . You must kill me . ”
216054	216064	216066	216066	Snape	172	“ Would you like me to do it now ? ”
216074	216087	216068	216068	his	172	“ Or would you like a few moments to compose an epitaph ? ”
216088	216095	216097	216097	Dumbledore	207	“ Oh , not quite yet , ”
216101	216119	216120	216120	he	172	“ I daresay the moment will present itself in due course . Given what has happened tonight , ”
216126	216139	216120	216120	he	172	“ we can be sure that it will happen within a year . ”
216140	216148	216150	216150	Snape	172	“ If you do n’t mind dying , ”
216153	216161	216150	216150	Snape	172	“ why not let Draco do it ? ”
216162	216173	216175	216175	Dumbledore	207	“ That boy ’s soul is not yet so damaged , ”
216177	216189	216175	216175	Dumbledore	207	“ I would not have it ripped apart on my account . ”
216190	216199	216150	216150	Snape	172	“ And my soul , Dumbledore ? Mine ? ”
216200	216220	216222	216222	Dumbledore	207	“ You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation , ”
216224	216308	216222	216222	Dumbledore	207	“ I ask this one great favor of you , Severus , because death is coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year ’s league . I confess I should prefer a quick , painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if , for instance , Greyback is involved — I hear Voldemort has recruited him ? Or dear Bellatrix , who likes to play with her food before she eats it . ”
216350	216356	216346	216346	Dumbledore	207	“ Thank you , Severus … ”
216377	216393	216394	216394	Snape	172	“ What are you doing with Potter , all these evenings you are closeted together ? ”
216402	216430	216398	216398	Dumbledore	207	“ Why ? You are n’t trying to give him more detentions , Severus ? The boy will soon have spent more time in detention than out . ”
216431	216439	216398	216398	Dumbledore	207	“ He is his father over again — ”
216440	216483	216398	216398	Dumbledore	207	“ In looks , perhaps , but his deepest nature is much more like his mother ’s . I spend time with Harry because I have things to discuss with him , information I must give him before it is too late . ”
216484	216487	216489	216489	Snape	172	“ Information , ”
216491	216502	216489	216489	Snape	172	“ You trust him … you do not trust me . ”
216503	216543	216398	216398	Dumbledore	207	“ It is not a question of trust . I have , as we both know , limited time . It is essential that I give the boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do . ”
216544	216555	216489	216489	Snape	172	“ And why may I not have the same information ? ”
216556	216587	216398	216398	Dumbledore	207	“ I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket , particularly not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort . ”
216588	216596	216489	216489	Snape	172	“ Which I do on your orders ! ”
216597	216646	216398	216398	Dumbledore	207	“ And you do it extremely well . Do not think that I underestimate the constant danger in which you place yourself , Severus . To give Voldemort what appears to be valuable information while withholding the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody but you . ”
216647	216680	216489	216489	Snape	172	“ Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency , whose magic is mediocre , and who has a direct connection into the Dark Lord ’s mind ! ”
216681	216687	216689	216689	Dumbledore	207	“ Voldemort fears that connection , ”
216691	216742	216689	216689	Dumbledore	207	“ Not so long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing Harry ’s mind means to him . It was pain such as he has never experienced . He will not try to possess Harry again , I am sure of it . Not in that way . ”
216743	216749	216489	216489	Snape	172	“ I do n’t understand . ”
216750	216785	216689	216689	Dumbledore	207	“ Lord Voldemort ’s soul , maimed as it is , can not bear close contact with a soul like Harry ’s . Like a tongue on frozen steel , like flesh in flame — ”
216786	216795	216489	216489	Snape	172	“ Souls ? We were talking of minds ! ”
216796	216817	216689	216689	Dumbledore	207	“ In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort , to speak of one is to speak of the other . ”
216848	216857	216844	216844	anyone	5116	“ After you have killed me , Severus — ”
216858	216875	216877	216877	Snape	172	“ You refuse to tell me everything , yet you expect that small service of me ! ”
216889	216907	216877	216877	Snape	172	“ You take a great deal for granted , Dumbledore ! Perhaps I have changed my mind ! ”
216908	216943	216844	216844	anyone	5116	“ You gave me your word , Severus . And while we are talking about services you owe me , I thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young Slytherin friend ? ”
216953	216978	216950	216950	Dumbledore	207	“ Come to my office tonight , Severus , at eleven , and you shall not complain that I have no confidence in you … ”
217009	217041	217002	217002	Dumbledore	207	“ Harry must not know , not until the last moment , not until it is necessary , otherwise how could he have the strength to do what must be done ? ”
217042	217049	216996	216996	Snape	172	“ But what must he do ? ”
217050	217101	217002	217002	Dumbledore	207	“ That is between Harry and me . Now listen closely , Severus . There will come a time — after my death — do not argue , do not interrupt ! There will come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake . ”
217102	217106	217107	217107	Snape	172	“ For Nagini ? ”
217111	217155	217107	217107	Snape	172	“ Precisely . If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding , but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection , then , I think , it will be safe to tell Harry . ”
217156	217161	217002	217002	Dumbledore	207	“ Tell him what ? ”
217172	217295	217107	217107	Snape	172	“ Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him , when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield , the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort , and a fragment of Voldemort ’s soul was blasted apart from the whole , and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsed building . Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry , and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes , and a connection with Lord Voldemort ’s mind that he has never understood . And while that fragment of soul , unmissed by Voldemort , remains attached to and protected by Harry , Lord Voldemort can not die . ”
217328	217338	217340	217340	Snape	172	“ So the boy … the boy must die ? ”
217344	217358	217296	217296	Harry	177	“ And Voldemort himself must do it , Severus . That is essential . ”
217367	217386	217364	217364	Snape	172	“ I thought … all those years … that we were protecting him for her . For Lily . ”
217387	217412	217414	217414	Dumbledore	207	“ We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him , to raise him , to let him try his strength , ”
217422	217477	217414	217414	Dumbledore	207	“ Meanwhile , the connection between them grows ever stronger , a parasitic growth . Sometimes I have thought he suspects it himself . If I know him , he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death , it will truly mean the end of Voldemort . ”
217487	217503	217483	217483	Snape	172	“ You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment ? ”
217504	217522	217536	217536	Snape	172	“ Do n’t be shocked , Severus . How many men and women have you watched die ? ”
217523	217534	217536	217536	Snape	172	“ Lately , only those whom I could not save , ”
217542	217548	217538	217538	He	172	“ You have used me . ”
217549	217552	217536	217536	Snape	172	“ Meaning ? ”
217553	217600	217538	217538	He	172	“ I have spied for you and lied for you , put myself in mortal danger for you . Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter ’s son safe . Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter — ”
217601	217609	217611	217611	Dumbledore	207	“ But this is touching , Severus , ”
217614	217627	217611	217611	Dumbledore	207	“ Have you grown to care for the boy , after all ? ”
217628	217632	217634	217634	Snape	172	“ For him ? ”
217636	217640	217634	217634	Snape	172	“ Expecto Patronum ! ”
217698	217704	217684	217684	he	207	“ After all this time ? ”
217705	217708	217710	217710	Snape	172	“ Always , ”
217732	217753	217755	217755	Dumbledore	207	“ You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry ’s departure from his aunt and uncle ’s , ”
217757	217853	217755	217755	Dumbledore	207	“ Not to do so will raise suspicion , when Voldemort believes you so well informed . However , you must plant the idea of decoys ; that , I think , ought to ensure Harry ’s safety . Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher . And Severus , if you are forced to take part in the chase , be sure to act your part convincingly … I am counting upon you to remain in Lord Voldemort ’s good books as long as possible , or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows … ”
217879	217890	217891	217891	Snape	172	“ You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix , ”
217894	217936	217891	217891	Snape	172	“ that they use decoys . Polyjuice Potion . Identical Potters . It ’s the only thing that might work . You will forget that I have suggested this . You will present it as your own idea . You understand ? ”
217937	217941	217943	217943	Mundungus	233	“ I understand , ”
218005	218008	218010	218010	Snape	172	“ Sectumsempra ! ”
218175	218190	218167	218168	Phineas Nigellus	378	“ Headmaster ! They are camping in the Forest of Dean ! The Mudblood — ”
218191	218198	218234	218235	the headmaster	1135	“ Do not use that word ! ”
218199	218220	218167	218168	Phineas Nigellus	378	“ — the Granger girl , then , mentioned the place as she opened her bag and I heard her ! ”
218221	218227	218232	218232	Dumbledore	207	“ Good . Very good ! ”
218239	218286	218232	218232	Dumbledore	207	“ Now , Severus , the sword ! Do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor — and he must not know that you give it ! If Voldemort should read Harry ’s mind and see you acting for him — ”
218287	218291	218293	218293	Snape	172	“ I know , ”
218327	218348	218352	218352	he	172	“ And you still are n’t going to tell me why it ’s so important to give Potter the sword ? ”
218361	218370	218372	218372	Dumbledore	207	“ No , I do n’t think so , ”
218376	218407	218372	218372	Dumbledore	207	“ He will know what to do with it . And Severus , be very careful , they may not take kindly to your appearance after George Weasley ’s mishap — ”
218414	218421	218422	218422	he	172	“ Do n’t worry , Dumbledore , ”
218426	218432	218422	218422	he	172	“ I have a plan … ”
219706	219719	219721	219722	Oliver Wood	577	“ You know what ? I can manage him alone , Neville , ”
219946	219949	219937	219937	Neville	401	“ Neville . ”
219950	219962	219934	219934	Harry	177	“ Blimey , Harry , you nearly gave me heart failure ! ”
219990	219998	219999	219999	Neville	401	“ Where are you going , alone ? ”
220003	220012	220014	220014	Harry	177	“ It ’s all part of the plan , ”
220016	220030	220014	220014	Harry	177	“ There ’s someting I ’ve got to do . Listen — Neville — ”
220031	220034	220035	220035	Neville	401	“ Harry ! ”
220040	220052	220035	220035	Neville	401	“ Harry , you ’re not thinking of handing yourself over ? ”
220053	220056	220057	220057	Harry	177	“ No , ”
220061	220101	220057	220057	Harry	177	“ ’ Course not … this is something else . But I might be out of sight for a while . You know Voldemort ’s snake , Neville ? He ’s got a huge snake … Calls it Nagini … ”
220102	220113	220035	220035	Neville	401	“ I ’ve heard , yeah … What about it ? ”
220114	220134	220057	220057	Harry	177	“ It ’s got to be killed . Ron and Hermione know that , but just in case they — ”
220216	220230	220271	220271	Neville	401	“ Just in case they’re — busy — and you get the chance — ”
220231	220236	220271	220271	Neville	401	“ Kill the snake ? ”
220237	220242	220243	220243	Harry	177	“ Kill the snake , ”
220246	220259	220271	220271	Neville	401	“ All right , Harry . You ’re okay , are you ? ”
220260	220269	220271	220271	Neville	401	“ I ’m fine . Thanks , Neville . ”
220282	220297	220271	220271	Neville	401	“ We ’re all going to keep fighting , Harry . You know that ? ”
220298	220303	220271	220271	Neville	401	“ Yeah , I — ”
220408	220414	220415	220415	Ginny	238	“ It ’s all right , ”
220419	220432	220415	220415	Ginny	238	“ It ’s ok . We ’re going to get you inside . ”
220433	220441	220443	220444	the girl	5988	“ But I want to go home , ”
220446	220455	220443	220444	the girl	5988	“ I do n’t want to fight anymore ! ”
220456	220460	220462	220462	Ginny	238	“ I know , ”
220469	220478	220465	220465	her	238	“ It ’s going to be all right . ”
220946	220953	220935	220935	He	177	“ I am about to die . ”
220977	220980	220960	220960	He	177	“ Lumos . ”
221356	221363	221345	221345	she	379	“ You ’ve been so brave . ”
221396	221402	221404	221404	James	270	“ You are nearly there , ”
221406	221418	221404	221404	James	270	“ Very close . We are … so proud of you . ”
221419	221424	221431	221431	Harry	177	“ Does it hurt ? ”
221440	221447	221449	221449	Sirius	198	“ Dying ? Not at all , ”
221451	221459	221449	221449	Sirius	198	“ Quicker and easier than falling asleep . ”
221460	221475	221477	221477	Lupin	189	“ And he will want it to be quick . He wants it over , ”
221479	221488	221489	221489	Harry	177	“ I did n’t want you to die , ”
221499	221508	221496	221496	his	177	“ Any of you . I ’m sorry — ”
221521	221537	221509	221509	He	177	“ — right after you ’d had your son … Remus , I ’m sorry — ”
221538	221544	221546	221546	Lupin	189	“ I am sorry too , ”
221548	221586	221546	221546	Lupin	189	“ Sorry I will never know him … but he will know why I died and I hope he will understand . I was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life . ”
221628	221635	221611	221611	they	4459	“ You ’ll stay with me ? ”
221636	221642	221644	221644	James	270	“ Until the very end , ”
221646	221656	221658	221658	Harry	177	“ They wo n’t be able to see you ? ”
221660	221667	221669	221669	Sirius	198	“ We are part of you , ”
221671	221677	221669	221669	Sirius	198	“ Invisible to anyone else . ”
221684	221690	221691	221691	he	177	“ Stay close to me , ”
221954	221958	221946	221946	father	2429	“ Someone there , ”
221967	221980	221946	221946	father	2429	“ He ’s got an Invisibility Cloak . Could it be — ? ”
222028	222033	222035	222035	Yaxley	173	“ Definitely heard something , ”
222037	222043	222035	222035	Yaxley	173	“ Animal , d’you reckon ? ”
222044	222058	222060	222060	Dolohov	176	“ That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here , ”
222074	222091	222067	222067	Yaxley	173	“ Time ’s nearly up . Porter ’s had his hour . He ’s not coming . ”
222092	222097	222099	222099	Yaxley	173	“ Better go back , ”
222101	222110	222099	222099	Yaxley	173	“ Find out what the plan is now . ”
222445	222454	222456	222456	Dolohov	176	“ No sign of him , my Lord , ”
222486	222490	222476	222476	he	175	“ My Lord — ”
222535	222542	222546	222546	his	175	“ I thought he would come , ”
222559	222566	222546	222546	his	175	“ I expected him to come . ”
222632	222641	222643	222643	Voldemort	175	“ I was , it seems … mistaken , ”
222645	222650	222643	222643	Voldemort	175	“ You were n’t . ”
222800	222805	222806	222806	He	177	“ Harry ! No ! ”
222834	222841	222821	222821	His	199	“ No ! No ! Harry ! ”
222842	222845	222847	222847	Rowle	376	“ Quiet ! ”
222993	222997	222998	222998	he	175	“ Harry Potter , ”
223014	223020	223003	223003	His	175	“ The Boy Who Lived . ”
223774	223780	223781	223781	He	177	“ You can not help . ”
223803	223806	223807	223807	He	207	“ Harry . ”
223824	223839	223807	223807	He	207	“ You wonderful boy . You brave , brave man . Let us walk . ”
223935	223941	223943	223943	Harry	177	“ But you ’re dead , ”
223945	223949	223951	223951	Dumbledore	207	“ Oh yes , ”
223958	223966	224007	224009	the old man	3025	“ Then … I ’m dead too ? ”
223967	223970	223972	223972	Dumbledore	207	“ Ah , ”
223979	224000	223972	223972	Dumbledore	207	“ That is the question , is n’t it ? On the whole , dear boy , I think not . ”
224013	224016	224018	224018	Harry	177	“ Not ? ”
224020	224023	224025	224025	Dumbledore	207	“ Not , ”
224027	224030	224031	224031	Harry	177	“ But … ”
224049	224070	224031	224031	Harry	177	“ But I should have died — I did n’t defend myself ! I meant to let him kill me ! ”
224071	224075	224077	224077	Dumbledore	207	“ And that , ”
224079	224091	224077	224077	Dumbledore	207	“ will , I think , have made all the difference . ”
224117	224120	224122	224122	Harry	177	“ Explain , ”
224124	224130	224132	224132	Dumbledore	207	“ But you already know , ”
224140	224147	224149	224149	Harry	177	“ I let him kill me , ”
224151	224156	224149	224149	Harry	177	“ Did n’t I ? ”
224157	224161	224163	224163	Dumbledore	207	“ You did , ”
224167	224171	224163	224163	Dumbledore	207	“ Go on ! ”
224172	224184	224185	224185	Dumbledore	207	“ So the part of his soul that was in me … ”
224204	224210	224185	224185	Dumbledore	207	“ … has it gone ? ”
224211	224215	224217	224217	Dumbledore	207	“ Oh yes ! ”
224219	224238	224217	224217	Dumbledore	207	“ Yes , he destroyed it . Your soul is whole , and completely your own , Harry . ”
224239	224243	224185	224185	Dumbledore	207	“ But then … ”
224261	224268	224185	224185	Dumbledore	207	“ What is that , Professor ? ”
224269	224279	224281	224281	Dumbledore	207	“ Something that is beyond either of our help , ”
224283	224292	224293	224293	Harry	177	“ But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse , ”
224297	224312	224293	224293	Harry	177	“ and nobody died for me this time — how can I be alive ? ”
224313	224319	224321	224321	Dumbledore	207	“ I think you know , ”
224323	224343	224321	224321	Dumbledore	207	“ Think back . Remember what he did , in his ignorance , in his greed and his cruelty . ”
224418	224424	224426	224426	Harry	177	“ He took my blood , ”
224428	224431	224433	224433	Dumbledore	207	“ Precisely ! ”
224435	224473	224433	224433	Dumbledore	207	“ He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it ! Your blood in his veins , Harry , Lily ’s protection inside both of you ! He thethered you to life while he lives ! ”
224474	224510	224511	224511	He	177	“ I live … while he lives ? But I thought … I thought it was the other way around ! I thought we both had to die ? Or is it the same thing ? ”
224533	224543	224511	224511	He	177	“ Are you sure we ca n’t do anything ? ”
224544	224551	224511	224511	He	177	“ There is no help possible . ”
224552	224558	224560	224560	Harry	177	“ Then explain … more , ”
224566	224583	224563	224563	Dumbledore	207	“ You were the seventh Horcrux , Harry , the Horcrux he never meant to make . ”
224595	224607	224584	224584	Dumbledore	207	“ And you knew this ? You knew — all along ? ”
224608	224620	224622	224622	Dumbledore	207	“ I guessed . But my guesses have usually been good , ”
224649	224654	224656	224656	Harry	177	“ There ’s more , ”
224658	224675	224656	224656	Harry	177	“ There ’s more to it . Why did my wand break the wand he borrowed ? ”
224676	224687	224622	224622	Dumbledore	207	“ As to that , I can not be sure . ”
224688	224695	224697	224697	Harry	177	“ Have a guess , then , ”
224703	224729	224622	224622	Dumbledore	207	“ What you must understand , Harry , is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested . ”
224730	224748	224750	224750	Harry	177	“ But if my wand was so powerful , how come Hermione was able to break it ? ”
224752	224807	224808	224808	Dumbledore	207	“ My dear boy , its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort , who had tampered so ill - advisedly with the deepest laws of magic . Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful . Otherwise it was a wand like any other … though a good one , I am sure , ”
224839	224847	224808	224808	Dumbledore	207	“ He killed me with your wand . ”
224848	224858	224859	224859	Dumbledore	207	“ He failed to kill you with my wand , ”
224863	224880	224881	224881	he	207	“ I think we can agree that you are not dead — though , of course , ”
224892	224907	224887	224887	he	207	“ I do not minimize your sufferings , which I am sure were severe . ”
224908	224918	224920	224920	Harry	177	“ I feel great at the moment , though , ”
224931	224938	224920	224920	Harry	177	“ Where are we , exactly ? ”
224939	224950	224952	224952	Dumbledore	207	“ Well , I was going to ask you that , ”
224957	224966	224952	224952	Dumbledore	207	“ Where would you say that we are ? ”
224992	224996	224997	224997	he	207	“ It looks , ”
225001	225027	224997	224997	he	207	“ like King ’s Cross station . Except a lo cleaner and empty , and there are no trains as far as I can see . ”
225028	225034	225035	225035	Dumbledore	207	“ King ’s Cross station ! ”
225040	225046	225035	225035	Dumbledore	207	“ Good gracious , really ? ”
225047	225057	225059	225059	Harry	177	“ Well , where do you think we are ? ”
225065	225085	225035	225035	Dumbledore	207	“ My dear boy , I have no idea . This is , as they say , your party . ”
225118	225123	225124	225124	he	177	“ The Deathly Hallows , ”
225144	225149	225150	225150	he	177	“ Ah , yes , ”
225160	225163	225153	225153	He	177	“ Well ? ”
225196	225202	225203	225203	he	177	“ Can you forgive me ? ”
225206	225268	225203	225203	he	177	“ Can you forgive me for not trusting you ? For not telling you ? Harry , I only feared that you would fail as I had failed . I only dreaded that you would make my mistakes . I crave your pardon , Harry . I have known , for some time now , that you are the better man . ”
225269	225276	225278	225278	Harry	177	“ What are you talking about ? ”
225294	225301	225303	225303	Dumbledore	207	“ The Hallows , the Hallows , ”
225305	225312	225303	225303	Dumbledore	207	“ A desperate man ’s dream ! ”
225313	225319	225203	225203	he	177	“ But they ’re real ! ”
225320	225332	225334	225334	Dumbledore	207	“ Real , and dangerous , and a lure for fools , ”
225336	225363	225334	225334	Dumbledore	207	“ And I was such a fool . But you know , do n’t you ? I have no secrets from you anymore . You know . ”
225364	225370	225203	225203	he	177	“ What do I know ? ”
225390	225410	225203	225203	he	177	“ Master of death , Harry , master of Death ! Was I better , ultimately , than Voldemort ? ”
225411	225417	225419	225419	Harry	177	“ Of course you were , ”
225421	225440	225419	225419	Harry	177	“ Of course — how can you ask that ? You never killed if you could avoid it ! ”
225441	225446	225448	225448	Dumbledore	207	“ True , true , ”
225459	225472	225451	225451	he	207	“ Yet I too sought a way to conquer death , Harry . ”
225473	225480	225482	225482	Harry	177	“ Not the way he did , ”
225512	225518	225510	225510	himself	207	“ Hallows , not Horcruxes . ”
225519	225522	225524	225524	Dumbledore	207	“ Hallows , ”
225526	225532	225524	225524	Dumbledore	207	“ not Horcruxes . Precisely . ”
225551	225559	225560	225560	he	177	“ Grindelwald was looking for them too ? ”
225573	225587	225588	225588	he	207	“ It was the thing , above all , that drew us together , ”
225592	225640	225588	225588	he	207	“ Two clever , arrogant boys with a shared obsession . He wanted to come to Godric ’s Hollow , as I am sure you have guessed , because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell . He wanted to explore the place the third brother had died . ”
225641	225647	225649	225649	Harry	177	“ So it ’s true ? ”
225651	225660	225649	225649	Harry	177	“ All of it ? The Peverell brothers — ”
225661	225671	225673	225673	Dumbledore	207	“ — were the three brothers of the tale , ”
225677	225789	225673	225673	Dumbledore	207	“ Oh yes , I think so . Whether they met Darth on a lonely road … I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply gifted , dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects . The story of them being Darth 's own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations . The Cloak , as you know now , traveled down through the ages , father to son , mother to daughter , right down to Ignotus ’s last living descendant , who was born , as Ignotus was , in the village of Godric ’s Hollow . ”
225795	225798	225790	225790	Dumbledore	207	“ Me ? ”
225799	225854	225855	225855	His	207	“ You . You have guessed , I know , why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died . Josh had showed it to me just a few days previously . It explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school ! I could hardly believe what I was seeing . ”
225861	225873	225874	225874	Harry	177	“ The Cloak would n’t have helped them survive , though , ”
225878	225899	225874	225874	Harry	177	“ Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were . The Cloak could n’t have made them curse - proof . ”
225900	225903	225905	225905	Dumbledore	207	“ True , ”
225907	225910	225905	225905	Dumbledore	207	“ True . ”
225925	225941	225921	225921	he	207	“ So you ’d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak ? ”
225942	225946	225948	225948	Dumbledore	207	“ Oh yes , ”
225963	225983	225954	225954	he	207	“ You know what happened . You know . You can not despise me more than I despise myself . ”
225984	225992	225921	225921	he	207	“ But I do n’t despise you — ”
225993	225998	226000	226000	Dumbledore	207	“ Then you should , ”
226008	226068	226002	226002	He	207	“ You know the secret of my sister ’s ill health , what those Muggles did , what she became . You know how my poor father sought revenge , and paid the price , died in Azkaban . You know how my mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana . I resented it , Harry . ”
226092	226120	226121	226121	he	207	“ I was gifted , I was brilliant . I wanted to escape . I wanted to shine . I wanted glory . Do not misunderstand me , ”
226145	226192	226136	226136	Dumbledore	207	“ Grindelwald . You can not imagine how his ideas caught me , Harry , inflamed me . Muggles forced into subservience . We wizards triumphant . Grindelwald and I , the glorious young leaders of the revolution . Oh , I had a few scruples . ”
226230	226368	226219	226219	He	177	“ Well , Grindelwald fled , as anyone but I could have predicted . He vanished , with his plans for seizing power , and his schemes for Muggle torture , and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows , dreams in which I had encouraged him and helped him . He ran , while I was left to bury my sister , and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief , the price of my shame . Years passed . There were rumors about him . They said he had procured a wand of immense power . I , meanwhile , was offered the post of Minister of Magic , not once , but several times . Naturally , I refused . I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power . ”
226369	226385	226388	226388	Harry	177	“ But you ’d have been better , much better , than Fudge or Scimgeour ! ”
226390	226394	226396	226396	Dumbledore	207	“ Would I ? ”
226399	226497	226396	226396	Dumbledore	207	“ I am not so sure . I had proven , as a very young man , that power was my weakness and my temptation . It is a curious thing , Harry , but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it . Those who , like you , have leadership thrust upon them , and take up the mantle because they must , and find to their own surprise that they wear it well . I was safer at Hogwarts . I think I was a good teacher — ”
226498	226503	226535	226535	Dumbledore	207	“ You were the best—. ”
226603	226627	226600	226600	he	177	“ Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand . He lied , you know , pretended he had never had it . ”
226645	226707	226748	226748	Dumbledore	207	“ They say he showed remorse in later years , alone in his cell at Nurmengard . I hope that is true . I would like to think that he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done . Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends … to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow … ”
226708	226718	226720	226720	Harry	177	“ … or maybe from breaking into your tomb ? ”
226735	226744	226732	226732	Harry	177	“ You tried to use the Resurrection Stone . ”
226780	226791	226748	226748	Dumbledore	207	“ Why did you have to make it so difficult ? ”
226798	226806	226808	226808	Dumbledore	207	“ I admit that was my intention , ”
226810	226823	226808	226808	Dumbledore	207	“ but it did not work as I intended , did it ? ”
226824	226827	226829	226829	Harry	177	“ No , ”
226831	226839	226829	226829	Harry	177	“ That bit did n’t work out . ”
226882	226894	226808	226808	Dumbledore	207	“ I ’ve got to go back , have n’t I ? ”
226895	226902	226851	226851	Dumbledore	207	“ That is up to you . ”
226903	226910	226808	226808	Dumbledore	207	“ I ’ve got a choice ? ”
226911	226915	226916	226916	Dumbledore	207	“ Oh yes , ”
226921	226957	226916	226916	Dumbledore	207	“ We are in King ’s Cross , you say ? I think that if you decided not to go back , you would be able to … let ’s say … board a train . ”
226958	226966	226808	226808	Dumbledore	207	“ And where would it take me ? ”
226967	226970	226972	226972	Dumbledore	207	“ On , ”
226978	226986	226808	226808	Dumbledore	207	“ Voldemort ’s got the Elder Wand . ”
226987	226996	226808	226808	Dumbledore	207	“ True . Voldemort has the Elder Wand . ”
226997	227006	226808	226808	Dumbledore	207	“ But you want me to go back ? ”
227007	227011	227013	227013	Dumbledore	207	“ I think , ”
227015	227061	227013	227013	Dumbledore	207	“ that if you choose to return , there is a chance that he may be finished for good . I can not promise it . But I know this , Harry , that you have less to fear from returning here than he does . ”
227082	227142	227062	227062	Harry	177	“ Do not pity the dead , Harry . Pity the living , and above all , those who live without love . By returning , you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed , fewer families are torn apart . If that seems to you a worthy goal , then we say good - bye for the present . ”
227215	227222	227224	227224	Harry	177	“ Tell me one last thing , ”
227226	227240	227224	227224	Harry	177	“ Is this real ? Or has this been happening inside my head ? ”
227270	227294	227247	227247	his	207	“ Of course it is happening inside your head , Harry , but why on earth should that mean it is not real ? ”
227426	227433	227441	227441	she	188	“ My Lord … my Lord … ”
227516	227520	227532	227533	More footsteps	4543	“ My Lord … ”
227521	227526	227528	227528	Voldemort	175	“ That will do , ”
227666	227673	227631	227631	he	175	“ My Lord , let me — ”
227674	227681	227683	227683	Voldemort	175	“ I do not require assitance , ”
227702	227710	227696	227696	Bellatrix	188	“ The boy … Is he dead ? ”
227753	227756	227758	227758	Voldemort	175	“ You , ”
227772	227783	227758	227758	Voldemort	175	“ Examine him . Tell me whether he is dead . ”
227881	227892	227873	227873	her	749	“ Is Draco alive ? Is he in the castle ? ”
227924	227927	227928	227928	he	177	“ Yes , ”

228049	228053	228055	228055	Voldemort	175	“ You see ? ”
228060	228082	228055	228055	Voldemort	175	“ Harry Potter is dead by my hand , and no man alive can threaten me now ! Watch ! Crucio ! ”
228200	228203	228205	228205	Voldemort	175	“ Now , ”
228207	228234	228205	228205	Voldemort	175	“ we go to the castle , and show them what has become of their hero . Who shall drag the body ? No — Wait — ”
228256	228261	228262	228262	Voldemort	175	“ You carry him , ”
228265	228302	228262	228262	Voldemort	175	“ He will be nice and visible in your arms , will he not ? Pick up your little friend , Hagrid . And the glasses — put on the glasses — he must be recognizable — ”
228383	228386	228388	228388	Voldemort	175	“ Move , ”
228551	228554	228555	228555	Hagrid	199	“ Bane ! ”
228566	228597	228555	228555	Hagrid	199	“ Happy now , are yeh , that yeh did n’t fight , yeh cowardly bunch o ’ nags ? Are yeh happy Harry Potter’s — d - dead … ? ”
228670	228673	228650	228650	Harry	177	“ Stop . ”
228793	228937	228769	228769	he	175	“ Harry Potter is dead . He was killed as he ran away , trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him . We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone . The battle is won . You have lost half of your fighters . My Death Eaters outnumber you , and the Boy Who Lived is finished . There must be no more war . Anyone who continues to resist , man , woman or child , will be slaughtered , as will every member of their family . Come out of the castle now , kneel before me , and you shall be spared . Your parents and children , your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven , and you will join me in the new world we shall build together . ”
228965	228968	228970	228970	Voldemort	175	“ Come , ”
229053	229056	229058	229058	Hagrid	199	“ Harry , ”

229433	229437	229439	229439	Voldemort	175	“ You see ? ”
229457	229490	229444	229444	him	175	“ Harry Potter is dead ! Do you understand now , deluded ones ? He was nothing , ever , but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him ! ”
229491	229496	229498	229498	Ron	227	“ He beat you ! ”
229528	229542	229544	229544	Voldemort	175	“ He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds , ”

229650	229670	229641	229641	he	175	“ Who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost ? ”
229677	229706	229671	229671	Bellatrix	188	“ It is Neville Longbottom , my Lord ! The boy who has been giving the Carrows so much trouble ! The son of the Aurors , remember ? ”
229707	229715	229717	229717	Voldemort	175	“ Ah , yes , I remember , ”
229752	229767	229768	229768	Voldemort	175	“ But you are a pureblood , are n’t you , my brave boy ? ”
229784	229791	229793	229793	Neville	401	“ So what if I am ? ”
229796	229827	229858	229859	the crowd	1291	“ You show spirit and bravery , and you come of noble stock . You will make a very valuable Death Eater . We need your kind , Neville Longbottom . ”
229828	229838	229840	229840	Neville	401	“ I ’ll join you when hell freezes over , ”
229842	229847	229848	229848	he	175	“ Dumbledore ’s Army ! ”
229871	229875	229877	229877	Voldemort	175	“ Very well , ”
229897	229917	229918	229918	he	175	“ If that is your choice , Longbottom , we revert to the original plan . On your head , ”
229922	229926	229918	229918	he	175	“ be it . ”
229993	230004	230006	230006	Voldemort	175	“ There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School , ”
230008	230041	230006	230006	Voldemort	175	“ There will be no more Houses . The emblem , shield and colors of my noble ancestor , Salazar Slytherin , will suffice everyone . Wo n’t they , Neville Longbottom ? ”
230105	230125	230137	230137	he	175	“ Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me , ”
230243	230246	230231	230231	Grawp	603	“ HAGGER ! ”
230498	230501	230502	230502	Hagrid	199	“ HARRY ! ”

231297	231303	231305	231306	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ OUT OF MY WAY ! ”
231378	231381	231382	231383	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ No ! ”

231464	231477	231479	231479	Bellatrix	188	“ What will happen to your children when I ’ve killed you ? ”
231496	231507	231489	231489	Molly	254	“ When Mummy ’s gone the same way as Freddie ? ”
231508	231523	231525	231526	Mrs. Weasley	253	“ You — will — never — touch — our — children — again ! ”

231806	231822	231798	231798	his	177	“ It ’s got to be like this . It ’s got to be me . ”
231826	231833	231834	231834	he	177	“ Potter does n’t mean that , ”
231842	231866	231834	231834	he	177	“ This is n’t how he works , is it ? Who are you going to use as a shield today , Potter ? ”
231867	231870	231872	231872	Harry	177	“ Nobody , ”
231875	231908	231872	231872	Harry	177	“ There are no more Horcruxes . It ’s just you and me . Neither can live while the other survives , and one of us is about to leave for good … ”
231909	231914	231919	231919	his	175	“ One of us ? ”
231938	231965	231925	231925	his	175	“ You think it will be you , do you , the boy who has survived by accident , and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings ? ”
231966	231980	231982	231982	Harry	177	“ Accident , was it , when my mother died to save me ? ”
232017	232049	232014	232014	Voldemort	175	“ Accident , when I decided to fight in that graveyard ? Accident , that I did n’t defend myself tonight , and still survived , and returned to fight again ? ”
232050	232053	232059	232059	he	175	“ Accidents ! ”
232090	232120	232087	232087	they	4672	“ Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women , and permitted me to kill them for you ! ”
232121	232131	232133	232133	Harry	177	“ You wo n’t be killing anyone else tonight , ”
232150	232183	232133	232133	Harry	177	“ You wo n’t be able to kill any of them ever again . Do n’t you get it ? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people — ”
232184	232190	232087	232087	they	4672	“ But you did not ! ”
232191	232259	232133	232133	Harry	177	“ — I meant to , and that ’s what did it . I ’ve done what my mother did . They ’re protected from you . Have n’t you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding ? You ca n’t torture them . You ca n’t touch them . You do n’t learn from your mistakes , Riddle , do you ? ”
232260	232264	232087	232087	they	4672	“ You dare — ”
232265	232271	232273	232273	Harry	177	“ Yes , I dare , ”
232275	232310	232273	232273	Harry	177	“ I know things you do n’t know , Tom Riddle . I know lots of important things that you do n’t . Want to hear some , before you make another big mistake ? ”
232349	232355	232357	232357	Voldemort	175	“ Is it love again ? ”
232365	232441	232357	232357	Voldemort	175	“ Dumbledore favorite solution , love , which he claimed conquered death , though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like an old waxwork ? Love , which did not prevent me stamping out your Mudblood mother like a cockroach , Potter — and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse . So what will stop you dying now when I strike ? ”
232442	232447	232449	232449	Harry	177	“ Just one thing , ”
232472	232485	232487	232487	Voldemort	175	“ If it is not love that will save you this time , ”
232489	232511	232487	232487	Voldemort	175	“ you must believe that you have magic that I do not , or else a weapon more powerful than mine ? ”
232512	232517	232519	232519	Harry	177	“ I believe both , ”
232563	232574	232575	232575	he	177	“ You think you know more magic than I do ? ”
232578	232597	232575	232575	he	177	“ Than I , than Lord Voldemort , who has performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of ? ”
232598	232605	232607	232607	Harry	177	“ Oh he dreamed of it , ”
232609	232627	232607	232607	Harry	177	“ but he knew more than you , knew enough not to do what you ’ve done . ”
232628	232635	232637	232637	Voldemort	175	“ You mean he was weak ! ”
232639	232660	232637	232637	Voldemort	175	“ Too weak to dare , too weak to take what might have been his , what will be mine ! ”
232661	232670	232672	232672	Harry	177	“ No , he was cleverer than you , ”
232674	232683	232672	232672	Harry	177	“ a better wizard , a better man . ”
232684	232694	232637	232637	Voldemort	175	“ I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore ! ”
232695	232701	232703	232703	Harry	177	“ You thought you did , ”
232705	232711	232703	232703	Harry	177	“ but you were wrong . ”
232734	232739	232740	232740	Voldemort	175	“ Dumbledore is dead ! ”
232758	232772	232740	232740	Voldemort	175	“ I have seen it , Potter , and he will not return ! ”
232773	232780	232782	232782	Harry	177	“ Yes , Dumbledore is dead , ”
232785	232822	232782	232782	Harry	177	“ but you did n’t have him killed . He chose his own manner of dying , chose it months before he died , arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant . ”
232823	232830	232836	232836	he	175	“ What childish dream is this ? ”
232852	232859	232861	232861	Harry	177	“ Severus Snape was n’t yours , ”
232863	232909	232861	232861	Harry	177	“ Snape was Dumbledore ’s . Dumbledore ’s from the moment you started hunting down my mother . And you never realized it , because of the thing you ca n’t understand . You never saw Snape cast a Patronus , did you , Riddle ? ”
232930	232938	232940	232940	Harry	177	“ Snape ’s Patronus was a doe , ”
232942	232974	232975	232975	he	177	“ the same as my mother ’s , because he loved her for nearly all of his life , from the time when they were children . You should have realized , ”
232985	232998	232975	232975	he	177	“ he asked you to spare her life , did n’t he ? ”
232999	233008	233010	233010	Voldemort	175	“ He desired her , that was all , ”
233012	233036	233010	233010	Voldemort	175	“ but when she had gone , he agreed that there were other women , and of purer blood , worthier of him — ”
233037	233045	233047	233047	Harry	177	“ Of course he told you that , ”
233049	233082	233047	233047	Harry	177	“ but he was Dumbledore ’s spy from the moment you threatened her , and he ’s been working against you ever since ! Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him ! ”
233083	233088	233090	233090	Voldemort	175	“ It matters not ! ”
233111	233117	233119	233119	Harry	177	“ Yeah , it did , ”
233121	233154	233119	233119	Harry	177	“ You ’re right . But before you try to kill me , I ’d advise you think what you ’ve done … Think , and try for some remorse , Riddle … ”
233155	233160	233185	233185	Harry	177	“ What is this ? ”
233202	233210	233212	233212	Harry	177	“ It ’s your one last chance , ”
233214	233243	233212	233212	Harry	177	“ it ’s all you ’ve got left … I ’ve seen what you ’ll be otherwise … Be a man … try … Try for some remorse … ”
233244	233249	233251	233251	Voldemort	175	“ You dare — ? ”
233254	233260	233262	233262	Harry	177	“ Yes , I dare , ”
233264	233286	233262	233262	Harry	177	“ because Dumbledore ’s last plan has n’t backfired on me at all . It ’s backfired on you , Riddle . ”
233315	233349	233212	233212	Harry	177	“ That wand still is n’t working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person . Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand . He never defeated Dumbledore . ”
233350	233354	233262	233262	Harry	177	“ He killed — ”
233355	233414	233212	233212	Harry	177	“ Are n’t you listening ? Snape never beat Dumbledore ! Dumbledore ’s death was planned between them ! Dumbledore instended to die , undefeated , the wand ’s last true master ! If all had gone as planned , the wand ’s power would have died with him , because it had never been won from him ! ”
233415	233430	233262	233262	Harry	177	“ But then , Potter , Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand ! ”
233439	233466	233431	233431	Voldemort	175	“ I stole the wand from its last master ’s tomb ! I removed it against the last master ’s wishes ! Its power is mine ! ”
233467	233568	233212	233212	Harry	177	“ You still do n’t get it , Riddle , do you ? Possessing the wand is n’t enough ! Holding it , using it , does n’t make it really yours . Did n’t you listen to Ollivander ? The wand chooses the wizard … The Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died , someone who never even laid a hand on it . The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will , never realizing exactly what he had done , or that the world ’s most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance … ”
233596	233608	233212	233212	Harry	177	“ The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy . ”
233626	233633	233634	233634	he	175	“ But what does it matter ? ”
233638	233684	233634	233634	he	175	“ Even if you are right , Potter , it makes no difference to you and me . You no longer have the phoenix wand : We duel on skill alone … and after I have killed you , I can attend to Draco Malfoy … ”
233685	233692	233694	233694	Harry	177	“ But you ’re too late , ”
233696	233721	233694	233694	Harry	177	“ You ’ve missed your chance . I got there first . I overpowered Draco weeks ago . I took his wand from him . ”
233741	233754	233756	233756	Harry	177	“ So it all comes down to this , does n’t it ? ”
233758	233787	233756	233756	Harry	177	“ Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed ? Because if it does … I am the true master of the Elder Wand . ”
233859	233863	233839	233841	the high voice	4692	“ Avada Kedavra ! ”
233864	233867	233839	233841	the high voice	4692	“ Expelliarmus ! ”
234498	234512	234513	234513	she	340	“ I ’d want some peace and quiet , if it were me , ”
234516	234522	234523	234523	he	177	“ I ’d love some , ”
234526	234533	234534	234534	she	340	“ I ’ll distract them all , ”
234537	234542	234534	234534	she	340	“ Use your cloak . ”
234555	234564	234551	234551	she	340	“ Oooh , look , a Blibbering Humdinger ! ”
234725	234730	234731	234731	he	177	“ It ’s me , ”
234739	234746	234731	234731	he	177	“ Will you come with me ? ”
234840	234858	234860	234860	Ron	227	“ Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing , does n’t it ? ”
235054	235060	235061	235061	he	177	“ Can we go up ? ”
235066	235070	235072	235073	the statue	4741	“ Feel free , ”
235231	235251	235225	235225	his	378	“ And let it be noted that Slytherin House played its part ! Let our contribution not be forgotten ! ”
235377	235387	235388	235388	he	177	“ The thing that was hidden in the Snitch , ”
235391	235422	235388	235388	he	177	“ I dropped it in the forest . I do n’t know exactly where , but I ’m not going to go looking for it again . Do you agree ? ”
235423	235431	235433	235433	Dumbledore	207	“ My dear boy , I do , ”
235444	235470	235433	235433	Dumbledore	207	“ A wise and courageous decision , but no less than I would have expected of you . Does anyone else know where it fell ? ”
235471	235475	235477	235477	Harry	177	“ No one , ”
235485	235497	235499	235499	Harry	177	“ I ’m going to keep Ignotus ’s present , though , ”
235505	235523	235502	235502	Dumbledore	207	“ But of course , Harry , it is yours forever , until you pass it on ! ”
235524	235531	235532	235532	Harry	177	“ And then there ’s this . ”
235568	235575	235577	235577	Harry	177	“ I do n’t want it , ”
235579	235582	235584	235584	Ron	227	“ What ? ”
235587	235592	235584	235584	Ron	227	“ Are you mental ? ”
235593	235600	235602	235602	Harry	177	“ I know it ’s powerful , ”
235605	235615	235602	235602	Harry	177	“ But I was happier with mine . So … ”
235701	235704	235676	235676	He	177	“ Reparo . ”
235753	235761	235762	235762	he	177	“ I ’m putting the Elder Wand , ”
235776	235824	235762	235762	he	177	“ back where it came from . It can stay there . If I die a natural death like Ignotus , its power will be broken , wo n’t it ? The previous master will never have been defeated . That ’ll be the end of it . ”
235834	235839	235841	235841	Ron	227	“ Are you sure ? ”
235861	235868	235870	235870	Hermione	197	“ I think Harry ’s right , ”
235873	235884	235886	235886	Harry	177	“ That wand ’s more trouble than it ’s worth , ”
235888	235893	235886	235886	Harry	177	“ And quite honestly , ”
235930	235940	235922	235922	Kreacher	384	“ I ’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime . ”
236039	236053	236054	236054	Harry	177	“ It wo n’t be long , and you ’ll be going too , ”
236058	236062	236064	236064	Liza	424	“ Two years , ”
236066	236073	236064	236064	Liza	424	“ I want to go now ! ”
236121	236133	236096	236096	Allan	664	“ I wo n’t ! I wo n’t be a Slytherin ! ”
236134	236142	236144	236144	Ginny	238	“ Josh , give it a rest ! ”
236146	236154	236156	236156	Josh	643	“ I only said he might be , ”
236164	236178	236156	236156	Josh	643	“ There ’s nothing wrong with that . He might be in Slytherin — ”
236231	236242	236243	236243	Allan	664	“ You ’ll write to me , wo n’t you ? ”
236258	236268	236270	236270	Ginny	238	“ Every day , if you want us to , ”
236272	236277	236279	236279	Allan	664	“ Not every day , ”
236282	236297	236279	236279	Allan	664	“ Josh says most people only get letters from home about once a month . ”
236298	236310	236312	236312	Ginny	238	“ We wrote to Josh three times a week last year , ”
236314	236329	236330	236330	Harry	177	“ And you do n’t want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts , ”
236334	236343	236330	236330	Harry	177	“ He likes a laugh , your brother . ”
236416	236421	236423	236423	Allan	664	“ Where are they ? ”
236442	236448	236450	236450	Ginny	238	“ We ’ll find them , ”
236505	236514	236516	236516	Ginny	238	“ I think that ’s them , Allan , ”
236558	236561	236563	236563	Allan	664	“ Hi , ”
236586	236593	236594	236594	Ron	227	“ Parked all right , then ? ”
236598	236627	236594	236594	Ron	227	“ I did . Hermione did n’t believe I could pass a Muggle driving test , did you ? She thought I ’d have to Confound the examiner . ”
236628	236635	236637	236637	Hermione	197	“ No , I did n’t , ”
236639	236647	236637	236637	Hermione	197	“ I had complete faith in you . ”
236648	236660	236661	236661	Ron	227	“ As a matter of fact , I did Confund him , ”
236679	236705	236661	236661	Ron	227	“ I only forgot to look in the wing mirror , and let ’s face it , I can use a Supersensory Charm for that . ”
236741	236754	236756	236756	Ron	227	“ If you ’re not in Gryffindor , we ’ll disinherit you , ”
236758	236763	236756	236756	Ron	227	“ but no pressure . ”
236764	236767	236770	236770	Hugo	666	“ Ron ! ”
236780	236787	236791	236791	Ginny	238	“ He does n’t mean it , ”
236837	236843	236826	236827	three people	2381	“ Look who it is . ”
236912	236919	236921	236921	Ron	227	“ So that ’s little Scorpius , ”
236926	236947	236921	236921	Ron	227	“ Make sure you beat him in every test , Rosie . Thank God you inherited your mother ’s brains . ”
236948	236956	236958	236958	Hermione	197	“ Ron , for heaven ’s sake , ”
236966	236983	236958	236958	Hermione	197	“ Do n’t try to turn them against each other before they ’ve even started school ! ”
236984	236991	236993	236993	Ron	227	“ You ’re right , sorry , ”
237004	237029	237001	237001	he	227	“ Do n’t get too friendly with him , though , Rosie . Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood . ”
237030	237033	237001	237001	he	227	“ Hey ! ”
237058	237064	237065	237065	he	643	“ Tim ’s back there , ”
237081	237096	237065	237065	he	643	“ Just seen him ! And guess what he ’s doing ? Snogging Victoire ! ”
237112	237134	237097	237097	He	643	“ Our Tim ! Tim ! Snogging our Victoire ! Our cousin ! And I asked Tim what he was doing — ”
237135	237140	237142	237142	Ginny	238	“ You interrupted them ? ”
237144	237151	237142	237142	Ginny	238	“ You are so like Ron — ”
237152	237179	237180	237180	Josh	643	“ — and he said he ’d come to see her off ! And then he told me to go away . He ’s snogging her ! ”
237192	237204	237206	237206	Liza	424	“ Oh , it would be lovely if they got married ! ”
237209	237220	237206	237206	Liza	424	“ Tim would really be part of the family then ! ”
237221	237234	237236	237236	Harry	177	“ He already comes round for dinner about four times a week , ”
237238	237256	237236	237236	Harry	177	“ Why do n’t we just invite him to live with is and have done with it ? ”
237257	237260	237262	237262	Josh	643	“ Yeah ! ”
237265	237280	237262	237262	Josh	643	“ I do n’t mind sharing with Allan — Tim could have my room ! ”
237281	237284	237286	237286	Harry	177	“ No , ”
237289	237305	237286	237286	Harry	177	“ you and Allan will share a room only when I want the house demolished . ”
237320	237333	237306	237306	He	177	“ It ’s nearly eleven , you ’d better get on board . ”
237334	237344	237345	237345	Ginny	238	“ Do n’t forget to give Neville our love ! ”
237353	237364	237349	237349	she	238	“ Mum ! I ca n’t give a professor love ! ”
237365	237371	237306	237306	He	177	“ But you know Neville — ”
237377	237405	237372	237372	Josh	643	“ Outside , yeah , but at school he ’s Professor Longbottom , is n’t he ? I ca n’t walk into Herbology and give him love … ”
237426	237439	237415	237415	he	643	“ See you later , Allan . Watch out for the thestrals . ”
237440	237453	237415	237415	he	643	“ I thought they were invisible ? You said they were invisible ! ”
237497	237505	237506	237506	Harry	177	“ Thestrals are nothing to worry about , ”
237510	237545	237508	237508	Allan	664	“ They ’re gentle things , there ’s nothing scary about them . Anyway , you wo n’t be going up to school in the carriages , you ’ll be going in the boats . ”
237553	237559	237546	237546	Ginny	238	“ See you at Christmas . ”
237560	237565	237567	237567	Harry	177	“ Bye , Allan , ”
237574	237612	237567	237567	Harry	177	“ Do n’t forget Hagrid ’s invited you to tea next Friday . Do n’t mess with Peeves . Do n’t duel anyone till you ’re learned how . And do n’t let Josh wind you up . ”
237613	237621	237653	237653	Harry	177	“ What if I ’m in Slytherin ? ”
237681	237684	237685	237685	Harry	177	“ Allan , ”
237717	237744	237698	237698	she	238	“ you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts . One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew . ”
237745	237750	237698	237698	she	238	“ But just say — ”
237751	237802	237698	237698	she	238	“ — then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student , wo n’t it ? It does n’t matter to us , Allan . But if it matter to you , you ’ll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin . The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account . ”
237803	237806	237698	237698	she	238	“ Really ? ”
237807	237813	237815	237815	Harry	177	“ It did for me , ”
237913	237920	237922	237922	Allan	664	“ Why are they all staring ? ”
237936	237944	237946	237946	Ron	227	“ Do n’t let it worry you , ”
237948	237958	237946	237946	Ron	227	“ It ’s me , I ’m extremely famous . ”
238042	238049	238051	238051	Ginny	238	“ He ’ll be all right , ”
238075	238081	238059	238059	he	177	“ I know he will . ”
